Schabacker was Simms\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation doctor from 2004 through 2007 following Simms\u2019 1999 work-related accident. Simms sued Schabacker and St. Vincent Healthcare, Schabacker\u2019s employer, alleging Schabacker had disclosed private, confidential healthcare information about him to a law enforcement officer without Simms\u2019 permission. The District Court concluded that Schabacker\u2019s letter was authorized by applicable Montana law and that Schabacker did not knowingly assist law enforcement. The court granted Schabacker\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Simms appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that Schabacker did not knowingly assist law enforcement and that Montana law authorized Schabacker\u2019s letter to Montana State Fund addressing Simms\u2019 medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">\u00b63 Randall Simms has been before this Court on two previous occasions relating to his 1999 workers\u2019 compensation <em>injury </em>\u2014 Simms <em>v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, 327 Mont. 511, 116 P.3d 773 <em>(Simms </em>I) and <em>Mont. State Fund v. Simms, </em>2012 MT 22, 364 Mont. 14, 270 P.3d 64 <em>(Simms II). </em>Detailed background facts are included in both <em>Simms I </em>and <em>Simms II. </em>Here, we outline only those facts necessary to place this appeal in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">\u00b64 In the previous cases it was established that Simms was injured while on the job in 1999. The State Fund accepted liability for his injury claim. Simms subsequently became totally disabled and has been receiving total disability benefits since 2006. Schabacker has treated Simms since October 2004, and his testimony before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court led to the settlement which provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Simms with permanent total disability and domiciliary care benefits. On April 12,2006, St. Vincent\u2019s Northern Rockies Pain Rehabilitation Center (NRPRC) presented Simms with a \u201cNotice of Privacy Policy\u201d which Simms signed. This Notice informed Simms that NRPRC \u201cmay share [Simms\u2019 healthcare] information with your insurance companies\u201d and \u201cmay disclose any information we collect when permitted or required by law. This may include but is not limited to, disclosures related to a court subpoena or similar legal requests, fraud investigations and an audit or security examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b65 The origin of this <em>case </em>\u2014 Simms <em>III- </em>\u2014 is a letter from State Fund attorney Thomas Martello to Schabacker dated June 20, 2007. The letter was written on Montana State Fund letterhead, indicated that Martello was legal counsel for State Fund, and enclosed a \u201ccompilation video\u201d showing Simms engaged in various daily activities. The first video was recorded in 2002; the following ten videos were recorded between September 27,2006, and May 1,2007. The 2006/2007 videos showed Simms walking, shopping, lifting, and loading groceries without using assistive devices such as his walker or wheelchair. He was recorded entering, exiting, and driving a pickup truck without assistance or apparent difficulty. However, the videos recording Simms and his wife entering Schabackeris office buildingfor scheduled visits show Simms walking slowly and with apparent difficulty while using a four-wheeled walker. Martello asked Schabacker to review the recordings and provide his medical observations and comments given the disparity between Simms\u2019 diagnosis and prognosis (permanent total disability) and his functionality as seen in the videos. Simms\u2019 attorney was copied on the letter to Schabacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b66 Schabacker dictated a response to Martello\u2019s letter on June 28, 2007, but did not send the letter to Martello at that time. On July 2, 2007, Martello forwarded a letter to Schabacker that Martello had received from Simms\u2019 attorney. Again, Martello\u2019s letter was on Montana State Fund letterhead, but noted under Martello\u2019s signature that Martello was both legal counsel for the State Fund and special assistant attorney general (SAAG).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b67 On August 17, 2007, Schabacker faxed his June 28 letter to Martello. In the letter Schabacker noted that \u201cthere is an overwhelming disparity between what is present in the video and what I have been left to believe is his functional status,\u201d and that Simms\u2019 \u201cphysical capabilities markedly exceed those he reported and demonstrated to me in clinic.\u201d The doctor stated that, based upon the videos, it appeared that Simms had \u201cnearly unrestricted physical capabilities in terms of lifting, carrying, walking, sitting, tossing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>driving\u201d and was no longer incapable of gainful employment. Schabacker stated he was disturbed by the videos. He indicated that Martello could contact him if Martello had questions or concerns about the contents of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b68 Martello distributed Schabacker\u2019s letter to other persons and entities that had formerly provided medical treatment or insurance coverage to Simms. Based upon the letter, State Fund and these parties sued Simms for fraud. These cases were ultimately dismissed and State Fund continues to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Simms.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b69 On July 28, 2010, Simms filed a complaint against Schabacker and St. Vincent Healthcare alleging that Schabacker had unlawfully disseminated Simms\u2019 private medical information to a law enforcement officer. The District Court resolved various issues as the litigation proceeded until Schabacker remained as the sole defendant and the single remaining issue was whether Schabacker\u2019s letter to Montana State Fund regarding Simms\u2019 abilities as displayed in the videos violated Simms\u2019 right to healthcare privacy as provided by \u00a7 50-16-801, et seq., MCA. In September 2013, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The District Court held oral argument on these motions on October 7,2013, and on October 30 rendered its order and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b610 The court addressed the importance of the physician-patient privilege but concluded that the disclosure statutes applicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases authorized Schabacker to have ex parte communications with Montana State Fund pertaining to Simms\u2019 relevant healthcare, and thus provided an exception to the physician-patient privilege. The court noted that State Fund and Schabacker had a history of ex parte communications regarding Simms\u2019 case as authorized by statute, and that this letter was in keeping with past correspondences. The court also concluded that Schabacker did not knowingly assist a law enforcement agency when he discussed Simms\u2019 medical condition with State Fund. Consequently, the District Court granted Schabacker\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Simms\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b611 Simms filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. Summary judgment \"should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Baumgart v. State, </em>2014 MT 194, \u00b6 13, 376 Mont. 1, 332 P.3d 225 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b613 In response to a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving paiiy must provide material and substantial evidence setting forth specific facts to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and cannot merely rely upon speculative or conclusory statements. <em>Baumgart, </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that Schabacker did not knowingly assist law enforcement and that Montana law authorized Schabackefs letter to Montana State Fund addressing Simms\u2019 medical condition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b615 The District Court concluded that the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme provides exceptions to the physician-patient confidentiality privilege by allowing ex parte communications between a claimant\u2019s physician and the workers\u2019 compensation insurer. The court concluded that Schahacker\u2019s communications with State Fund relative to Simms\u2019 medical condition, including the subject letter to Martello, were authorized under Sections 50-16-805(1), 50-16-527, and 39-71-604(2), MCA. The relevant portions of these statutes are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\"><em>50-16-805Disclosure of information allowed for certain purposes. </em>(1) To the extent provided in 39-71-604 and 50-16-527, a signed claim for workers\u2019 compensation or occupational disease benefits authorizes disclosure to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer, as defined in 39-71-116, by the health care provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\"><em>50-16-527 Patient authorization </em>\u2014 retention\u2014effective period\u2014 <em>exception </em>\u2014 communication <em>without prior notice for workers\u2019 compensation purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">(4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), a signed claim for workers\u2019 compensation or occupational disease benefits authorizes disclosure to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer, as defined in 39-71-116, or to the agent of a workers\u2019 compensation insurer by the health care provider. The disclosure authorized by this subsection authorizes the physician or other health care provider to disclose or release only information relevant to the claimant\u2019s condition. Health care information relevant to the claimant\u2019s condition may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>include past history of the complaints of or the treatment of a condition that is similar to that presented in the claim, conditions for which benefits are subsequently claimed, other conditions related to the same body part, or conditions that may affect recovery. A release of information related to workers\u2019 compensation must be consistent with the provisions of this subsection. Authorization under this section is effective only as long as the claimant is claiming benefits. This subsection may not be construed to restrict the scope of discovery or disclosure of health care information as allowed under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, by the workers\u2019 compensation court, or as otherwise provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Finally, \u00a7 39-71-604(2), MCA, contains a provision identical to \u00a7 50-16-527(4), MCA, set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b616 Simms argues that the above statutes do not excuse Schabacker\u2019s conduct. He maintains that Schabacker\u2019s letter to Martello in response to his receipt of the videos was atypical of the parties\u2019 previous correspondence and is actionable because Martello\u2019s July2,2007 letter revealed to Schabacker that Martello was acting in his capacity as a \u201cSpecial Assistant Attorney General.\u201d The text of Martello\u2019s letter \u2014 which was on State Fund stationery \u2014 makes no reference to the SAAG capacity or to any criminal investigation; the quoted words simply appear under Martello\u2019s signature. Simms maintains that in light of this \u201cdisclosure\u201d on the Martello letter, Schabacker knew he was assisting in a criminal investigation rather than simply providing information pertaining to Simms\u2019 medical condition, and that Schabacker should be held liable for providing medical opinions to a law enforcement agent in a criminal investigation that are adverse to his own patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b617 In response, Schabacker points out that he had responded to multiple Montana State Fund communications over the years, all arriving on the same letterhead, regarding Simms\u2019 progress and treatment throughout the time that he acted as Simms\u2019 treating physician, and that this correspondence was exchanged as authorized by the statutes quoted above. These letters were copied to Simms, and Simms never objected to the communications. Schabacker submitted a sworn affidavit to the effect that when he drafted his response to Martello\u2019s initial letter containing the videos, he had no knowledge that Martello was associated with law enforcement in any manner. He stated he did not consider Martello\u2019s SAAG title to be a factor when responding to Martello\u2019s letter, and that he did not know that a criminal investigation of Simms was underway and never intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>assist in any such investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b618  In entering summary judgment, the District Court concluded that Schabacker and the State Fund were authorized to conduct ex parte communications with each other, and that the communications properly centered on healthcare information relevant to Simms\u2019 condition for which he was claiming benefits. The court found that the Notice of Privacy Policy executed by Simms, when read in conjunction with authorizing statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 50-16-805(1), 50-16-527, and 39-71-604, MCA), expressly permitted Schabacker to release relevant healthcare information regarding Simms to State Fund. While the court found it \u201ctroubling\u201d that State Fund sent the videos to the doctor in the first place, it observed that the issue before the court was whether Schabackeris response to the videos breached the physician-client privilege and Simms\u2019 right to the privacy of his medical information. The court concluded that in light of the executed Notice of Privacy Policy and the statutes authorizing such communications, Schabacker did not breach the privilege, and further that the doctor had established that he had no knowledge that he was assisting a law enforcement agency when he wrote the letter to Martello. We find no error in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b619 The sole basis for Simms\u2019 complaint against Schabacker is that because of the reference to Martello\u2019s SAAG status in one letter, Schabacker knew he was participating in a criminal investigation against his own patient when he informed Martello of his reaction to the videos. Schabacker flatly denied in an affidavit and sworn testimony that he knew Martello was acting in a law enforcement capacity, and the District Court relied upon these denials to conclude that the doctor had no knowledge he was assisting a law enforcement agency. However, we conclude that even if the SAAG status noted at the bottom of MarteEo\u2019s letter could arguably raise a question of fact about what the doctor knew, summary judgment was stiE appropriate in fight of the provision in the Notice of Privacy Polity that NRPRC \u201cmay disclose any information we coEect... [which] may include ... disclosures related to... fraud investigations.\u201d <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 4. Thus, even if Schabacker suspected that a fraud investigation had commenced, his disclosure would nonetheless be protected by virtue of the language of the Notice of Privacy Polity which was signed by Simms. Notably, Simms has not argued that he was coerced into signing the Notice or that he did not understand its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b620 The Dissent maintains that we err in omitting \u00a7 50-16-805(2), MCA, from our discussion. It posits that this statute, which addresses those situations in which healthcare providers may disclose healthcare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>information for law enforcement purposes, is in essence an absolute liability statute in that it does not require a healthcare provider to <em>know </em>that he is making a disclosure to law enforcement authorities in order for a violation of the statute to be established. We reject this argument for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b621 First, Simms has consistently argued that Schabacker <em>knowingly </em>made prohibited disclosures to Martello as SAAG in violation of the statute; thus, the position interposed by the Dissent is contrary to Simms\u2019 primary contention on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b622 Second, we disagree with the proposition that the statute is an absolute liability statute. The Legislature is well aware of how to craft a statute so as to make clear that it intends the statute to impose absolute liability for the conduct described. For example, \u00a7 61-8-401(7), MCA, which addresses the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, provides: \u201cAbsolute liability as provided in 45-2-104 [limiting the circumstances under which absolute liability may be imposed] will be imposed for a violation of this section.\u201d The intent to impose absolute liability is expressly stated. <em>State v. Parks, </em>2013 MT 280, \u00b6 40, 372 Mont. 88, 310 P.3d 1088 (Cotter, J., concurring). Here, there is no language in the statute to indicate that absolute liability is intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b623  Finally, the Dissent ignores the fact that the Notice ofPrivacy Policy signed by Simms authorizes healthcare providers to make disclosures \u201crelated to fraud investigations.\u201d Nothing in \u00a7 50-16-805(2), MCA, limits or precludes actions taken in accordance with the provisions of such a document.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b624 For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b307-11\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"AY6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\u00b625 I disagree with tibe Court\u2019s interpretation of the controlling statute. Therefore, I dissent. Because I believe a genuine issue of material fact existed, I conclude that the District Court erred by granting summary judgment, and would remand for trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">\u00b626 As the District Court correctly noted, this Court has not yet applied or interpreted \u00a7 50-16-805, MCA, the statute that controls the matter at bar. Before we can decide whether the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>correctly determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact, we must first review the District Court\u2019s decision as to what facts are material. This is a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. <em>See Gordon v. Kuzara, </em>2012 MT 206, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18, 366 Mont. 243, 286 P.3d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b627 Without explanation, the Court implies that the proper inquiry for determining whether a violation of \u00a7 50-16-305, MCA, occurred is whether the health care provider \u2014 Schabacker in this <em>case </em>\u2014 knowingly assisted a law enforcement agency. This interpretation is not supported by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AmLM\">\u00b628 Notably, the Court omits \u00a7 50-16-805(2), MCA, from its discussion. Instead, it limits its discussion to \u00a7 50-16-805(1), MCA. Yet, the meaning of \u00a7 50-16-805(1), MCA, is not clear without reference to \u00a7 50-16-805(2), MCA. Those sections read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">(1) To the extent provided in 39-71-604 and 50-16-527, a signed claim for workers\u2019 compensation or occupational disease benefits authorizes disclosure to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer, as defined in 39-71-116, by the health care provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">(2) A health care provider may disclose health care information about an individual for law enforcement purposes if the disclosure is to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">(a) federal, state, or local law enforcement authorities to the extent required by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">(b) a law enforcement officer about the general physical condition of a patient being treated in a health care facility It the patient was injured by the possible criminal act of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b629 It is a maxim of statutory interpretation that a general statute will yield to a specific statute. Section 1-2-102, MCA; <em>State v. Plouffe, </em>2014 MT 183, \u00b6 27, 375 Mont. 429, 329 P.3d 1255. Here, \u00a7 50-16-805(1), MCA, read with \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-604 and 50-16-527, MCA, states a general rule: a health care provider may disclose relevant health care information to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer. Yet, where the disclosure is for more specific \u201claw enforcement purposes\u201d this rule yields to \u00a7 50-16-805(2), MCA. In such case, disclosure can only be made to law enforcement authorities or law enforcement officers, and only to the specific extent allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\u00b630 Thus, the proper inquiry under this statute does not begin and end with whether the health care provider knew that he or she was disclosing information to a law enforcement authority; \u00a7 50-16-805(1), MCA, does not provide a safe-harbor for health care providers just because they subjectively believe their disclosures are being made to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer. Rather the inquiry is two-fold. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>First, a court must determine for what purpose the disclosure of health care information was made. While the health care provider\u2019s knowledge of the identity of the disclosure recipient may be a relevant factor here, it seems unlikely that it will be dispositive in every instance. For most purposes, the provider may properly disclose information to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer. If the disclosure was made for law enforcement purposes, however, the court must make a second inquiry. Namely, it must ensure that the disclosure was to \u201claw enforcement authorities to the extent required by law,\u201d or to \u201ca law enforcement officer about the general physical condition of a patient being treated in a health care facility if the patient was injured by the possible criminal act of another.\u201d Section 50-16-805(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A9j\">\u00b631 While the first inquiry may turn on the subjective knowledge or purpose of the health care provider, the second does not. This Court has often stated that if will not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Shockley v. Cascade </em>Cnty., 2014 MT 281, \u00b6 19, 376 Mont. 493, 336 P.3d 375. Here, the Court effectively omits the language regarding law enforcement purposes and inserts a knowledge requirement into the second part of tire analysis. This is not justified by the language of \u00a7 50-16-805, MCA. Nor was such a requirement intended by the Legislature. This becomes clear upon consideration of \u00a7 50-16-817, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b632 That section provides civil remedies for violation of Title 50, part 16, MCA, and it is the section pursuant to which relief could be granted in the present case. Notably, \u00a7 50-16-817(4), MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">If the court determines that there is a violation of this part, the aggrieved person is entitled to recover damages for pecuniary losses sustained as a result of the violation and, <em>in addition, </em>if the violation results from <em>willful or grossly negligent </em>conduct, the aggrieved person may recover not in excess of $5,000, exclusive of any pecuniary loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">(emphasis added). This statute allows recovery of damages for any violation of Title 50, part 16, MCA, including \u00a7 50-16-805, MCA. It does not require any particular knowledge or state of mind. Instead, it allows for <em>enhanced </em>damages when certain states ofmind are shown. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-1-204(5), MCA (defining \u201cwillfully\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b633 The specific inclusion of enhanced damages for \u201cwillful\u201d conduct or \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d conduct, further demonstrates that the Legislature specifically excluded the similar, state-of-mind modifier \u201cknowingly\u201d in both \u00a7 50-16-817, MCA, and the related \u00a750-16-805,MCA. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 1-1-204(2),MCA(defining\u201cknowingly\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>with </em>\u00a7 1-1-204(5), MCA (defining \u201cwfilfully\u201d). The Legislature intended to make no distinction between a knowing violation and an unknowing one.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b634 Thus, the Court errs by making that distinction here. While the difference between the Court\u2019s analysis and the one discussed in this dissent may seem minor, the practical outcome is not. By requiring actual knowledge of disclosure to a law enforcement entity, the Court creates incentives for the health care provider to learn as little as possible about the particular entity to whom he or she is providing information. This further complicates an already complex relationship between the patient, doctor, workers\u2019 compensation insurer, and law enforcement officials. The Court\u2019s interpretation pushes the health care provider, who is already caught between the other parties and must already carefully balance his or her relationships with the patient, insurer, and law enforcement, further away from the patient; it allows the health care provider to become an agent of law enforcement rather than an advocate for his patient, if he or she does so unknowingly. This is not what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b635 Instead, the Legislature stated in \u00a7 50-16-801, MCA, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">[H]ealth care information is personal and sensitive information that if improperly used or released may do significant harm to a patient\u2019s interests in privacy and health care or other interests; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">it is in the best interest of the citizens of Montana to have certain requirements, with respect to the use or release of health care information by health care providers, that are more restrictive than or additional to the health care privacy protections of HIPAA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The two-step analysis required by \u00a7 50-16-805, MCA, better protects these legislative goals than the Court\u2019s interpretation. It places the burden of safeguarding a patient\u2019s information and of determining whether its disclosures are legally permissible with the health care provider; depending on the purpose for the disclosure, the health care provider must ensure that it is disclosing information to a permissible paily. As the Legislature intended, this bolsters the doctor-patient relationship and helps to ensure that privileged health care information is protected. For this reason, the analysis discussed above is preferable to the analysis applied by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u00b636 Yet, regardless of whether or where a subjective \u201cknowingly\" standard should be applied, I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision that there was no genuine issue of material fact. As the District Court did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>this Court relies too heavily on Schabacker\u2019s affidavit and testimony, while giving too little weight to Simms\u2019 arguments and evidence. Simms presented arguments and evidence indicating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u2022 Schabacker was contacted by Thomas Martello, a Special Assistant Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u2022 Schabacker was given what he knew to be surveillance footage of Simms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u2022 Schabacker provided more than health care information to Martello; Schabacker suggested \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d on the part of Simms and declared the surveillance tape to be \u201cdisturbing\u201d in light of the Schabacker\u2019s testimony and advocacy on Simms\u2019 behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Additionally, Schabacker stated in his affidavit that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">Although my main purpose in writing the letter was to communicate with the Montana State Fund regarding Simms\u2019 condition, I also wanted to make clear that I had not previously known that Mr. Simms had the mobility portrayed in the videos and that I would need to reassess his condition and treatment. I also wanted to state that my prior assistance to Mr. Simms in obtaining benefits was done without any knowledge of his true mobility and that I may have inadvertently assisted him in obtaining benefits he was not entitled to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u00b637 A court considering summary judgment must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Thornton v. Flathead Cnty., </em>2009 MT 367, \u00b6 13, 353 Mont. 252, 220 P.3d 395. Drawing such inferences, the foregoing evidence may reasonably establish that Schabacker knew he was disclosing health care information to a special assistant attorney general; that Schabacker understood the surveillance nature of the videos he was supplied with; and that the character of Schabacker\u2019s communication was defensive of Schabacker\u2019s own role and accusatory toward Simms. Accordingly, a trier of fact might reasonably have found that Schabacker knew he was disclosing health care information to a law enforcement agency or for law enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">\u00b638 Yet, the District Court gave credence to Schabacker\u2019s self-serving assertion that he did not know that Martello was a special assistant attorney general or involved with a criminal investigation at the time Schabacker wrote his letter. Viewed in the light most favorable to Simms, this statement at most establishes that Schabacker did not know Martello\u2019s identity when he was writing the letter. Given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>over a month passed between the times when the letter was written and when it was sent, this says nothing of Schabacker\u2019s knowledge at the time the health care information disclosure actually occurred. For these reasons, there was a genuine issue of material fact, and the District Court should not have granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b639 The Court contends that the foregoing is of little consequence given the disclosure permissions granted in the Notice of Privacy Policy. Yet, the Court ignores the limitations built into what it interprets as the document\u2019s unequivocal permission for the health care provider to disclose health care information to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18. While the Notice of Privacy Policy does, as the Court states, allow NRPRC to \"disclose any information [it] collect[s],\u201d NRPRC is only allowed to do so \"when permitted orrequired by law.\u201d Given the foregoing discussion, whether the disclosure in this case was permitted by law turns on whether Schabacker made the disclosure for a law enforcement purpose or, under the Court\u2019s analysis, knowingly to a law enforcement agent. In either case, there is a genuine issue of material fact and the Notice of Privacy Policy does not make summary judgment proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b640 I believe this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 50-16-805, MCA, was erroneous. Forthisreason,IcannotjointheCourt\u2019sOpinion. I dissent because under the proper \u00a7 50-16-805, MCA, analysis and the one applied by this Court, there was a genuine issue of material fact. I would reverse and remand to the District Court for this reason.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
