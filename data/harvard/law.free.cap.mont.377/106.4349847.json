On March 6,2014, the Defendant was sentenced for Count II: Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (alprazolam), a felony, in violation of Section 45-9-102, MCA, to Montana Department of Corrections for a period of Five (5) years. The Defendant is granted credit for time served prior to sentencing for the time periods of May 6-8,2013; and January 21, 2014-March 6, 2014. The Department may place Defendant into an appropriate community-based program, facility or State correctional institution, with the Court\u2019s recommendation for placement at Elkhom, followed by treatment court. Should Defendant not be accepted at Elkhom, the Court recommends Defendant be placed at Passages, followed by a pre-release center program.

The Defendant was represented by Ed Sheehy, Jr., Montana Office of Public Defender.

The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Rule 12, Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana, provides that, \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct. The sentence shall not be reduced or increased unless it is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Division that the sentence shall be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Done in open Court this 26th day of September, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-14\">Chairperson, Hon.
