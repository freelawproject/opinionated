The State was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Before hearing the Application, the Defendant was advised that the Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Rule 12, Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana, provides that, \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct.
