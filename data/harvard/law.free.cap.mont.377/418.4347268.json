The court sentenced Hanna to thirty yearn in Montana State Prison with ten years suspended and awarded restitution in an unspecified amount. We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">1. <em>Whether Hanna is entitled to a new trial because the District Court improperly instructed the jury on accountability for robbery.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Hanna\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Hanna.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">\u00b62 We affirm on the first two issues. On the third, we remand to the District Court to determine the amount of restitution Hanna owes for the victim\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">\u00b63 At approximately 3:00 a.m. on September 7,2012, a masked man entered Ole\u2019s convenience store in East Missoula dressed in all black and carrying a .22 caliber rifle. Store clerk Adam Gallegos was cleaning soda machines on the opposite side of the store from the front doors where the man entered. The man demanded that Gallegos give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>him money out of the register. Gallegos recognized the man as Chris Burch by his voice and shoes. Gallegos had met Burch on previous occasions through mutual friends and Burch had been a customer at Ole\u2019s. Gallegos told Burch no, that he would not give Burch the money out of the register, and turned his back to continue cleaning. Burch took the rifle to his shoulder, aimed, and fired. The bullet hit Gallegos in the upper right chest, entering his lung. Burch ran out the front doors. Gallegos survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b64 Detectives located Burch in the morning. Burch said that he had been out drinking with Preston Hanna the night before and that Hanna was the one who entered Ole\u2019s with the rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b65 Detectives interrogated Hanna later that day after Hanna signed a form waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Hanna acknowledged having been out with Burch and another acquaintance, Josh Smith, the night before. Burch was wearing black pants and a black shirt, Smith was in his supermarket work uniform, and Hanna was wearing a black shirt and swim shorts. Hanna stated that the three decided to drive up Deer Creek to go \"plinking\u201d \u2014 essentially, shooting random objects with Hanna\u2019s rifle. Hanna admitted to the detectives that he removed the temporary tag from his girlfriend\u2019s car before the three got in with Hanna driving. After the three started on their way, Burch asked Hanna to stop by Ole\u2019s. Because they were out of alcohol and it was past the hour when they could purchase beer, Hanna reported thinking that Burch might want to do a \"beer run\u201d (essentially, Burch would run into the store, grab a case of beer, and run out without paying). Hanna parked the car in front of Ole\u2019s. According to Hanna, Burch told him to shut off the headlights, and Burch tied black pants around his face to create a mask before exiting the car carrying Hanna\u2019s rifle. Hanna told the detectives that this was when he realized that Burch was doing something more than a beer run. Burch went into the store with the rifle and Hanna remained in the driver\u2019s seat with the car parked. A short time later, Burch came out of the store, got in the car, and told Hanna that he had shot the clerk and to \"drive, drive, drive.\u201d Hanna recounted that he sped off to his place, where he parked the car and decided to wait until the morning before figuring out what to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b66 When detectives interviewed Burch again, he admitted that he was the one who entered Ole\u2019s and shot Gallegos.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b67 The State charged Hanna by information with accountability for attempted deliberate homicide and accountability for robbery. At a hearing on February 25, 2013, the State moved to dismiss the accountability for attempted deliberate homicide charge with prejudice. The State explained that its motion to dismiss the charge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>unrelated to a plea agreement it had reached with Hanna. Hanna and the State presented their plea agreement to the court: Hanna would plead guilty to accountability for robbery and agree to testify against Burch in exchange for a twenty-year sentence to Montana State Prison with fifteen years suspended. Accordingly, Hanna pleaded guilty in open court and the District Court ordered a presentence investigation report. On May 1, 2013, the court and parties reconvened for sentencing. The District Court advised the parties that it would not follow the plea agreement and would instead impose a twenty-year sentence to Montana State Prison with no time suspended. The court asked Hanna if he wished to withdraw his guilty plea now that the court had rejected the agreement. Hanna decided to withdraw his plea and to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b68 At trial, neither Hanna nor Burch testified. The State called Josh Smith, the third person in the car on the night of the shooting. Smith testified that Hanna jokingly suggested robbing Ole\u2019s and that, before the three went to Ole\u2019s, Hanna removed the temporary tag from the car. After Hanna parked outside Ole\u2019s, Smith said Hanna went to the back of the car, came back with the rifle, and handed it to Burch. Burch masked himself, went into the store, and returned a few moments later, telling Hanna to drive, and that he had shot the clerk after the clerk refused to give him money. Smith said Hanna sped off. During cross examination, Smith admitted that he acted as a lookout when Burch went into the store, that he blacked out for at least a portion of the night, and that, when originally questioned by the detectives, he did not disclose some information until they threatened him with prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b69 The State also played a recording of Hanna\u2019s interrogation for the jury. At the close of the State\u2019s case, Hanna moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the State had presented insufficient evidence to convict him. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b610 In his defense, Hanna presented two witnesses who testified that Hanna had been cited for \u201cplinking\u201d in the past. In closing, defense counsel emphasized that Hanna was drunk the night of the crime, that everything happened very fast once Hanna realized Burch was going into the store with the rifle, and that Hanna did not have time to extricate himself from the situation once the shooting occurred unexpectedly. Defense counsel argued that Hanna may have intended to facilitate a theft, but he did not intend to facilitate a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b611 The jury returned a guilty verdict. The court sentenced Hanna to thirty years in Montana State Prison with ten years suspended, ordered Hanna to register as a violent offender, and requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201cthe Board of Pardons and Adult Probation Office review restitution due to Mr. Gallegos prior to [Hanna\u2019s] release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b612 Hanna appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b613 We review preserved jury instruction challenges for an abuse of discretion coupled with a showing of prejudice to the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Cybulski, </em>2009 MT <em>70, </em>\u00b6 34, 349 Mont. 429, 204 P.3d 7. If a defendant had the opportunity but failed to object to a jury instruction at trial, we will not examine the issue unless it qualifies for plain error review. <em>State v. Birthmark, </em>2013 MT 86, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 413, 300 P.3d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b614 We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. <em>State v. Kirn, </em>2012 MT 69, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 746. We determine whether, after viewing the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable juror could have convicted the defendant. <em>Kirn, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b615 A district court\u2019s compliance with sentencing statutes is generally a question of law that we review de novo. <em>State v. Cerasani, </em>2014 MT 2, \u00b6 11, 373 Mont. 192, 316 P.3d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\u00b616 <em>1. Whether Hanna is entitled to a new trial because the District Court improperly instructed the jury on accountability for robbery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b617 Hanna was charged with and found guilty of accountability for robbery. A person commits robbery when, \u201cin the course of committing a theft, the person: (a) inflicts bodily injury upon another; (b) threatens to inflict bodily injury upon any person or purposely or knowingly puts any person in fear of immediate bodily injury; or (c) commits or threatens immediately to commit any felony other than theft.\u201d Section 45-5-401(1), MCA \u201c[Accountability is not a separate or different offense from the one charged, but rather, is \u2018merely a conduit by which to find a person criminally liable for the acts of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tellegen, </em>2013 MT 337, \u00b6 9, 372 Mont. 454, 314 P.3d 902 (citations omitted). An accomplice is accountable for another person\u2019s robbery when \u201ceither before or during the commission of [the robbery] with the purpose to promote or facilitate the commission, the [accomplice] solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid the other person in the planning or commission of the [robbery].\u201d Section 45-2-302(3), MCA. \u00b618 The District Court instructed the jury that a person commits robbery if, \u201cin the course of committing a theft, the person: purposely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>or knowingly inflicts bodily injury upon another; OR purposely or knowingly threatens to inflict bodily injury upon any person; OR purposely or knowingly puts any person in fear of immediate bodily iiyury[.]\u201d Hanna objected to this instruction at trial and now appeals it. Hanna argues that he was charged with accountability for robbery under a single theory: the principal\u2019s commission of a theft coupled with a purposeful or knowing infliction of bodily injury on another. Hanna posits that he was not charged with accountability for robbery by means of a theft coupled with either the threat to inflict bodily injury or the fear of immediate bodily injury. In essence, Hanna suggests that the jury instructions permitted the jury to convict him of accountability for robbery under sub-elements of robbery with which he was never charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b619 A criminal defendant has the right to notice of the crime under which he will be prosecuted. <em>State v. Spotted Eagle, </em>2010 MT 222, \u00b6 9, 358 Mont. 22, 243 P.3d 402 (\u201cAn [Ijnformation must reasonably apprise the defendant of the charges against him so that he may have the opportumtyto prepare and present his defense\u201d). Thatright is violated when the Information charges the defendant of one crime but the jury is permitted to convict the defendant of another. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 15. In <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>the State charged the defendant by Information with violating \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA \u2014 Montana\u2019s law prohibiting assault on a partner or family member \u2014 because the defendant \u201cpurposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to his partner[.]\u201d <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 2. At trial, the court instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of violating \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, if the defendant \u201ccaused bodily injury <em>or </em>reasonable apprehension of bodily irrjury\u201d to his partner. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 3 (emphasis supplied). We held that the instruction \u201cimproperly amended the charge\u201d against the defendant by permitting conviction under an offense sub-element that the defendant was never charged with violating. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b620  By contrast, the State\u2019s Information in this case charged Hanna with robbery in general, citing only \u00a7 45-5-401, MCA, and not any particular subsection of the robbery statute. Unlike the Information in <em>Spotted Eagle </em>that limited the charge to causing bodily ixyury to the victim, the Information in this case did not so limit the robbery charge. The charge was general, alleging that Hanna, \u201cbefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and/or during the commission of the offense of Robbery, aided or abetted Christopher Burch in the commission of the offense of Robbery.\u201d Further, the affidavit accompanying the Information alleged that a masked man entered a store with a rifle, told an employee to give him the store\u2019s money, and then shot the employee. The affidavit also included allegations that Hanna had removed the license plate from his car before driving Burch to Ole\u2019s; that Hanna drove the vehicle and waited in the parking lot with the lights out and engine running while Burch entered with the rifle; that Hanna drove off in a hurry with Burch in the car after Burch returned and reported that he had shot the clerk; that the robbery was Hanna\u2019s idea; and that Hanna had provided Burch with the rifle. The Information and affidavit provided Hanna with reasonable notice of a charge of accountability fox' robbery under any of \u00a7 45-5-401\u2019s sub-elements. The robbery jury instruction patterned on the statute did not improperly amend the charge against Hanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b621 Hanna maintains that the robbeiy instruction was improper because it did not instruct the jury that it must reach unanimity with regard to the specific element of robbery that it determined Hanna purposefully aided or abetted. Hanna cites <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MI 252,307 Mont. 139,36 P.3d 900. In that case, the court instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of burglary for entering a home \u201cto commit either the offense of theft or the offense of sexual assault,\u201d but did not instruct the jury that it would have to reach a unanimous verdict on either alternative. <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 71. We reversed the verdict because \u201c[u]nanimity requires more than a conclusory agreement that the accused is guilty of some charged offense; the jury must be in agreement as to the principal factual elements underlying a specific offense.\u201d <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70,72.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b622 Hanna failed to object to the robbery instruction\u2019s lack of a unanimity requirement. We refrain from considering issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Robertson, </em>2014 MT 279, \u00b6 16, 376 Mont. 471, 336 P.3d 367. Under \u00a7 46-16-410(3), MCA, \u201c[a] party may not assign as error any portion of the instructions or omission from the instructions unless an objection was made specifically stating the matter objected to, and the grounds for the objections, at the settlement of instructions.\u201d As addressed above, Hanna\u2019s objection to instruction number twelve \u2014 the robbery instruction \u2014 was based on the purported lack of notice of the robbery sub-elements found in the instruction. Hanna never mentioned, much less \u201cspecifically staffed],\u201d that there was a unanimity problem with the instruction. Section 45-16-410(3), MCA. Accordingly, Hanna\u2019s objection to the robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>instruction was insufficient to preserve the unanimity issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A-6\">\u00b623 We do occasionally review unpreserved issues under the doctrine of plain error review, but only when (1) \u201cthe claimed error implicates a fundamental right,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe claimed error would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d Robertson, \u00b6 32 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A1V\">\u00b624 The State argues that there was no error because this case involves accountability rather than principal liability. But accountability is \u201cmerely a conduit\u201d for liability and not a \u201cseparate or different offense.\u201d <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 9. Thus, charging someone with accountability for a substantive offense does not affect the elements of the substantive offense. Whether charged as a principal or an accomplice, a defendant is entitled to a unanimous verdict on each principal element of the offense. <em>See Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 72. While the District Court instructed the jury broadly that the \u201claw requires a jury verdict in this case that is unanimous,\u201d the court did not instruct the jury that it had to agree on the principal elements of Hanna\u2019s robbery offense. Even though the jury was not instructed in this regard, we conclude that plain error review is not warranted. Viewingthe claimed error in the context of the evidence presented at trial and the arguments of the parties, we are not convinced that the failure to provide a unanimity instruction compromised the \u201cjustness, fairness, or integrity of [Hanna\u2019s] trial.\u201d <em>Robertson, </em>\u00b6 40. No one disputed that Burch purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to Gallegos, and no one claimed that Hanna intended for Gallegos to be shot. Hanna\u2019s defense was that he did not know about Burch\u2019s plan until after the shooting and did not have a chance to withdraw from the criminal enterprise after that occurred. The instruction on the three methods of committing robbery did not compromise the integrity of Hanna\u2019s trial, which focused on Hanna\u2019s intention to facilitate the commission of the robbery even after the store clerk had been shot and even though Hanna did not know in advance that was going to happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b625 Hanna also argues that instruction number thirteen was improper. Instruction number thirteen directed the jury that, \u201cThe ensuing flight is considered part and parcel of the robbery until such time as the criminal purpose is completed. A person acting as a getaway driver may become hable for robbery.\u201d Hanna argues that the instruction\u2019s second sentence derives from dicta in <em>State v. Case, </em>190 Mont. 450, 621 P.2d 1066 (1980) and was thus inappropriate to use in a jury instruction. The State responds that Hanna waived this issue on appeal by failing to object to it at trial. As the State apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>recognizes, however, Hanna was in the process of objecting to the instruction when the District Court cut him off. Thus, we will review the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b626 In reviewing a claim of instructional error, \u201cwe determine whether the instructions taken as a whole frilly and fairly instructed the jury on the law applicable in the case.\u201d <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 5. Hanna does not challenge the instruction\u2019s first sentence directing that \u201c[t]he ensuing flight is considered part and parcel of the robbery until such time as the criminal purpose is completed.\u201d Nor could he: this instruction is essentially identical to one we upheld in <em>State v. Kills on </em>Top, 243 Mont. 56, 63-64, 793 P.2d 1273, 1298 (1990). Viewed in context, the getaway driver sentence merely extrapolates upon the preceding sentence and the principle that a person is accountable if he purposefully facilitates a crime by aiding or abetting it. Section 45-5-401(3), MCA, is explicit that \u201cin the course of committing a theft\u201d includes acts that occur \u201cin flight after the attempt or commission....\u201d The getaway driver sentence was a full and fair explication of the law in the context of this case. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by giving instruction number thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b627 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Hanna\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b628 Hanna argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hanna argues that the State failed to present sufficient corroborating evidence showing that Hanna was an accomplice to the robbery. Hanna admits that he drove Burch away from the scene of the crime, but argues that this admission does not support holding him liable for the robbery because the robbery already had ended by the time he drove away. In his reply brief, Hanna also cites <em>United States v. </em>Rosemand,_U.S._, 134 S. Ct. 1240 (2014), for the proposition that he needed to have known in advance that Burch was armed to be convicted as an accomplice to Burch\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8\">\u00b629 \u201cA person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense... unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that... tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.\u201d Section 46-16-213, MCA. Corroborative evidence must \u201c \u2018(1) be independent, (2) point toward the defendant\u2019s guilt, and (3) provide a legally sufficient connection between the defendant and the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. </em>Berger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 28,290 Mont. 78,964 P.2d 725 (citation omitted). \u00b630 Hanna argues that because Smith admitted that he acted as a lookout and thus as an accomplice to the robbery, Smith\u2019s testimony could not stand alone in convicting Hanna. But Smith\u2019s testimony did not stand alone. The jury heard the recording of Hanna\u2019s interrogation. In his interview with the detectives, Hanna admitted that he removed the temporary tag from the car; that he knew that something other than a simple beer run was happening when Burch got out of the vehicle with a rifle and a mask; that he remained outside the store in the car while Burch went inside; that he would have made Burch split the proceeds of the crime had Burch come out of Ole\u2019s with money; and that Burch told Hanna that he had shot the clerk before Hanna sped off from the scene of the crime with Burch in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b631 After hearing these admissions, areasonable juror couldinferthat Hanna knew Burch entered Ole\u2019s with a rifle in hand, intending to commit a theft. A reasonable juror could infer that when a person enters a convenience store with a rifle in hand intending to steal, that person is threatening to inflict bodily injury on anyone who stands in his way. Moreover, a reasonable juror could infer that Hanna knew Burch inflicted bodily injury on another while committing the theft because Burch told Hanna as much when he got back in the car. A reasonable juror also could conclude that Hanna purposely facilitated the commission of the robbery by participating in the flight after commission of the attempted theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b632 We see no conflict between these conclusions and the recent <em>Rosemand </em>case. In <em>Rosemand, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant could be convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) \u2014 which criminalizes carrying or using a gun in connection with a drug trafficking offense \u2014 only when the defendant knew that one of his confederates would carry a gun at the offense. Rosemand,_U.S. at_, 134 S. Ct. at 1249. This holding followed from the general accomplice liability principle that an accomplice\u2019s intent to facilitate the substantive offense\u2019s commission \u201cmust go to the specific and entire crime charged[.]\u201d Rosemand,_U.S. at_, 134 S. Ct. at 1248 (citing, e.g., Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00b6 13.2(c) (2d ed. 2003)). Applying that principle to robbery under \u00a7 45-5-401, MCA, means that, either before or during Burch\u2019s crime and with the purpose to facilitate it, Hanna had to have knowledge that Burch was going to inflict, threaten to inflict, or cause someone to fear infliction of bodily injury. Unlike the statute at issue in <em>Rosemand, </em>carrying or using a gun is not an element of robbery under \u00a7 45-5-401, MCA. As noted, a reasonable juror could infer that Hanna had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>requisite knowledge after he saw Burch go into Ole\u2019s with the rifle and then heard Burch explain that he had shot Gallegos.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b633  A reasonable juror could take Hanna\u2019s act of driving Burch away from the scene of the crime \u2014 executed after Hanna knew what had occurred \u2014 as aiding or abetting the commission of the crime. As the jury properly was instructed, \u201c[t]he ensuing flight is considered part and parcel of a [rjobbery until such time as the criminal purpose, including carrying away of the spoils of the crime, is completed.\u201d <em>Kills on Top, </em>243 Mont, at 63, 793 P.2d at 1298. There were no spoils here, but there was a robbery and a flight, and Hanna facilitated Burch\u2019s getaway only a few moments after Burch shot Gallegos and before Burch had reached a point of \u201cseeming security.\u201d <em>Case, </em>190 Mont, at 455, 621 P.2d at 1069. The jury could consider Hanna\u2019s actions as the getaway driver as evidence that Hanna aided and abetted the robbery, and that he did so with the purpose of facilitating the robbery\u2019s commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b634 3. <em>Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Hanna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b635 Hanna has three issues with his sentence. First, Hanna argues that the District Court erred by failing to specify the amount of restitution Hanna owes to Gallegos for medical expenses. The State concedes the District Court\u2019s error on this point. At the post-trial sentencing hearing, the District Court requested that, upon Hanna\u2019s eventual release from prison, \u201cthe Board of Pardons and Adult Probation Office... look at the restitution that is due to Mr. Gallegos.\u201d The court repeated this request in its written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b636 \u201c[A] sentencing court shall, as part of the sentence, require an offender to make full restitution to any victim who has sustained a pecuniary loss ... .\u201d Section 46-18-241(1), MCA. \u201cPecuniary loss\u201d includes \u201cfuture medical expenses that the victim can reasonably be expected to incur as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct....\u201d Section 46-18-243(1)(c), MCA. \u201c(TJhe amount of restitution must be stated as a specific amount of money.\u201d <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 7, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087; <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA. The District Court\u2019s request that correctional authorities determine restitution upon Hanna\u2019s release lacks statutory basis. With the help of a presentence investigation and report, a court must determine a definitive amount of restitution while permitting Hanna to \u201cassert any defense\u201d that he could raise in a civil action. Sections 46-18-242(1), - 244(2), MCA. We therefore remand to the District Court to specify the amount of restitution Hanna owes Gallegos, including the amount of future medical expenses that Gallegos reasonably may be expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>incur as a result of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b637 Second, Hanna argues that, by imposing a greater sentence after trial than it said it would impose before trial, the District Court punished Hanna for exercising his right to go to trial. Hanna invokes our decisional law that \u201cwhen a [district [c]ourt becomes involved in the plea negotiations and an offer is made, any difference in the sentencing after trial must point out the factors [that] justify the increased sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>2003 MT 253, \u00b6 42, 317 Mont. 356, 77 P.3d 239. Here, at Hanna\u2019s sentencing hearing following the entry of his guilty plea, the court notified the parties that it would \u201cnot follow the plea bargain agreement,\u201d and would impose \u201ca twenty-year sentence to the Montana State Prison\u201d with no time suspended. In light of its rejection of the plea agreement, the court permitted Hanna to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA (directing that, upon rejecting a plea agreement that exchanges a guilty plea for a specific sentence, a court permit the defendant to withdraw his plea and advise the defendant that the case\u2019s disposition may be less favorable than was contemplated in the plea agreement). Hanna elected to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b638  Simply because there is a disparity between the sentence offered and the sentence imposed after a withdrawn plea does not mean that the defendant has been punished for exercising his right to a jury trial. <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>192 Mont. 521, 526, 629 P.2d 222, 225 (1981). We require that a district court justify an increased sentence following trial only if (1) the district court did increase the sentence following trial, and (2) the district court became \u201cinvolved in the plea negotiations.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 42. On the first requirement, the State argues that the pre-trial and post-trial sentences are consistent because, in either case, Hanna would serve twenty years in prison. But there is a discrepancy between the two sentences. At the pre-trial sentencing hearing, the court told Hanna that \u201cthe sentence, that the [c]ourt would impose, is a twenty-year sentence to Montana State Prison.\u201d At the post-trial sentencing hearing, the court sentenced Hanna to \u201cthirty years at the Montana State Prison\u201d and specified that \u201c[t]he last ten years of that sentence is suspended.\u201d Suspended time is nonetheless sentenced time. <em>See Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 662, 122 S. Ct. 1764, 1770 (2002) (holding that \u201c[a] suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of a conviction\u201d and thus implicates the Sixth Amendment right to counsel). The facts of this case satisfy the first requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b639 Regarding the second requirement, we have considered whether a district court became involved in plea negotiations in four cases. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Hall, </em>at a pre-trial omnibus hearing, the court indicated that it was aware of ongoing plea negotiations and offered the defendant a sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. The court then imposed a greater sentence after the defendant went to trial. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 40. In <em>State v. Tate, </em>196 Mont. 248, 639 P.2d 1149 (1982), the defendant informed the judge mid-trial that he was having second thoughts about whether he should proceed or plead guilty. The court offered the defendant a sentence in exchange for pleading guilty yet imposed a greater sentence after the defendant chose to proceed with the trial. <em>Tate, </em>196 Mont, at 249, 639 P.2d at 1149. And in <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>192 Mont. 521, 629 P.2d 222 (1981), the court sent a letter to the defendant offering a sentence in exchange for a guilty plea but then imposed a greater sentence alter the defendant proceeded to trial. <em>Baldwin, </em>192 Mont, at 522-24, 629 P.2d at 223-24. In each of these cases, we held that the court became involved in plea negotiations. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>Tate, </em>196 Mont, at 251, 639 P.2d at 1150; <em>Baldwin, </em>192 Mont, at 527-28, 629 P.2d at 226. By contrast, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>2003 MT 166, 316 Mont. 310, 71 P.3d 1215, we determined that \u201c[e]xcept for being apprised of the plea negotiations at a pretrial conference, there is no evidence that the District Court was involved in the plea negotiation process.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 27. Thus, we concluded that the court was not required to justify a harsher sentence after trial. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b640  The principle that we deduce from these cases is that a district court is not \"involved in plea negotiations\u201d if those negotiations already have concluded before the court offers a sentence. Here, without any apparent involvement by the court, Hanna and the State bargained and reached a plea agreement. The District Court\u2019s only involvement was to inform Hanna that it rejected the terms of that agreement and would instead impose a twenty-year sentence with no time suspended. By then, plea negotiations already had ended. A district court\u2019s rejection of a negotiated plea agreement is not involvement in plea negotiations. Accordingly, the District Court was not required to explain specifically why the sentence was greater after trial. The District Court gave specific reasons for the sentence imposed, both during the sentencing hearing and in the written judgment, in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b641 The third sentencing issue that Hanna raises is whether it was proper for the District Court to order Hanna to register as a violent offender. The Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act [SVORA] mandates that a \"sexual or violent offender\u201d report personal information to be kept in a registry. Section 46-23-504(1), MCA. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201csexual or violent offender\u201d is a person who has been convicted of a \u201csexual or violent offense.\u201d Section 46-23-502(10), MCA. A \u201cviolent offense\u201d means \u201cany violation of or attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit a violation of\u201d a number of enumerated crimes, including robbery. Section 46-23-502(13)(a), MCA. Hanna argues that because \u201caccountability\u201d is not listed in this definition of a violent offense, his accountability for robbery conviction does not qualify as a violent offense requiring registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b642 As stated, however, accountability is not a \u201cseparate or different offense,\u201d but \u201cmerely a conduit by which to find a person criminally liable for the acts of another.\u201d <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 9. Accordingly, the term \u201cviolation\u201d incorporates the liability of an accomplice just as it incorporates a principal\u2019s liability. Section 46-23-502(13)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">\u00b643  Hanna cites <em>State v. </em>Ferguson, 2005 MT 343, 300 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463, to argue that the District Court was required to find that Hanna used or possessed a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d in order to sentence Hanna as a violent offender. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 112. This argument is misplaced. In <em>Ferguson, </em>we considered whether the defendant\u2019s conviction for attempted robbery qualified under \u00a7 46-18-104(2Xa)(i), MCA, as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d That section defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a \u201ccrime in which an offender <em>uses or possesses and threatens to use </em>a deadly weapon during the commission or attempted commission of a crime[.]\u201d Section 46-18-104(2)(aXi), MCA (emphasis added). A \u00a7 46-18-104(2Xa)(i) \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and a \u00a746-23-502(13)(a) \u201cviolent offense\u201d are different terms with different definitions and significances. Specifically, if a person commits a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u2014 which requires the use of a deadly weapon \u2014 he or she no longer may qualify as a nonviolent offender for sentencing purposes and a court therefore need not consider alternatives to imprisonment. Sections 46-18-104(3), -225(1), MCA. Commission of a \u201cviolent offense\u201d \u2014 which does not require the use of a deadly weapon \u2014 determines whether the offender must register under SVORA. Section 46-23-504(1), MCA. The issue here is whether it was proper to require Hanna to register under SVORA. Because Hanna committed a \u201cviolent offense,\u201d it was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b644 We affirm Hanna\u2019s conviction and remand the District Court\u2019s judgment with instructions to enter an amended judgment specifying the total amount of restitution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> Relatedly, Hanna also briefly argues that he could not be charged with a different type of robbery than Burch.
