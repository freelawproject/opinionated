Scott Svee and Megan Svee (Svees) cross-appeal from the Judgment for dismissing their constitutional claims and denying their claim for attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part, and restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by determining that Helena City Code \u00a7 11-42-2 was an impermissible building code, and not a zoning ordinance?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by holding that the Svees were ineligible for an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">\n<em>3. Did the District Court err by failing to address and dismissing the Svees\u2019s constitutional arguments?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">\u00b62 In January 2009, the Helena City Commission adopted an amendment to its existing zoning ordinance, \u00a7 11-41-1 of the Helena City Code, which created a wildland-urban interface district (WUI district) encompassing the corporate limits of the city of Helena and overlaying the City\u2019s other zoning districts. As part thereof, the City also adopted \u00a7 11-41-2, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgN\">A Structures located within the wildland-urban interface district may not have exposed, wooden roofing materials, whether treated or untreated, and must have noncombustible or fire resistant roofing materials that are rated Class C or higher in accordance with ANSI/UL 790 or ASTM E 108 or any equivalent test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>B. Existing roofs that undergo renovation, alteration, or repairs that involve more than ten percent (10%) of the square footage of the affected roof plane must meet the requirements of this chapter. If the renovation, alteration, or repair involves more than fifty percent (50%) of the square footage of the area of the entire roof, then the entire roof must comply with the requirements of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Helena, Mont., City Code \u00a7 11-41-2. The challenge in this case is made only to \u00a7 11-41-2, and the limitations it places on roofing materials, not to the creation of the WUI district itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b63 The Svees are homeowners whose property is situated within the WUI zoning district. After receiving notice that their homeowners insurance policy would be canceled due to the condition of their roof, the Svees, due to personal financial constraints, limited repairs to the portion of the roof most in need of improvement, replacing old wooden shingles on the south plane of the roof with new wooden shingles. The project began on August 12,2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b64 On August 15, 2011, a city building official observed the Svees\u2019 repair project and issued a stop-work notice. By the time the Svees received the notice, they had finished the roof repair. The City filed criminal complaints against the Svees for re-roofing without a permit, serving them on September 8,2011. Then, on November 7,2011, the Helena City Commission voted to file a civil action against the Svees in addition to pursuing criminal charges. On December 6, 2011, the City filed a six-count complaint against the Svees in the First Judicial District Court, alleging failure to obtain a building permit; violation of the International Residential Code by failing to obtain a building permit; violation of the International Residential Code by installing new roof covering over an existing roof covering; violation of the International Residential code by using excess applications of roof covering; violation of Helena Cfty Code by using illegal roofing materials; and public nuisance. The Svees answered the civil complaint in January 2012 and petitioned the District Court for a declaratory judgment that the Ordinance was invalid on statutory and constitutional grounds. On February 13, 2012, the criminal charges were dismissed on the motion of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b65 Svees moved for summary judgment on their Petition for Declaratory Judgment and the City countered by moving for summary judgment while simultaneously withdrawing five of the counts alleged in its complaint, leaving only the count alleging violation of the Ordinance. The parties agreed that there were no genuine issues of material fact, and that the validity of \u00a7 11-41-2 was a question of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Based on a statutory analysis, the District Court denied the City\u2019s motion and granted the Svees\u2019, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">[WJhen the plain language of the statutes are applied in conjunction with one another, the Court concludes that the logical conclusion is that \u00a7 11-41-2 is a building regulation, i.e., an ordinance relating to the design, construction, alternation, or repair of buildings, and the materials to be used therefor.... The statute does not authorize the City to adopt building regulations under the guise of a zoning ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The court did not address the constitutional claims raised by the Svees. \u00b66 On October 25,2013, the District Court entered a final Judgment, declaring \u201cthe Svees\u2019 claims seeking a declaration that the City had no legal authority to adopt or enforce Helena City Code \u00a7 11-41-2 ... are GRANTED.\u201d OnNovember 5,2013, the Svees filed a motion requesting attorney fees, which the District Court denied. Subsequently, the City filed a notice of appeal from the judgment invalidating the Ordinance, and the Svees filed a cross-appeal challenging the dismissal of their constitutional arguments and the denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b67 This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by a district court. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates an absence of any genuine issue of material act and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. When no dispute exists as to the material facts, this Court reviews whether the district court correctly applied the law. <em>Kalispell Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>2011 MT 154, \u00b6 9, 361 Mont. 115, 255 P.3d 199. A district court\u2019s ruling on a summary judgment is not a discretionary function that merits deferential review. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 53, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. This Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the existence of legal authority to award attorney fees. <em>Hughes v. Ahlgren, </em>2011 MT 189, \u00b6 10, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439 (citation omitted). If legal authority exists, we review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b68 <em>1. Did the District Court err by determining that Helena City Code \u00a7 11-42-2 was an impermissible building code, and not a zoning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>ordinance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b69 In 1969, Montana adopted a state building code designed to \"provide reasonably uniform standards and requirements for construction and construction materials consistent with accepted standards of design, engineering, and fire prevention practices.\u201d Section 50-60-201(1), MCA. Section 50-60-202, MCA, designates the Department of Labor and Industry as \"the only state agency that may promulgate building regulations....\u201d The Legislature has authorized counties, cities, and towns to locally adopt and enforce only those building codes that have been \"adopted by the department.\u201d Sections 50-60-301(2), MCA; 50-60-302(a), MCA. \"Building regulations\u201d are defined as \"any law, rule, resolution, regulation, ordinance, or code, general or special ... relating to the design, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, repair, inspection, or use of buildings and installation of equipment in buildings.\u201d Section 50-60-101(3Xa), MCA. This definition \"does not include zoning ordinances.\u201d Section 50-60-101(3Xb), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b610 The City interprets the District Court\u2019s order as holding that <em>\u201cthe creation of the WUI zoning district </em>was nothing more than the adoption of \u2018a building regulation!] under the guise of a zoning ordinance,\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added), which the City challenges as error. The City argues that the key issue is \"whether the WUI zoning overlay district is a valid zoning ordinance under Montana law,\u201d and notes that municipalities are authorized, pursuant to their delegated zoning authority, to regulate the height and size of buildings and other structures, \u00a7 76-2-301, MCA, as well as \u201cthe erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of buildings.\u201d Section 76-2-302, MCA. Positing that its WUI district falls squarely within statutorily authorized municipal zoning, the City then cites the qualification within the definition of \"building regulations\u201d in \u00a7 50-60-101(3)(b), MCA, as \u201cnot includ[ing] zoning ordinances,\u201d and reasons that this exclusion eliminates any possible classification of the WUI zoning district as a building code regulation, as well as any conflict with state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b611 The first problem with the City\u2019s overbroad argument, as noted by Svees, is that Svees did not challenge and the District Court did not invalidate the entire WUI zoning district as an impermissible building regulation that conflicted with state law. Bather, they challenged and the District Court invalidated only the portion of the WUI ordinance that regulated building construction materials, that being \u00a7 11-42-2. While the District Court\u2019s decision may have removed the \u201cteeth\u201d of the WUI district as now enacted, the district itself remains valid and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>City is not precluded from exploring other mechanisms to secure fire protections in the district. Thus, the City\u2019s assertion that it is \u201cabsurd\u201d to conclude that the WUI district is not a valid exercise of the City\u2019s zoning authority is falsely premised \u2014 the District Court did not so hold, and that issue is not before us here. The further flaws in the City\u2019s arguments, as discussed below, are that neither the general municipal zoning authority set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 76-2-301, -302, MCA, nor the distinguishing of zoning ordinances within the definition of \u201cbuilding regulations\u201d in \u00a7 50-60-101(3)(b), MCA, supplant the Legislature\u2019s clearly demonstrated intention to occupy this area of the law by enacting a statewide building code and by expressly prohibiting local governments from adopting regulations that deviate from the state code.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b612 The City emphasizes the language of \u00a7 76-2-302, MCA, which authorizes municipalities to \u201cregulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of buildings, structures or land.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the District Court reasoned, on first blush this language appears to support the City\u2019s position, but ultimately fails under further analysis. Section 76-2-302, MCA, clarifies that these powers are granted \u201c[flor the purposes of 76-2-301,\u201d which in turn empowers municipalities to regulate the size, location and use of all structures and land; the size of yards, courts, and other open spaces; and the occupancy on land and density of population. Section 76-2-301, MCA. This statute neither mentions nor authorizes municipalities to regulate building materials that are expressly governed by the state building code. The exclusion of zoning ordinances from the definition of \u201cbuilding regulations\u201d in \u00a7 50-60-101(3)0)), MCA, simply distinguishes zoning ordinances that properly regulate structures within the sphere of authority provided by \u00a7 76-2-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b613 The City next argues that \u00a7 11- 41-2 is a valid ordinance under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Virginia City v. Estate of Olsen, </em>2009 MT 3, 348 Mont. 279, 201 P.3d 115. There, a homeowner challenged building requirements imposed by two building permits issued pursuant to Virginia City\u2019s zoning ordinances, including its Design Review Zoning Ordinance, by which the City regulated construction to ensure consistency with the City\u2019s historic character. <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 9-10. The ordinance regulated such matters as \u201csetback distances, height, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>window size and placement, and general structure.\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 9. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s rejection of the homeowner\u2019s challenge to the requirements of the building permits and entry of summary judgment against the homeowner. <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 23, 25. The City reasons that, if ordinances may be legitimately enacted to \u201cregulate such things as \u2018window size and placement\u2019... then the City of Helena can legitimately regulate the use of structures with wooden roofing materials through the very same municipal zoning authorities for the safety of life and property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b614 Svees correctly argue that our holding in <em>Virginia City </em>concerned the homeowner\u2019s failure to adhere to the terms of the building permits, not the propriety of the zoning ordinances. We explained that the parties had agreed that the permits controlled the issues before the Court, that \u201cto the extent that any requirement in the permits and accompanying documents is at variance with the provisions of Ordinance 503 or other City ordinances, the provisions of the permits control,\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 17, and thus \u201cDefendants\u2019 counterclaims and arguments relating to the validity and enforceability of the ordinances have no bearing on whether the City may enforce the terms of the permits.\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 37. Consequently, we did not address the validity of the subject ordinances in <em>Virginia City. </em>It is further notable that the actual building issues resolved in that case involved setback and structural requirements, which are zoning-related questions not at issue here. <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b615 The Svees note that two attorney general opinions are consistent with the District Court\u2019s holding. In 40 Attorney General Opinion 76, the Attorney General concluded that the enactment of the state building code in 1969 effectively repealed \u00a7 7-33-4203, MCA, which granted local governments the power to regulate the construction of combustible buildings, opining that \u201cthe authority to adopt rules for the construction of all buildings was vested in the state under [Montana law]. These provisions leave no room for a local government to prescribe rules dealing with building construction.\u201d 40 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 3; <em>see also </em>Opinion No. 81, 37 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 2 (1977). The Legislature thereafter agreed, subsequently repealing \u00a7 7-33-4203, MCA. Sec. 156, Ch. 370, L. 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b616  Section 7-1-113(1), MCA, provides \u201c[a] local government with self-government powers is prohibited the exercise of any power in any manner inconsistent with state law or administrative regulation in areas of law affirmatively subjected by law to state regulation or control.\u201d Section 11-41-2 of the Helena City Code expressly limits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>materials that may be used in the construction or repair of a building. The Ordinance thus exceeds the zoning authority granted to municipalities by statute and trespasses into subject matter that had been made the exclusive domain of the Department of Labor and Industry by the Legislature. The District Court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Svees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b617 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding the Svees viere ineligible for an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b618 As a general rule, attorney fees are considered to be the burden of the respective litigants in a case. Montana follows the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d which provides that, absent statutory or contractual authority, attorney fees will not be awarded to the prevailing parly in a lawsuit. <em>Western Tradition P\u2019ship, Inc. v. Att\u2019y Gen. of Mont., </em>2012 MT 271, \u00b6 9, 367 Mont. 112, 291 P.3d 545. We have recognized equitable exceptions to this rule, but construe them narrowly \u201clest they swallow the rule.\u201d <em>Trustees oflnd. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663; <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 23, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. We have rejected the expansion of such equitable exceptions when the effect would \u201cdrive a stake into the heart of the American Rule.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brewer, </em>2003 MT 98, \u00b6 40, 315 Mont. 231, 69 P.3d 652).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b619  Svees moved for recoveiy of costs and attorney fees in the District Court on three bases: 1) The supplemental relief provision of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA); 2) \u00a7 25-10-711(1), MCA (relating to recovery from a governmental entity when a suit or defense was frivolous or in bad faith); and 3) the <em>Foy </em>exception to the American Rule. The District Court denied relief on all three grounds. We conclude Svees are entitled to attorney fees under the UDJA, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>address that single basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b620 As we explained in <em>United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 38, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260, the threshold question for an award of attorney fees is \"whether the equities support an award.\u201d One of these equitable considerations is whether the parties are similarly situated. In <em>United Nafl, </em>we reasoned that because the parties were similarly situated, the equities did not support an award of attorney fees. <em>United Nat'l, </em>\u00b6 39. Similarly, in <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6 46, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230, we held the equities did not support an award of attorney fees where the subject action involved partnership agreements entered into by sophisticated and well-informed parties dealing with one another on equal footing. Likewise, in <em>Ahlgren, </em>\u00b6 19 and <em>New Hope Lutheran Ministry v. Faith Lutheran Church of Great Falls, Inc., </em>2014 MT 69, \u00b6 76,374 Mont. 229,328 P.3d 586, we denied attorney fees because the parties to the cases were situated in similar positions and on equal footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b621 The case here is distinguishable from those noted above in that the parties here are clearly not similarly situated or on equal footing. The Svees sought to accomplish a low-cost repair of their roof in response to a notice from their insurance company about cancellation of their coverage. By so doing, they were named as defendants in both criminal and civil actions filed by the municipal government, in comparison to whom they had significantly less resources to litigate the alleged violation of the ordinance. As such, the equitable threshold consideration is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b622 The next step is to apply the tangible parameters test articulated in <em>Buxbaum. </em>There, this Court recognized the propriety of an attorney fee award in declaratory judgment actions. We held that district courts possess authority to award attorney fees under the supplemental relief provisions of the UDJA as \u201cnecessaiy or proper.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 46. We stated that while supplemental relief provisions are typically provided in the context of an insurer/insured relationship, \"we need not limit application\u201d to that arrangement. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 42. Noting that the \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d language is nebulous, we adopted an analytical framework from the Ohio Court of Appeals to articulate tangible parameters for trial courts to use when analyzing this issue. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 43. These parameters contemplated a situation in which the \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d requirement would be satisfied. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 44. We restated those tangible parameters in <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>as situations in which: 1) an insurance company possesses what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the plaintiffs sought in the declaratory relief action; 2) it is necessary to seek a declaration showing the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought; and 3) the declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to change the status quo. 2004 MT 366, \u00b6 27, 324 Mont. 509,105 P.3d 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b623 The District Court concluded that Svees were not entitled to attorney fees, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">The firstfactor of the tangible parameters test does not apply here because there is no insurer or self-insurer involved. Further, a declaratory judgment action was the procedural course chosen by the Svees, who could have opted to litigate their position in the context of the suit filed by the City. A declaratory judgment action was not necessary to address the validity of the ordinance ... . Svees\u2019 decision to litigate the validity of the ordinance through the UDJA does not entitle them to attorney fees per se. If such were the case, attorney fees should arguably be awarded in every declaratory judgment action challenging a government action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6N\">\u00b624 Contrary to the District Court\u2019s reasoning, we stated in <em>Buxbaum, </em>as noted above, that we did not intend to define the exclusive circumstances that would justify an award, specifically, to only the insurance context. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 42. <em>Buxbaum </em>was limited in this regard, describing but one instance in which attorney fees are \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d under the terms of the UDJA. The court\u2019s conclusion that the first prong of the tangible parameters could not be met because it was inapplicable was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b625 With respect to the second prong of the test, we conclude that a declaratory action was necessary. At the instance of notice from their insurer, Svees undertook a small project to replace damaged wooden shingles on their roof, and limited the scope of their repairs due to personal financial constraints. As a result, the Svees found themselves defending legal actions brought by the City, first a criminal action and then a six-count civil action, resulting in three years of litigation and the incurrence of substantial legal fees by Svees. While the District Court reasoned that the Svees could have opted to litigate within the context of the legal action initiated by the City, it was both appropriate and necessary for the Svees to file a declaratory action to get to the root of the City\u2019s multiple claims \u2014 the validity of the ordinance itself, from which the City drew its authority. A declaratory action solely challenging the ordinance was the quickest and most direct path to resolution and relief, in light of the City\u2019s multiple enforcement actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b626 The final prong of the test is satisfied when a declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>judgment action is necessaxy to change the status quo. Here, the city initiated legal proceedings based upon the \"status quo\u201d \u2014 the enacted ordinance. In order to change the status quo, Svees initiated this action to challenge the validity of the ordinance. In <em>Martin v. SAIF Corp., </em>2007 MT 234, \u00b6 27, 339 Mont. 167, 167 P.3d 916, we held that attorney fees in favor of SAIF were inappropriate because the declaratory action at issue failed to change the status quo with respect to SAIF. There, the Oregon Worker's Compensation Board (Board) had determined SAIF (a state-chartered worker\u2019s compensation insurance company) was entitled to a share of Martin\u2019s third-party tort action award as subrogation for benefits paid to Martin following an accident. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 7. Because SAIF was already entitled to its portion of the tort settlement per the Board\u2019s decision, it was not necessary for SAIF to seek a declaration from the Montana court in order to change the status quo, and, thus, the third prong of the tangible parameters test was not met. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 27. Unlike the situation in <em>Martin, </em>Svees did not initiate this action to enforce the status quo, but rather sought to alter it. The third prong of the tangible parameters test is thus satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b627 Because the equitable considerations merit an award of attorney fees and the Svees have satisfied the tangible parameters test, we conclude it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny an award of attorney fees. While \u00a7 11-41-2 has been found invalid, the Svees have technically prevailed but are left only with a legally patched roof and significant legal bills. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to deny attorney fees and remand for proceedings to determine the appropriate amount of fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b628 <em>3. Did. the District Court err when denying and dismissing the Svees\u2019s constitutional arguments?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b629 The Svees made several constitutional claims for relief within their motion for summary judgment, which the District Court dismissed. The District Court stated that it would be \"inappropriate... to address or resolve any constitutional challenges\u201d because the order granting summary judgment in favor of the Svees effectively \u201cresolve[d] the case in the Svees\u2019 favor on non-constitutional grounds.\u201d \u00b630 Svees cross-appeal the denial and dismissal of those claims, but acknowledge in tkeir briefing that, if the District Court\u2019s order is affirmed, then it is unnecessary for this Court to address their constitutional claims. This Court has repeatedly recognized that courts should avoid constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>Merlin Myers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Revocable Trust v.

Applying the deferential standard of review accorded the trial court in such matters, and consistent with settled precedent under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, I would conclude that the District Court\u2019s denial of fees was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b633 Before the District Court, the Svees sought fees on three grounds: first, that the City\u2019s action was frivolous or brought in bad faith, justifying a fee award under \u00a7 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA; second, that they were entitled to fees under the equitable exception to the American Rule established in <em>Foy v. Anderson, </em>176 Mont. 507, 580 P.2d 114 (1978); and third, that fees are \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d as supplemental relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. The District Court analyzed and denied relief on all three grounds. The Svees appeal only the court\u2019s third ruling. They do not challenge the court\u2019s determination that the City acted in good faith in its attempt to enforce the ordinance, nor do they take issue with the court\u2019s conclusion that the Svees were not \u201cforced to hire an attorney to defend an action that is frivolous or utterly without merit,\u201d as required by Foy. <em>DeVoe v. City of Missoula, </em>2012 MT 72, \u00b6 25, 364 Mont. 375, 274 P.3d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\u00b634 In denying relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, the District Court noted that the case began as an enforcement action by the Cily and that the validity of the ordinance could have been challenged and resolved in that enforcement action. Thus, the Svees were not compelled \u201cto litigate the validity of the ordinance through the UBJA\u201d and their decision to do so \u201cdoes not entitle them to attorney fees per se.\u201d The District Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the City has an obligation to enforce its ordinances and in this instance it was seeking to do just that.\u201d The court observed that the City had made efforts to \u201csecure an expeditious district court resolution of the matter\u201d and that the issue was \u201cresolved short of trial by briefs and a single oral argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\u00b635 Our precedent is clear that \u201cequitable considerations\u201d are a \u201cthreshold determination\u201d in a claim that fees are \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d in a declaratory judgment action. W. <em>Tradition F\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 12. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>identified in <em>Buxbaum </em>additional \u201ctangible parameters\u201d for a court to consider once that threshold standard is met. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 43. Although the Court points out that the award of fees is not limited to the insurance context (Opinion, \u00b6 24), that is only the first component of the tangible parameters consideration. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 27. The Court\u2019s analysis falls short in attempting to satisfy the other two factors \u2014 whether a declaratory judgment action was necessary to establish the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to relief and whether declaratory relief was necessary in order to change the status quo. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 27. The District Court addressed these points directly, observing that the pursuit of a declaratory judgment was not \u201cnecessary\u201d in order for the Svees to obtain relief, because the question was placed at issue by the City\u2019s enforcement action. The District Court\u2019s decision is faithM to the tangible parameters analysis articulated in <em>Buxbaum: </em>fees are \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d only \u201cwhen no other alternative was available\u201d for a plaintiff to obtain relief except to seek a declaratory judgment. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 44 (quoting <em>McConnell v. Hunt Sports Ent., 725 </em>N.E.2d 1193, 1225 (Ohio Ct. App. 1999)). In <em>Buxbaum, </em>we quoted the Ohio court\u2019s examples of why declaratory relief was \u201cnecessary\u201d in those cases to obtain relief or change the status quo: \u201cwithout a declaration, the insureds in <em>Brandenburg </em>would not have coverage under their insurance policy and the plaintiffs in <em>Culberson </em>would have a cloud on their title.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 44 (quoting <em>McConnell, 725 </em>N.E.2d at 1225). Here, in contrast, without the Svees\u2019 counter-petition for declaratory judgment, the City\u2019s complaint still would have been litigated, the ordinance still would have been found invalid, and the Svees still would have a \u201clegally patched roof and presumably \u201csignificant legal bills\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 27. Although the counter-petition may have served to focus the litigation, a plaintiffs \u201ctactical\u201d decision to seek a declaratory judgment, even though it \u201cmay have proved resourceful,\u201d does not \u201cequal necessary or proper as contemplated by the statute.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 45 (quoting <em>McConnell, 725 </em>N.E.2d at 1225).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b636 As we noted just last year, \u201conly once have we upheld an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory relief action under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA.\u201d <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Hanke, </em>2013 MT 320, \u00b6 35, 372 Mont. 350, 312 P.3d 429. That single occasion occurred <em>inRenville, </em>which we described in <em>Hanke </em>as an \u201coutlier\u201d with \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Hanke, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36, 38. The District Court found no such extreme situation here, distinguishing another district court decision where fees were awarded against a county under \u201cegregious circumstances.\u201d The Court does not find clear error in the District Court\u2019s specific findings that this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>does not involve the \u201cburdensome procedural history involved in <em>Renville\u201d </em>or that the City\u2019s \u201csimply disjointed case management decisions\u201d did not amount to lack of good faith. Though it bemoans the fact that \u201cthree years of litigation\u201d were consumed in getting the case resolved, the record shows that less than a year and a half transpired from the date the City\u2019s complaint was filed to the date of the District Court\u2019s summaiy judgment order. The District Court determined that this case involved a good faith legal dispute over the validity of a municipal ordinance, noting that, like a state statute, it is \u201cpresumed valid unless a court determines otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b637 We criticized the District Court in <em>Martin </em>for \u201cfocus[ing] on the fact that SAIF ultimately prevailed in the litigation rather than thoroughly articulating why an award of attorney fees to SAIF would be \u2018necessary and proper.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting Renville, \u00b6 27. The Court\u2019s decision today suffers the same flaw. Its analysis is insufficient to support a conclusion that the District Court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason when it ruled that it was not \u201cnecessary\u201d for the Svees to seek a declaratory judgment in order to obtain relief from the City\u2019s enforcement of its ordinance. As the District Court rightly observed, if fees were awarded here, \u201cattorney fees should arguably be awarded in every declaratory judgment action challenging a government enactment.\u201d The court recognized that a private citizen opposing the government\u2019s good faith attempt to enforce its regulations most likely will incur expense and delay. The court was within its discretion to determine that this case did not present the rare exception that justified a fee award. <em>See also Wagner v. Woodward, </em>2012 MT 19, \u00b6 81, 363 Mont. 403, 270 P.3d 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b638 The decision to award fees in this case eviscerates the requirement that a declaratory judgment action be \u201cnecessary\u201d in order for a party to obtain relief. Further, it disregards \u00a7 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA, which we have acknowledged is a statutory \u201cguidepost\u201d to award fees against a governmental entity based on considerations of bad faith or frivolous litigation. W. <em>Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 18. More, the Court appears to create an equitable exception to the American Rule broader than that recognized under <em>Foy, </em>which reserves an award of fees for \u201crare instances and only when a party has been forced to defend against a wholly frivolous or malicious action.\u201d <em>Boehm v. Cokedale, LLC, </em>2011 MT 224, \u00b6 27, 362 Mont. 65, 261 P.3d 994 (citing Estofe <em>of Pruyn v. Axmen Propane, Inc., </em>2009 MT 448, \u00b6 72,354 Mont. 208, 223 P.3d 845). Today\u2019s decision appears to require only that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>reviewing court\u2019s view, the equities of the case support awarding fees to a citizen who incurs \u201csignificant legal bills\u201d in a successful challenge to a governmental regulation. Opinion, \u00b6 27. This conclusion not only departs from our established course in restricting the scope of exceptions to the American Buie, but charts a new path for obtaining fees against a governmental entity seeking to enforce its regulations. \u00b639 I would affirm entirely the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
