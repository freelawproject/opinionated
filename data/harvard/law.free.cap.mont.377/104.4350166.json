The Defendant was sentenced for Count VI: Theft, a felony, in violation of Section 45-6-301, MCA, committed to the Department of Corrections for a term of Ten (10) years with Ten (10) years suspended; Defendant shall receive credit for time served in the amount of 8 days and shall be given credit for street time.

The Defendant was sentenced for Count IV: Criminal Mischief, a felony, in violation of Section 45-6-101, MCA, to Department of Corrections for a term of Ten years with Five (5) years suspended.

The Defendant was represented by Ed Sheehy, Jr., Montana Office of PublicDefender. The State was not represented:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Before hearing the Application, the Defendant was advised that the Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Rule 12, Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana, provides that, \"The sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct. The sentence shall not be reduced or increased unless it is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Division that the sentence shall be AFFIRMED. The Defendant presented to the Division an argument of factual error between the Judgments entered by Judge Townsend in the Missoula County District Court in this case. Specifically, a discrepancy between sentences for crimes of Count IV Criminal Mischief, a felony; and Count VI Theft, a felony. In the original Judgment the Defendant was sentenced for Count IV, Criminal Mischief, a felony. In the Judgment given January 29, 2013, (Judgment reviewed by the Division) the Defendant was sentenced for Count VI, Theft, a felony. The Division informs the Defendant that as a remedy, she can ask the District Court to review this at any time to determine if a factual error has been made, pursuant to Section 46-18-116, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Done in open Court this 26th day of September, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b577-15\">Chairperson, Hon.
