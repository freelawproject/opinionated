When Northland appealed before, we remanded the case to the Seventh Judicial District Court to consider the applicability of \u00a7 72-3-618, MCA <em>Northland Royalty Corp. v. Engel, </em>No. DA 11-0467, Order (Mont. Apr. 10, 2012). Northland subsequently moved for summary judgment on the basis of that statute and now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion. The issue we address is whether the District Court erred in denying summary judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u00b62 This case concerns mineral rights that have passed through three wills and were purchased by Northland. The minerals are located in North Dakota and in Richland County, Montana, but only the Montana minerals are before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">\u00b63 In the first will, Charlotte C. Nohle, who died in 1957, left the mineral rights to her sister, Victoria F. Davis. In the second will, Davis, who died in 1976, left the mineral rights to her daughter, Helen Jaumotte, and also designated Helen as her estate\u2019s personal representative. In the third will, Helen, who died in 1991, left the \"use and enjoyment of the income from the mineral interests\u201d to her husband Jay Jaumotte. Helen farther directed that \u201c[u]pon [Jay\u2019s] death, those mineral interests and the use and enjoyment thereof revert to the issue of Charlotte C. Nohle, in keeping with her Will, specifically to Floyd A. Engel, Mrs. Ella Steinbeck, Mrs. Dorothy Freeman, and Mrs. Cecil Baxter, and each of their issue by representation.\u201d Finally, in her will, Helen designated Jay as her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>estate\u2019s personal representative. Defendants and Appellees [Devisees] are \u201cthe issue of Charlotte C. Nohle\u201d referenced in Helen\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b64 Soon after Helen died in 1991, Jay initiated informal probate proceedings on Helen\u2019s will in Yavapai County, Arizona, and received letters appointing him personal representative of Helen\u2019s estate. In April 1992, Jay received letters appointing him as the successor personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate. In May 1992, Jay swore in a closing statement that Helen\u2019s estate had been fiilly administered, but Jay\u2019s attorney did not file that statement with Yavapai County until 1999. A closing statement for the Davis estate was not filed untU 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">\u00b65 Richard Keller, president and sole shareholder of Northland Royalty Corporation and a landman by profession, became interested in the minerals. Through examining documents relating to the minerals and the Davis estate appointment letters, Keller knew that Jay was the personal representative of Davis\u2019s estate. In 1997, when Keller contacted Jay about purchasing the rights to the minerals, Jay represented that he also was the personal representative of Helen\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b66 Before purchasing the mineral rights, Keller sought additional documents relating to Helen\u2019s estate and the minerals. Keller did not know that Helen\u2019s estate was probated in Yavapai County. As a result, in attempting to examine Helen\u2019s estate documents, Keller contacted Richland County, Montana, and Maricopa County, Arizona (where Jay was residing). Keller failed to find Helen\u2019s estate documents in either of those two counties. Also, in the spring of 1997, Keller checked the title on the North Dakota minerals. In August 1997, three of the Devisees recorded ratifications of an oil and gas lease on some of the North Dakota minerals. Keller admitted in court that these ratifications would have suggested to him that the minerals were held in a life estate, but testified that he did not see the ratifications because they were not of record when he examined the title earlier that year. When Northland purchased the minerals in August 1998, Northland acquired \u201c100% of the remaining interests as acquired by Victoria F. Davis from the Estate of Charlotte C. Nohle\u201d for $15,010. Jay deeded the minerals \u201cindividually, as Personal Representative of the estate of Helen Jaumotte and as sole Successor Personal Representative of the Will and Estate of Victoria F. Davis.\u201d Jay died in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b67 After purchasing the mineral rights, Northland negotiated a deal to lease the rights to a third party, but the deal collapsed in 2005 due to problems with Northland\u2019s title. In 2007, Northland brought a quiet title action naming Devisees as defendants. Devisees counterclaimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and, in 2011, the Seventh Judicial District Court quieted title in their favor. Northland appealed to this Court, and we remanded to the District Court to consider the applicability of \u00a7 72-3-618, MCA. Northland moved for summary judgment, arguing that the statute offered Northland protection against Devisees\u2019 claims to the minerals. The District Court denied summary judgment on this issue because it concluded that Northland failed to act in good faith as required by the statute. Northland appeals that portion of the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bailey v. St. Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(e); <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>City of Missoula v. Iosefo, </em>2014 MT 209, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 161, 330 P.3d 1180 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b69 In 1974, Montana adopted a version of the Uniform Probate Code [UPC]. Section 72-1-101, MCA. Under the UPC, an estate\u2019s administrator is called a personal representative. Section72-1-103(45), MCA. If a personal representative improperly exercises his or her power in administering an estate, the personal representative is liable to the estate\u2019s beneficiaries. Section 72-3-616(1), MCA. Thus, under that provision of the UPC, if a personal representative improperly disposes of estate property, beneficiaries have a remedy directly against the personal representative. By contrast, under \u00a7 72-3-618, MCA, the rights of the third-party purchaser may be protected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">A person who in good faith and without notice either assists a personal representative or deals with a personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised the personal representative\u2019s power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise. Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives that are endorsed on letters as provided in 72-3-404(3), a provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>effective except as to persons with actual knowledge of the provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Section 72-3-618(1), MCA. By providing protection to persons dealing with personal representatives, the UPC seeks to \u201cavoid the need of obtaining doubt-ending court orders in routine probate administrations\u201d that would cut against the UPC\u2019s \u201cflexible system of administration.\u201d <em>Uniform Probate Code Practice Manual </em>319 (Richard V. Wellman ed., 2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b610 To determine whether Northland dealt with a personal representative \u201cin good faith and without notice\u201d under \u00a7 72-3-618(1), MCA, Devisees suggest using the standard for good faith we adopted in <em>Luloff v. Blackburn, </em>274 Mont. 64, 69, 906 P.2d 189, 191 (1995). There, we examined Montana\u2019s race-notice statute, \u00a7 70-21-304, MCA, and equated \u201cgood faith\u201d under that statute with the standard for a bona-fide purchaser: \u201cone who... purchases in the honest belief that his vendor has a right to sell, without notice, actual or constructive^] of any adverse rights, claims, interest, or equities of others in and to the property <em>sold.\" </em>Luloff, 274 Mont. at 69 (quoting Foster <em>v. Winstanley, </em>39 Mont. 314, 316, 102 P. 574, 579 (1909)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b611 We decline to define \u201cgood faith and without notice\u201d as used in \u00a7 72-3-618, MCA, to require a purchaser\u2019s \u201chonest belief... without [actual or constructive] notice\u201d regarding other parties\u2019 interests in the property. <em>Foster, </em>39 Mont. at 316, 102 P. at 579. Such a rule does not fit in the context of dealings with a personal representative. Estate devisees take devised property \u201csubject to\u201d the estate\u2019s administration, \u00a7 72-3-101(2), MCA, and a personal representative has the power to sell estate property if necessaxy for the estate\u2019s administration. Sections 72-3-606(1), -613(6), MCA. By the plain language of these statutes, a personal representative has the power to sell property within the estate, even if that property is specifically devised in the will. <em>Green v. Gustafson, </em>482 N.W.2d 842, 846 n.3 (N.D. 1992) (interpreting the UPC to permit a personal representative to sell estate property regardless of whether the property was devised in a will); <em>contra In re Estate of Olson, </em>744 N.W.2d 555, 561 (S.D. 2008) (holding that, outside certain exceptions, a specific devise restricts a personal representative\u2019s power of sale under the UPC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, although the District Court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the North Dakota ratifications provided Northland notice that other parties had interests in the minerals, the ratifications did not provide notice of a restriction on the \u201cpower of [the] personal representative\u201d as required by \u00a7 72-3-618(1), MCA, and are therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b612 Further, \u00a7 72-3-618(1), MCA, \u201cexplicitly excuse[s] [purchasers] from examining the terms of the will, court records relating to the appointment, or other sources that might be relevant to the question of whether the sale is proper as between the fiduciary and those entitled to the inheritance.\u201d <em>Uniform Probate Code Practice Manual </em>407. Because \u00a7 72-3-618(1), MCA, relieves a purchaser from having to inquire into the specific language of a will, the District Court erred by concluding that Keller failed to act in good faith by failing to locate Helen\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b613  What the statute\u2019s good faith and notice requirements do encompass is whether a purchaser in good faith believes that the \u201cvendor has a right to sell\u201d by virtue of being an estate\u2019s personal representative. Foster, 39 Mont. at 316, 102 P. at 579. \u201cIn the ordinary case... a [purchaser] would only need to see that the letters were issued and in effect when a personal representative gave a deed to purchaser.\u201d 3 Patton &amp; Palomar on Land Titles \u00a7 521 (3d ed. 2003). While Keller may not have obtained such independent verification here, there is no dispute that, at the time that the transaction occurred, Helen\u2019s estate was open, Jay was the estate\u2019s personal representative, there were no restrictions placed in Jay\u2019s letters of appointment, and Keller had no actual knowledge of any restrictions on Jay\u2019s authority. We thus hold that \u00a7 72-3-618, MCA, protects Northland\u2019s purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b614 We reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying summary judgment and remand for entry of judgment in Northland\u2019s favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> The dissent in <em>Olson </em>pointed out that, because the UPC makes a personal representative\u2019s power of sale statutory, testators must \u201cdraft their wills to explicitly limit, restrict, or eliminate this power of sale if that is their intent.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>744 N.W.2d at 577 (Zinter, J., dissenting). In a subsequent appeal in the same underlying case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>South Dakota Supreme Court held that the third-party purchaser of the estate\u2019s property acted in good faith under South Dakota\u2019s equivalent to \u00a7 72-3-618, MCA, despite purchasing specifically devised property from the personal representative. <em>Muhlbauer v.
