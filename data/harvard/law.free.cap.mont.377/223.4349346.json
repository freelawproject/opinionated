We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b62 S.L. raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the \u201cdeterioration standard\u201d contained in \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(d), MCA, is unconstitutional.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">\n<em>2.

Whether \u00a753-21-127(2), MCA, requires a separate dispositional hearing to he held upon the request of the Respondent.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">\u00b63 S.L. is a 42-year-old female who moved from the state of Maine to Montana in the early part of 2013. The record establishes that on June 6, 2013, S.L. was brought to the Kalispell Regional Medical Center (KRMC) emergency room by a friend. S.L. reported to the attending physician that she had \u201caccidently\u201d overdosed on 50 tablets of Valium and 20 tablets of Meclizine. S.L. initially denied any suicidal intent. However, when her boyfriend arrived and was allowed into her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>examination room, S.L. told him in the nurse\u2019s presence that she had intended to take her life, she felt hopeless, and would continue to try to take her life until she was successful. After her boyfriend left the hospital, she wanted to call the police to report that her boyfriend had stolen her car, wallet, and money. S.L. then attempted to leave KRMC emergency room against medical advice. Hospital security was called in to assist in detaining S.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b64 Certified Mental Health Person Annette Darkenwald (Darkenwald) conducted an interview of S.L. Darkenwald observed that S.L. was groggy, disoriented, and evasive in answering questions. S.L. denied any suicidal intent and stated that she suffered a traumatic brain injury in 1996, which left her with \u201cseveral physcial [sic] issues.\" Darkenwald determined that S.L. should be detained based upon the amount of ingested medications and S.L.\u2019s need of medical stabilization. S.L. was later transferred to Pathways Treatment Center (Pathways)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Kalispell, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b65 On June 10, 2013, the State filed a Petition for Involuntary Commitment. Before the involuntary commitment hearing, however, the State dismissed the petition after it was determined that S.L. no longer met the involuntary commitment criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b66 On September 27, 2013, S.L. arrived at KRMC emergency room by ambulance. According to the report by Certified Mental Health Person Camalla Larson (Larson), S.L. had calledher case manager and reported that she had ingested \u201cher whole pill box in an attempt to end her life.\" The case manager then called 9-1-1 and an ambulance transported S.L. to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b67 Once medically stable, S.L. was interviewed by Larson. S.L. admitted that she had taken two weeks and three days\u2019 worth of her medication and was trying to end her life; however, she indicated that she was no longer suicidal. Larson reported that the previous day S.L. had been seen by a mental health professional, \u201cconvincingly denied\" being suicidal, and was discharged. Larson indicated that since June 2013, S.L. had six psychiatric hospitalizations, including three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>admissions to Western Montana Mental Health Center (WMMHC)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and three admissions to Pathways. Larson concluded that S.L. was an imminent risk of harming herself. She opined that the Montana State Hospital (MSH) in Warm Springs, Montana, was the least restrictive environment because the local community mental health services had failed to stabilize S.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b68 On September 27, 2013, the State a filed a Petition for Involuntary Commitment. The District Court conducted an adjudicatory hearing on October 7,2013, after granting S.L.\u2019s request to be examined by a professional person of her choice. At the hearing, the State elicited testimony from one medical professional and one licensed clinical professional counselor. One medical professional testified on S.L.\u2019s behalf and S.L. also testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b69 On behalf of the State, Dr. Joseph Boyle, a licensed psychiatrist in Montana, appeared telephonically and testified that he first met S.L. at Pathways in September 2013, and visited with her almost daily during her admission. He observed that she had prominent mood symptoms, severe psychosocial circumstances, and interpersonal difficulties. Dr. Boyle diagnosed S.L. with mood disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury and Axis II, dependent personality disorder stating that \"there is a relationship between the brain iiyury and moot [sic] symptoms.\u201d He also stated that her hospitalization record indicated that she had a history of post-traumatic stress disorder. \u00b610 Based upon her behavior preceding admission, Dr. Boyle concluded that S.L. was an imminent threat to herself and would have difficulty protecting her own health. As to the prospect of imminent harm, Dr. Boyle explained that \"it could be as soon as immediately,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s not a hundred percent.\u201d Dr. Boyle also stated that if left untreated her disorder could result in mental deterioration. He recommended S.L. be transferred to MSH as the least restrictive treatment option.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b611 The State also called Blake Passmore (Passmore), a licensed clinical professional counselor and a certified mental health professional, who works as a therapist at Pathways. Passmore testified regarding the circumstances surrounding S.L.\u2019s previous admissions to Pathways. Passmore was involved in S.L.\u2019s June 6, 2013 intake when S.L. had ingested Valium and Meclizine tablets, as well as on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>June 23, 2013, when S.L. was admitted to Pathways for \u201csuicidal ideation with a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b612 Passmore concurred with Dr. Boyle\u2019s diagnosis that S.L. suffers from mood disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury and dependent personality disorder. He also stated that S.L.\u2019s history over the previous three months demonstrated that she was a threat to herself \u2014 noting that following prior discharges she had quickly called the crisis line to convey that she was suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b613 Passmore believed that S.L. had the ability to care for her basic needs, but her dependent personality put her at risk of feeling \u201ccaught up\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d leading her to \u201cdo almost anything... to escape, such as overdose.\u201d Passmore recommended that she be transferred to MSH, noting that no other community resources were available as S.L. had lost placement at Samaritan House and A Ray of Hope, and neither The Abbie Shelter nor The Safe House would accept her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the threat of imminent harm, Passmore testified that S.L. had quickly decompensated in the past and was likely to make another overdose attempt and become suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b614 Dr. Dustin Sulak, an osteopathic physician licensed in Maine, appeared telephonically and testified on behalf of S.L. Dr. Sulak first met S.L. in 2010 and had maintained periodic communication with her since she moved to Montana. He was aware of her medical history, including her traumatic brain injury and her numerous admissions to Acadia Mental Health Hospital in Maine. Dr. Sulak was also familiar with S.L.\u2019s medications, including antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers, seizure medications, antidepressants, stimulants, benzodiazepine, and sleeping aids, as well as her diagnosis of a mood disorder, a personality disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder by mental health professionals in Maine. Dr. Sulak acknowledged that his general practice does not focus on psychiatric health.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b615 Dr. Sulak testified that S.L. did receive some benefit from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>psychiatric medication; however, he stated that despite mental health interventions she had attempted to commit suicide on five occasions. He opined that non-pharmacological treatments such as neural feedback and other behavioral therapies would likely be the more successful alternative to inpatient psychiatric admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b616 S.L. then testified on her own behalf. S.L. relayed that on the day of her admission, she was kidnapped by her husband on her way to the courthouse to secure a restraining order against him. She stated that her husband forced her to stay in a room at his house and would not allow her to use a telephone or go outside. S.L. believed her only escape option was to overdose on her medication, which would require her husband to call 9-1-1. S.L. claimed she knew that ingesting high doses of seizure medication would not be lethal and that she had no intention of committing suicide. She attributed her behavior to her traumatic brain injury and poor impulse control and indicated that the prior psychiatric hospitalizations in Maine had only worsened her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"AO_G\">\u00b617 Although she did not have the \"most concrete plan\u201d if discharged, S.L. said she would go to Motel 6, get a ride to Missoula from a trusted friend, and then take a bus from Missoula to Maine where she could reunite with her family, therapy dogs, and medical resources. In closing, counsel for S.L. requested that the court hold a separate disposition hearing if it determined she suffered from a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b618 The District Court concluded that S.L. suffered from a mental disorder and ordered a commitment on October 7, 2013. It premised its commitment order on \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c) and (d), MCA, citing evidence establishing that S.L. posed an imminent threat to herself and that S.L.\u2019s mental condition would deteriorate if left untreated. The order of commitment was for a period not to exceed ninety days. The court determined that MSH was the least restrictive treatment alternative. It did not hold a separate disposition hearing. S.L. was unconditionally discharged on October 18, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b619 S.L. now appeals the District Court\u2019s involuntary commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s civil commitment order to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re R.W.K., </em>2013 MT 54, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 193, 297 P.3d 318. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if we are left with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made after reviewing the entire record. <em>In re R.W.K., </em>\u00b6 14. \u201c[W]e must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of A.S.B., </em>2008 MT 82, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 169, 180 P.3d 625 (citation omitted). \u201cWe normally defer to a district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility and evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>In re C.R., </em>2012 MT 258, \u00b6 18, 367 Mont. 1, 289 P.3d 125 (quoting <em>In re G.M., </em>2008 MT 200, \u00b6 38, 344 Mont. 87, 186 P.3d 229). We require \u201cstrict adherence\u201d to the statutory scheme governing involuntary commitment due to the \u201ccritical importance,\u201d of the constitutional rights at stake. <em>In re C.R., </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting/n <em>re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100).</p>\n<p id=\"AWP\">\u00b621  An appeal from an order of involuntary commitment is not moot despite the appellant\u2019s release, since the issues are capable of repetition, yet otherwise would evade review. <em>In re C.R., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b622 <em>1. Whether the \u201cdeterioration standard* contained in \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(d), MCA, is unconstitutional.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b623 S.L. first argues that the \u201cdeterioration standard\u201d set forth in \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(d), MCA, is unconstitutional. Because we find that the District Court\u2019s involuntary commitment order is supported by alternate and independent grounds, we decline to address S.L.\u2019s constitutionality claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA, (\u201cSatisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter\u201d). We have repeatedly observed that courts should avoid constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>In re </em>S.H., 2003 MT 366, \u00b6 18, 319 Mont. 90, 86 P.3d 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b624 <em>2. Whether the District Court erroneously committed S.L. to the Montana State Hospital.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\u00b625 S.L. contends that the District Court\u2019s involuntary commitment determination is not supported by sufficient evidence. She maintains that a mental disorder was not proven to a reasonable medical certainty, that she was not an imminent threat to herself, and that MSH was not the least restrictive treatment option.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">\u00b626 In adjudicating a petition for involuntary commitment, a court must first determine whether the individual suffers from a mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>disorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. If there is a finding of a mental disorder, the court must then consider the criteria set forth in \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, to determine whether commitment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b627 Commitment is justified if any one of the following criteria is satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by the respondent\u2019s relevant medical histoiy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA; <em>see </em>\u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA, (\u201cSatisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u00b628  Imminent threat of injury \u201cmust be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant as to the respondent\u2019s present condition.\u201d Section 53-21-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AYb\">\u00b629 The District Court first concluded that S.L. suffered from a mental disorder, citing Dr. Boyle\u2019s testimony that S.L. suffered from a mood disorder secondary to a traumatic brain injury and Axis II, dependent personality disorder \u2014 a diagnosis consistent with S.L.\u2019s history. The District Court noted that Passmore agreed with Dr. Boyle\u2019s conclusions. Further, Dr. Sulak acknowledged that mental health professionals in Maine had also diagnosed S.L. with a mood disorder and a personality disorder. Though Dr. Sulak testified that S.L.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>symptoms are the result of a traumatic brain injury, \u201c[w]e normally defer to a district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility and evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>In re C.R., </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>In re G.M., </em>\u00b6 38). In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude the District Court\u2019s finding of a mental disorder is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b630 Next, the District Court concluded that S.L. presented an imminent threat of self-injury based upon her mental disorders and past suicide attempts. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-126(1)(c), MCA. S.L. disputes having suicidal intent, and maintains there was insufficient evidence to prove that she posed an imminent risk of harm to herself, noting that Dr. Boyle and Passmore could not say with exact precision when she would carry out that threat. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b631 As we have stated, an imminent threat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">[D]oes not mean that a person may possibly cause an injury at some time in the distant or uncertain future. The danger must be fairly immediate. At the same time, the law does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an injury will occur in the future. Threat is not certainly. The law requires only proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the threat of future iqjury presently exists and that the threat is imminent, that is, impending, likely to occur at any moment. If beyond a reasonable doubt there is a present indication of probable physical injury which is likely to occur at any moment or in the immediate future, and if this injury would be a result of a mental disorder, then the person suffering from such mental disorder is seriously mentally ill within the meaning of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\"><em>In re Mental Health of AS.B., </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>In the Matter of F.B., </em>189 Mont. 229, 233, 615 P.2d 867, 869 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b632 There was ample evidence before the District Court that S.L. had committed recent overt acts \u201cmaterial and relevant\u201d to her present condition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-126(2), MCA. The testimony revealed at least seven prior suicide attempts: five in Maine as testified to by Dr. Sulak, and two attempts which led to her admissions into KRMC emergency room on June 6, 2013, and again on September 27, 2013. Additionally, the record showed S.L. had three prior psychiatric admissions to WMMHC and three prior admissions to Pathways, including admittance on June 23, 2013, for having \u201csuicidal ideation with a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u00b633 S.L. does not dispute intentionally overdosing on her medications; rather, she insists that her actions were driven solely by a desire to \u201cescape\u201d an abusive relationship. However, we conclude her behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>supports the imminent threat concerns articulated by Passmore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">1 think history has established over the last three-month period that she gets discharged from a hospital or our safe house, where she\u2019s been numerous times since June, and she presents very quickly calling the Crisis Line saying that she\u2019s suicidal, saying that she can\u2019t handle taking care of whatever situation she\u2019s in, and she becomes so desperate that she begins to make a suicide attempt to get out of [sic] current situation she\u2019s in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">I think we\u2019ve established over the last three months that she quickly decompensates and will require an increased level of care if we were to discharge her today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">I think her dependent personality puts her at risk because of relationships she has with other people where she feels so caught up and so trapped that she\u2019s willing to do almost anything she can do to escape, such as overdose on medications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b634 Passmore went on to state that S.L. would attempt suicide again, but was uncertain whether it would \u201chappen today or in three days, but I can tell you it\u2019s going to.\u201d Dr. Boyle opined that S.L.\u2019s imminent threat to herself \u201ccould be as soon as immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b635  As we have stated, although it need not be certain, the threat of future injury must \u201cpresently exist\u00fc\u201d and be \u201clikely to occur at any moment.\u201d These criteria are clearly met here. <em>See Matter of F.B., </em>189 Mont, at 233, 615 P.2d at 869. We therefore conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence that S.L. posed an imminent threat of self-harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b636  Finally, S.L. argues that the court should have considered outpatient and non-pharmacological therapies in Maine as less restrictive treatment options. S.L. admitted that her plan to stay at a Motel 6, hitching a ride from a friend to Missoula, Montana, and then taking a bus from Missoula to Augusta, Maine, was not \u201cthe most concrete.\u201d We conclude the court did not err in rejecting this vague course of treatment. Further, the District Court correctly found that MSH was the least restrictive treatment option as, undisputedly, all other treatment facilities in Flathead County had been considered but none would accept S.L. Based upon the record before us, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision to commit S.L. to MSH was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b637 <em>3. Whether \u00a753-21-127(2), MCA, requires a separate dispositional hearing to be held upon the request of the Respondent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u00b638 S.L. next challenges the District Court\u2019s decision to immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>proceed with the disposition hearing after finding that S.L. suffered from a mental illness. She relies upon \u00a7 53-21-127(2), MCA, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing... [which] must be held within 5 days ... during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b639  Nothing in the plain language of the statute precludes the court from immediately proceeding to a disposition hearing after a finding that the respondent suffers from a mental disorder. Although S.L. maintains that the court\u2019s failure to hold a subsequent stand-alone disposition hearing has violated her rights to due process, she does not explain how this is so. The record clearly supports the District Court\u2019s determination that MSH was the least restrictive placement alternative, given that other community treatment facilities were unavailable to S.L. and the court\u2019s rejection of her indefinite plan to return to Maine. Under these circumstances, a subsequent disposition hearing would have served no purpose. We therefore conclude that S.L. has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s decision not to hold a subsequent stand-alone disposition hearing has deprived her of her rights to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b640 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s involuntary commitment order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> Pathways offers inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse services.
