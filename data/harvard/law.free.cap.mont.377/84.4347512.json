Erickson gave notice that he would rely on the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. A three-day jury trial was held in February 2013. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Erickson moved to dismiss on the ground that the State had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that he was not justified in his use of force. The District Court denied the motion. The jury ultimately found Erickson guilty of criminal endangerment and not guilty of aggravated assault. He now appeals, raising two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"AcA\">Issue 1: Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to prove that Erickson was not justified in his use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Issue 2: Whether the District Court abused its discretion in giving the jury an \u201caggressor\u201d instruction pursuant to \u00a7 45-3-105(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We affirm as to both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b62 The charges against Erickson arose out of an altercation he had with Gene Johnson in the parking lot outside the Golden Spike Bar in Havre at approximately 1:00 a.m. on April 23,2011. The altercation ended when Erickson struck Johnson in the face with a single punch, causing Johnson to fall to the pavement and hit the back of his head. At the time, Johnson was 34 years old, six feet, two inches tall, and roughly 185 pounds. Erickson was 47 years old, five feet, seven inches tall, and 145 pounds. Erickson claimed that he acted in self-defense; however, he, Johnson, and other witnesses gave varying accounts as to how the altercation unfolded.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b63 William McDaniel testified that he and a Mend had just arrived at the bar when he noticed two men (Erickson and Johnson) outside near the side door. The men were \u201cright up in each other\u2019s face,... just cursing back and forth.\u201d McDaniel estimated that he witnessed about ten seconds of the incident. He saw Johnson put Ms hands in Ms pockets and turn Ms head, as though he was backing down. At that point, Erickson struck Johnson, and Johnson fell to the ground. McDaniel did not notice either of the men shoving each other, and he did not believe that Johnson physically threatened Erickson. In McDaniel\u2019s view, Johnson did not expect to be punched.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b64 Stefan Johnson (unrelated to the victim, Gene Johnson) testified that he arrived at the bar with McDaniel and witnessed roughly 20 seconds of the altercation. Stefan saw Erickson and Johnson \u201cin each other\u2019s faces\u201d arguing. Erickson seemed more excited or angry than Johnson. Stefan didnot notice anypushingor shoving. He recalled that Johnson\u2019s hands were down at Ms side when the punch occurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Stefan testified that Johnson did not appear to have a threatening demeanor. Based on what he saw, Stefan did not believe that Erickson acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b65 Tyler Sheppard and his brother Scott Sheppard were outside the bar that evening. Tyler testified that he observed Johnson come out of the bar, with Erickson right behind him. The two men began arguing and \u201cgetting in each other\u2019s faces\u201d near the side door. Tyler saw Erickson push Johnson, but he did not see Johnson push back. Tyler did not see Johnson make any aggressive movements. Tyler observed that Johnson\u2019s hands were in his pockets and that he \u201cwas kind of shrugging his shoulders\u201d and \u201cblowing [Erickson] off.\u201d It seemed Johnson did not expect things to escalate. Nevertheless, Erickson then punched Johnson, who \u201clooked like he was out as soon as he got hit.\u201d Erickson seemed concerned and attempted to revive Johnson. Tyler estimated that the altercation lasted a minute or two. On cross-examination, he admitted that he had not heard all that Erickson and Johnson said and, thus, it was possible that Johnson threatened Erickson during the altercation. Tyler noted, however, that \u201cneither one of them [seemed] really scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b66 Scott Sheppard testified that he saw Johnson back out the door of the bar with Erickson following close behind. It appeared to him that Erickson and Johnson may have exchanged words inside the bar. Given the crowd and the loud music, Scott could not hear what the two men were saying, but it seemed from their body language that they were arguing. They were \u201cbumping chests\u201d and getting \u201cin each other\u2019s face.\u201d Scott testified that Erickson shoved Johnson just before punching him. Johnson\u2019s hands were in his pockets and he did not block or deflect the punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b67 Tony Smith also witnessed the incident. When he first saw Erickson and Johnson, they were already engaged in a verbal confrontation with \u201ca lot of swearing.\u201d He saw Johnson poke Erickson in the chest and Erickson push back. Then a \u201cshoving match back and forth\u201d ensued. Smith thought both men were acting \u201cquite aggressive.\u201d There was \u201csort of a break in the action\u201d \u2014 it became more verbal than physical \u2014 just before the punch occurred. Smith heard Erickson say, \u201cI\u2019m going to knock you out.\u201d He testified that Johnson\u2019s hands were at his side when Erickson punched him.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b68 Beth Hannah, Johnson\u2019s girlfriend at the time, testified that she and Johnson were out with Mends earlier that evening and saw Erickson while at two other bars. Although Johnson did not interact with Erickson at either of these establishments, he \u201cwasn\u2019t very thrilled\u201d to see Erickson. Hamah explained that Johnson had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>previously been charged with driving under the influence, and he believed this was due to a false report that Erickson had given the police. Nevertheless, Hannah testified that Johnson did not react angrily when he saw Erickson that evening. She stated that he was in \u201ca really good mood.\u201d Hannah farther testified that she provided care for Johnson after his release from the hospital. She discussed the extent of his injuries. He suffered a subdural hematoma and partial brain damage. He also suffered some hearing loss, and his memory, cognitive and verbal skills, and impulse control have been diminished. He has suffered seizures, which are being treated with medication. One side of his face is \u201ccompletely slack.\u201d He is volatile and easily angered, which was not his disposition prior to the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b69 Johnson testified at trial. He stated that it was difficult to remember all of the details of the altercation with Erickson. What he could remember is that he went to the Golden Spike with friends and sat at the far end of the bar. He had a couple of beers and then went outside to smoke a cigarette. He recalled seeing Erickson outside and, at some point, saying: \u201cWell, what are you going to do? That\u2019s what I thought. Nothing.\u201d He remembered having his hands in his pockets and turning away from Erickson. The next thing he remembered is waking up in the hospital. Under cross-examination, Johnson acknowledged that, before the altercation, he had ill feelings toward Erickson because of the DUJ charge. But he denied being angry or holding a grudge against Erickson.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b610 Sergeant Mike Labaly of the Havre Police Department testified that he was dispatched to the bar at 1:24 a.m. and arrived a few minutes later. Labaly photographed the scene and obtained initial statements from several witnesses. He and a second officer searched in and around the bar but were unable to locate Erickson, who had already left. Labaty then proceeded to the hospital, where Johnson had been transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b611 Meanwhile, Erickson telephoned the police station at around 2:00 a.m. Labaly returned the call at around 3:00 a.m. Labaty and Erickson again spoke by telephone at 3:45 p.m. later that day. Recordings of the conversations were played for the juiy during Labaty\u2019s testimony. In the first call, Erickson alleged that Johnson had \u201charassed\u201d him and was \u201cbeing a dickhead.\u201d Erickson claimed he had no idea what they were arguing about. He stated that Johnson pushed him, that he \u201cpushed\u201d Johnson back, and that Johnson tripped, fell, and hit his head. He made no mention of punching Johnson; he implied that Johnson\u2019s fall was accidental. He also did not state that he had felt threatened by Johnson. He admitted leaving the scene, but explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that he was scared in light of Johnson\u2019s injury. In the second call, Erickson stated that he had spoken with an attorney who had advised him not to give any further statements. He did say, however, that he believed he had acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b612 In the days following the altercation, Labaty and other officers obtained follow-up statements from nine individuals. Labaty testified that not a single witness stated that Johnson had attempted to hit or strike Erickson. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Labaty: \u201c[I]f somebody\u2019s harassing and harassing you and shoving you and being a dickhead to you, wouldn\u2019t that imply to you that the person is acting in a threatening way?\u201d Labaty declined to \u201cimply\u201d anything, but he did note that, in these types of cases, people typically mention right away that they were trying to defend themselves. Erickson had not done that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b613 Also on cross-examination, defense counsel challenged the adequacy of Labaty\u2019s investigation. In particular, counsel focused on what Labaty had, or had not, done to investigate Erickson\u2019s self-defense claim. Labaty noted that he had been precluded from obtaining further details about this claim from Erickson himself, given Erickson\u2019s refusal to talk to him. But Labaty indicated that he did obtain information from two witnesses potentially supporting Erickson\u2019s claim. First, Chalon Kinholt reported that he had witnessed the altercation and heard Johnson tell Erickson, \u201cI\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d Second, Hannah told Labaty about Johnson\u2019s belief that Erickson had reported him for DUI \u2014 which could have been a motive for Johnson to confront Erickson. Nevertheless, defense counsel faulted Labaty for not conducting further interviews and investigations, and suggested that because Labaty had not done \u201ca thorough and complete investigation into the issues of self-defense in this case,\u201d the State \u201chas not and cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kenneth Erickson was not acting legally to defend himself that evening.\u201d This remark drew an objection from the prosecutor, which the court sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b614 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, which consisted of testimony from the foregoing witnesses, Erickson moved to dismiss for insufficient evidence. Of relevance to tins appeal, he argued that the State had not met its burden under \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA, of proving that Erickson\u2019s actions were unjustified. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b615 Erickson called Kinholt as his first witness. Kinholt testified that on the night of the altercation, he received a call from Erickson shortly before 1:00 a.m. inviting him to the Golden Spike for beers. Upon arriving, Kinholt saw Erickson and Johnson in \u201csome kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>confrontation.\u201d They were standing a couple feet apart, yelling at each other. According to Kinholt, Johnson seemed \u201cenraged\u201d and was making \u201cangry motions\u201d with his hands. Kinholt stated that he heard Johnson tell Erickson, \u201cI\u2019m going to kick your [expletive] ass.\u201d Kinholt went over \u201cto try and stop it\u201d but was pulled back by Tyler Sheppard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kinholt testified that Johnson and Erickson shoved each other several times. He further testified, contrary to every other witness, that Johnson then came at Erickson with his fists in the air, at which point Erickson punched Johnson in the face. In Kinholt\u2019s view, Erickson acted in self-defense. Kinholt stated that he (Kinholt) provided aid by holding Johnson\u2019s head up off the pavement until EMTs arrived and that he later spoke with officers inside the bar. During the State\u2019s rebuttal, however, Labaty testified that a different individual was holding Johnson\u2019s head when EMTs arrived and that he did not see Kinholt (whom Labaty knew) anywhere at the scene that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b616 Erickson next called his former brother-in-law, Tim Munyan, who was acquainted with Johnson. Munyan testified that about six months before the altercation, Johnson stated that he believed Erickson had reported him to the police, causing him to be charged with BUI. According to Munyan, Johnson referred to Erickson as a \u201cson of a bitch.\u201d Munyan further testified that about two months before the altercation, Johnson told Munyan: \u201cI will catch that son of a bitch and kick his ass.\u201d Concerned that Johnson would cany out this threat, Munyan warned Erickson \u201cto really watch himself.\u201d In response, Erickson told Munyan that he did not know Johnson and (hat he knew nothing about the BUI incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b617 Erickson also called John Stevenson, who had been at the Golden Spike with him on the night in question. Stevenson was inside the bar during the altercation and thus did not witness it. Stevenson testified that Erickson went outside for about five minutes and appeared \u201cdistraught\u201d when he returned. Erickson said they needed to leave because he had been in a fight and punched a guy. Erickson stated that the guy (Johnson) was very aggressive and twice his size. Erickson told Stevenson, \u201cI felt like I had to strike first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b618 Erickson testified in his own defense. He explained that it had been hot inside the bar and so he went outside to cool off. He testified that he walked five to ten steps out the door, and \u201c[t]he next thing I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>know some guy is standing over top of me calling me a prick and an asshole.\u201d Erickson assumed this was a disgruntled car owner whose vehicle had been towed by Erickson\u2019s towing company at law enforcement\u2019s behest. According to Erickson, the man (Johnson) was drunk, angry, and belligerent and stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d Erickson testified that he tried to talk his way out of the situation, but Johnson would not back down. Erickson admitted threatening Johnson: \u201cLeave me alone or I\u2019m going to knock you out.\u201d The two men shoved each other several times, and then Erickson decided \u201cto pop [Johnson] in the nose,\u201d \u201cwater his eyes,\u201d and \u201cget the hell out\u201d of there. Erickson proceeded to punch Johnson, causing him to fall to the ground. He believed that the entire altercation lasted two to three minutes and that the time from when the pushing started to when he threw the punch was about 20 seconds. He testified that he believed it was necessary to use force against Johnson because \u201cI was afraid I was going to get my ass kicked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b619 The jury found Erickson not guilty of aggravated assault and the lesser included offense of assault, but guilty of criminal endangerment. The District Court deferred imposition of sentence for a period of six years, subject to various conditions. The court also ordered Erickson to pay restitution of $324,215.31, most of which was attributable to Johnson\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b620 At the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence, the defendant may move to dismiss the action on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding or verdict of guilty. Section 46-16-403, MCA. A motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there is not sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 35, 342 Mont. 1,180 P.3d 1102. We review the denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence de novo. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b621 A district court has broad discretion when it instructs the jury, and we thus review a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 309,170 P.3d 444. A district court\u2019s discretion is restricted, however, by the overriding principle that the instructions, as a whole, must fidly and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Hovey, </em>2011 MT 3, \u00b6 10,359 Mont. 100,248 P.3d 303; <em>Bieber,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 1: Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to prove that Erickson was not justified in his use of force.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b623 Erickson was convicted of criminal endangerment, which is defined as follows: \u201cA person who knowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another commits the offense of criminal endangerment.\u201d Section 45-5-207(1), MCA. The parties stipulated that the injuries suffered by Johnson constitute \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The issue was whether Erickson knowingly engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of such injuries. The State argued that Erickson did so by initiating a verbal confrontation with Johnson outside a bar on an asphalt parking lot, and then escalating it into a physical altercation during which he struck Johnson in the face with a closed fist, causing Johnson to fall back and hit his head on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u00b624  Erickson relied on the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force, which is set forth in Title 45, chapter 3, part 1, MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, a person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force by another person. However, the person is justified in the use of force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony. Section 45-3-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">\u00b625  The State must prove the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623. Prior to 2009, the State was not required to prove the absence of justification. <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 13. In 2009, however, the Legislature enacted legislation designed to shift the burden to the State to prove the absence of justification in self-defense claims. <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 14. Section 46-16-131, MCA, states: \u201cIn a criminal trial, when the defendant has offered evidence of justifiable use of force, the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s actions were not justified.\u201d Justifiable use of force is still an affirmative defense \u2014 which we have defined as one that admits the doing of the act charged, but seeks to justify, excuse, or mitigate it \u2014 and the initial burden of evidence production is still on the defendant. <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 15; \u00a7\u00a7 45-3-115, 46-16-131, MCA. But if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>defendant offers evidence of justifiable use of force, then the ultimate burden of proof shifts to the State. <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 15; \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA. The State concedes in the present appeal that the burden was shifted to the prosecution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b626 Erickson contends that the State did not meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that his actions were not justified. He argues two theories, one focused on Sergeant Labaty\u2019s investigation and the other focused on the evidence. As to the first theory, Erickson relies on \u00a7 45-3-112, MCA (also enacted in 2009), which states: \"When an investigation is conducted by a peace officer of an incident that appears to have or is alleged to have involved justifiable use of force, the investigation must be conducted so as to disclose all evidence, including testimony concerning the alleged offense and that might support the apparent or alleged justifiable use of force.\u201d Erickson asserts that Labaty failed to comply with this statute because he did not interview certain witnesses, did not re-interview other witnesses, and did not investigate all \"self-defense issues\u201d in the case, such as Johnson\u2019s medical history and how intoxicated he and Erickson were that night. Erickson argues that if Labaty had investigated these matters, he would have realized that Johnson was the initial aggressor and that Erickson acted in self-defense. Erickson suggests (as reflected in his questioning of Labaty at trial) that Labaty\u2019s alleged failure to conduct \"a thorough and complete investigation into the issues of self-defense in this case\u201d means that the State cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Erickson\u2019s actions were unjustified. We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b627  First, four months prior to Erickson\u2019s trial, this Court analyzed \u00a7 45-3-112, MCA, and concluded that nothing in the language of the statute requires law enforcement to conduct an independent investigation for the defense in every case involving justifiable use of force. We held that the statute requires an officer conducting an investigation in such cases to make available for disclosure to the defense all evidence the officer discovers that might support the defense of justifiable use of force. <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6\u00b6 33-38, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174. Nothing in the record here indicates that Labaty failed to make available for disclosure to Erickson all evidence he discovered during his investigation. Second, even if Labaty could have conducted more interviews and uncovered more evidence, as Erickson alleges, this does not mean that the evidence which Labaty did uncover and which the State ultimately did present at trial was insufficient as a matter of law. As the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>correctly points out, the issue is not whether some hypothetical investigation would have turned up more evidence of Erickson\u2019s defense. It is whether the evidence that law enforcement did find and that the State did present was itself sufficient to avoid dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b628 This leads to Erickson\u2019s second theory, which is that the evidence at trial supports his position rather than the State\u2019s. He argues that the evidence proved the following: Johnson believed Erickson had caused him to be charged with DUI; Johnson angrily confronted Erickson about this issue; Johnson was substantially younger and bigger than Erickson; Johnson was belligerent, threatening, and apparently drunk; Johnson subjected Erickson to profane name-calling, threats, and insulting and provoking shoves; Erickson reasonably believed that Johnson was intent on carrying out his stated threat \u201cto kick [Erickson\u2019s] ass\u201d; Erickson feared Johnson would do so imminently; he punched Johnson in response to the imminent threat that he perceived; and he used the amount of force he reasonably believed was necessary to defend himself. It is true that this version of the altercation is one possible interpretation of the evidence. But, again, the issue here is not whether there is evidence sufficient to support a finding favorable to the defendant. <em>Cf State v. Weigand, </em>2005 MT 201, \u00b6 7, 328 Mont. 198, 119 P.3d 74. It is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to <em>the prosecution, </em>there is sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\u2019s actions were not justified. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 35; \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b629 Because Erickson\u2019s argument is that the District Court should have granted his mid-trial motion to dismiss made at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, our focus is on the evidence presented in the State\u2019s case-in-chief. In this regard, although some of the testimony was conflicting, the existence of conflicting testimony does not render the evidence insufficient. <em>State v. Wood, </em>2008 MT 298, \u00b6 43, 345 Mont. 487, 191 P.3d 463. Determinations of the credibility and the weight of testimony are within the exclusive province of the jury, <em>Wood, </em>\u00b6 43, and the jurors here were so instructed. They were also instructed that \u201c[tjhe evidence presented by one witness, whom you believe, is sufficient for the proof of any fact in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b630 The testimony ofthe State\u2019s witnesses, if believed, would establish the following. The altercation lasted about a minute, perhaps two. Johnson walked out of the bar first, with Erickson pursuing close behind. An argument ensued, during which the men were \u201cin each other\u2019s faces.\u201d Erickson seemed more excited or angry than Johnson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Johnson did not have a threatening demeanor and made no aggressive movements. He shrugged his shoulders and appeared to be \u201cblowing [Erickson] off.\u201d Johnson\u2019s conduct did not suggest any escalation. Nevertheless, Erickson shoved Johnson and told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to knock you out.\u201d Erickson then punched Johnson in the face. At that point, Johnson\u2019s hands were in his pockets or at his side, and he was turning away. When Erickson first spoke with Sergeant Labaty that night, he made no mention of feeling threatened by Johnson or acting in self-defense. He claimed only that Johnson had harassed him and was being \u201ca dickhead,\u201d and he characterized Johnson\u2019s fall as accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b631  Viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, Erickson was unreasonable in believing that there was an imminent use of unlawful force by Johnson and that the force Erickson used was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself. Section 45-3-102, MCA. The District Court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b632 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court abused its discretion in giving the jury an \u201caggressor\u201d instruction pursuant to \u00a7 45-3-105(2), MCA. </em>\u00b633 Following the close of all the evidence, the District Court gave the jury several instructions relating to justifiable use of force. Included in these was Instruction No. 27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">The use of force in defense of a person is not available to a person who purposely or knowingly provokes the use of force against himself unless such force is so great that he reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to the assailant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">This is a nearly verbatim recitation of \u00a7 45-3-105(2Xa), MCA, which concerns \u201c[u]se of force by aggressor.\u201d Erickson objected to this instruction on the basis that he was not the aggressor. In response, the State argued that conflicting testimony had been presented about who was the initiator or provoker of the altercation. The District Court agreed and overruled Erickson\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u00b634 On appeal, Erickson again argues that the District Court should not have given Instruction No. 27 because \u201cit allowed the jury to conclude that [he] was the aggressor.\u201d He asserts the evidence \u201cclearly establishes\u201d that Johnson, not Erickson, \u201cprovoked the confrontation herein.\u201d The State responds that there was testimony from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>eyewitnesses indicating that Erickson was the aggressor and, thus, Instruction No. 27 was necessary to fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b635  The trial judge is under a duly to instruct the jury on every issue or theory finding support in the evidence, and this duty is discharged by giving instructions which accurately and correctly state the law applicable in a case. <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, \u00b6 36, 292 Mont. 23, 971 P.2d 359, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6\u00b6 25,61,298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204. An instruction must be supported either by direct evidence or by some logical inference from the evidence presented. <em>State v. Hudson, </em>2005MT 142, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 286, 114 P.3d 210. Based on the testimony discussed above, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that Erickson was the aggressor. The testimony, if believed, established that he pursued Johnson from the bar, and may have approached Johnson from behind. The testimony further establishes that Johnson did not have a threatening demeanor and made no aggressive movements; that Johnson had his hands in his pockets or at this sides; that Erickson shoved Johnson and then punched him; and that Erickson, by his own admission, \u201cfelt like Die] had to strike first.\u201d A rational trier of fact could find from this evidence that Erickson purposely or knowingly provoked Johnson. Section 45-3-lG5(2}(a), MCA. We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in giving Instruction No. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"> Tyler testified about this earlier in the trial, explaining that it appeared Kinholt \u201cwas going to jump in\u201d to the fray and \u201cstart swinging.\u201d Tyler thus pulled Kinholt back, stating: \u201cHey, I think they\u2019re just talking.
