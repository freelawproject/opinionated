The City of Missoula (City) previously appealed the Fourth Judicial District Court\u2019s award compensating Landowners for the City\u2019s taking of their property to construct improvements along South Avenue. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s determination that Landowners were entitled to just compensation for the faking hut reversed and remanded on other issues. In this second appeal, the City appeals the District Court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by Landowners during the prior appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Landowners incurred during the prior appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\u00b64 The original dispute in this case arose after the City decided to undertake road improvements along South Avenue in Missoula, Montana. Landowners contested the City\u2019s assessment of the width of the right-of-way on a section of South Avenue. Landowners believed the City\u2019s improvements constituted a faking of their property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">\u00b65 After a bench trial, the District Court held that the City\u2019s improvements required the use of land beyond its right-of-way and that the City\u2019s actions constituted a taking. The court made findings of fact that calculated the amount of the final judgment at $22.52 per square foot, based on the value of a representative parcel of property on April 7,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">\u00b66 The City appealed the District Court\u2019s decision. This Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Wohl v. City of Missoula, </em>2013 MT 46, 369 Mont. 108, 300 P.3d 1119 <em>(Wohl I). </em>We remanded for redetermination of damages because the District Court relied on the value of a specific representative parcel, which had been determined by a sale that occurred approximately seven months after the City\u2019s improvement project had been completed. The same parcel had sold for $15.41 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>square foot in March 2005, and another parcel in the vicinity sold around the same time for $15.00 per square foot for the bare land. We reversed the court\u2019s assessment of Landowners\u2019 damages for the City\u2019s taking of their land and remanded for a recalculation of damages that reflected the value of Landowners\u2019 property at the time the City seized it. <em>Wohl </em>I, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 74. We rejected Landowners\u2019 cross-appeal under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which claimed damages and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 for alleged violations of their rights under both state and federal law. <em>Wohl I, </em>\u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b67 Additionally, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s award of fees and costs incurred in the underlying litigation as authorized by Article n, Section 29. <em>Wohl I, </em>\u00b6 62. We also considered Landowners\u2019 claim to costs and attorney\u2019s fees associated with proving the fees and costs of the underlying litigation were reasonable and necessary. Such fees are called \u201cfees for fees\u201d and are generally disallowed. <em>See, e.g., Mont. Dept. of Hwys. v. McGuckin, </em>242 Mont. 81, 788 P.2d 926 (1990). <em>Wohl I, </em>\u00b6 65. We noted the District Court correctly denied Landowners\u2019 claim for \u201cfees for fees,\u201d but erroneously prohibited Landowners\u2019 counsel from charging his clients for the fee incurred in establishing the reasonableness of litigation expenses other than fees. <em>Wohl </em>I, \u00b6 69. We therefore vacated and remanded in part, ruling that \u201cLandowners\u2019 counsel may not charge his clients with the expense of proving the underlying <em>attorney\u2019s fees, </em>but he may pass on to his clients the expense of proving the underlying litigation expenses <em>other than attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Wohl I, </em>\u00b6 69 (emphasis in original). <em>Wohl I </em>therefore addressed multiple issues including the award of underlying litigation fees and expenses and the unacceptable \u201cfees for fees\u201d practice but it did not address whether Landowners were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees incurred during the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b68 Landowners filed a petition for rehearing, arguing that the Court had \u201coverlooked the material fact that [Landowners] requested attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred on appeal\u201d and that our opinion conflicted \u201cwith a controlling decision.\u201d They asked the Court to award both attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred for the appeal. The City opposed the petition. We denied the petition for rehearing, noting that we had not awarded appellate fees in <em>Wohl I </em>because Landowners had not presented appellate fees and costs as an issue on appeal nor had they presented argument or legal authority on the point. The Court\u2019s order on the petition for rehearing stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">[I]f the Court intends for attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded on appeal, it must say so. We did not expressly award [Landowners] their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. We decline to do so now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">As to appellate costs, we pointed out that the District Court was authorized by the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure to determine which party prevailed on appeal to this Court, and to determine the amount of costs recoverable for the appeal on remand. M. R. App. P. 19(3) (Rule 19(3\u00bb.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b69 On remand, Landowners agreed to reduce their \u201ctaken property\u201d value to $15.41 per square foot. Landowners moved for a final judgment based on the lower per square foot value. They also asked the District Court to assess both attorney\u2019s fees and costs against the City for the appeal. The City opposed the motion, arguing that Landowners\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees already had been denied by this Court in its order on the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b610 On November 15, 2013, the District Court issued an order determining that Landowners were the prevailing party on appeal. The court awarded Landowners\u2019 appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The City objected again that this Court\u2019s order on the petition for rehearing precluded the award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees to Landowners. The City argued further that Landowners were not entitled to their appellate costs because the District Court incorrectly determined that Landowners were the \u201cprevailing party\u201d on appeal. The District Court entered a final judgment on March 5, 2014, awarding appellate attorney\u2019s fees of $33,406.11 and appellate costs of $1,697.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\u00b611 The City appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred during the prior appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s determination of which party prevailed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Whipps, L.L.C. v. Kaufman, Vidal, Hileman &amp; Ramlow, P.C., </em>2007 MT 66, \u00b6 6, 336 Mont. 386, 156 P.3d 11. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Whipps, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">\u00b613 In an eminent domain case, as this one, a district court\u2019s award of \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation\u201d to a prevailing private property owner is mandated by Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 70-30-305(2), MCA. We review a district court\u2019s decisions on constitutional issues and the interpretation and application of a statute for correctness. <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone Cty. Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 2, </em>2002 MT 264, \u00b6 16, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381 (\u201cA district court\u2019s resolution of an issue involving a question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>constitutional law is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the conclusion is correct.\u201d); <em>State v. Am. Bank, </em>2008 MT 362, \u00b6 7, 346 Mont. 405, 195 P.3d 844 (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute for correctness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b614 We acknowledge the numerous cases in which we have applied a two-step standard of review as it applies to a grant or denial of attorney fees. We have stated that a district court\u2019s determination of whether legal authority exists to award attorney\u2019s fees is a conclusion of law we review for correctness. We then have applied the second step to review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of fees based upon the existing authority for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 402, 168 P.3d 615. This two-step standard of review remains applicable in cases where attorney fees are not mandated by the Montana Constitution or a statute but rather, for example, are governed by a discretionary statute such as \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA. (\u201cA plaintiff who prevails in an action brought in district court to enforce the plaintiffs rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution <em>may </em>be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err by awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Landowners incurred during a prior appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b616 The City argues that the District Court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees for the prior appeal because this Court already had considered and denied Landowners\u2019 claim for appellate attorney\u2019s fees before remanding the case to the District Court. It argues that our refusal to award fees in our Order on Rehearing constitutes \u201claw of the case.\u201d We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b617 The doctrine of \u201claw of the case\u201d provides that \u201c[w]hen this Court, in deciding a case presented, states a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress, both in the trial court and upon subsequent appeal.\u201d <em>Winslow v. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </em>2005 MT 217, \u00b6 30, 328 Mont. 260, 121 P.3d 506 (citation omitted). The doctrine is \u201climited to those issues which were actually decided and were necessary to the decision.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Great N. Ry. Co., </em>148 Mont. 429, 440, 421 P.2d 710, 716 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b618 In our rehearing order, we did not pronounce a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision; rather, we simply observed that we had not expressly awarded attorney fees in our <em>Wohl I </em>opinion, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201cdecline[d] to do so now.\u201d We \u201cmade no expression of opinion on the merits\u201d of the Landowners\u2019 request for appellate fees. <em>See State ex rel Union Oil Co. v. Dist. Court, </em>160 Mont. 229, 234, 503 P.2d 1008, 1011 (1972) (finding that this Court\u2019s earlier denial of an application for a writ of supervisory control did not constitute \u201claw of the case,\u201d as the denial presented \u201cno expression of opinion on the merits of the case\u201d nor did it \u201cimply anything regarding our view of the merit of the arguments presented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b619  Moreover, even if the doctrine of law of the case arguably applied here, the decision of the District Court would not be precluded. Our rehearing order did not address the substantive question of whether the Landowners were entitled to appellate attorney fees under the Montana Constitution, nor did it preclude the District Court from taking up the issue on remand. Rather, we addressed the authorized award of costs to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under Rule 19(3). We stated in the short paragraph in which we declined to award fees that \u201cRide 19 does not govern the award of fees on appeal.\u201d We made no reference to the constitutional right to attorney fees under Article H, Section 29, despite the fact that Landowners specifically sought an award of fees under the constitutional provision, and not Rule 19. Furthermore, we expressly deferred to the District Court the determination of who was the prevailing party, and it is this very determination that triggers a party\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees under Article n, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution. It therefore was appropriate that once the District Court concluded on remand that plaintiffs were the prevailing parties on appeal, it would then consider the propriety of appellate attorney fees under Article II, Section 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b620 Article n, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution addresses eminent domain. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation to the full extent of the loss having been first made to or paid into court for the owner. In the event of litigation, just compensation shall include necessaxy expenses of litigation to be awarded by the court when the private property owner prevails.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b621 We have held that \u201cjust compensation\u201d as referenced in Art. II, Section 29 cases, includes attorney fees. <em>Galt v. State, </em>230 Mont. 327, 331, 749 P.2d 1089, 1092 (1988). <em>See also Wohl I, </em>\u00b6 60. We have also held that recovery in inverse condemnation cases \u2014 like this one \u2014 derives from the constitutional provision, and that \u201cthere is a clear constitutional requirement that attorney fees be paid in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>condemnation cases where the landowner prevails.\u201d <em>Rauser v. Toston Irrigation Dist., </em>172 Mont. 530, 545, 565 P.2d 632, 641 (1977). We noted in <em>Galt </em>\"that just compensation, including necessary expenses of litigation, is constitutionally required where the State takes private properly for public use.\u201d <em>Galt, </em>230 Mont, at 334, 749 P.2d at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">\u00b622 The determination of who is the prevailing party in a condemnation case is governed by specific statute. Section 70-30-305(2), MCA, provides that in the event of litigation, where the condemnee prevails by receiving an award in excess of the final written offer of the condemnor, \"the court shall award necessary expenses of litigation to the condemnee.\u201d Here, the Landowners \"prevailed\u201d by recovering an amount in excess of that offered by the City of Missoula, which had offered them nothing when taking their property. It is this recovery that triggered the right to recover expenses of litigation including attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b623 The Dissent posits that because we rejected Landowners\u2019 cross-appeal on their alleged dvil rights violations and ruled in favor of the City on the calculation of the underlying damage award in <em>Wohl I, </em>this somehow mitigates against Wohls\u2019 entitlement to attorney fees. This argument ignores the fact that Landowners plainly satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 70-30-305(2), MCA, as noted above, thus making the award of the expenses of litigation to them mandatory under the statute. The Dissent dtes no authority for the apparent proposition that general \"prevailing party\u201d considerations with respect to ancillary claims should somehow trump a party\u2019s statutory entitlement to the recovery of \"necessary expenses of litigation to the condemnee\u201d under \u00a7 70-30-305(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b624  The District Court correctly concluded that the Landowners have a constitutional right to be made whole through an award of attorney fees and costs on appeal. The court properly relied on <em>Galt, </em>in which we remarked upon the \"imbalance between the resources available to the parties which should be redressed by requiring the state to bear full financial burden of the individual whose property is being condemned,\u201d and the Constitutional Convention\u2019s \"abundantly clear\u201d intention \"to make the landowner whole in eminent domain proceedings to the extent that the amount of the judgment for the taking of his land and improvements would be a \u2018net recover/ with expenses of litigation assessed against the State, where the landowner prevailed.\u201d <em>Galt, </em>230 Mont, at 332, 749 P.2d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b625 In <em>Wohl I, </em>we correctly affirmed the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees incurred in the underlying litigation to the Landowners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>under Article n, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution. The District Court likewise had the authority to award appellate attorney fees and costs to the Landowners under \u00a7 70-30-305, MCA, Rule 19(3), <em>Galt </em>and <em>Rauser.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b626 As noted above, a trial court\u2019s decision as to whether legal authority exists to award attorney\u2019s fees is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Wohl I, </em>\u00b6 29. In light of our unequivocal holding in <em>Rauser </em>that there is a clear constitutional requirement that attorney fees be paid in condemnation cases where the landowner prevails, the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law that the prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to recover appellate attorney fees is patently correct. The foregoing authorities likewise support an award of costs to the prevailing party, as does M. R. App. P. 19(3), which provides that costs on appeal are to be awarded to the prevailing parly \u201cunless otherwise specifically provided\u201d by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b627 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s award of $33,406.11 in appellate attorney\u2019s fees and $1,697.37 in costs as set forth in the court\u2019s March 5,2014 Judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b177-8\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"Aem\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">\u00b628 The District Court erred in awarding the Landowners\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees for the prior appeal, and this Court errs in affirming that award. The parties already briefed, and we already considered and decided, the identical issue in the Landowners\u2019 petition for rehearing in <em>Wohl I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b629 Landowners\u2019 petition for rehearing was limited to a single issue. They argued that the Court had overlooked their request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs for the appeal and asked the Court to award both. The Ciiy opposed the petition and we denied it, stating;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">[I]f the Court intends for attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded on appeal, it must say so. We did not expressly award [Landowners] their attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. We decline to do so now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">We pointed out that, in contrast to a fee award, costs automatically were allowed on appeal, subject to the District Court\u2019s determination of prevailing party status, and that the District Court was to determine the amount of costs recoverable for the appeal on remand. M. R. App. P. 19(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">\u00b630 A prior decision or order of a court resolving an issue is binding between the same parties in later litigation. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>2009 MT 291, \u00b6 6, 352 Mont. 364, 217 P.3d 1027; <em>LeMond v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Yellowstone Dev., LLC, </em>2014 MT 181A, \u00b6 41, 375 Mont. 402, 336 P.3d 345 (noting that courts generally \u201crefuse to reopen what has been decided\u201d). \u201c The general rule in Montana is that where a decision has been rendered by the Supreme Court on a particular issue between the same parties in the same case, whether that decision is right or wrong, such decision is binding on the parties and the courts and cannot be relitigated in a subsequent appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grenfell v. Anderson, </em>2002 MT 225, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 385, 56 P.3d 326 <em>(quoting Belgrade State Bank v.

Just as in their brief in this appeal, they argued that they were the prevailing parties on appeal and were entitled to fees as a necessary expense of litigation under Article n, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution. We denied their petition unequivocally. Our denial offees in the prior appeal \u201cactually decided\u201d the issue of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and is the law of the case. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Great N. R.R. </em>Co., 148 Mont. 429, 440, 421 P.2d 710, 716 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b632 I therefore would not address Landowners\u2019 argument that attorney\u2019s fees were required by the \u2018just compensation\u201d clause in Article II, Section 29. <em>Galt v. State, </em>230 Mont. 327, 334, 749 P.2d 1089, 1094 (1988). Although Landowners did not include this constitutional argument in their principal briefs during the prior appeal, if was the exclusive focus of their rehearing petition. We noted in our rehearing order that \u201c[Landowners\u2019] briefs on appeal did not identify this as a separate issue or present argument and legal authority on the point, but included in their concluding paragraph a request that the Court \u2018[require] the City to pay all of Plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal.\u2019 \u201d They did not present this argument until their petition for rehearing, and we declined to adopt it at that time. Our rejection of their arguments on rehearing forecloses their consideration now.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b633 Further, it is not as if we simply overlooked those arguments. Our opinion in <em>Wohl I </em>affirmed the District Court as to the City\u2019s liability, but we rejected Landowners\u2019 cross-appeal on their alleged civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, and ruled in the City\u2019s favor on the calculation of the underlying damage award, as well as a portion of the fee award. These were not insignificant issues on appeal, yet Landowners had presented no argument or authority as to whether fees nonetheless should be awarded or how, if at all, they should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>apportioned. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f); <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6 38, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946 (declining to address argument that was \u201ctoo undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles\u201d); <em>State v.

We considered Landowners\u2019 cursory demand for attorney's fees and declined to award them for the appeal. <em>See State v. Slack, </em>2001 MT 137, \u00b6 35, 305 Mont. 488, 29 P.3d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"Axh\">\u00b634 The Court points out that we deferred to the District Court the determination of which party prevailed on appeal. Opinion, \u00b6 19. But that determination was for the purpose of awarding costs, as expressly provided in M. R. App. P. 19(3). \u201cThis rule makes clear that the District Court is entitled to make the decision as to which party prevailed on appeal to this Court.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Mont. PSC, </em>2012 MT 299, \u00b6 14, 367 Mont. 379, 291 P.3d 1116. Rule 19(3) addresses only the award of costs, and makes an award of appellate costs purely a matter within the discretion of the District Court, unless this Court \u201cotherwise specifically provide[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b635 On the contrary, Rule 19 does not address an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Our rehearing order correctly observed that the Rule does not permit an award of appellate fees unless we \u201csay so.\u201d Appellate fees, if they were to be allowed, had to be authorized by this Court and were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b636 Our order on the petition for rehearing resolved the issue alter briefing by the parties by declining to award fees. That ruling became the law of the case; as such, it was binding on the District Court \u201cwhether that decision is right or wrong...\u201d <em>Grenfell, </em>\u00b6 19. Even if the Court now believes it made a mistake, its rationale today, which was not articulated at the time the petition for rehearing was denied, is too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b637 I agree that the award of appellate costs should be affirmed, but I dissent from the decision affirming attorney\u2019s fees for the prior appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
