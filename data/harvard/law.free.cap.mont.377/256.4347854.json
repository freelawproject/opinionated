Pesanti appeals the Second Judicial District Court\u2019s final decree of dissolution of his marriage with Terra L. Pesanti and its entry of a final parenting plan for their minor children. We address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by awarding primary custody of the children to Terra.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion with regard to Lewis\u2019s child support obligation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\u00b62 We affirm on the first issue and reverse and remand on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u00b63 Lewis and Terra married in 1995. They had three children together. All of the children are minors and one suffers from a severe seizure syndrome. In 2011, Lewis filed with the District Court a petition for dissolution of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">\u00b64 In September 2011, Lewis began paying Terra approximately $500 a month for support of the children. Soon thereafter, Terra filed a motion for temporary child support with the Child Support Enforcement Division of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (CSED). In February 2012, an administrative law judge (AU) with CSED entered a proposed temporary child support order. In the order, the ALJ made findings regarding the parties\u2019 incomes and properties and concluded that Lewis should pay Terra $1,644 in child support per month. The ALJ determined that Lewis\u2019s child support obligation was retroactive to September 2011. Thus, after deducting the $2,600 Lewis already had paid Terra over the course of five months, Lewis was $7,264 in arrears. The proposed order notified the parties of their right to seek administrative review of the order and the process for doing so. Neither party sought administrative review. Accordingly, the proposed order was entered as a final temporary order after the window to seek further review had closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">\u00b65 Lewis moved the District Court in April 2012 to modify the temporary child support order. Lewis notified CSED and Terra of the motion. Both CSED and Terra objected to it. Because the District Court failed to rule on the motion, the motion was deemed denied according to a Second Judicial District local rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u00b66 In March 2013, the District Court held a bench trial on the dissolution of the Pesantis\u2019 marriage. In January 2014, the court entered its final parenting plan and final decree of dissolution. The orders specify that the children will reside primarily with Terra; Lewis is entitled to parenting time every other weekend, on Wednesday evenings, every other holiday, and for a continuous twenty-day period each summer. The orders direct that \u201cicjhild support shall be calculated according to the Montana Child Support Guidelines and shall be administered and enforced by [CSED].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lewis appeals the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b67 We review factual findings in parenting plans and child support orders to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Tummarello, </em>2012 MT 18, \u00b6 21, 363 Mont. 387,270 P.3d 28. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the evidence convinces us that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 479, 124 P.3d 1151. We review the trial court\u2019s orders in such matters for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 21. We will not find an abuse of discretion unless the court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Jackson, </em>2008 MT 25, \u00b6 9, 341 Mont. 227, 177 P.3d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b68 2. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by awarding primary custody of the children to Terra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b69 District courts determine parenting plans based on the best interest of the children after considering \u201call relevant parenting factors.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. These factors include \u201cthe mental and physical health of all individuals involved,\u201d the relationship between the parents and the children, and \u201ccontinuity and stability of care.\u201d Section 40-4-212(l)(c), (e), (h), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u00b610 In awarding primary custody of the children to Terra, the District Court affirmed that both Lewis and Terra \u201care fit and able parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>[who] care deeply about the best interests, well-being, and development of their minor children.\u201d The court found that Lewis \u201cis an appropriate parent of the three minor children,\u201d but noted that he had \u201cpursued his own interests at times\u201d and \u201cbeen questionable with his priorities in relation to the parenting of his three minor children.\u201d The court found that Terra \u201chas been an exceptional parent under exceptional circumstances.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cit is in the best interest of the minor children to continue residing primarily with [Terra] under the Final Parenting Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b611 Lewis contends that the District Court abused its discretion by declining to award him at least 50-50 custody of the children. He argues that Terra is not fit to be the primary residential parent because she suffers from major depressive disorder and receives social security disability benefits as a result of that disorder. Lewis also calls to our attention a time when one of the children wandered off while in Terra\u2019s custody and a time when Terra used profanity in front of the children. Lewis contends that the court disregarded evidence demonstrating that Terra lacks the ability to parent on a full-time basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b612 The orders reflect the District Court\u2019s recognition that the Social Security Administration has found Terra disabled by mqjor depressive disorder. Nevertheless, the court specifically found that Terra\u2019s \u201cdisability does not impact her ability to effectively parent her three children.\u201d The testimonies of multiple trial witnesses provide substantial support for that finding. To recount one, a family friend testified that Terra goes \u201cabove and beyond with the boys,\u201d that Terra\u2019s \u201cwhole life revolves around the children,\u201d and that Terra \u201cdoes things that are absolutely incredible that I wasn\u2019t able to provide my own boys.\u201d Moreover, the Social Security Administration\u2019s determination that an impairment prevents a person from working in a full-time job does not necessarily mean the person is incapable of parenting her children as the primary custodian. <em>See Brennan v. </em>Hill, 516 A.2d 149, 149 (Conn. App. Ct. 1986) (holding that a trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody to a parent who received social security disability benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b613 The District Court\u2019s findings capture the unique challenges of child care in this family. In the dissolution order, the court recounted the testimony of Dr. Kenneth Graham, who has treated all three of the children, including the child who suffers from severe seizure disorder. Relying on his testimony, the com\u00ed; found that the \u201cseizure disorder requires extensive medical care\u201d and \u201caround the clock management.\u201d The court noted Dr. Graham\u2019s opinion that Terra has a keen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>understanding of tibe disorder and a \u201c24-hour a day commitment\u201d to managing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b614  In all, the District Court heard substantial evidence at the trial supportingthe finding that Terra \u201chas been an exceptional parent under exceptional circumstances.\u201d This finding supports the court\u2019s determination to award primary custody to Terra. \u201cChild custody cases often present the court with difficult decisions. We must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision.\u201d <em>In re Parenting </em>of N.S., 2011 MT 98, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it is in the children\u2019s best interest to reside primarily with Terra.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b615 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion with regard to Lewis\u2019s child support obligation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b616 The District Court adopted and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination that Lewis must pay $1,644 total per month in child support. Regarding each party\u2019s income for the purposes of calculating child support, the District Court found that Lewis earns \u201capproximately $85,000 per year\u201d and that Terra receives $2,115.90 in social security disability benefits per month (or $25,390.80 per year). The court also awarded to Terra exclusive use of the parties\u2019 ranch property until their youngest child graduates from high school, at which time the property is to be sold and the proceeds divided. The ranch property includes the family home, a homestead, a bunkhouse, and a smaller house \u2014 the last three of which the Pesantis have rented to third parties in the past. The court found that renting the ranch property does not provide a \u201ccontinuous stream of rental income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b617 Lewis does not specifically challenge the District Court\u2019s factual findings, but argues that the court abused its discretion in affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination of Lewis\u2019s child support obligation. Lewis points out that, to calculate child support, the ALJ used numbers that conflict with the District Court\u2019s findings. Specifically, the ALJ attributed to Lewis $6,300 in rental income from the property that the District Court later awarded to Terra, bringing Lewis\u2019s total income to $90,886 (as opposed to the \u201capproximately $85,000\u201d that the District Court found). Also, the ALJ attributed to Terra $16,062 in social security benefits yearly (as opposed to the $25,390.90 that the District Court found). Lewis argues that the District Court\u2019s refusal to let him testify at trial about his disagreements with the ALJ\u2019s order contributed to the court\u2019s abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b618 Terra responds by arguing that, with or without the $6,300 in rental income, Lewis could afford to pay the $1,644 in child support that the ALJ ordered, and the order therefore should be affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Terra also argues that the District Court correctly refused to hear Lewis\u2019s testimony about the ALJ\u2019s order, and that, regardless, Lewis was permitted to testify regarding his trouble meeting the child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b619 When determining reasonable or necessary child support, a district court must consider \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including \u201cthe financial resources of the parents.\u201d Section 40-4-204(1M2), MCA. The district court must apply the uniform child support guidelines adopted by CSED. Section40-4-204(3)(a), MCA. \u201cThe amount determined under the guidelines is presumed to be an adequate and reasonable support award....\u201d Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA. If the district court imposes an amount that departs from the guidelines, \u201cit shall state the reasons\u201d for concluding \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d that the guideline amount \u201cis unjust or inappropriate.\u201d Section 40-4-204(3)(a)-(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AntU\">\u00b620  The District Court adopted the ALJ\u2019s determination that Lewis should pay $1,644 in child support per month. The ALJ derived that number by applying the guidelines to the facts that it found \u2014 specifically, to Lewis\u2019s $90,886 in annual income (including rental income) and Terra\u2019s $16,062 in income. Despite adopting the ALJ\u2019s determination of the amount of child support Lewis should pay, the District Court found facts different from those found by the ALJ with respect to rental of the ranch property and Terra\u2019s income from Social Security. Applying the guidelines to the District Court\u2019s facts could yield a significant change in Lewis\u2019s obligation as compared to the obligation determined by the ALJ. In that event, adopting the ALJ\u2019s amount would depart from the guidelines. A district court may order child support that departs from the guidelines only after explaining why clear and convincing evidence requires the departure. Section 40-4-204(3)(a)-(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b621 Lewis also argues that the District Court abused its discretion by denying admission of Lewis\u2019s testimony regarding the child support obligation. When Lewis began to testify regarding his proposal for adjusting the arrearage established by the ALJ, Terra objected and the court sustained that objection because it determined that Lewis\u2019s proposal is \u201ca separate issue that [CSED] has a right to participate in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">\u00b622 Section 40-5-202(5)(a), MCA, specifies that when CSED is providing child support services, it must be afforded notice and an opportunity to participate in any proceeding relating to the establishment or modification of a support obligation. The notice must include \u201cthe names of the parties and the child, and the identity and location of the tribunal in which the issues will be determined.\u201d Section 40-5-202(5)(b), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u00b623 <em>In In re Marriage of Banka, </em>2003 MT 84, 315 Mont. 97, 67 P.3d 885, we interpreted \u00a7 40-5-202(5)\u2019s notice requirement under similar circumstances. In that case, a CSED AU issued a proposed temporary child support order. Neither the father nor the mother filed an administrative appeal of the proposed temporary order and it was entered as a final order. <em>Banka, </em>\u00b6 8. The father moved the District Court in the dissolution proceeding for immediate review of the temporary order, and notified CSED of that motion. Before the court ruled, however, the parties stipulated to dismiss the motion based on a recognition that the order was \u201ca temporary order only\u201d and was \u201cnot subject to judicial review ... [or] binding upon the District Court,\u201d which would \u201csupersede the temporary order\u201d when it resolved the petition for dissolution. <em>Banka, </em>\u00b6 9. Nonetheless, upon resolving the petition for dissolution and entering a permanent child support order, the District Court declined to apply its child support order retroactively, in part because it concluded that CSED had not received proper notice of the proceeding under \u00a7 40-5-202(5Xa), MCA. <em>Banka, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11,15. We overturned the court because (1) \u201cthe very nature of a [CSED] temporary order contemplates its supersession\u201d by an order of a district court, and (2) the father had provided sufficient notice to CSED of the proceeding. <em>Banka, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b624  Here, as in <em>Banka, </em>CSED \u201center[ed] an order requiring a child\u2019s parent or parents to pay an amount each month for the temporary support of the child pending entry of a support order by the district court.\u201d Section 40-5-225(3)(a), MCA. Unless terminated by CSED, such an order remains in effect until superseded by a district court's final decree in the dissolution matter. Section 40-5-225(12), MCA. When Lewis moved the District Court to review CSED\u2019s temporary order, he notified CSED and CSED responded by objecting to the motion. CSED \u201cwas reasonably informed of the pending dissolution proceeding, that child support was at issue, and was aware of the names of the parties and children involved, and the location of the tribunal.\u201d <em>Banka, </em>\u00b6 19. The District Court erred by sustaining the objection to Lewis\u2019s testimony regarding his requested modification of the child support ordered by CSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b625 We note that Lewis was partly responsible for the confusion regarding the AI*Fs order. CSED derived its authority to enter a temporary support order in this case from \u00a7 40-5-225(3)(a), MCA. Section 40-5-225(12), MCA, directs that \u201c[a] temporary support obligation established under subsection (3) continues until terminated [by CSED] or until the temporary support order is superseded by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>[district court\u2019s] final order, judgment, or decree.\u201d Thus, a party to a dissolution action who desires to modify a temporary support order entered by CSED under \u00a7 40-5-225(3) has a clear path. Once a temporary order is proposed, the party may seek administrative review within CSED before the order is entered as final. Admin. R. M. 37.62.949(2), 37.62.951(1). Once a final order is entered, the party may seek further modification by the court in its final decree of dissolution, provided that CSED has notice and the opportunity to participate in the proceeding. Sections 40-5-202(5)(a), -225(12), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b626 Here, although Lewis did not follow the path provided by statute, he did provide CSED notice of the proceeding, and the law permitted him to seek modification in the final decree of dissolution. Despite sustaining Terra\u2019s objection, however, the District Court heard testimony from Lewis regarding bis gross and net income, his difficulty making the support payments, and his suggested amount of monthly child support payments. Lewis claims error in the disparity in income calculations regarding the rental properties and Terra\u2019s annual income. We conclude that the appropriate course is to remand for reconsideration of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b627 The District Court\u2019s final parenting plan is affirmed. We reverse the final decree and remand for redetermination of child support or for entry of additional findings explaining why clear and convincing evidence supports any departure from the guidelines.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\"> The parties appear to assume that this direction effectively adopts the AWs previous determination regarding Lewis\u2019s child support obligation. Although that is not facially obvious, this opinion proceeds under that understanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
