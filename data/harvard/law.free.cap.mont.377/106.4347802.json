We reverse the order and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">\u00b62 We review the following issue: Was the District Court\u2019s assessment of C.T.C.\u2019s best interests clearly erroneous? As our review of this issue is dispositive, we decline to reach the two additional issues the parties presented for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">\u00b63 C.T.C. was bom in January 2003 to Tracy Cumber (Tracy). Soon thereafter, paternity and custody proceedings were initiated, and Steven Higgins (Steven) was found to be the birth father of C.T.C. and was designated the primary residential parent, effective July 1,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">\u00b64 On August 7, 2004, Steven married Karen. C.T.C. resided primarily with Steven and Karen for approximately the next five years. Karen became an important parental figure to C.T.C. during this time period. She performed many of the essential parenting responsibilities and was called \u201cmom\u201d by C.T.C. Karen never adopted C.T.C., however.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b65 Steven died on October 15,2009. C.T.C. remained with Karen for a short time following Steven\u2019s death, but on November 17,2009, Tracy was granted primary residential custody of the child, and shortly thereafter, C.T.C. started living with Tracy and her husband, Randy Cumber (Randy). C.T.C. has remained with the Cumbers since that date. Randy adopted C.T.C. in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00b66 Beginning in November 2009, Karen made efforts to remain in contact with C.T.C. For some time, Karen maintained telephone and email correspondence with C.T.C. and Tracy. Eventually, however, Tracy made it clear that she valued her privacy with C.T.C. and ended communication between C.T.C. and Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b67 On May 12, 2010, Karen filed a petition in the District Court, requesting visitation with C.T.C. Tracy opposed the petition. In late 2010, Karen and Tracy entered into a settlement agreement, but this agreement was subsequently modified and then set aside altogether. Randy intervened in July 2013, and a hearing was held on the matter on December 17 and 18,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b68 Tracy and Randy each testified as to their wishes for C.T.C. at the hearing. Tracy\u2019s testimony included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">Q. What is ... your wish as [C.T.CJ\u2019s mother concerning the request for time filed by Karen Higgins in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">A. The visitation that she wants?... I want the decision.... I\u2019m the mother, and Randy and I as [C.T.CJ\u2019s parents are going to make that decision for [C.T.C.], and we will make the best decision for [C.T.C.], and it also needs to be [C.T.CJ\u2019s choice, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve decided as a family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">Q. But she wants to see the child. Don\u2019t you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">A. And [C.T.C.] does not want to see her, nor is it my decision at this time. I have decided it\u2019s in his best interest to allow him peace within our home, within our community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Similarly, Randy\u2019s testimony included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">Q. What is your... wish, Mr. Cumber, with respect to the custody petition here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">A. I wish to let [C.T.C.] be the boy he want\u00bb to be, and be done with all the stress that\u2019s been in his life since the day I\u2019ve known him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">Q. So what concerns you? ... What\u2019s the big deal about forcing [C.T.C.] to see Karen Higgins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">A. Because he does not want to, and I don\u2019t think that we need to force him into doing something he does not want to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">\u00b69 Following the hearing, the District Court issued an order, making findings of fact, conclusions of law, and granting Karen\u2019s petition for visitation. Among other things, the order granted Karen a weekend per month of face-to-face visitation with C.T.C. and two consecutive weeks of visitation in the summer. The order allowed Karen to travel with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>C.T.C. outside of the Cumbers\u2019 community of residence during the summer visitation periods. The Cumbers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes for correctness and findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Hansen v. Moats (In re Parenting of S.J.H.), </em>2014 MT 40, \u00b6 8, 374 Mont. 31, 318 P.3d 1021. A finding is clearly emmeous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the evidence leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6 8 <em>(citing Puccinelli v. Puccinelli, </em>2012 MT 46, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 235, 272 P.3d 117).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b611 <em>Was theDistrict Court's assessment of C.T.C.\u2019s best interests clearly </em>erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b612 The Cumbers argue that the District Court did not properly consider their parental wishes when it determined that the visitation schedule was in the best interests of C.T.C. They claim that a district court must defer to the wishes of a parent, and that for this reason the District Court erred by ordering visitation with Karen over their objection. Karen responds that the District Court was allowed to grant visitation pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, without considering the wishes of C.T.C.\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b613 Section 40-4-228(3), MCA, allows a district court to grant a nonparent visitation with a child based solely \"on the best interests of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-228(3), MCA; <em>Grice v. Price (In re A.P.P.), </em>2011 MT 50, \u00b6 21, 359 Mont. 386, 251 P.3d 127. Section 40-4-212, MCA, provides some guidance for determining what is in the best interests of the child. It states that a court \"shall consider all relevant parenting factors, which may include... the wishes of the child\u2019s parent or parents.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The code is silent, however, on how courts ought to balance the relevant parenting factors or whether courts should afford a parent\u2019s wishes any special deference. See \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and 40-4-228, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b614 We have previously recognized that \u201cparents have a fundamental constitutional right 1\u00bb make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children\u2019 \u201d and that fit parents are presumed to act in their child\u2019s best interests. <em>Polasek v. Omura, </em>2006 MT 103, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 332 Mont. 157, 136 P.3d 519 (quoting <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>57, 66, 68, 120 S. Ct. 2054,2060-61 (2000)). Accordingly, in the context of a nonparent\u2019s claim for visitation, we have required courts to presume that a fit parent\u2019s wishes are in the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>see In re Grandparent I Grandchild Contact of C.A.G., </em>2014 MT 290, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14, 376 Mont. 540, 337 P.3d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Polasek, </em>we construed the best interest of the child standard of \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA. <em>See Polasek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 14-15; <em>C.A.G., </em>\u00b6 14. At the time of our decision, that statute imposed a best interests standard for granting visitation similar to the standard used by \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA. It read: \u201cGrandparent-grandchild contact granted under this section may be granted only upon a finding by the court, after a hearing, that the contact would be in the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 40-9-102(2), MCA (2005); <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 10 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b616 While our decision in <em>Polasek </em>construed a statute having to do with grandparent-grandchild visitation, our analysis is equally applicable to the nonparent visitation statute at issue in the present case. In <em>Polasek, </em>we focused on protecting a parent\u2019s fundamental rights against a claim for visitation by a party without similar rights in the child; our analysis was not concerned with grandparents as such but with grandparents as nonparents. <em>See Polasek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15; <em>C.A.G., </em>\u00b6 14. As we later stated in <em>Snyder v. Spaulding, </em>2010 MT 151, 357 Mont. 34, 235 P.3d 578, distinguishing parenting actions between a parent and a grandparent from those between parents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">In the latter context, the central issue is the division of parenting responsibilities between the parents, whereas in the former context, the issue is contact between a child and a nonparent over the parent\u2019s objection. This is a critical distinction. Both parties to a \u201cparenting plan\u201d are \u201cparents\u201d; and, in this sense, both are possessed of the same fundamental rights with respect to the parenting of their child. But the same is not true in grandparent-contact cases, where one party is a nonparent asking a court to overturn the decision of a parent notwithstanding the parent\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions concerning her child\u2019s associates. This second scenario requires delicate balancing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>rights of the parent vis-a-vis the interests of the nonparent, as well as the interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>accord Polasek </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Based on the similarities in the relevant code provisions and the interests of the parties, our holding in <em>Polasek </em>is directly applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">f 17 Although we have previously declined to apply the reasoning of <em>Polasek </em>to the best interests analysis of \u00a7 40-4-228(2), MCA, that statute and our decisions interpreting it are distinguishable such that we are not barred from applying <em>Polasek </em>here. Section 40-4-228(2), MCA, allows a district court to grant a parental interest to a nonparent, but the statute requires the district court to make several findings in addition to the bests interests of the child. Based on these additional requirements, we found the reasoning of <em>Polasek </em>to be inapplicable to \u00a7 40-4-228(2), MCA. <em>See Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6\u00b6 68-70, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595; <em>Filpula v. Ankney (In re L.F.A.), </em>2009 MT 363, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16, 18, 353 Mont. 220, 220 P.3d 391. We did not consider a grant of visitation under \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, in either <em>Kulstad </em>or <em>Filpula, </em>nor does that statute include the additional, distinguishing requirements of \u00a7 40-4-228(2), MCA. Thus, insofar as the statutory process and requirements for granting a parental interest to a nonparent are distinguishable from those for granting visitation, <em>Kulstad </em>and <em>Filpula </em>do not prevent us from applying <em>Polasek </em>here. <em>See Kulstad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 68-70; <em>Filpula, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 16, 18; <em>Grice, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 21; <em>compare </em>\u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, <em>with </em>\u00a7 40-4-228(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b618 Accordingly, we again recognize that a parent has a fundamental right to the care and custody of his or her child, and that fit parents are presumed to act in their child\u2019s best interests. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15; <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 66, 68, 120 S. Ct. at 2060-61. And, we reaffirm our application in <em>Polasek </em>of <em>Troxel </em>to nonparent petitions for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">\u00b619  Thus, when considering a claim for visitation by a nonparent that is contrary to the wishes of a parent, a court must determine whether the child\u2019s parent is fit. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68, 120 S. Ct. at 2061. In this context, a parent is fit if he or she \u201cadequately cares for his or her children.\" <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68,120 S. Ct. at 2061). If the parent is fit, the court must recognize a presumption in favor of a parent\u2019s wishes as to visitation. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S. Ct. at 2064. The presumption may be rebutted if the petitioning nonparent proves by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the child\u2019s best interests to have visitation with the nonparent. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15. If the parent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>not fit, no presumption arises and tibe parent\u2019s wishes are due no deference in determining the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b620  In the present case, the Cumbers wished for the District Court to let them decide whether and when to let C.T.C. have contact with Karen. As such, the District Court should have considered the Cumbers\u2019 fitness as parents. If if found that the Cumbers were fit, the District Court should have presumed that their wishes, as the wishes of C.T.C.\u2019s parents, represented C.T.C.\u2019s best interests. Yet, there is no indication that the District Court evaluated the Cumbers\u2019 fitness as parents or made a presumption in favor of the Cumbers\u2019 wishes. As such, if erred by granting visitation to Karen that was contrary to the Cumbers\u2019 wishes. While the District Court stated that visitation was in the best interest of C.T.C. and that it \"considered all [of the \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA,] factors,\u201d this mere recitation is not enough to support the visitation ordered, without a finding that the Cumbers were unfit or that the presumption in favor of their wishes had been rebutted. Because the District Court did not apply the correct analysis, as outlined above, we reverse the District Court\u2019s visitation order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b621  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court did not apply the correct analysis when it determined that visitation was in the best interests of C.T.C. We reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting visitation and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion. Given this decision, we decline to reach either the issue of whether the District Court in fact granted Karen visitation or the issue of whether \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, was unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGSATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> Although the cases in which we have done so use the term \u201ccontact\u201d rather than \u201cvisitation,\u201d we have treated these terms synonymously with regard to their effect on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to the care, custody, and control of his or her children. <em>See Polasek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-14 (applying <em>Troxel, </em>which uses the term \u201cvisitation,\u201d to the best interests standard of the grandparent contact statute); CIA. <em>G., </em>\u00b6 14. Given the language of \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, the statute controlling this case, we will use the term \u201cvisitation\u201d here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
