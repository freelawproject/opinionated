Nichols challenges the District Court\u2019s admission of testimony regarding his character and sexual habits, permitting a primary investigator to act as a representative of the State and testify during trial, and entering judgment of guilt of both Sexual Assault and Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, where the charges arose from a single incident. He also asserts that he is entitled to a new trial due to ineffective assistance of counsel. We reverse and remand, addressing two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">2. <em>Did the District Court err by allowing the State to elicit testimony regarding Nichols\u2019 sexual </em>habits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by allowing a primary investigator to act as both a representative of the State and a witness during trial?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">\u00b62 In January 2010, Nichols and his girlfriend Kay Lynn had a baby. Shortly thereafter, the couple moved in with Kay Lynn\u2019s family, including her nine year old sister, T.K. Nichols remained at the home for about three weeks until moving out on February 9, 2010. Within a month, Kay Lynn followed Nichols. Approximately two days later, T.K told her mother that \u201cTom touched me.\u201d Upon further questioning, T.K indicated to her mother that Nichols had touched her \u201ccrotch area.\u201d When asked why she had not said anything sooner, T.K responded she was afraid her mother would be angry. When T.K\u2019s mother hugged her and said it was not her fault, T.K \u201ckind of broke down\u201d and told her mom she was glad she had gotten it off of her chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">\u00b63 T.K\u2019s father contacted law enforcement after learning of the alleged assault. T.K was interviewed by Megan Breining, a forensic interviewer for the Flathead County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Although noting that she was nervous, Breining found T.K had no problem giving a narrative response when prompted with open-ended questions. According to T.K, she had been watching a movie in the computer room of her home with Nichols and her brother while the rest of the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>was watching television across the hall in the family room. T.K\u2019s father testified at trial that he \u201ckept opening\u201d the door to the computer room because \u201cit seemed to keep getting closed.\u201d T.K stated that her brother left prior to the movie\u2019s end, and about five minutes later Nichols asked T.K if he could \u201ctouch her somewhere.\u201d After T.K asked Nichols where he wanted to touch her, he pointed to her \u201ccrotch area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b64 T.K said she did not know what to do but responded \u201cI guess.\u201d Nichols then asked T.K to pull her pants down, which she did. T.K says Nichols then touched her \u201cin her crotch,\u201d and \u201ckind of rub[ed], like in a circle.\u201d T.K stated Nichols was using his \u201cpointer finger\u201d and was \u201ckind of digging.\u201d T.K stated Nichols then asked how it felt, to which she responded \u201cit kind of hurts.\u201d T.K asserts Nichols then offered her $10 to \u201clet [him] play with it.\u201d Nichols told T.K he did not mean to make her uncomfortable, but she could \u201ctouch [his].\u201d T.K then said \u201c[n]o, that\u2019s gross\u201d and pulled her pants back up, at which point they continued watching the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b65 T.K stated that later she felt uncomfortable and left to join the rest of her family across the hall in the family room. Nichols followed her to the family room shortly thereafter. T.K stated she did not tell anyone immediately because she felt \u201cawkward\u201d and did not want to talk about it. T.K was examined by Debbie Mulcahy, an emergency room nurse and sexual assault nurse examiner, in March 2010. Mulcahy found T.K to have a \u201cnormal examination,\u201d which she found unsurprising because injuries are typically observed in only three to five percent of sexual assault patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b66 Nichols wasinterviewedbyDetectiveBuls, an investigator with the Flathead County Sheriffs Office specializing in crimes against children. Nichols told Buis he had only lived at T.K\u2019s house for a few weeks because his relationship with her parents was strained. During the interview, Nichols confirmed he had watched a movie with T.K and her brother in the computer room and had been alone with her at some point.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b67 Nichols was charged by Information with the offense of Sexual Assault and arrested. The State amended the Information to also charge Nichols with Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. While awaitingtrial, Nichols was incarcerated and housed with several other inmates who later testified concerning an alleged confession by Nichols and about his telephone conversations with Kay Lynn. The trial commenced on November 28,2011, and three days later the jury found Nichols guilty of both counts. Nichols appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b68 District Courts are vested with broad discretion in controlling the admission of evidence at trial. <em>Seltzer v. </em>Morton, 2007 MT 62, \u00b6 65, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. When reviewing a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, this Court determines only whether a lower court abused its discretion. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. When a court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b69 <em>1. Did the District Court err by allowing the State to elicit testimony regarding Nichols\u2019 sexual habits?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b610 At trial, the State elicited testimony about the personal sexual habits of Nichols, his allegedly strained relationship with T.K.\u2019s parents, and his prior work history. Because our holding is based on the testimony about Nichols\u2019 sexual habits, our discussion will focus on that testimony. Nichols objected to the questions regarding this evidence, but his objections were overruled based on the prosecution\u2019s position that defense counsel had opened the door to the questioning during his opening statement by stating that Nichols had no reason to molest T.K. because of his \u201chealthy, active sex life with Kay Lynn ... .\u201d Nichols argues the evidence was irrelevant and admitted for the purposes of alienating the jury and obtaining a conviction in a weak case. He argues that, even if relevant, the evidence should have been excluded under M. R. Evid. 403 as unfairly prejudicial. The challenged testimony was elicited from the following witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">1. Kay Lynn</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">\u00b611 The State pursued invasive questioning of Nichols\u2019 girlfriend, Kay Lynn, during its direct examination of her. Nichols\u2019 objections are here omitted and instead discussed below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">Q. Okay. Isn\u2019t it true, though, that there\u2019s been times in the past when [Nichols] cheated on you, that despite your healthy sexual lifestyle he\u2019s gone off and done stuff with other girls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">Q. That\u2019s not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">Q. Okay. So there wasn\u2019t a time that you walked in on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">A. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but no, they weren\u2019t doing anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-19\">Q. Okay. There wasn\u2019t a time when Tom and another girl were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>doing something, you walked in, and he asked you to join?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Q. Okay. So if the two of you \u2014 if Tom and you had a discussion over a recorded jail call about an incident like that you both would have been just out of your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">A. No. What happened was completely different than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Q. What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">A. Well, sometimes when we were doing stuff we had other people, but it was always between both of us, you know, like we would discuss it first, he never cheated on me. But\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">Q. So this incident when you\u2019re on the tape and you tell him \"remember the time that I walked in, you were doing stuff, but I was on the rag\u201d \u2014 meaning on your period, so you couldn\u2019t participate, and so you left and they just continued doing stuff? Do you remember telling that? Because I can play the tape if you like. A. But they stopped when I said that I was on the rag....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Q. Okay. Did Tom ever talk to you about doing \u2014 doing unusual sexual things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">A. Um, can you define unusual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">Q* I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">A. To an extent, but like \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I consider what we do kind of unusual, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-15\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">A. \u2014nothing, like, really unusual, like\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-17\">Q. Okay. Do you know what fisting is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-18\">A. Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-19\">Q. Do you know what fisting is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-21\">Q. Did you ever talk with Tom about fisting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-22\">A. Sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-23\">Q. Do you know what red wings are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-25\">Q. Okay, Tom indicated there was a time when the two of you engaged in sexual activities and you were on your period, and that was considered red wings. Do you recall what Tom said as far as payback?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-26\">Q. Do you recall him saying that he would be inside of you during your period and then he would make you suck his penis and lick it off?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-27\">\u00b612 Defense counsel objected to the State\u2019s asking whether Nichols had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201cgone off and done stuff with other girls.\u201d The State responded that the defense had opened the door to questions about Nichols\u2019 private sex life, referencing defense counsel\u2019s reference to Nichols\u2019 \u201chealthy, active sex life\u201d during his opening statement. The State further argued the testimony was relevant because it \u201cquestions impeachment with regards to this witness and whether or not she\u2019s being forthright, it also is relevant with respect to whether or not Tom has gone searching around for other women despite his relationship with [Kay Lynn].\u201d Overruling the objection, the District Court urged the State to \u201ckeep it within a certain range.\u201d After the State\u2019s questions concerning fisting and menstrual sex, defense counsel again objected, arguing the testimony was irrelevant. The court overruled the objection, stating only that Kay Lynn was \u201can adverse witness obviously.\u201d A recording of a conversation between Kay Lynn and Nichols discussing sexual matters was then played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b613 On appeal, the State acknowledges that the relevance of some of Kay Lynn\u2019s testimony was \u201ctenuous,\u201d but argues the questions were relevant due to defense counsel's opening statement comment, which suggested he was prepared to open up at least some aspects of his sexual relationship with Kay Lynn. The State argues the testimony was related to Kay Lynn\u2019s potential bias as a witness, which was consistent with the District Court\u2019s statement that she was an adverse witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State further argues the questioning was harmless, as there was no reasonable possibility the evidence of Nichols\u2019 private sexual practices influenced his conviction, given the sufficiency of evidence to convict him without the disputed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">2. Noah Powell</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b614 Noah Powell had been in custody with Nichols and was called by the State. Powell testified that he had overheard Nichols call Kay Lynn a \u201cslut\u201d and sometimes told her to \u201cshut up.\u201d Nichols objected to the testimony on relevancy grounds. The State responded that the testimony was offered in response to defense counsel\u2019s reference in his opening statement to Nichols\u2019 active and healthy sex life with Kay Lynn. The court overruled the objection and Powell continued to testify that Nichols yelled at Kay Lynn on the phone and used foul language.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b615 The State contends the testimony about Nichols and Kay Lynn\u2019s relationship was relevant because Nichols may have dominated Kay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Lynn to the point that he could force her to testify in his favor, and was necessary to demonstrate Kay Lynn\u2019s bias in theorizing that T.K. was simply reiterating her own story of molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">3. Darren Reid and Brian Nauman</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">\u00b616 Darren Reid had been incarcerated with Nichols prior to trial and was called by the defense. During the State\u2019s cross-examination, Reid was asked questions about telephone conversations he overheard between Nichols and Kay Lynn. Specifically, Reid was asked whether he overheard Nichols asking Kay Lynn to bring sex toys when visiting him, referring to himself as \u201c[Kay Lynn\u2019s] master,\u201d and discussing how he embellished letters to Kay Lynn with sexually explicit comments. Nichols objected to this line of questioning, but the District Court overruled the objection. The State concedes that Nichols\u2019 objection should have been sustained because the door to character evidence testimony had not yet been opened, but contends that the error was harmless because the testimony was not admitted to prove an element of the charges and was cumulative of evidence properly admitted elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b617 Brian Nauman was also an inmate with Nichols and testified on his behalf. During cross-examination, the State pursued a similar line of questioning, again asking about Nichols\u2019 sextoy requests, the references to being Kay Lynn\u2019s \u201cmaster,\u201d and the sexually explicit messages written to Kay Lynn. Additionally, the State asked Nauman if he had ever heard Nichols degrade women, to which Nauman answered in the negative. The State argues the testimony was proper because Nauman had referred to Nichols as a \u201cgood Christian\u201d during his direct examination, thus opening the door to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b618 Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible under M. R. Evid. 402. M. R. Evid. 403 provides that evidence, even if relevant, may be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u00b619  Throughout the course of Nichols\u2019 trial, the State succeeded in eliciting testimony about Nichols\u2019 private sexual habits. While defense counsel\u2019s opening remarks about Nichols\u2019 active sex life with Kay Lynn may have opened the door to some scrutiny about the truth of that statement, the State\u2019s questioning about the details of the couple\u2019s variant sexual practices was inflammatory and unfairly prejudicial. The District Court attempted to keep the questioning \u201cwithin a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>range,\u201d but the State, given an inch, took a mile. While the intertwined questioning about Nichols\u2019potential dominance over Kay Lynn may well have been relevant to establishing the motivation for, or bias in, Kay Lynn\u2019s testimony, or that Nichols was searching for other sexual partners, those points could have been explored without delving into the exacting details of the couple\u2019s sexual habits. We must conclude that the admission of this testimony was an abuse of discretion by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b620 The State argues the error was not reversible, and \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, provides that a cause \u201cmay not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d We held in <em>State v. Gray, </em>207 Mont. 261, 268, 673 P.2d 1262, 1266 (1983), that an error requires reversal if a reasonable possibility exists that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to a conviction. In <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001MT 184, \u00b6 37, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735, this Court adopted a two-step analysis to be used when determining whether an alleged error prejudiced a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and is thus reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b621 First, error must be categorized as either \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37, 43. \u201cStructural error\u201d is reversible without additional review and encompasses such problems as error in the jury selection process, total depravation of the right to counsel, and lack of an impartial trial judge. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39. \u201cTrial error\u201d commonly occurs dining the presentation of a case to a jury and is not presumptively prejudicial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Here, the improper admission of the testimony was trial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b622 Next, it must be determined whether a reasonable possibility exists that the evidence might have contributed to the conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42. In making this determination, we utilize the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test, which asks whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence proving the same facts as the tainted evidence. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. If the evidence at issue does not go to the proof of an element of the charged crime and there is no other admissible evidence tending to prove the particular fact at issue, the admission of the evidence will only be deemed harmless if the State demonstrates there was no reasonable possibility the admission contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. Such is the case here: the State must \u201cdemonstrate that, qualitatively, there was no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction....\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b623  Given our conclusion that the tainted evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>inflammatory in nature, this is a difficult burden for the State to carry. <em>Van </em>Kirk, \u00b6 46. Further, the State\u2019s case was not overwhelmingly strong. Given the inconclusive physical examination, the key evidence was T.K\u2019s testimony and the challenged testimony of two witnesses who testified to hearing Nichols admit to the crime while incarcerated. We conclude that the tainted evidence about Nichols\u2019 sexual habits likely contributed to his conviction. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b624 <em>2. Did the District Court err by allowing a primary investigator to act as both a representative of the State and a witness during trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ab9\">\u00b625 While our reversal under the first issue obviates the need to address the other issues presented, we take this opportunity to address the second issue in order to provide guidance in this matter in the event of retrial, and to clarify our holding in a previous case. <em>See K&amp;R P\u2019ship v. City ofWhitefish, </em>2008 MT 228, \u00b6 39, 334 Mont. 336, 189 P.3d 593 (\u201cTo provide guidance upon remand, we continue our review of the remaining issues on appeal.\u201d). M. R. Evid. 615 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">At the request of a party, the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize the exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b626  We held in <em>Faulconbridge v. State, </em>2006 MT 198, \u00b6 53, 333 Mont. 186, 142 P.3d 777, that the language of Rule 615 permits a validly designated representative to remain in the courtroom during trial and testify. Here, the State cited <em>Faulconbridge </em>as precedent to utilize Detective Buis as both a designated representative of the State and a witness. Detective Buis was allowed to remain in the courtroom even when other witnesses were excluded. Nichols argues that our holding in <em>Faulconbridge </em>is not applicable to criminal proceedings because it was a civil matter involving only money damages. The State disagrees, noting that <em>Faulconbridge </em>overruled two criminal cases in which the use of a law enforcement officer as a designated representative and witness had been prohibited. We agree. <em>Faulconbridge </em>explicitly overruled two prior criminal cases analogous to the case here. Our intention to apply the holding to both civil and criminal cases was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b627 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> Kay Lynn testified that she had been molested by a cousin as a young girl and had relayed the story to T.K. as a cautionary tale.

The prosecution thus asked and was granted leave to treat her as an adverse witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
