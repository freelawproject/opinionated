The remaining terms and conditions shall remain as imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">On December 31, 2013, the prior sentence imposed on December 18, 2007, was revoked. The Defendant was sentenced for Count I: Theft, a felony, in violation of Section 45-6-301(8), MCA to Five (5) years to Department of Corrections with Two (2) years suspended; the Court recommends to the Department that Defendant be screened for placement in the Intensive Supervision Program; receive credit for time served of 241 days; this sentence shall run consecutive to the sentence Defendant is currently serving from Cascade County; the terms and conditions of the deferred or suspended portion of this Judgment are the same as those contained in the Judgment filed on December 26, 2007; and other terms and conditions given in the Judgment on December 31,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">On May 8,2014, the Defendant\u2019s Application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court (hereafter \u201cthe Division\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">The Defendant was present and appeared by Vision Net from the Great Falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Regional Prison in Great Falls, Montana.

The State was not represented.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AaX\">DATED this 28th day of May, 2014.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Before hearing the Application, the Defendant was advised that the Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Rule 12, Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana, provides that, \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct. The sentence shall not be reduced or increased unless it is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive. With respect to the Defendant\u2019s argument concerning jail credit, the Defendant\u2019s arguments could be presented in a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief if it is deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Division that the sentence shall be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Done in open Court this 8th day of May, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-10\">Chairperson, Hon.
