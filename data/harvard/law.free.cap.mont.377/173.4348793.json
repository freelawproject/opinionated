We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">\n<em>1. Whether Garner\u2019s motion to withdraw plea was time-barred</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred when it concluded Garner\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">\u00b63 Gamer is a developmental^ disabled 40-year-old man. In the summer of 2009, Gamer lived in a trailer at the Bitterroot Family Campground near Hamilton. He sometimes babysat four-year-old A.D., whose grandmother also lived in the campground. In October 2009, A.D. disclosed to his mother that Gamer had put his mouth on A.D.\u2019s penis. During a forensic interview the following month, A.D. used dolls to demonstrate that Gamer had touched A.D.\u2019s penis with his hand, put his mouth on A.D.\u2019s penis, placed his penis in A.D.\u2019s mouth, and inserted his penis into A.D.\u2019s rectum or buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">\u00b64 On November 19, 2009, Detective Jesse Jessop of the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office interviewed Gamer. Gamer said he remembered spending time with A.D. the previous summer. Gamer initially denied the allegations of sexual conduct, saying he could not remember because of his \u201cbrain problems.\u201d As the interview progressed, Detective Jessop asked Gamer if he had touched AD.\u2019s penis with his hand. Gamer nodded his head, indicating an affirmative response. A few minutes later, Detective Jessop repeated the question. Gamer again nodded his head. Gamer continued to deny the allegations of oral and anal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">\u00b65 On December 4,2009, Gamer was charged with three counts of felony sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503(1), (4), MCA (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His initial appearance was set for December 10, 2009. Gamer was represented at that appearance by Nick Miller. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Miller advised the court of Gamer\u2019s possible disability, and requested a continuance of the initial appearance to allow an evaluation of his fitness to proceed. At the continued initial appearance on December 22, 2009, Gamer was represented by David Stenerson. Stenerson informed the court that a full evaluation had not yet been completed, but that Gamer appeared to have \u201can obvious difficulty with reading and retention and understanding difficult tasks ... .\u201d Defense counsel retained a psychiatrist to perform a \u201cfull-blown evaluation\u201d to address \u201coverall mental disease and defect.\u201d Dr. Paul Moomaw evaluated Gamer and determined that he was fit to proceed to trial, although he scored \u201cvery low\u201d on language intelligence testing. Dr. Moomaw did not issue a written report, but informed defense counsel of his findings. \u00b66 At Gamer\u2019s arraignment on February 11,2010, Stenerson advised the District Court that Dr. Moomaw had \u201ccome to the conclusion that [Gamer] can proceed with trial, and we\u2019ll withdraw any objection to that at this point.\u201d Gamer initialed and signed an acknowledgement of rights form. The District Court asked Gamer if he had any concerns about his ability to proceed, and Gamer said he did not. Gamer also said he understood his rights, felt comfortable asking questions of his attorney, and understood the arraignment proceeding. Gamer was informed that he was charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, each of which was punishable by a term of 100 years. Gamer pled not guilty to each count and said he understood the maximum punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b67 On June 15,2010, the State filed an amended information adding a charge of felony sexual assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502(1), (3), MCA. On June 18,2010, Gamer was informed that if convicted of that charge, he could receive life imprisonment or a prison sentence of not less than four years or more than 100 years. Gamer said he understood the charge and the maximum possible punishment. He pled not guilty to the charge of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b68 A jury trial began on September 7, 2010. Stenerson and Miller represented Gamer during the trial. On the third day of trial, Gamer agreed to plead guilty to sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(1), (3), MCA, in exchange for which the State agreed to dismiss the three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. Gamer signed a plea agreement, guilty plea, and waiver of rights. The agreement was an \u201copen plea,\u201d meaning that the State did not agree to make any particular sentencing recommendation and remained free to argue for the maximum possible sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b69 The plea agreement, guilty plea, and waiver of rights were submitted to the District Court. The District Court questioned Gamer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>extensively to determine Ms understanding of the proceedings. Gamer said he had understood most of the trial so far, and had been able to rely on Ms attorneys to explain things to him. He said he felt comfortable asking Ms attorneys for an explanation if he had difficulty understanding anything about the change of plea process. The District Court asked Gamer if he wanted to speak to Ms attorney before proceeding, and Gamer said he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b610 The District Court then explained the charge of sexual assault and the possible penalty of not less than four years or more than 100 years. Gamer said he understood the maximum possible penalty. The District Court asked Gamer if he was entering Ms plea voluntarily, and Gamer said yes. The District Court asked Gamer if he believed the plea was in Ms best interests, and he said yes. Gamer said he had been given sufficient time to review Ms rights with Ms attorneys, and had no questions about them. He agreed he had full knowledge of the rights he was waiving. He said he was satisfied with the services of Ms attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b611 Stenerson then questioned Gamer about the factual basis for the plea. Gamer said he touched A.D.\u2019s penis with Ms hand during the summer of2009, when A.D. was four years old. The District Court then additionally advised Gamer that because the victim was under 16 years of age, Gamer would be required to serve at least 30 days in jail. The State then recited the terms of the plea, including Gamer\u2019s understanding and agreement that he could not withdraw Ms plea once entered. The District Court accepted the plea, ordered a psychosexual evaluation, and dismissed the three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The jury was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b612 Dr. Robert Page conducted the psychosexual evaluation. Dr. Page observed that Gamer presented with some cognitive delays wMch may affect Ms comprehension, and therefore recommended a full neuropsychological evaluation. Dr. Page concluded that Gamer was dependent on others and tended to seek reassurance. During the evaluation, Gamer was able to describe the allegations against him. He understood that as part of Ms plea agreement, if he admitted to sexual assault, the State would dismiss the other charges. Gamer could not tell Dr. Page the potential sentence for sexual assault, and said he wanted to go home to care for Ms cats. Gamer was aware Dr. Moomaw had evaluated him and found Mm fit for trial, and Gamer said he felt \u201csomewhat capable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b613 A neuropsychological evaluation was performed by Dr. Paul Bach. Dr. Bach concluded that Gamer\u2019s cognitive abilities were in the low-average range. He concluded Gamer was not mentally retarded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>although he was functioning at a \u201cborderline abnormal level.\u201d Dr. Bach observed that Gamer was competent with hands-on tasks and capable of learning, but at a disadvantage when required to \u201cmentally conceptualize with language.\u201d Dr. Bach concluded that Gamer read at a seventh-grade level, which was a fair indication of his cognitive level in most life situations. Dr. Bach described Gamer as an \u201cextraordinarily simple, unbright individual who is significantly depressed and anxious at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b614 A sentencing hearing was held on March 22, 2011. During the hearing, Stenerson objected to the State\u2019s presentation of evidence, arguing that it amounted to \u201cretrying this case; and if that is the case, I think I need to ask to withdraw the guilty plea and go to trial.\u201d The District Court admitted the disputed exhibits, but declined to consider withdrawal of the plea absent a written motion. Stenerson requested a continuance to consider whether to file a motion to withdraw plea. Stenerson later advised the court administrator that he would not move to withdraw. The sentencing hearing resumed on April 6,2011. At that hearing, Stenerson informed the court that, despite his earlier representation to the court administrator, after further conversations with Gamer, he did not believe Gamer knew what he was doing when he entered the guilty plea. Stenerson said Gamer would \u201csay almost anything you ask him to say if you ask him a question in the right way.\u201d Stenerson asked the court for permission to withdraw the guilty plea. The District Court responded, again, that it would not rule on the request without a written motion and a hearing. Stenerson agreed to proceed with sentencing and file a written motion to withdraw Gamer\u2019s plea at a later date. The State recommended a sentence of 40 years with 20 years suspended. Stenerson asked the District Court to impose a 10-year commitment to the Department of Corrections, with all time suspended. Stenerson acknowledged the four-year mandatory minimum, but asked the District Court for an exception based on Gamer\u2019s cognitive disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b615 The District Court sentenced Gamer to 40 years at the Montana State Prison, with 20 of those years suspended. Gamer was required to complete Phases 1 and 2 of the sexual offender treatment program before being considered eligible for parole. The written judgment, issued April 27, 2011, incorrectly stated that Gamer would be committed to the Department of Corrections, rather than the Montana State Prison, and did not include the parole restriction. On the State\u2019s motion, an amended judgment reflecting these conditions was issued July 12,2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b616 On July 9,2012, nearly one year after the issuance of the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>judgment, Gamer, represented by new counsel, moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The State opposed Gamer\u2019s motion, arguing that the motion was untimely and that Gamer\u2019s plea had been entered voluntarily. An evidentiary hearing was held September 5, 2012. Gamer did not challenge the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the finding that he was competent to stand trial, and stated that the only issue was whether the plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Gamer\u2019s trial attorneys, Miller and Stenerson, testified at the hearing. \u00b617 Miller testified that during his conversations with Gamer, it was \u201cvery questionable what [Gamer] understood about ... the full consequences of what would happen.\u201d Miller said Gamer\u2019s understanding of the legal process \u201cseemed a little tenuous.\u201d Miller acknowledged that during the trial, he had only \u201csmall, casual conversations\u201d with Gamer. He said he was aware that Gamer had been found fit to proceed, and that he had not raised any concerns about Gamer\u2019s ability to enter a voluntary plea either with Stenerson or before the court. Miller also acknowledged that Gamer received a benefit from the plea agreement. Miller said he believed there was a significant difference between fitness to proceed and the ability to enter a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary guilty plea. When asked by the District Court, however, Miller said he was expressing his own opinion and knew of no legal authority supporting a distinction between fitness to proceed and the ability to enter a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b618 Stenerson testified that after his initial meetings with Gamer, it was obvious that he \u201cwas fimctioning at a lower level.\u201d Stenerson ordered the fitness to proceed evaluation and withdrew any question about fitness to proceed after learning the results. Despite this, Stenerson said he continued to have personal doubts. Notwithstanding those doubts, Stenerson said he informed the District Court at the change of plea that he did not have any reservations about Gamer\u2019s ability to enter a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea. When asked if that was correct at the time, Stenerson replied, \u201cLegally, yes. In my heart, no.\u201d Stenerson acknowledged, \u201cThe doctor said he was fit to proceed, and that\u2019s a legal issue, and there was no argument about that from me.\u201d He described a \u201cgut feeling\u201d that Gamer did not fully understand the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b619 Gamer testified at the evidentiary hearing and said he remembered some of his conversations with Stenerson about what would happen if he lost at trial. He remembered the judge asking him questions at the change of plea, and said he thought he understood the questions, but was a little confused. He understood that by entering a plea agreement, he would not go to trial and would not be able to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>witnesses in his defense. He said he thought he was going to go home and be on probation after entering a plea, because Stenerson \u201cdid a note thing on recommended, like for me to go home and be on like a probation for like 10 years.\u201d Gamer said he did not understand a mandatory minimum sentence. He said he did understand when Stenerson explained to him that if he lost at trial, he could be sentenced to life in prison or 100 years, which he said was \u201ca long time. That\u2019s definitely life.\u201d He said that when he heard he had heen sentenced to a commitment of 40 years with 20 years suspended, he thought, \u201cMan, that\u2019s 60 years.\u201d He later understood that was not the case, saying, \u201cDave Stenerson explained that stuff to me. And I was like, Man, well, it\u2019s still pretty bad.\u201d Gamer was also \u00e1ble to name the medications he was taking, describe their purposes and how long he had been taking them, and to clarify for the court that \u201cbuspirone\u201d was the generic equivalent of the drug BuSpar.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b620 The District Court found Garner\u2019s motion timely because it was brought within one year of the date of the amended judgment. The District Court refused to allow Gamer to withdraw his guilty plea, however, finding it had been entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. The District Court considered the adequacy of the plea colloquy, the benefit Gamer obtained as a result of the plea agreement, the fitness to proceed evaluation by Dr. Moomaw, the evaluations by Drs. Page and Bach, and Gamer\u2019s own testimony and demeanor at the evidentiary hearing. The District Court also made note of an observation in the pre-sentence investigation report to the effect that Gamer \u201chas learned to use his mental impairment to serve his interests,\u201d and seemed capable of rememberingmore than he admitted. The District Court found \u201cnothing to suggest any infirmity in Gamer\u2019s plea process.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b621 We review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254. The ultimate issue of the voluntariness of a guilty plea is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u00b622 <em>1. Whether Gamer\u2019s motion to withdraw plea was time-barred. </em>\u00b623 As a threshold matter, we address the State\u2019s argument that Gamer\u2019s motion to withdraw plea was barred by \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>which allows a plea to be withdrawn within one year after judgment becomes final. A judgment becomes final when the time for appeal to this Court expires. Section 46-16-105(2)(a), MCA. In a criminal case, an appeal must be taken within 60 days of entry of the final judgment. M. R. App. P. 4(5)(b). The original written judgment was entered on April 27, 2011. Thus, the State argues, Gamer\u2019s motion was time-barred as of June 27,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b624 We agree with the District Court that the amended judgment, issued July 12, 2011, was the final judgment in this case. <em>See State v. Ringewold, </em>2001 MT 185, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 306 Mont. 229, 32 P.3d 729 (considering timely appeal from amended judgment issued in 1999, although original judgment had been issued in 1995 and amended judgment was specifically made effective as of the 1995 date); <em>McKinster v. Great N. Ry., </em>67 Mont. 134, 136, 218 P. 87, 87-88 (1923) (rejecting argument that appeal from amended judgment, taken only two days after entry, was untimely because the time for appeal from the original judgment had expired). Gamer\u2019s motion to withdraw plea, filed July 9, 2012, was therefore within the period contemplated by \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b625 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred when it concluded Garner\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b626  A guilty plea is a waiver of constitutional rights, and must be a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent act. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1469 (1970). \u201cThe voluntariness of a plea \u2019can be determined only by considering all of the relevant circumstances surrounding it.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>2008 MT 328, \u00b6 15, 346 Mont. 150, 194 P.3d 643 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 749, 90 S. Ct. at 1469). A court may allow a guilty plea to be withdrawn \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Section 46-16-105(2), MCA. Good cause includes the involuntariness of the plea. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 16. In determining whether a plea was entered voluntarily, we examine \u201ccase-specific considerations\u201d including the adequacy of the plea colloquy, the benefit the defendant obtained from the plea agreement, and the timing of the motion to withdraw. <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 166, 176 P.3d 1057; <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 397, 121 P.3d 521. If the defendant was aware of the consequences of the plea, and if the plea was not induced by threats, misrepresentation, or improper promises, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw plea. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32 <em>(citingBrady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u00b627 A defendant must be mentally competent to enter a guilty plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>just as he must be competent to stand trial. <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 214, 108 P.3d 500 (citing <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 398-99, 113 S. Ct. 2680, 2686 (1993)), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Brinson, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 136, 210 P.3d 164. A defendant is competent when he is able \u201c \u2018to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2019 \u201d and \u201c T\u00edas a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Garner, </em>2001 MT 222, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 462, 36 P.3d 346 (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 789 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b628 Gamer does not challenge the finding that he was competent under this standard to enter a guilty plea; rather, he claims the District Court failed to adequately consider the additional question of whether, though competent, he acted voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently when he pled guilty. Additionally, Gamer has not challenged the adequacy of the plea colloquy. <em>See McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 17. Garner received a significant benefit from the plea agreement, which resulted in dismissal of three felony counts of sexual intercourse without consent. <em>See Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 14. Gamer\u2019s motion to withdraw plea, although within the statutory period as previously noted, was filed nearly two years after his plea was entered. We have previously found that such a delay may weigh against the defendant. <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 19. In the present circumstances, however, the District Court \u201caccordted] some weight\u201d to the fact that Gamer had raised the possibility of withdrawing his plea at the time of sentencing, and appeared to have \u201ccontinuously contemplated\u201d such action. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing indicated that a portion of the delay was attributable to Miller\u2019s efforts to secure outside counsel for Gamer in order to avoid conflicts of interest. We agree with the District Court that \u201c[considering the totality of the circumstances, this timeliness factor marginally weighs in Gamer\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b629 Gamer argues that due to his low verbal intelligence, as observed by the three doctors who evaluated him during the proceedings, his plea was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. We have stated that the defendant must be \u201cfully aware\u201d of the direct consequences of pleading guilty and must \u201cunderstand\u201d the rights and protections being waived. <em>Humphrey, </em>\u00b6 22. But the record here does not support Gamer\u2019s claim that he did not understand the consequences of entering a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b630 Gamer adequately demonstrated and affirmed his understanding of the proceedings at various points, for example, by informing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>District Court during his change of plea that he understood aspects of the proceedings like jury selection. During his evaluation with Dr. Page, Gamer understood and was able to describe the factual basis of the allegations against him as well as the terms of his plea agreement. At the evidentiary hearing, Gamer accurately remembered that his counsel had recommended a 10-year suspended sentence. Gamer characterized this as a recommendation, and not a promise of any kind. He also remembered that the State had requested a 40-year sentence with 20 years suspended. He said that although he was initially confused about the net effect of that sentence, he understood it after his attorney explained it to him. On appeal, Gamer claims he did not understand that he would be subject to a four-year mandatory minimum sentence, but he was informed of this during the initial appearance, the change of plea, and again at the sentencing hearing. \u00b631 Gamer claims he did not understand the consequences of his plea, because the District Court incorrectly informed him at the change of plea hearing that he would be required to serve 30 days of imprisonment. If the victim is under 16 years of age, the first 30 days of a sentence imposed for sexual intercourse without consent may not be suspended or deferred. Section 46-18-205(1), MCA. If the victim is under 16 years of age and the offender is three or more years older than the victim, the first two years of a sentence imposed for sexual assault may not be suspended or deferred unless a statutory exception applies. Section 46-18-205(2), MCA. Gamer pled guilty to sexual assault, not sexual intercourse without consent; therefore, the first two years of his imprisonment could not be suspended unless otherwise provided. Section 46-18-205(2), MCA. The District Court mistakenly advised Gamer that he would be required to serve 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b632 Although Gamer failed to object to the District Court\u2019s misstatement during the change of plea, did not raise the statements as an issue during the District Court\u2019s consideration of his motion to withdraw plea, and has repeatedly acknowledged that the District Court\u2019s colloquy was adequate, he now claims the mistaken advisement supports his contention that he was confused about the consequences of his plea. Gamer claims this confusion led him to erroneously believe there was a possibility that he could receive a fully suspended sentence. This belief was not, however, erroneous. As Gamer correctly recalled at the evidentiary hearing, his attorney recommended a fully suspended 10-year sentence. Although the first two years of Gamer\u2019s sentence could not ordinarily be suspended under \u00a7 46-18-205(2), MCA, the requirements of that section are subject to statutory exceptions listed at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA. Thus, Gamer could have received a fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>suspended sentence based on his mental capacity at the time of the offense. Section 46-18-222(2), MCA. This argument was made by Gamer\u2019s attorney at the time of sentencing. The record demonstrates that despite the District Court\u2019s mistaken reference to \u00a7 46-18-205(1), MCA, Gamer accurately understood the sentencing possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b633 Dr. Bach found that Garner, although \u201cunbright,\u201d was not mentally retarded. At the evidentiary hearing, Gamer was able to recollect his evaluation with Dr. Bach in detail, and to describe lucidly and accurately the medications he was taking. Neither Miller nor Stenerson was able to articulate any objective basis for concluding that Gamer was incapable of understanding the change of plea, relying instead on \u201cgut feeling.\u201d The District Court, having observed Gamer\u2019s demeanor and testimony at the evidentiary hearing as well as throughout earlier proceedings, found credible the observation in the pre-sentence investigation report that Gamer was capable of remembering and understanding more than he acknowledged, and sometimes claimed not to remember things that were not to his benefit. \u00b634 [2] Gamer affirmed to the District Court during the change of plea that he understood the proceedings; that he was satisfied with the services of his attorneys, who explained to him anything he did not understand; that he understood his rights; that he believed entering a plea of guilty was in his best interests; and that he entered such a plea voluntarily. The record demonstrates that Gamer understood the consequences of his decision to plead guilty, and his plea was not induced by any threats, misrepresentation, or improper promises. <em>See Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Gamer\u2019s motion to withdraw plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-16\"> We apply the 2007 version of the Montana Code Annotated, which was in effect at the time of Gamer\u2019s offense.
