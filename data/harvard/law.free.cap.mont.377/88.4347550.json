The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Rule 12, Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana, provides that, \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct. The sentence shall not be reduced or increased unless it is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">It is the unanimous decision of the Division that the Defendant\u2019s sentence is not clearly excessive or clearly inadequate. At the request of the Defendant and with concurrence from the Sentencing Judge, Hon. John Larson, Probation Conditions No. 16 and 17 shall be amended. Probation Conditions No. 16 and 17 require the Defendant to submit to Chemical Dependency and Mental Health Evaluations from qualified professional persons or programs and to follow the aftercare treatment recommendedby such evaluations. It is the decision of the Division that the Defendant will not be required to complete those evaluations unless his probation officer determines that updated evaluations are necessary to promote effective probation supervision. The record shows that the Defendant obtained those evaluations prior to the time of sentencing. The remaining sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Done in open Court this 7th day of August 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Chairperson, Hon. Brad Newman, Member Hon.
