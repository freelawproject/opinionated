The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Johnston\u2019s discovery requests for information contained in the DPHHS files of his victims without first conducting an in camera review.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">\u00b62 Johnston was charged with three counts of incest, one count of solicitation, and one count of sexual abuse of children. Johnston\u2019s counsel moved to compel discovery of records related to the ongoing DPHHS case involving the two victims. The District Court denied the motion without conducting an in camera review. Johnston was convicted of two counts of incest, one count of solicitation, and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>count of sexual abuse of children. On appeal from those convictions, Johnston requests that we remand this case to the District Court for an in camera review of the victims\u2019 DPHHS files for relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b63 In <em>State v. Little, </em>we dealt with the same circumstances at issue in this case. <em>State v. Little, </em>260 Mont. 460, 466-67, 861 P.2d 154, 158 (1993). Little moved for discovery of the victims\u2019 DPHHS (then DFS) files. The district court denied tire motion without conducting an in camera review. Little was convicted and appealed the denial of his motion. This Court issued an interlocutory appellate order requiring the district court to conduct an in camera review of the victims\u2019 DPHHS files and enter appropriate findings regarding whether the files contained information relevant to Little\u2019s defense. We relied on \u00a7 41-3-205(2), MCA, which provides that DPHHS records may be disclosed to a court for an in camera review if relevant to an issue before it. As we noted in that order, \u201cthe District Court should have conducted an in camera inspection of the files before ruling on the Defendant\u2019s discovery request, and the result ofthat inspection and the files should be before this Court as a part of the record on appeal on this issue.\u201d <em>State v. Little, </em>Order, June 23, 1993, DA 92-560.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b64 The State makes two arguments in opposition to Johnston\u2019s request for an in camera review of the DPHHS files. First, the State argues that Johnston may not ask for in camera review on appeal because he did not ask the District Court to review the files in camera. Although this is correct, we find this argument unpersuasive in light of the fact that when it opposed Johnston\u2019s motion to compel, the State itself proposed that the District Court conduct an in camera review. Moreover, when the District Court denied Johnston\u2019s motion to compel, its only stated rationale was: \u201cThe authority and rationale in [the State\u2019s] answer brief are adopted by the Court and incorporated herein by reference.\u201d Among the authority and rationale of the State\u2019s answer brief was a citation to <em>State v. Duffy, </em>which acknowledged that there are competing concerns between a defendant\u2019s right to exculpatory evidence contained in confidential records of victims, and victims\u2019 right to protect their confidential information. <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT186, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 300 Mont. 381, 6 P.3d 453. <em>Duffy </em>held, \u201cTo balance the relative interests of the defendant and the victim, the district court should review the confidential records in camera.\u201d <em>Duffy, </em>\u00b6 21. Thus, the District Court denied Johnston\u2019s motion to compel without first conducting an in camera review while citing, by reference, a case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>holds that the District Court should conduct an in camera review to determine whether a defendant is entitled to information in the confidential records of his alleged victims. Moreover, as a practical consideration, neither the District Court, nor this Court, can determine whether Johnston is entitled to any of the information in the DPHHS files in the absence of an in camera review.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b65 The State\u2019s second argument in opposition is that the prosecutor was not required to turn over the DPHHS files because they were not in her possession. In support of this argument, the State attempts to distinguish this case from our previous holding in <em>Little </em>by arguing that \u201cit appears that the prosecutors <em>inLittle </em>[already] had the DPHHS records in their possession.\u201d However, our order in <em>Little </em>that the District Court was required to conduct an in camera review of the DPHHS records neither discussed, nor was it premised on, whether or not the records were already in the prosecution\u2019s possession. The State\u2019s argument in this regard, therefore, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b66 In <em>Pennsylvania v. </em>Ritchie, the U.S. Supreme Court dealt with a similar issue involving files which were not within the possession of the prosecutor, but were within the possession of a state agency. The Court held that the defendant had a constitutional right to exculpatory evidence contained in the state Child and Youth Services (CYS) files of his alleged victims. <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 57, 107 S. Ct. 989, 1001 (1987). Notably, the defendant <em>w. Ritchie </em>had subpoenaed the files, but CYS refused to turn them over, citing a Pennsylvania statute that prevented the disclosure of CYS files in the interests of protecting sensitive information. On appeal, the Court noted that the statute provided an exception that allowed CYS to disclose files pursuant to court order. The Court determined that the appropriate procedure, therefore, was for the trial court to conduct an in camera reviewto determine whether there was any exculpatory evidence in the files. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 60-61, 107 S. Ct. at 1002-03. The Court held that such a procedure appropriately balanced the state\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting the contents of the files, with the defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process right to exculpatory information possessed by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b67 Two aspects of <em>Ritchie </em>are particularly salient to this case. First, the prosecution in <em>Ritchie, </em>as in this case, did not possess the files, nor had it seen them. The Court nonetheless held that the defendant had a constitutional light to exculpatory evidence that may be contained in the files and the appropriate procedure was for the trial court to conduct an in camera review to ascertain the existence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>evidence. Second, Ritchie subpoenaed the DYS files to no avail because a state statute prevented DYS from disclosing the files. In this case, the State contends that Johnston should have subpoenaed the DPHHS records. However, as was the case in Ritchie, DPHHS is prevented from disclosing its files to a defendant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-205(1), MCA (\u201cThe case records ... concerning actions taken under this chapter and all records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect must be kept confidential except as provided by this section.\u201d). Section 41-3-205(1), MCA, makes it a misdemeanor to disclose the files to anyone not specifically listed in the statute as authorized to receive child abuse and neglect reports. The only entities involved in a criminal case authorized to receive DPHHS files under \u00a7 41-3-205, MCA, are the prosecutor and the court. No exception is made for a subpoena from a criminal defense attorney. Thus, any subpoena from Johnston would have been futile, as it was in <em>Ritchie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b68 Since only the prosecutor and the court are authorized to receive DPHHS files, it was appropriate for Johnston to request the files from the prosecutor via discovery and, when the prosecutor refused to produce the files, to request an order from the court. Johnston\u2019s motion requested an order from the court \u201cpursuant to Section 46-15-322, M.C.A.\u201d Section 46-15-322(5), MCA, provides: \u201cUpon motion showing that the defendant has substantial need in the preparation of the case for additional material or information not otherwise provided for and that the defendant is unable, without undue hardship, to obtain the substantial equivalent by other means, the court, in its discretion, may order any person to make it available to the defendant.\u201d Although Johnston certainly could have more artfully made his case to the District Court, his motion nevertheless invoked the District Corut\u2019s authority to order the prosecution to obtain and disclose the DPHHS files that Johnston was statutorily foreclosed from obtaining on his own.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<otherdate id=\"b317-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>DATED this 16th day of December, 2014.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b69  Johnston\u2019s motion was sufficient to invoke his right to potentially exculpatory information in the DPHHS files. Once he invoked that right, it was the trial court\u2019s duty to conduct an in camera review to ascertain whether there was any exculpatory evidence in the files. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b610 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal be dismissed without prejudice, and the case remanded to the District Court to conduct an in camera review of the victims\u2019 DPHHS files. The District Court shall then enter findings and an order regarding whether or not the files contain information that should have been disclosed to Johnston and, contingent on those findings, shall entertain appropriate motions from the parties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\"> Johnston\u2019s motion to the District Court also requested materials from nongovernmental entities. Those materials are not at issue on appeal and this opinion and order addresses only materials and information in the possession and control ofthe State and which Johnston had no ability to otherwise obtain. We also note that nothing in this opinion and order requires the prosecution to seek out potentially exculpatory evidence in the possession of other agencies. <em>See McGarvey v. State, </em>2014 MT 189, 116, 375 Mont. 495, 329 P.3d 576 (\u201cAs a general rule, the State\u2019s obligation to disclose information under <em>Brady </em>does not impose a duty on the prosecutor or investigators to learn of information possessed by other jurisdictions or agencies that have no involvement in the investigation or prosecution at issue.\u201d). This opinion and order deals only with a specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>pretrial request for documents in the possession of a state agency that a defendant cannot obtain without the prosecutor\u2019s or the court\u2019s assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
