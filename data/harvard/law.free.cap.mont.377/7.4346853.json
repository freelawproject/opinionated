He was arraigned November 21, 2011, and trial was set for March 15,2012. At the pretrial hearing on February 29,2012, counsel for Christensen moved to postpone tibe trial date. The City Court reset the trial for May 10, 2012. The prosecution subsequently discovered Christensen had three prior DUIs, so the City Attorney filed a motion in City Court to transfer the case to the District Court. The City Court granted the motion to transfer and vacated the May 10,2012 trial date. The City Court did not, however, dismiss the misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b64 On May 23,2012, six months and two days after arraignment in City Court, the misdemeanor had not been dismissed, and the information had not been filed in the District Court. On that day, Christensen moved to dismiss on the basis that the misdemeanor was not brought to trial witMn six months of arraignment as required by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. The City responded by noting the case had been transferred to the District Court. Christensen objected, arguing the proper procedure is for the misdemeanor to be dismissed and an information filed in the District Court. Christensen argued that no legal procedure allows for a case to be initiated in the District Court upon a \u201ctransfer\u201d from a court of limited jurisdiction. The City Court denied Christensen\u2019s motion, holding there was no speedy trial violation because the case had been transferred to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u00b65 On July 5,2012, the State initiated the felony DUI charge by filing an affidavit and motion for leave to file an information in the District Court (DC 12-303). The City Court subsequently dismissed the misdemeanor charge without prejudice. Christensen filed a motion in the felony DUI case, arguing that the City Court erred when it denied Ms motion to dismiss for violation of \u00a7 46-13-401, MCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further argued that because the misdemeanor should have been dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>with prejudice, the felony DUI charge should be dismissed for violating double jeopardy. The District Court accepted Christensen\u2019s argument that the prosecution had failed to follow proper procedure when it transferred the case from City Court to District Court, but refused to dismiss a felony DUI simply because of a procedural flaw that did not affect Christensen\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b66 Christensen appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the felony DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b67 Whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated is a question of law, which we review to determine whether the District Court\u2019s interpretation of law is correct. <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Mr. Christensen\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon double jeopardy considerations and for lack of a speedy trial pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-13-401(2).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">\u00b69 On appeal, Christensen argues that: (1) the misdemeanor DUI should have been dismissed with prejudice for violating his misdemeanor speedy trial rights tinder \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA and (2) because the misdemeanor should have been dismissed with prejudice, the felony DUI charge should have been dismissed for violating double jeopardy. Since we find the speedy trial issue dispositive, we do not reach the double jeopardy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">\u00b610 Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, states, \u201cAfter the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.\u201d We have consistently held that dismissal under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA is appropriate \u201conly if two conditions are met: (1) the defendant has not asked for a postponement; and (2) the State has not shown good cause for the delay.\u201d <em>City of Helena v. Roan, </em>2010 MT 29, \u00b6 9, 355 Mont. 172, 226 P.3d 601; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>240 Mont. 235, 238, 784 P.2d 901, 903 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"A1N\">\u00b611  Christensen has no valid claim under \u00a7 46-13-401, MCA because the trial was postponed upon his own motion. <em>See State v. Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. 358, 362, 691 P.2d 1348, 1350 (1984) (\u201cIf the defendant requests the postponement the six-month trial deadline does not apply.\u201d). Christensen claims he never moved for a continuance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>This is incorrect. The record reflects that Christensen orally moved for a continuance of the City Court trial date at the pretrial hearing on February 29,2012. Christensen\u2019s counsel asked the City Court for a trial date in April or May because Christensen\u2019s counsel would be unavailable for the original trial date of March 15, 2012. The City Court granted Christensen\u2019s request to postpone the trial. Because the defendant asked for and received a postponement, he is not entitled to dismissal under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. Roan, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b612 The District Court did not consider Christensen\u2019s postponement of the trial when it denied his motion to dismiss, but it nonetheless reached the right result. It has long been our practice to uphold the District Court when it reached the right result, regardless of the District Court\u2019s rationale. <em>See e.g. State ex rel. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Great N. </em>Utils., 86 Mont. 442, 446, 284 P. 772, 773 (1930) (\u201cThe rule that an appellate court is not concerned with the reason given for a decision, and will therefore affirm a correct ruling regardless of the fact that the trial court gave a wrong reason therefor, is of almost universal application and has been followed in this jurisdiction on the consideration of eveiy conceivable species of decision which the trial court had authority to make....\u201d); <em>State v. Kenfield, </em>2009 MT 242, \u00b6 16, 351 Mont. 409, 213 P.3d 461 (\u201cWe will... affirm a court\u2019s decision if it reaches the correct result, albeit for the wrong reason.\u201d). We need not address the District Court\u2019s rationale here because it is apparent from the face of the record that the court reached the right result when it denied Christensen\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b613 Christensen suffered no violation of his right to a trial within six months of arraignment because he moved for a postponement of the original trial date. Regardless of the District Court\u2019s rationale, it reached the right result.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b32-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> Christensen also initiated an appeal in the District Court, making the same argument (DC 12-351).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
