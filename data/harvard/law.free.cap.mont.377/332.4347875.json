We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b62 We restate the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">\n<em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred when it determined White was not mentally fit to stand trial at a proceeding in which White was not present.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">\n<em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred by failing to complete the initial appearance process.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\u00b63 During the early morning of Februaiy 15, 2011, Mark Ward (Ward) was delivering newspapers to the Darlington Manor in Bozeman, Montana. White lived in the Darlington Manor. After hearing noises in the hallway, White had a brief conversation with Ward and told him to never return to the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">\u00b64 Ward returned the following day to deliver papers to residents of the building. As Ward was leaving the building, White confronted him, stating, \u201cI thought I told you to get out of here and never come back.\u201d White then assaulted Ward, slamming him into a door and jumping on him multiple times. After the assault ended, Ward returned to his vehicle and called 911. While on the phone, White entered the vehicle and cut Ward\u2019s face. Ultimately, Ward was able to drive to safety and police arrested White.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">\u00b65 During the event, White made multiple statements indicating he was suffering from mental health problems. On the 911 call, White is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>heard referring to Ward as a \u201cKraut.\u201d When police arrived at the scene, White stated, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. The Nazis are over here. Let\u2019s go kill them.\u201d White also told police that he was wearing gloves because he planned to cut Ward\u2019s eyes out and feed the eyes to a cat.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b66 On February 17, 2011, White was charged by complaint with assault with a weapon after a justice of the peace determined there was probable cause to believe he committed the offense. Soon after his placement at the Gallatin County Detention Center, White was transferred to the Hope House for psychiatric treatment. While at Hope House, White was delusional and acted aggressively. As a result, involuntary civil commitment proceedings were initiated. In late February 2011, the District Court found that probable cause existed for the offense and an information charging White with assault with a weapon was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b67 On February 28, 2011, White and his attorney, Mr. Petaja, appeared before Judge Salvagni via video from Hope House. The District Court and defense counsel had the following conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0j\">The Court: You\u2019re telling me, Mr. Petiqa, that he is not in a mental condition for me to do an Initial Appearance with him this morning; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">Mr. Petaja: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">The Court: So it would be of no benefit to advise him about these charges filed against him; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">Mr. Petaja: Not at this time, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">The Court: Okay. The Court will enter a not guilty plea at Mr. Petaja\u2019s request to the charge of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">Mr. Petaja: They\u2019re entering a not guilty plea, Mark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">The Court: \u2014 to the charge of assault with a weapon. The Court will issue a Conditional Release Order, however, in the criminal case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">The Court: So the Court will set bail in the amount of $20,000, will order that he shall not be released from custody until he appears before the Court setting conditions if he proposes to post bail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\u00b68 The District Court then ordered a fitness evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-202, MCA. In a separate proceeding, White was civilly committed to the Montana State Hospital and involuntarily medicated. White\u2019s fitness-to-proceed evaluation did not begin until May 2011, after he completed his 90-day civil commitment. On July 22, 2011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>doctors at Montana State Hospital issued a report, concluding that White suffered from schizoaffective disorder, a mental disease that substantially impaired his ability to rationally understand court proceedings and consult with his attorney. The State Hospital recommended an extension of White\u2019s commitment on the issue of fitness to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b69 On August 1,2011, the District Court conducted a review hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221, MCA. White remained at the State Hospital and did not participate in the hearing. Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel contested the report\u2019s findings. The District Court determined White was unfit to proceed, relying exclusively on the Montana State Hospital report and continued White\u2019s commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"AP_\">\u00b610 In a subsequent report, dated October 6,2011, doctors concluded that White had regained the ability to rationally understand the proceedings and consult with his attorney. Staff further reported that White had the substantial capacity to form the particular mental state that was an element of the offense, but that his schizoaffective disorder substantially impaired his capacity to conform his conduct to the law at the time of the offense. Subsequently, White was transferred to the Gallatin County Detention Center. After months of continuances, an omnibus hearing was held in May 2012. The District Court did not conduct an initial appearance after White was deemed fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b611 White waived his right to a jury trial and Judge Salvagni conducted a bench trial. Judge Salvagni found White guilty of assault with a weapon. White was sentenced to twenty years with the Department of Public Health and Human Services. Section 46-14-312(2), MCA, allows a criminal defendant to be committed to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services if the court finds that the defendant suffered from a mental disease, defect, or developmental disability at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b612 Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at a critical stage has been violated is a question of constitutional law. <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6 12, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244 (overruled in part by <em>State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934). This Court exercises plenary review over constitutional questions. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\u00b613 Whether an initial appearance is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of \u00a7\u00a7 46-7-101-102, MCA, is an issue of statutory construction that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Gatlin, </em>2009 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>348, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 163, 219 P.3d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b614 Appellants must make a timely objection or risk waiver for purposes of the appeal. <em>State v. Reim, </em>2014 MT 108, \u00b6 28, 374 Mont. 487, 323 P.3d 880 (citing \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA). \u201cWe will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted). At the Court\u2019s discretion, we may review unpreserved claims under the plain error doctrine. <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 29 (citations omitted). Plain error review is appropriate where fundamental rights are implicated and the appellant convinces the Court that failing to review the claimed error would result in \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 38 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b615 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred when it determined White was not mentally fit to stand trial at a proceeding in which White was not present.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b616 White asserts on appeal that the District Court erred by making a fitness determination at the August 1, 2011 hearing without him present. White argues that the fitness determination was a critical stage in the case and that his exclusion resulted in a violation of his fundamental right to participate in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b617 In response, the State argues that in situations where neither the prosecutor nor the defense counsel contests the findings of the fitness report, the district court may determine fitness based on the report alone, without conducting a hearing. The State asserts that the District Court acted in conformity with \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA, noting that White has not challenged the constitutionality of the statute. Finally, the State maintains that White suffered no prejudice due to his absence from the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b618 The prosecution ofan incompetent individual violates due process. <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S. Ct. 896, 903 (1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Persons whose mental condition renders them unable to understand the proceedings against them or to assist in their own defense may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>be tried, convicted, or sentenced so long as the incapacity continues. Section 46-14-103, MCA; <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 171, 95 S. Ct. at 903. The trial court has a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to order a fitness determination \u201cif the court has reasonable grounds for concluding that there is a good faith doubt as to a defendant\u2019s competency.\u201d <em>State v. Bartlett, </em>282 Mont. 114, 120, 935 P.2d 114, 117 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b619 Both the United States and Montana Constitutions guarantee the right to be present at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution. <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 2667 (1987); <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 36. A \u201ccritical stage\u201d includes \u201cany step of the proceeding where there is potential for substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40 (citations omitted). A defendant waives this right only through an on-the-record statement acknowledging that he voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waives his right to be present. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 69. \u00b620 A defendant\u2019s absence from a critical stage is subject to harmless error review. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 35. The State must persuade the Court, \u201cbased upon the record before us and given the interests the right of presence was designed to protect, that the violation was harmless.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 45. More precisely, this requires the State to show that \u201cthere is no \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 that the violation of the defendant\u2019s right to be present caused him prejudice.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40 (citing <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b621 Neither the United States Supreme Court nor this Court has determined whether a fitness to proceed determination constitutes a critical stage of a criminal prosecution. Because we conclude that White\u2019s absence from the fitness proceeding did not cause him prejudice, we will not address the initial questions of whether the fitness proceeding constituted a \u201ccritical stage\u201d or whether White waived his right of presence. We will assume for purposes of analysis that the proceeding constituted a critical stage and that White did not waive his right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b622 What remains is whether White suffered prejudice due to his exclusion from the August 1 proceeding. The Court is persuaded, based on the record and given the interests the right of presence was designed to protect, that White was not prejudiced by his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"A67\">\u00b623 The District Court acted according to the directives of \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA. White asserts that he was denied the opportunity to personally observe the demeanor of Judge Salvagni and the prosecutor, to hear the arguments, and to observe his counsel\u2019s performance. While these factors maybe important in a contested healing where testimony is given and conflicting accounts are provided, these considerations are not critical in this case. Here, the proceeding was not adversarial, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>witnesses testified, and neither party contested the findings of the Montana State Hospital report.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b624 White also maintains that, had he been present, he would have contested the report\u2019s conclusion that he was unfit. During the early course of his commitment, White maintained that he was sane; however, later he acknowledged his mental illness and continued to take his medicine after the involuntary medication order expired. And, while White may have contested his fitness, the reports from the Montana State Hospital establish that White\u2019s ability to consult with his attorney and understand the criminal process was substantially impaired by his schizoaffective disorder at the time. There is no reasonable probability that White\u2019s presence at the proceeding would have altered the District Court\u2019s conclusion that White was unfit to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b625  Finally, White\u2019s absence from the proceeding does not render the result unjust or unfair. White was not tried until after he was found fit. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, <em>Sturgis v. Goldsmith, </em>796 F.2d 1103 (9th Cir. 1986), is instructive, ha <em>Sturgis, </em>the court concluded that the defendant had a constitutional right to be present at his competency hearing. <em>Sturgis, </em>796 F.2d at 1112. However, the court held that \u201cif the government can prove that [the defendant] was, in fact, competent at the time of trial, the error will not require reversal of the conviction.\u201d <em>Sturgis, </em>796F.2d at 1109. Here, although White was not present at the fitness proceeding, he was fit at the time of trial. Once Mr. Petaja raised the issue of fitness, the District Court had a duty to determine White\u2019s fitness through an evaluation. The State did not move forward with the prosecution until White was deemed fit. Clearly, he was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b626 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred by failing to complete the initial appearance process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b627 White argues his due process rights were violated when the District Court failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46-7-101 and 102, MCA. He maintains that <em>State v. Gatlin, </em>2009 MT 348, 353 Mont. 163, 219 P.3d 874 controls and due process requires the initial appearance. White concedes that his trial counsel failed to raise the issue below and requests this Court\u2019s review under the plain error doctrine. The State maintains that White\u2019s counsel acquiesced in the error by agreeing with Judge Salvagni\u2019s statement that, \u201cit would be of no benefit to advise him about these charges filed against him.\u201d As such, the State argues plain error review is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b628 Montana\u2019s initial appearance law requires law enforcement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>bring an arrested individual before the nearest and most accessible judge without unnecessary delay. Section 46-7-101, MCA. At the initial appearance, the judge must inform the defendant of the following: the charges against him, the right to counsel and the right to appointed counsel if indigent, the general circumstances under which the defendant may seek pre-trial release, the right to remain silent and a warning that any statement may be used against him, the potential loss of various firearms rights if convicted, and the right to a probable cause determination by a judge. Section 46-7-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b629 Here, an initial appearance was conducted and White was present with his attorney. However, the proceeding failed to comply with the requirements of the initial appearance statute. Clearly, it was necessary to delay the initial appearance at the February 28, 2011 proceeding, when it appeared to Judge Salvagni and counsel that White lacked the capacity to understand the proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it was an error to fail to comply with \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, once White was deemed fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b630  Notably, defense counsel failed to object or request an initial appearance after White was deemed fit. Generally, failure to make a timely objection constitutes a waiver of the objection for purposes of appeal. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA; <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 28. \u201cWe will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted). As discussed above, this Court may review unpreserved claims implicating a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review would result in \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Reim, </em>\u00b6 38 (citations omitted). Here, there is no indication that White was prejudiced by the incomplete proceeding such that it calls into question the fundamental fairness of the process or resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. \u00b631 Individuals are guaranteed due process before deprivation of life, liberty, or property. U.S. Const, amend 14; Mont. Const, art. H, \u00a7 17. The United States Supreme Court has held that pre-trial detentions are deprivations of liberty that require due process. <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 114, 95 S. Ct. 854, 863 (1975). To satisfy the due process requirements, defendants must be afforded a pre-trial, judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>determination of probable cause. <em>Gerstein, </em>420 U.S. at 114, 95 S. Ct. at 863 (1975). Here, following White\u2019s arrest, a justice of the peace evaluated the State\u2019s affidavit and made a determination that probable cause existed for the arrest. Moreover, a district court judge conducted a second probable cause determination before the State filed the Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b632 Further, White was represented by counsel during the entire course of his civil commitment and prosecution. The State provided White copies of the Information charging him with assault with a weapon and the accompanying affidavit. Judge Salvagni set bail and entered a not guilty plea. The State Hospital report notes that White was aware of his right to remain silent and the State did not use any post-arrest statements against White. Finally, although White was never informed of the possible consequences on his ability to possess firearms, he had already lost those rights due to his civil commitments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the District Court did not verbally inform White of a number of rights, White received the actual realization of those rights. Notably, White does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b633 White\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>State v. Gatlin, </em>2009 MT 348, 353 Mont. 163, 219 P.3d 874 and <em>State v. Strong, </em>2010 MT 163, 357 Mont. 114, 236 P.3d 580, both of which dealt primarily with the proper remedy for violating \u00a7\u00a7 46-7-101 and 102, MCA. At the onset, it is important to note that in both cases, trial counsel objected to the failure to provide an initial appearance, thus preserving the issue and implicating a different standard of review. Additionally, both cases centered on the failure to advise of the right to counsel, acknowledging that defendants often lack the legal knowledge of a trained lawyer. \u00b634 In <em>Gatlin, </em>an initial appearance was held, however it did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA. The court failed to inform the defendant of his right to counsel, that an attorney would be appointed if he could not afford one, and of his right to a probable cause determination. <em>Gatlin, </em>\u00b6 18. The Court noted that the purpose of an initial appearance is to ensure that a defendant is not \"held incommunicado for a protracted time.\u201d <em>Gatlin, </em>\u00b6 22. In <em>Strong, </em>the defendant was jailed and held incommunicado for forty-two days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>without an initial appearance. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 10. Strong had an initial appearance only after a public defender noticed him while visiting another prisoner in jail and inquired into his case. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b635  White\u2019s case is distinguishable from the scenarios of <em>Strong </em>and <em>Gatlin. </em>Here, White was not held incommunicado, rather he had an attorney throughout the case, even during times when other criminal defendants are typically not represented. Unlike <em>Gatlin, </em>who was jailed for three months without counsel on some of the charges pending against him, White had capable representation from day one. The purpose of the initial appearance statute is to protect the defendant from extended jail time without the assistance of counsel and knowledge of certain rights. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Gatlin, </em>\u00b6 22. Here, the interest that the initial appearance statute was designed to protect were safeguarded. White had capable counsel, was not jailed and isolated from legal assistance for a protracted period, and the error was never raised in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b636  We decline to exercise plain error review. White was not prejudiced by his absence from the fitness proceeding. Additionally, we conclude that White was not prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s failure to provide the advisories in \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA. White has not established that a manifest miscarriage of justice occurred compromising the fundamental fairness of the trial or the integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Montana uses the terns \u201cfitness,\u201d \u201cfit,\u201d and \u201cunfit.\u201d This Court treats fitness as meaning the same thing as competency, the term used by the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>See State v.

At that hearing, the District Court did not determine White was fit to proceed, but rather adopted the uncontested finding of incompetent and continued White\u2019s commitment at Montana State Hospital for him to regain his fitness to proceed. At the subsequent October 24,2011 hearing, which White was present for, the District Court issued its determination White had regained his fitness. This determination was similarly based on an uncontested report from Montana State Hospital. I therefore disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis that suggests a competency hearing was actually held and analyzes whether White was absent from a critical stage of his trial. Pursuant to the statutory criteria of \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA, a competency hearing was never required and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>District Court did not hold one. White does not challenge the procedure set forth in \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA, and I thus find inappropriate any harmless error review. The District Court complied with the provisions of \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA, and neither party lodged any objections to the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b639 Section 46-14-221(1), MCA, allows the trial court to make a fitness determination without a hearing when the report filed under \u00a7 46-14-206, MCA, is not contested. The relevant provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">If neither the prosecutor nor the defendant\u2019s counsel contests the finding of the report filed under 46-14-206, the court may make the determination on the basis of the report. If the finding is contested, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in evidence upon the hearing, the parties have the right to subpoena and cross-examine the psychiatrists or licensed clinical psychologists who joined in the report and to offer evidence upon the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Thus, it is only when the finding is contested that a hearing is required. White\u2019s presence was not necessary at the August 1, 2011 status hearing when the District Court adopted the uncontested incompetency finding of the report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, based on \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA, the District Court could have adopted the findings without a hearing and outside the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b640 The District Court conducted five status/review hearings where it attempted to resolve the issue surrounding White\u2019s fitness to proceed. At the first three hearings, held April 25,2011, May23,2011, and July 11, 2011, Montana State Hospital had not completed its report and proceedings had to be continued on each occasion. By the time of the August 1, 2011 hearing, Montana State Hospital had completed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>evaluation, as required by \u00a7 46-14-206, MCA, and determined White was not fit to proceed. This finding was not contested by White or the State. The District Court then adopted these uncontested findings and continued the matter and White\u2019s commitment to allow additional time for White to gain his fitness to proceed. At the fifth hearing, held October 25, 2011, the District Court again adopted the uncontested findings of the report, this time that White had regained his fitness to proceed. White was present for this hearing on October 25,2011. He does not challenge any aspect of the October 25,2011 hearing in which the District Court reached its conclusion that White regained his fitness and that proceedings in the criminal case could resume.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b641 I therefore disagree with the Courtthatacompetencyhearingwas ever conducted which would potentially invoke the defendant\u2019s right to be present and the Court\u2019s harmless error analysis. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. It is not necessary to address whether the District Court\u2019s fitness determination was a critical stage of the proceeding, because there was no contested fitness hearing conducted in White\u2019s absence. The District Court complied with statutory requirements in its adoption of uncontested findings. Because White has not challenged the constitutionality of the statute or its procedure on appeal or argued that a competency hearing must be held before an uncontested fitness determination can be made, I believe the Court\u2019s analysis is incorrect. I therefore specially concur as to Issue One.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b642 The Court\u2019s analysis and resolution of Issue Two is troubling. To understand why this is so, it is only necessary to review the <em>record </em>and note the complete absence of an initial appearance hearing. White\u2019s scheduled initial appearance on February 28, 2011 substantively did not occur: White was undisputedly not fit to proceed; defense counsel represented to the court his client could not understand the court\u2019s advisements; defense counsel requested a continuance, presumably until White regained his fitness to proceed; and the court accepted White\u2019s motion and committed White to Montana State Hospital. White\u2019s motion raising his fitness to proceed and the court\u2019s commitment of White suspended the criminal proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(a), MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Am7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u00b643 After White was determined to have regained his fitness on October 24, 2011, the District Court set the matter for a bench trial without conducting an initial appearance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I disagree with the Court that we may presume that because White was represented by counsel, he effectively \u201crealized\u201d these mandatory advisements to which he was both statutorily and constitutionally entitled. It is almost too basic and too simple to state that we should not compel a defendant to defend himself against criminal accusations brought by the State without first properly advising the defendant of his constitutional rights in the proceedings. These advisements are so well-established and routine that their constitutional principles are embodied in \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, as a \u201c[d]uty of court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b644 White was charged on February 17,2011, by complaint in Gallatin County Justice Court with one count of assault with a weapon in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The underlying offense occurred on February 16,2011. White had a long and documented history of mental illness. The State filed a motion and affidavit for leave to file an information in the District Court and a petition to involuntarily commit White. White had both an emergency detention hearing pursuant to the State\u2019s civil commitment petition and his initial appearance on the information February 28, 2011, before the same judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b645 During White\u2019s initial appearance, which apparently followed White\u2019s emergency detention hearing, the District Judge inquired of defense counsel whether White was fit to proceed with his initial appearance. Defense counsel answered on two occasions that White was not fit to proceed with the initial appearance and requested that the proceedings be suspended pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(a), MCA. Defense counsel represented that he would be filing a written motion reusing White\u2019s fitness to proceed and that the Court could enter a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea on White\u2019s behalf. The court committed White to Montana State Hospital for evaluation, entered a plea on White\u2019s behalf, and set bail and conditions of release. It is undisputed that the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 46-7-101 and -102, MCA, relating to a defendant\u2019s initial appearance were never satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b646 The Court states the \"purpose of the initial appearance is to ensure that a defendant is not \u2018held incommunicado for a protracted time,\u2019 \u201d citing <em>State v. </em>Gatlin, 2009 MT 348, \u00b6 22, 353 Mont. 163, 219 P.3d 874, and observes that \u201cWhite was not held incommunicado, rather he had an attorney throughout the case, even during times when other criminal defendants are typically not represented.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. While I agree that ensuring a defendant is not held \u201cincommunicado\u201d is one purpose of the \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d provision of \u00a7 46-7-101, MCA, it is my opinion we have misinterpreted our precedent in <em>Gatlin </em>and <em>State v. Strong, </em>2010 MT 163, 357 Mont. 114, 236 P.3d 580, where initial appearance hearings were nevertheless held, in order to justify a particular result in this proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court has consistently recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he purpose of [\u00a7 46-7-101, MCA] is to [e]nsure that the person arrested is advised of the charge made against him in order to enable him to prepare a defense, <em>and </em>to protect him from being held incommunicado for protracted periods of time.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_z\">In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation; to meet the witnesses against him face to face; to have process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The initial appearance serves to (1) advise the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to be informed of the charges against him, U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Const, amend.

Ct. 1, 3 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b648 Section 46-7-102, MCA, embodies the aforementioned constitutional principles and specifically states that it is the \u201c[d]uty of [the] court\u201d and that the judge \u201cshall\u201d inform the defendant:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">(a) of the charge or charges against the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">(b) of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">(c) of the defendant\u2019s right to have counsel assigned by a court of record in accordance with the provisions of 46-8-101;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">(d) of the general circumstances under which the defendant may obtain pretrial release;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">(e) of the defendant\u2019s right to refuse to make a statement and the fact that any statement made by the defendant may be offered in evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">(f) that conviction may result in the loss of various rights regarding firearms under state and federal law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">(g) of the defendant\u2019s right to a judicial determination of whether probable cause exists if the charge is made by a complaint alleging the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">It is necessary the defendant be informed of these rights by the court. The fact that White was appointed counsel does not release the court from its obligation to provide the defendant with a proper advisement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b649 While recognizing that an error occurred in failing to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, the Court finds it \u201cnotable\u201d that White failed to make any objection and additionally has never alleged a violation of any one of these rights. We conclude that \u201cWhite received the actual realization of those rights,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32, and therefore \u201cdecline to exercise plain error review,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36. In some respects, we put the cart before the horse by reviewing a claim for prejudice, finding no prejudice, and then declining to exercise plain error review. However, because I have little doubt the District Court would have promptly and sufficiently conducted an initial hearing following White\u2019s release from Montana State Hospital had defense counsel objected, I am compelled to find that the objection should have been made in order that error be preserved. I disagree, however, that the exercise of plain error review is not required. It is my opinion that the ultimate effect of the failure to advise of these fundamental constitutional rights must be deemed a denial of due process which \u201cleave[s] unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, [and] compromise^] the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Reim, </em>2014 MT 108, \u00b6 38, 374 Mont. 487, 323 P.3d 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b650 Initially, I want to be clear that while I believe an objection should have been made to the failure to conduct an initial hearing, I think it unfair to require a person to object to what occurred during a period when he was deemed unfit to proceed. If it is fundamentally unfair to require an incompetent person to stand trial, <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 378, 86 S. Ct. 836, 838 (1966), then certainly it is just as unfair to require the person to make an objection during a period when he is considered unfit to proceed. We cannot presume that White knew, one way or another, whether he was advised of his rights, particularly since he was deemed unfit to proceed for the first eight months of his pre-trial proceedings. This is, however, a matter more appropriately addressed in a collateral proceeding and is not a basis for altering standards of review and precedent regarding preservation of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b651 Secondly, I fundamentally disagree with the notion that the absence of a specific violation of one or more of the fundamental rights provided for in \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, dispenses of any consideration of a violation of the statute. The requirements of \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, would be rendered meaningless under such an interpretation. In stating the obligation of the judiciary to apply these constitutional rights, the United States Supreme Court, over 100 years ago, eloquently explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>in <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 373, 30 S. Ct. 544, 551 (1910):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYd\">[O]ur contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Bights declared in words might be lost in reality. And this has been recognized. The meaning and vitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b652 We applied these principles recently in <em>Strong, </em>where we declared that the <em>Benbo </em>suppression remedy was an insufficient incentive for officials to follow these statutory procedures and that, without more, rights declared in statute will often become \u201c lost in reality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 14. We held that if dismissal were the appropriate remedy in <em>Gatlin </em>for a failure to provide the defendant with all the information and advisories required at the initial appearance, then \u201cmanifestly dismissal is the appropriate remedy if the initial appearance itself is unnecessarily delayed.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 15. Consistent with <em>Gatlin </em>and <em>Strong, </em>I would therefore dismiss the charge for failure to conduct an initial appearance hearing \u2014 or any hearing \u2014 in which White was advised of his constitutional rights as provided for in \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA. It is my view that we ignore the law established by prior cases in holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b653 The final issue remaining is whether the dismissal should be with or without prejudice. In <em>Strong, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">We re-affirm what was at least implied in <em>Gatlin\", </em>if a defendant who is not afforded the rights provided by \u00a7\u00a7 46-7-101 and -102, MCA, demonstrates material prejudice arising from an unnecessary delay in providing an initial appearance or from failure to provide required information and advisories, then dismissal with prejudice may be warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\"><em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 20. As I have indicated, the Court\u2019s analysis dispenses with the requirement of advising a criminal defendant of the constitutional rights at an initial appearance by finding that a defendant receives the \u201cactual realization of those rights\u201d vicariously through counsel. Opinion, \u00b6 32. Dismissal with prejudice would serve to protect the defendant\u2019s statutory rights and his constitutional rights. In the present case, however, White seeks only dismissal without prejudice. I therefore would dismiss the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b654 In closing, I feel constrained to comment that I understand the circumstances surrounding the District Court\u2019s failure to conduct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>initial hearing. The register of action and minute entries of the Clerk of Court reflect that an initial hearing took place. The District Judge undoubtedly noted these docket entries and proceeded to set an omnibus hearing following White\u2019s release from Montana State Hospital. Everyone concerned \u2014 eight months and hundreds of cases later \u2014 understandably did not recall the particular circumstances of the February28,2011 hearing. There would not have been a transcript of the proceeding in the court file. In spite of these administrative obstacles, however, a criminal defendant must receive the advisories contained in \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, and the failure to provide these advisories was error. Under the circumstances of this case, I would exercise plain error review and dismiss without prejudice. I dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue Two concluding otherwise.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">A defendant has a \u201cright to be present at all stages of the trial \u00abdiere his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings \u201dFaretta <em>v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819 n.15, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2533 n.15 (1975). However, the right to be present is not absolute. <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 342-43, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 1060-61 (1970). I do not mean to suggest that any aspect of a criminal proceeding should be conducted in the defendant\u2019s absence \u2014 even a status or review hearing. It is the burden of the District Court to determine whether a defendant\u2019s presence is necessary based upon a multitude of factors. I believe it safe to say that most district judges, when aware of a potential presence issue, will fall on the side of having the defendant present. However, since a competency hearing was never required pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(1), MCA and the District Court did not conduct a competency hearing, it is not necessary to address White\u2019s presence claim for an uncontested finding made by the District Court \u2014 even if made at a status hearing.
