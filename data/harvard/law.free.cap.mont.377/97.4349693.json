We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">1. <em>Whether Cleveland\u2019s felony criminal endangerment charge qualified as an exception to the prior felony conviction rule, allowing him to receive a deferred sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\n<em>2. Whether Cleveland was entitled to specific performance of the original plea agreement that recommended a three-year deferred sentence, when he had a prior felony conviction that was not discovered until after the plea agreement was executed.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">\u00b63 On October 25,2012, Cleveland was observed driving erratically at 99 miles per hour in a 75-mile-per-hour zone. After being pulled over, Cleveland was found to be under the influence of alcohol. Cleveland\u2019s six-month-old child, O.C., was in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">\u00b64 Cleveland was charged by information on November 2,2012, with one felony count of criminal endangerment, and three misdemeanors: (1) driving under the influence of alcohol, (2) being a habitual traffic offender operating a motor vehicle, and (3) operating a motor vehicle with plates assigned to another vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00b65 On April 5,2013, Cleveland signed an acknowledgement of waiver of rights and plea agreement, in which he pled guilty to the charges of criminal endangerment, driving under the influence, and being a habitual traffic offender operating a motor vehicle. The State agreed to move to dismiss the charge of operating a motor vehicle with plates assigned to another vehicle. The plea agreement recommended a $500 fine, and a three-year deferred sentence on the condition that Cleveland complete the Adult Impaired Driving Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b66 On June 4,2013, the District Court held Cleveland\u2019s sentencing hearing at which the State presented a modification to Cleveland\u2019s recommended sentence because it discovered in his pre-sentence report that Cleveland had a prior felony which precluded him from receiving a deferred sentence under \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(b), MCA. Because of this discovery, the State recommended Cleveland receive a suspended sentence instead of a deferred sentence. Alternatively, the State agreed that Cleveland should have the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b67 Cleveland argued that he was still eligible for a deferred sentence under an exception to the prior felony conviction rule, \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, and that he was entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement. However, the District Court ruled that the exception to the prior felony conviction rule under \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, did not apply to Cleveland\u2019s case. Having determined that Cleveland was not statutorily eligible for a deferred sentence under \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(b), MCA, the District Court refused to grant Cleveland specific performance of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b68 The District Court issued a sentencing order on July 10,2013, in which it sentenced Cleveland to a three-year suspended sentence with credit for time served, a $500 fine, and participation in the Adult Impaired Driving Court on the charges of felony criminal endangerment, driving under the influence of alcohol, and being a habitual traffic offender operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b69 Cleveland appeals the District Court\u2019s July 10,2013 sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality (i.e., whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute). <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, 983 P.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b611 <em>1. Whether Cleveland\u2019s felony criminal endangerment charge qualified as an exception to the prior felony conviction rule, allowing him to receive a deferred sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b612 Section 46-18-201(l)(b), MCA, states: \u201cExcept as provided in 46-18-222, imposition of sentence in a felony case may not be deferred in the case of an offender who has been convicted of a felony on a prior occasion.\u201d Relevant to the present dispute is the exception set forth at \u00a746-18-222(5), MCA, which provides in pertinent part that a defendant qualifies for a subsequent deferred sentence \u201cin a case in which the threat of bodily injury or actual infliction of bodily injury is an actual element of the crime, [but] no serious bodily injury was inflicted on the victim unless a weapon was used in the commission of the offense.\u201d \u00b613 Cleveland argues that his crime should be included in the exception to the prior felony conviction rule because criminal endangerment is a crime in which the risk of bodily injury is an element, \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, but no bodily injury actually occurs. Section 46-18-222(5), MCA. The State disagrees, arguing that this exception only applies to violent crimes involving the \u201cthreat\u201d of bodily injury, \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, whereas criminal endangerment involves the \u201crisk\u201d of bodily injury pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-207, MCA. Essentially, the State argues that as used in these respective statutes, \u201cthreat\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d are not synonymous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b614  Section 45-2-101(76Xa), MCA, defines \u201cthreat\u201d as \u201ca menace, however communicated, to ... inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person or on property.\u201d By contrast, a \u201crisk\u201d is defined as \u201csomeone or something that creates or suggests a hazard.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>1076 (Frederick C. Mish ed., 11th ed. 2012). Plainly, a \u201cthreat\u201d of bodily injury, \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, is not synonymous with a \u201crisk\u201d of bodily injury as used in \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA. A threat involves an affirmative act in which the actor communicates a menace to inflict harm. Section45-2-10H76X&amp;), MCA. As used in \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, \u201crisk\u201d is the possibility of death or injury resulting from a hazard created by the defendant. Relevant to the present case, Cleveland obviously did not \u201cthreaten\u201d to inflict harm upon his six-month-old child. He did, however, create a hazard from which harm to the child may have resulted by driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b615  It may seem incongruous that arguably more serious offenses may qualify for an exception to the prior felony conviction rule under \u00a7 46-18-222(5), MCA, while criminal endangerment pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>207, MCA, does not. Nevertheless, Cleveland\u2019s offense clearly did not qualify for the recommended deferred sentence in the original plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b616 <em>2. Whether Cleveland was entitled to specific performance of the original plea agreement that recommended a three-year deferred sentence, when he had a prior felony conviction that was not discovered until after the plea agreement was executed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b617 \u201cPlea bargaining agreements are subject to contract law standards.\u201d <em>State v. Dinndorf, </em>202 Mont. 308, 311, 658 P.2d 372, 373 (1983). In <em>State v. Allen </em>we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">Prosecutors who engage in plea bargaining must meet strict and meticulous standards of both promise and performance as a plea of guilty resting in any significant degree on an unfulfilled plea bargain is involuntary and subject to vacation. Prosecutorial violations, even if made inadvertently or in good faith to obtain a just and mutually desired end, are unacceptable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\"><em>State v. Allen, </em>199 Mont. 204, 209, 645 P.2d 380, 382 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u00b618 A contract is unlawful if it is \u201ccontrary to an express provision of law.\u201d Section 28-2-701(1), MCA. If a contract has several distinct objects, and at least one object is lawful and one is unlawftd, then \u201cthe contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.\u201d Section 28-2-604, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u00b619 As discussed above, Cleveland was not eligible for a deferred sentence because of his prior felony conviction. The State argues, therefore, that there was no breach of the plea agreement because the agreement was voided by the illegal provision \u2014 i.e., the deferred sentence, citing \u00a7 28-2-701, MCA, and \u00a7 28-2-603, MCA. Cleveland argues that the State should have allowed him to nevertheless choose between specific performance of the plea agreement or withdrawal of his guilty plea, relying on <em>State v. Munoz, </em>2001 MT 85, 305 Mont. 139, 23 P.3d 922; and State <em>v. Rardon, </em>2002 MT 345, 313 Mont. 321, 61 P.3d 132 <em>(Rardon IT).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">\u00b620 In <em>Munoz, </em>the defendant pled guilty to one count of sexual assault, and entered a plea agreement for a three-year sentence. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. However, at the sentencing hearing the prosecution urged the District Court to adopt the probation officer\u2019s recommendation of a five-year sentence. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6 5. The District Court sentenced him to five years, and ordered that Munoz would be ineligible for parole until he completed every phase of the prison\u2019s sex offender treatment program. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6 6. Munoz moved to withdraw his guilty plea because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>State breached the plea agreement, but his motion was denied. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b621 On appeal, we held that because the State breached the plea agreement, Munoz should have been allowed to choose from available remedies as the non-breaching party. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 38. The burden then fell on the State, as the breaching party, to show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant\u2019s choice of remedy would result in a miscarriage of justice. We therefore held that Munoz should have been given the option to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6 38. In <em>Eardon II, </em>we gave the defendant the option to withdraw his guilty plea or obtain specific performance of his plea agreement after the state breached the plea agreement. <em>Eardon II, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b622  Cleveland\u2019s cas\u00e9is distinguishable from <em>Munoz </em>and <em>Eardonll </em>because the terms of Cleveland\u2019s plea agreement were illegal under \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(b), MCA, due to Cleveland\u2019s prior felony conviction which made him ineligible to receive a deferred sentence. Because that provision of the original plea agreement was illegal, the object of the plea agreement \u2014 the deferred sentence \u2014 was void and unenforceable. Sections 28-2-701, -604, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b623  We reiterate that the State has an obligation to \u201cmeet strict and meticulous standards of both promise and performance\u201d when engaged in plea bargaining and that \u201c[pjrosecutorial violations, even if made inadvertently or in good faith to obtain a just and mutually desired end, are unacceptable.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>199 Mont, at 209, 645 P.2d at 382. However, these obligations cannot include the enforcement of an illegal, and therefore unenforceable, provision. Therefore, Cleveland was not entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement, and the State correctly gave him the option to either withdraw his guilty plea or agree to the suspended sentence in accordance with \u00a7 46-18-201(lXb), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-9\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b124-10\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AKj\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u00b625 I agree with the Court\u2019s holding as to Issue 1. With respect to Issue 2, however, it is unnecessary to invoke provisions of Title 28, pertaining generally to contracts, when we already have precedent clearly stating that there can be no plea bargain to an illegal sentence. <em>State v. Deserly, </em>2008 MT 242, \u00b6 16, 344 Mont. 468, 188 P.3d 1057, <em>overruled on other grounds hy State v. Brinson, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 136, 210 P.3d 164.1 would affirm the District Court on this basis and would not apply Title 28 statutes or <em>State v. Munoz, </em>2001 MT 85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>305 Mont. 139, 23 P.3d 922, in resolving this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">\u00b626 The notion that a plea agreement is a contract subject to contract law standards is well established in our caselaw. Opinion, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2012 MT 157, \u00b6 16, 365 Mont. 431, 282 P.3d 679. This principle can be traced back to <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S. Ct. 495 (1971). There, the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S. Ct. at 499. We acknowledged this holding in <em>State v. Allen, </em>685 P.2d 333 (Mont. 1982) <em>(Mien II), </em>observing that it \u201cwas based <em>in part </em>on analogies to contract law.\u201d 685 P.2d at 335 (emphasis added). We noted, however, that \u201cthere appears to be a recent trend away from a strict contract characterization of a plea bargain agreement.\u201d <em>Mien II, </em>685 P.2d at 335 (citing <em>Cooper v. United States, </em>594 F.2d 12 (4th Cir. 1979)). In <em>Cooper, </em>for example, the court explained that plea bargaining implicates constitutional rights and, thus, there is a limit on the extent to which contract law may be relied on in this context. <em>Cooper, </em>594 F.2d at 15-18. More recently, the Supreme Court stated that while \u201cplea bargains are essentially contracts,\u201d this \u201canalogy may not hold in all respects.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 137, 129 S. Ct. 1423, 1430 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b627 Since <em>Mien II, </em>and indeed <em>Santobello, </em>this Court and courts across the country have struggled with fitting the \u201cbroken plea bargain\u201d into the context of contract law and defining the remedy to be allowed. <em>E.g., Munoz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-38. In my view, because a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty involves the waiver of various constitutional rights, a plea bargain is an agreement between the State and an individual having as its ultimate goal the advancement of <em>criminal justice, </em>rather than the commercial marketplace. Contract principles, which undisputedly derive from the free market and involve arm\u2019s length transactions in the business world, are. inapt analogies of a defendant\u2019s relationship to the State. True, the analogy may provide context to the Supreme Court\u2019s struggle in <em>Santobello </em>to implant legal principles into \u201can essential component of the administration of justice\u201d \u2014 i.e., plea bargaining. 404 U.S. at 260, 92 S. Ct. at 498. The constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>underpinnings to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, however, are beyond dispute. \u201c[A] guilty plea is a serious find sobering occasion inasmuch as it constitutes a waiver of the fundamental rights to a jury trial, to confront one\u2019s accusers, to present witnesses in one\u2019s defense, to remain silent, and to be convicted by proof beyond all reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 264, 92 S. Ct. at 500 (Douglas, J., concurring) (citations omitted). Use of contract law to define the rights and relationship between the State and the defendant ignores the fact that a conviction founded on an improperly induced guilty plea deprives the plea of its constitutionally required voluntariness. <em>Brinson, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b628 1 agree, therefore, with our prior observations that \u201cprosecutors must meet strict and meticulous standards of both promise and performance relating to plea agreements, because a guilty plea resting on an unfulfilled promise in a plea bargain is involuntary and prosecutorial violations, even if made inadvertently or in good faith to obtain a just and mutually desired end, are unacceptable.\u201d <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2002 MT 345, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 321, 61 P.3d 132 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord State v. LaMere, </em>272 Mont. 355, 359, 900 P.2d 926, 929 (1995); <em>State v. Alien, </em>197 Mont. 64, 69, 645 P.2d 380, 382 (1981) <em>{Allen l).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, addressing the enforceability of a plea agreement based on strict adherence to contract principles can be misleading and may cause us to lose sight of the fundamental principle recognized in Santobello: that the defendant must be treated with fairness throughout the process. 404U.S. at 261, 92 S. Ct. at 498.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I believe strongly that the law of contracts is inadequate to define the limits of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and I find the use of contract principles to resolve the instant dispute inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b629 Indeed, as stated at the outset, resort to Title 28 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>principles of contract law discussed in <em>Mu\u00f1as </em>is unnecessary. Cleveland\u2019s arguments for specific performance pertain to plea agreements contemplating lawful sentences where the prosecutor breached his obligations under the plea agreement, which is not the situation here. This case instead involves a plea bargain to an illegal sentence. Our precedent already recognizes that \u201c \u2018[t]here can be no plea bargain to an illegal sentence. Even when a defendant, prosecutor, and court agree on a sentence, the court cannot give the sentence effect if it is not authorized by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>United States v. Greatwalker, </em>285 F.3d 727, 729-30 (8th Cir. 2002)). \u201c \u2018[A] plea agreement calling for an unauthorized sentence cannot be specifically enforced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>606 N.W.2d 670, 674 (Minn. 2000)). Furthermore, because a guilty plea cannot be induced by unfulfillable promises, the voluntariness of the plea is drawn into question where the plea agreement contemplates a sentence unauthorized by law. <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 16. If a plea bargain is based on a promise that the trial court lacks authority to fulfill, and the defendant was induced to plead guilty by that promise, then the defendant is entitled to withdraw the plea and the parties are returned to their initial positions. <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b630 Given our adoption in <em>Deserly </em>of the foregoing well-recognized principles, it is not necessary, or advisable, to apply Title 28 statutes in resolving the instant appeal. The presentence investigation revealed that Cleveland has a prior felony conviction. Thus, upon learning that the sentence contemplated by the parties in the plea agreement is illegal, the District Court gave Cleveland the option of withdrawinghis guilty plea at the June 4,2013 sentencing hearing (a critical fact that we have failed to mention in our Opinion). The District Court advised Cleveland that if he chose not to withdraw his guilty plea, the court would <em>impose </em>a suspended <em>sentence </em>rather than a deferred <em>sentence. </em>Cleveland, after being properly advised, stated: \u201c[N]o, I wouldn\u2019t withdraw my guilty plea, because obviously, I did the crime. So there\u2019s no point in dragging that out any longer.\u201d Cleveland instead chose to insist on specific performance of the plea agreement, which the District Court correctly determined was not an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b631 I would affirm the District Court based on the rationale that there can be no plea bargain to an illegal sentence, <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 16, and that Cleveland declined to withdraw his plea when given the opportunity to do so. I therefore specially concur as to Issue 2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\"> The legality of the sentence was not at issue in <em>Munoz. </em>The State had recommended a sentence different from what had been agreed upon in the plea agreement. The State conceded breach of the plea agreement, and the issue concerned the proper remedy. <em>Munoz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> <em>Allen I </em>is also reported at 199 Mont. 204,209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> <em>See also Cooper, </em>594 F.2d at 15-16 (\u201cBoth before and since <em>Santobello, </em>the courts have understandably drawn heavily on the ready analogies of substantive and remedial contract law to Bupply the body of doctrine necessary to order plea bargaining practices and to afford relief to defendants aggrieved in the negotiating process. To the extent therefore that there has evolved any general body of \u201cplea bargain law,\u2019 it is heavily freighted with these contract law analogies. When <em>Santobello </em>made it plain, however, that the core concept here is the existence of a constitutional right in the defendant to be treated with Taimess\u2019 throughout the process, this presaged inevitably the question of the extent to which contract law may be drawn upon to define the limits of this constitutional right.\u201d (footnote omitted\u00bb.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
