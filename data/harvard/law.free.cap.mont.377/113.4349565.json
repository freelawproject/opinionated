First Student Transportation, LLC (First Student) cross-appeals from the denial of its bill of costs as untimely. We affirm, restating the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u00b62 2. <em>Did the District Court err by admitting evidence of PetersonTuelVs prior trauma and depression ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by denying Peterson-TuelVs challenges for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">\u00b64 <em>3. Did the District Court err by denying First Student's bill of costs as untimely under \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">\u00b65 On December 21,2009, Peterson-Tuell was stopped in her vehicle at an intersection in Billings. A school bus owned by First Student was stopped behind Peterson-Tuell and rear-ended her vehicle by pulling forward when the light turned green. The impact pushed PetersonTuell\u2019s vehicle into the car in front of her, causing minor damage to both vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">\u00b66 Peterson-Tuell exhibited no injuries at the scene. Several hours later, Peterson-Tuell was examined at a same-day medical care facility* During the examination, Peterson-Tuell reported no injuries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>showed no signs of difficulty in speaking, thinking, or concentrating. The treating physician\u2019s assistant noted that Peterson-Tuell had not hit her head during the accident, and described her as alert, oriented, and capable of making good eye contact. Two weeks later, PetersonTuell was examined by Dr. Lucinda Husby and no symptoms of brain trauma were reported or noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b67 On January25,2010, Peterson-Tuell was evaluated by Dr. Dennis O\u2019Brien, a neurologist. Peterson-Tuell did not indicate that she was suffering cognitive difficulties, and no such symptoms were observed by Dr. O\u2019Brien. It was only during a subsequent appointment with Dr. O\u2019Brien on February 24, 2010, that Peterson-Tuell first reported she was experiencing cognitive problems. Duringthat visit, Peterson-Tuell stated she had been suffering memory issues and difficulty concentrating since the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b68 Peterson-Tuell filed suit against First Student on December 13, 2011, claiming negligence. Peterson-Tuell alleged the accident had caused a traumatic brain injury and prevented her from securing employment. First Student admitted liability for the accident, leaving the issues of causation and damages to be decided at trial. Peterson-Tuell sought $3,000,000 in damages, and First Student made an offer of judgment in the amount of $95,000. The jury awarded $65,000 to Peterson-Tuell. Within five business days of tire verdict, First Student filed a bill of costs in the amount of $4,001. The bill was rejected by the District Court, which concluded that \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, required a bill of costs to be filed within five calendar days. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b69 District Courts are vested with broad discretion in controlling the admission of evidence at trial. <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 65, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. When reviewing a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, this Court determines only whether a lower court abused its discretion. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. Abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 14, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a challenge for cause for abuse of discretion. <em>Harris v. Hanson, </em>2009 MT 13, \u00b6 17, 349 Mont. 29, 201 P.3d 151. A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>Mont. State Fund v. Simms, </em>2012 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 14, 270 P.3d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the District Court err by admitting evidence of PetersonTuell\u2019s prior trauma and </em>depression?</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b611 At trial, Peterson-Tuell\u2019s treatment records and the medical opinions of her personal medical providers were introduced into evidence. First Student used this evidence to argue that PetersonTuell\u2019s symptoms were psychosomatic and attributable to a long histoiy of anxiety and depression, not the accident. Two of PetersonTuell\u2019s physicians opined that her anxiety and depression were related to feelings of guilt that she experienced as a result of the sexual abuse of her daughter some 20 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b612 Prior to trial, Peterson-Tuell filed a motion in limine that challenged unspecified \u201cpsychological theories\u201d she expected to be offered at trial by First Student. The only evidence referenced in the motion was the expected testimony of a medical expert witness for First Student, arguing that the expert \u201creaches back 30 years into the sexual abuse of one of the Plaintiffs children without showing any causal link at all between that and Plaintiffs symptoms ... . Defendant\u2019s [sic] should not be allowed to speculate and provide this court with a retroactive diagnosis.\u201d The motion did not object to the admission of Peterson-Tuell\u2019s medical records or testimony from her physicians, and did not seek exclusion of the evidence as prejudicial under M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b613 The District Court made no ruling on the motion in limine until the morning of the trial. In chambers, the court denied the motion after the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">[Plaintiff]: Well, there\u2019s really several issues there, your Honor, and I\u2019m tempted to just say, forget it, but the reason that the motion was written, it\u2019s one thing to say that the Plaintiff has psychosomatic complaints or that she\u2019s depressed. It\u2019s another thing... to reach back twenty-five years and say that some trauma had anything to do with this bus wreck....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">COURT: Isn\u2019t that kind of what this case is all about? 1 mean, liability is admitted; the issue is damages. The Plaintiff is stating, or claiming, that she has mild brain trauma and the Defendants think that (a) that isn\u2019t true, and if it is true, it could be from some other incident from the past, does that basically sum it up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">[Plaintiff]: [W]hat Dr. Husby\u2019s saying is a little more complicated than that. She says that pain causes depression, depression intensifies pain, and that it\u2019s a vicious cycle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>COURT: Okay. Fm going to deny the motion. If you think the Defendants are going too far on their theory, just make an objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Again, no objection was made to the admission of Peterson-Tuell\u2019s medical records or the conclusions of her treating physicians, nor was a concern raised about any evidence being unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b614 Although not specifying a rule, Peterson-Tuell\u2019s objections sounded in relevance and in the causation requirement that a party establish a \"medical connection\u201d foundation for evidence, as held in <em>Kimes v. Herrin, </em>217 Mont. 330, 705 P.2d 108 (1985), on which Peterson-Tuell relies. In <em>Kimes, </em>a two year-old child injured in an automobile accident began experiencing symptoms of listlessness, sleepiness, and staring several years later. <em>Kimes, </em>217 Mont, at 331-332, 705 P.2d at 109-110. A suit was brought alleging the child had suffered a brain trauma, against which the Defendant offered evidence of family fighting and an alcoholic environment to prove an alternate cause of the child\u2019s symptoms. <em>Kimes, </em>217 Mont, at 332-333, 705 P.2d at 110. Experts opined that the described home environment could cause the exhibited symptoms, but failed to establish \"a medical connection between poor home environment and the [child\u2019s] symptoms.\u201d <em>Kimes, </em>217 Mont, at 333, 705 P.2d at 110. While noting that the evidence was relevant, we nonetheless held that, without the requisite causal connection, the evidence should have been excluded under M. R. Evid. 403, \u201cbecause the probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice.\u201d <em>Kimes, </em>217 Mont, at 333, 705 P.2d at 110. Peterson-Tuell also cites <em>Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 63, 319 Mont. 307,84 P.3d 38 (\"Litigants must establish a causal connection more probable than not connecting any possible cause of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries before alternate causation testimony is allowed at trial; mere speculation is not sufficient and not admissible.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b615 However, the evidence here was neither speculative nor lacking a causal connection to Peterson-Tuell\u2019s symptoms, as in <em>Kimes </em>and <em>Henricksen. </em>The alternate causation evidence was provided by Peterson-Tuell\u2019s own treatment records and by the testimony of her physicians, including their opinion that her symptoms arose from her prior anxiety and depression, which was essentially admitted without objection. Dr. Husby, who treated Peterson-Tuell for depression, anxiety, and pain for a decade prior to the accident, concluded that, while her post-accident complaints of cognitive problems and headaches \"may have been set off by the rear-end accident,\u201d she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>nonetheless \u201cbeyond that\u201d and was experiencing a \u201cpsychosomatic overlay\u201d caused by her depression. Dr. Quenemoen concluded that Peterson-TuelTs memory complaints were likely \u201csecondary\u201d to other causes, such as depression and anxiety, noting that she had exhibited \u201cexcessive responses to physical problems in the past.\u201d Dr. Bredehoft determined Peterson-TuelTs cognitive functions to be \u201cat least in the average range\u201d and attributed her current cognitive problems to fatigue, pain, or anxiety, likely linked to feelings of guilt stemming from the molestation of her daughter. Dr. Schahacker concluded the abuse of Peterson-TuelTs daughter was a \u201clife-defining factor\u201d causing her \u201csubstantial trouble.\u201d Dr. Gumm opined that Peterson-TuelTs cognitive complaints were likely attributable to a \u201cmood disorder, not otherwise specified,\u201d such as depression and anxiety. Finally, Dr. Stuart Hall, a neuropsychologist retained by First Student to evaluate Peterson-Tuell, testified he found nothing in Peterson-TuelTs treatment records consistent with a traumatic brain injury following the accident, and added that delayed symptoms of cognitive impairment would be inconsistent with brain trauma, noting \u201cit just doesn\u2019t happen that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b616 As in <em>Mmes, </em>the evidence here had a tendency to make the alleged cause of Peterson-TuelTs symptoms more or less probable, and was therefore relevant under M. R. Evid. 401. However, unlike <em>Kimes, </em>the evidence went beyond theoretical musing and medically connected Peterson-Tuell's symptoms to something other than the accident. <em>Kimes, </em>217 Mont, at 333, 705 P.2d at 110. As the District Court correctly recognized, this case was \u201call about\u201d causation, and this evidence was relevant and admissible to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b617 On appeal, Peterson-Tuell has changed her theory, now arguing primarily that, even if relevant, the evidence should have been excluded as unduly prejudicial under M. R. Evid. 403, particularly, those questions that referenced her daughter\u2019s sexual abuse. She highlights a direct reference to that abuse during First Student\u2019s cross-examination of another of her daughters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">[Defendant]: It\u2019[s] my understanding, and I\u2019m \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be rude about this, but it\u2019s my understanding when you were a child, your dad, your biological dad actually raped your daughter \u2014 or, your sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">[Plaintiff]: Objection, your Honor. It\u2019s not relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">COURT: What is the relevance, Mr. Fagan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">[Defendant]: The relevance is to the trauma and to the crisis that she talked about that her mom\u2019s endured about depression. [Plaintiff]: Twenty five years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>COURT: Overruled, I'll let you go into it for a moment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANE\">Acknowledging she should have done more \u201cto exclude much \u2018psychological evidence\u2019 post accident, to limit the Defendant\u2019s theory,\u201d Peterson-Tuell argues that, nonetheless, her motion in limine was sufficient to preserve this prejudice objection for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b618 A motion in limine can serve as an important strategic tool to preserve objections for appeal. <em>State v. Crider, </em>2014 MT 139, \u00b6 19, 375 Mont. 187, 328 P.3d 612. We have held, however, that when utilizing a motion in limine, a party must \u201cmake the basis for his objection clear to the district court\u201d to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Crider, </em>\u00b6 20. A motion in limine must be sufficiently specific as to the basis for the objection so that the District Court is alerted to the issue and can rule upon it. <em>Crider, </em>\u00b6 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b619  A Rule 403 objection limiting inquiry into the difficult subject of her daughter\u2019s sexual abuse may have been well taken, but, as noted above, Peterson-Tuell did not make that objection in the District Court. In her motion in limine and in her trial objections, she argued only that the evidence was not relevant and lacked a causal connection. \u201c[W]e do not address a party\u2019s change in legal theory on appeal nor do we render a district court\u2019s decision incorrect when it was not given an opportunity to correct itself.\u201d <em>Newman v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 125, \u00b6 84,370 Mont. 133, 301 P.3d 348. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b620 <em>2. Did the District Court err by denying Peterson-TuelVs challenges for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b621 A juror may be challenged for cause when the juror has evinced \u201cenmity against or bias in favor of either parly.\u201d Section 25-7-223(7), MCA. Examination of potential jurors during voir dire is intended to evaluate their qualifications to serve in a case contemplating specific issues. <em>Abernathy v. Eline Oil Field Services, </em>200 Mont. 205, 214, 650 P.2d 772, 777 (1982). The determination of whether a juror should be allowed to serve must be \u201cleft largely to the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d because the court has the advantage of observing his or her demeanor. <em>Abernathy, </em>200 Mont, at 214, 650 P.2d at 777 (citations omitted). A court\u2019s ruling should not be set aside unless error is manifest or there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Abernathy, </em>200 Mont, at 214, 650 P.2d at 777. A court abuses its discretion if it fails to excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>a prospective juror whose actual bias is discovered during voir dire. <em>Harris v. Hanson, </em>2009 MT13, \u00b6 22, 349 Mont. 29, 201 P.3d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b622 Peterson-Tuell argues the District Court abused its discretion by failingto dismiss two jurors she challenged for cause,forcing her to use two peremptory challenges to remove those jurors and depriving her of those challenges to dismiss other jurors. The first, Janet Cline, stated during Peterson-TuelTs voir dire that she had grown up in the same neighborhood as First Student\u2019s counsel and attended high school with him, although she had not been in contact with him since that time. First Student\u2019s counsel asked Cline if their prior relationship biased her in his favor, to which she replied: \u201cNo \u2014 its been years....\u201d Peterson-Tuell challenged Cline for cause and the District Court overruled the objection without prejudice to a further demonstration that Cline was biased. Counsel for Peterson-Tuell withdrew from questioning Cline, stating he would return to her, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AQN\">\u00b623 Cline also stated dining First Student\u2019s questioning that she felt bus drivers were \u201csaints,\u201d because driving children around is a \u201cnerve-wracking job.\u201d After First Student passed the jury for cause, PetersonTuell was allowed an additional opportunity to question the panel and she again challenged Cline for cause, arguing that her comment about bus drivers demonstrated a bias in favor of First Student. In response to Peterson-TuelTs renewed objection, Cline offered to clarify her earlier comment about bus drivers being \u201csaints,\u201d agreeing with First Student that it was a strong term to use and that she merely meant to say bus drivers are \u201cpatient.\u201d The court denied the challenge because Cline did not evince an indication that she would be unfair or biased.</p>\n<p id=\"AZb\">\u00b624 The second juror at issue was Patrick Lawler. During First Student\u2019s voir dire, Lawler stated that if there was no evidence of causation, he would \u201csay [Peterson-Tuell] was just claiming she had an injury\u201d and would not give her the benefit of the doubt. First Student asked Lawler whether he would consider the proof offered by Peterson-Tuell when making his decision, and he stated that he would. After Peterson-Tuell challenged Lawler, First Student objected, arguing that Lawler had \u201csaid that he would weigh the evidence and apply the burden of proof.\u201d The District Court denied the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9C\">\u00b625 On appeal, Peterson-Tuell argues Cline\u2019s bias was \u201cobvious\u201d and characterizes Lawler as \u201copenly hostile to the plaintiffs case.\u201d First Student answers that neither juror expressed enmity or bias, as required under \u00a7 25-7-223(7), MCA. We agree. Cline stated her relationship with First Student\u2019s counsel would not affect her decision. Additionally, as clarified, Cline\u2019s comments about bus drivers did not demonstrate bias. Similarly, Lawler stated during voir dire that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>would make a judgment about Peterson-Tuell\u2019s claim only after considering her evidence. Lawler\u2019s statement that he would not find in Peterson-Tuell\u2019s favor if she failed to offer evidence of causality was essentially a lay person\u2019s restatement of the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b626  Peterson-Tuell did not demonstrate actual bias on the part of either challenged juror. As such, neither the District Court\u2019s denial of the challenge to Cline nor the challenge to Lawler constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b627 <em>3. Did the District Court err by denying First Student\u2019s bill of costs as untimely under \u00a725-10-501, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b628 First Student cross appeals the denial of its costs. Prior to trial, First Student made an offer of judgment to Peterson-Tuell in the amount of $95,000, which was declined. M. R. Civ. P. 68(d) provides that, when an offer of judgment is made and not accepted, the \u201cofferee must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made\u201d if the judgment obtained is less favorable than the offer. Additionally, \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, states that a \u201cparty in whose favor judgment is rendered and who claims the party\u2019s costs shall deliver to the clerk and serve upon the adverse party, within 5 days after the verdict or notice of the decision....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b629 Peterson-Tuell and First Student both filed a bill of costs following the verdict. The District Court ruled that the parties had failed to timely file their bills, and denied them both. The court reasoned that First Student was entitled to its incurred costs following rejection of the offer of judgment by Peterson-Tuell, as her recovery was $30,000 less than the offer, M. R. Civ. F. 68(d), but further held that first Student had failed to comply with the time requirements of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b630 First Student argues the District Court erred, citing <em>Doyle v. Clark, </em>2011 MT 117, \u00b6 41, 360 Mont. 450, <em>254 P.3d 570.In Doyle, </em>this Court held \u201cthat the five-day period provided for in \u00a7 25-10-50, MCA, is five <em>business </em>days....\u201d (Emphasis in original.) First Student offers that the District Court erroneously concluded that an amendment to M. R. Civ. P. 6 operated to change our holding in <em>Doyle. </em>The amendment was enacted in 2011 as part of a comprehensive revision to the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by this Court, effective October 1, 2011. <em>In re Mont. R. Civ. Proc., </em>No. AF 07-157 (Mont. Apr. 26, 2011). Under the revised rules, M. R. Civ. P. 6 was amended to read that intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are counted when calculating time under the rules. Prior to the amendment, Rule 6 stated that \u201c[w]hen the period of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded in the computation....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b631  First Student argues that the revision to Rule 6 had no effect on the holding in <em>Doyle, </em>and the rule of that case remains valid. However, <em>Doyle </em>was decided prior to the implementation of the amendment. Section25-10-501, MCA, does not explicitly state how the five days should be calculated. When the Rule 6 was amended, it became the goveraingrule that \"in computing anytime period specified in [the] rules, or court order, or <em>in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In short, the holding in <em>Doyle </em>was nullified by the rule revision. The District Court correctly interpreted the statute and the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b144-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\"> Following this initial objection, Peterson-Tuell made one other objection to this line of questioning, again arguing the absence of a causal connection between the abuse of her daughter and her current symptoms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
