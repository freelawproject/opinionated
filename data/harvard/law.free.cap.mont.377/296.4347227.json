Sheridan is a Montana rural electric cooperative. MDU is an electric services provider. Both serve customers in the Madoc/Scobey area in Daniels County. Cahill Seeds, Inc. (Cahill) is a farm and seed retail business located approximately six miles east of Scobey, near the intersection of Highway 5 and North Madoc Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b63 In 2011, Cahill began planning the construction of a new seed washing plant and submitted initial requests for electric service to MDU and Sheridan. The request stated that Cahill would require three-phase Wye pow\u00e9r to operate the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u00b64 When Cahill made its request Sheridan had an existing distribution line carrying three-phase Wye power approximately 1.33 miles north of the Cahill site. Meanwhile, MDU had an existing line carrying three-phase Wye power located approximately 6.5 miles west of Cahill. MDU also had an existing transmission line carrying three-phase Delta power running along Highway 5, and a distribution line connected to that transmission line at its Madoc Substation, near the junction of Highway 5 and North Madoc Road, approximately 300 feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>from Cahill.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b65 Sheridan responded to Cahill\u2019s request, stating that it could provide three-phase Wye power with the construction of a 1.33 mile line extension connecting its distribution line to Cahill. MDU told Cahill that it could not provide three-phase Wye power.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b66 In September 2011, Cahill began buildingtheseed washingplant. To provide power during construction, MDU installed a pole-mount transformer along the distribution line and extended a 285 foot single-phase service line to Cahill.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b67 During 2012 and 2013, as construction neared completion and Cahill began to install equipment requiring three-phase Wye power, MDU upgraded its transmission and distribution systems near Cahill. MDU replaced the transformer at the Madoc substation with a Wye transformer, added a fourth \"neutral\u201d wire to the distribution line, replaced the pole mount transformer on the distribution line with a three-phase padmount transformer, and replaced the single-phase service line with three-phase service line. These upgrades allowed MDU to provide three-phase Wye power to Cahill.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After completing its upgrades, MDU began providing three-phase Wye power to Cahill.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b68 On January 14, 2013, prior to MDU completing its upgrades, Sheridan filed a complaint in District Court. Sheridan alleged that MDU violated the Montana Territorial Integrity Act (MTIA) when it extended power to Cahill. Sheridan argued that under the priority provisions of the MTIA it had the exclusive right to serve Cahill because it had a line capable of delivering three-phase Wye power located 1.33 miles away from Cahill, while MDU\u2019s closest capable line was 6.5 miles away from Cahill. According to Sheridan, MDU\u2019s nearby distribution line did not meet the requirements of the MTIA because substantial upgrades to MDU\u2019s distribution system were required to send three-phase Wye power along the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b69 MDU responded, arguing that the MTIA only required that the \"line\u201d itself need have the capacity to cany the requisite load. MDU pointed out that the line itself had the physical capacity to carry three-phase Wye power, and only the transformers needed to be upgraded to provide three-phase Wye to Cahill.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b610 Both sides moved for summaryjudgment. The District Court ruled in favor of Sheridan, finding that the 1.33 mile distance from Sheridan\u2019s three-phase Wye transmission line to Cahill gave Sheridan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>priority over MDU, whose three-phase line was 6.5 miles away. MDU appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Scentry Biologicals, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>2014 MT 39, \u00b6 23, 374 Mont. 18, 319 P.3d 1260. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute for correctness. <em>State v. Madsen, </em>2013 MT 281, \u00b6 8, 372 Mont. 102, 317 P.3d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b612 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the District Court err in finding that Sheridan had the right to serve Cahill under the priority provisions of the MTIA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b614 MDU asks us to reverse the District Court for three reasons. First, because MDU had the exclusive right to serve Cahill under \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, by virtue of having the line nearest to Cahill with the capacity to serve Cahill. Second, because MDU added Cahill to its service territory when it began delivering single-phase construction power to Cahill in September 2011, and therefore Sheridan was prohibited from serving Cahill by \u00a7 69-5-104, MCA. Third, because granting priority to Sheridan would violate public policy and the legislative intent of the MTIA</p>\n<p id=\"Afs\">\u00b615 We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">When Cahill submitted its request for three-phase Wye power, did MDU have priority to serve Cahill under \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u00b616  We first address the question of when a provider\u2019s facilities are measured for purposes of determining priority for serving new consumers under the MTIA. Timing is important where, as in this case, an electric facilities provider is upgrading its facilities during the pendency of a dispute. The District Court implicitly held that priority should be determined at the time Cahill approached Sheridan and MDU about providing electric services. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">\u00b617 Section 69-5-105(1), MCA, \u201cService to new consumers,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\">Except as provided in 69-5-106 and 69-5-113, the electric facilities provider that has a line nearest the premises and that has the capacity to serve the premises, as measured in accordance with subsection (2), shall provide electric service facilities to the premises initially requiring service after May 2,1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Without a premises in existence the statute would have no meaning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Furthermore, the statute clearly contemplates new premises, that is, premises that have recently come into existence. MTIA defines \u201cpremises\u201d as \u201ca building, residence, structure, irrigation pump, or facility to which electrical service facilities are provided or are to be installed.\u201d Section 69-5-102(12), MCA. When Cahill solicited bids for electrical services in early 2011, the plant became a \u201cfacility to which electrical services... [were] to be installed\u201d which is to say a premises. The need to evaluate each party\u2019s electrical service facilities arose at that time. Thus in assessing priority we will consider only the electric service facilities each party had in place when Cahill made its request for electrical service.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b618 Having determined that we will only consider a provider\u2019s electrical service facilities already in place in early 2011, we turn to the question of which party had priority under the MTIA. The answer to this question hinges upon the meaning of \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b619 MDU contends that the term \u201ccapacity\u201d as used in \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, refers to the physical capacity of the <em>line </em>as defined by \u00a7 69-5-102(11), MCA. \u201c \u2018line\u2019 means any material that is used to convey electrical energy and that is normally energized between 2,400 volts phase to ground and 14,400 volts phase to ground.\u201d Section 69-5-102(11), MCA Under MDU\u2019s interpretation of the statute, MDU had priority because, at the time Cahill submitted its request for power, the line itself had the capacity to deliver three-phase Wye power, despite the fact that MDU\u2019s nearby substation did not have the capacity to send three-phase Wye power down the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b620 An alternative interpretation is that the statute requires the <em>electric facilities provider </em>to have the capacity to actually send the load down the line. \u201c \u2018Electric facilities provider means any utility that provides electric service facilities to the public.\u201d Section 69-5-102(6), MCA. \u201c \u201cElectric service facilities\u2019 means any distribution or transmission system or related facility necessary to provide electricity to the premises, including lines.\u201d Section 69-5-102(7), MCA Under this interpretation, Sheridan would have priority because its nearest distribution system, including line, was actually carrying three-phase Wye when Cahill made its request, while MDU\u2019s distribution system required a substation upgrade in order to carry three-phase Wye.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b621 The plain language of \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, supports the latter interpretation. The sentence comprising \u00a7 65-5-105(1) contains two relative clauses: \u201cthat has a line nearest the premises,\u201d and \u201cthat has the capacity to serve the premises.\u201d Each clause begins with the relative pronoun \u201cthat.\u201d The meaning of the statute rests on which noun, \u201celectric facilities provider\u201d or \u201cline,\u201d is antecedent to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>relative pronoun. Under MDU\u2019s interpretation \u201celectric facilities provider\u201d is antecedent to the first and \u201cline\u201d is antecedent to the second. However, the statute states: \u201cthe electric facilities provider that has a line nearest the premises <em>and </em>that has the capacity to serve the premises....\u201d Section 65-5-105(1), MCA (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00b622 Here, the \u201cand\u201d is dispositive. Its placement in the sentence compels the conclusion that \u201celectric facilities provider\u201d is antecedent to both relative pronouns and therefore is the subject of each relative clause. Thus it is the \u201celectric facilities provider\u201d that must \u201c[have] a line nearest the premises\u201d and it is the \u201celectric facilities provider\u201d that must \u201c[have] the capacity to serve the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b623  Therefore, under \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, an electric facilities provider that has the line nearest the premises and that has the distribution system (including lines) with the capacity to provide electricity to the premises \u201cshall provide electric service facilities to the premises....\u201d Section 69-5-105(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b624  While it is undisputed that MDU\u2019s distribution <em>line </em>had the capacity to supply three-phase Wye power, we conclude that MDU did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, because its distribution and transmission facilities did not have the capacity to provide three-phase Wye without a significant upgrade to its nearby substation. When Cahill made its request for three-phase Wye power in 2011, MDU\u2019s nearest line with the distribution and transmission facilities necessary to provide three-phase Wye were more than six miles away, while Sheridan had a line with the necessary facilities less than two miles away. Therefore, the District Court did not err when it determined that Sheridan had priority to serve Cahill under \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Did Cahill become part of MDU\u2019s service territory\u201d when it provided single-phase electricity to Cahill during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>construction of the facility?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b625 MDU argues that when it provided single-phase construction power to Cahill in September 2011, it added Cahill to its service territory, thus precluding Sheridan from providing electricity to Cahill pursuant to \u00a7 69-5-104, MCA. That statute states that \u201ca utility may not provide electricity supply service to premises in another utility\u2019s service territory.\u201d \u00a7 69-5-104(1), MCA. A \u201cservice territory\u201d is defined as \u201cpremises receiving distribution service from a utility on January 1, 2011, and premises added pursuant to Title 69, chapter 5.\u201d Section 69-5-102(14), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b626  Because MDU was not providing distribution service to Cahill on January 1,2011, Cahill could only be made a part of MDUs service territory if it was added pursuant to Title 69, chapter 5. Under Title 69, chapter 5, priority for service to new customers is determined by \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA. We have already concluded that Sheridan had priority in providing electric services to Cahill under that section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, when MDU extended single-phase electrical service to Cahill, it did not do so pursuant to Title 69, chapter 5. Thus, MDU providing construction power to Cahill did not result in Cahill being added to MDUs service territory. Section 69-5-104(1), MCA, therefore, grants no priority to MDU and does not prohibit Sheridan from providing electricity supply service to Cahill.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Would grouting Sheridan priority to serve Cahill violate the legislative intent behind the MITA?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b627 MDU urges us to reverse the District Court because granting Sheridan priority to serve Cahill would violate the legislative intent behind the MTIA. In interpreting a statute \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. If the language of the statute is unambiguous \u201cno further interpretation is required, and we will resort to legislative history only if legislative intent cannot be determined from the plain wording of the statute.\u201d <em>Clarke v. Massey, </em>271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b628 Because we have found that the language of \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, unambiguously grants priority to the electric facilities provider that has both the line nearest the premises and the capacity to serve the premises we will not look to legislative history in interpreting the statute further. The statute clearly grants priority to Sheridan.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b629 We conclude that the language of \u00a7 69-5-105(1), MCA, unambiguously grants priority to Sheridan because it had the line closest to Cahill and the distribution system capacity to serve Cahill. Based on that finding, we determine that MDU did not add Cahill to its service territory pursuant to Title 69, chapter 5, when it extended single-phase construction power to Cahill in September 2011. We decline to resort to an examination of legislative history where the statute in question is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court did not err in finding that Sheridan has the right to serve Cahill under the priority provisions of the MTIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> An MDU employee testified that the fourth wire was a common addition to three-phase Wye lines but not a necessity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> As part of its argument, MDU notes that the statute does not define \u201ccapacity\u201d and correctly states that when a term is not defined by statute we consider that term to have its plain and ordinary meaning. In support of its position that the term \u201ccapacity\u201d refers only to the line itself, MDU quotes Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, defining \u201ccapacity\u201d as \u201cthe power or ability to hold, receive, or accommodate.\u201d This definition is indeed appropriate when referring to the capacity of an electrical line. However, another equally plain and ordinary meaning of \u201ccapacity\u201d is \u201cthe ability to... process... manufacture, or produce.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 330 (1961). This definition is appropriate when referring to the capacity of an electrical facilities provider. The \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d doctrine as applied to the term \u201ccapacity\u201d does not lend support to either interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> <em>See supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
