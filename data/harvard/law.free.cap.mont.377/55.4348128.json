The Defendant was sentenced for Count I: Theft, a felony, in violation of Section 45-6-301(8), MCA to the Department of Corrections for Five (5) years.

The State was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-22\">Before hearing the Application, the Defendant was advised that the Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">Rule 12, Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana, provides that, \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct. The sentence shall not be reduced or increased unless it is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aoe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>DATED this 28th day of May, 2014.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Division finds that the absence of direction in the Judgment in Missoula County, Cause No. DC-12-608, as to whether or not this sentence should run concurrently or consecutively to the Defendant\u2019s sentence imposed in Teton County, Cause No. DC-13-007, renders the sentence clearly excessive. It is the unanimous decision of the Division to amend the Judgment in Missoula County, Cause No. DC-12-608 to specifically state that the sentence imposed shall run concurrent with the sentence imposed in Teton County, Cause No. DC-13-007. The remaining terms and conditions of the sentence imposed are not clearly inadequate or clearly excessive and are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Done in open Court this 8th day of May, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-7\">Chairperson, Hon.
