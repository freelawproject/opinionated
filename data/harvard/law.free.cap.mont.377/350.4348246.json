The issue we address on appeal is whether the MHRA applies to Neva\u2019s commercial lease. We conclude that it does and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b62 In June 2009, Neva approached Bates about leasing a commercial property in Absarokee for an art gallery. The building was not immediately tenantable because it had a leaky roof and other problems. The two came to a verbal agreement: Bates would pay for the materials and make the repairs, while Neva would help with the repairs and would not pay rent until a month after the building\u2019s condition permitted the gallery to open for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b63 In July 2009, the two worked together on the repairs. Neva would later testify to numerous instances of inappropriate conduct by Bates during this month, including grabbing Neva\u2019s breast, commenting on Neva\u2019s underwear, and telephoning Neva to tell her that he was naked. Bates also sent a string of emails to Neva, later admitted into evidence, in whichhe proposed sexually explicit encounters. Neva eventually told Bates that he was \u201cnothing but a landlord\u201d to her. Bates then stopped making repairs, though the two dispute whether that was because Neva rebuffed his advances or because Neva installed a security system preventing Bates from gaining unfettered access to the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b64 In 2010, Neva filed a complaint with the Montana Human Rights Bureau, alleging that Bates violated the MHRA by sexually harassing her. In 2011, after a contested hearing, a hearing officer found that Bates had \u201cseverely]\u201d and \u201cpersistently]\u201d harassed Neva, and that the harassment was \u201cpatently unwelcome.\u201d Despite these findings, the hearing officer concluded that the harassment occurred in a context that neither the MHRA\u2019s public accommodation nor real estate provisions cover. With regard to the MHRA\u2019s real estate provisions, the hearing officer declared, \u201cThe MHRA does not address illegal discrimination in commercial, as opposed to housing, leases between private individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u00b65 Neva appealed the hearing officer\u2019s determination to the Montana Human Rights Commission. Examining the text of the MHRA, the Commission concluded that it \u201cprohibits unlawful discrimination in commercial property transactions, as well as all other real estate transactions.\u201d Accordingly, the Commission ruled that Neva could proceed with her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u00b66 Bates sought judicial review, arguing that the Commission: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>violated his right to due process by analyzing Neva\u2019s action under the MHRA\u2019s real estate provisions, and (2) incorrectly interpreted those provisions. Ruling for Bates on the due process argument, the District Court vacated the Commission\u2019s decision and reinstated the hearing officer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b67 Neva appealed the District Court\u2019s order to this Court and we reversed, concluding that Bates received due process. <em>Bates v. Neva, </em>2013 MT 246, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 371 Mont. 466, 308 P.3d 114. We remanded, directing the District Court to resolve the issue that formed the alternate basis for Bates\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s decision: whether the MHRA\u2019s real estate provisions apply to Neva\u2019s commercial lease. <em>Bates, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b68 On remand, the District Court concluded that the MHRA\u2019s real estate provisions prohibit discrimination in commercial real estate transactions. The court entered an order on February 27, 2014, remanding the case to the Montana Department of Labor and Industry\u2019s Hearings Bureau for further proceedings, including a determination of damages. Bates appeals the District Court\u2019s decision and order, thus presenting to the Court this matter of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b69 The correct interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>City of Missoula v. Iosefo, </em>2014 MT 209, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 161, 330 P.3d 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\u00b610 The MHRA prohibits an \u201cowner, lessor, or manager\u201d leasing a \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property\u201d from discriminating on the basis of sex \u201cin a term, condition, or privilege\u201d relating to property\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d or \u201clease.\u201d Section 49-2-305(1), (l)flb), MCA. \u201c[Sjexual harassment is sexual discrimination under the [MHRA].\u201d <em>Harrison v. Chance, </em>244 Mont. 215, 221 ,797 P.2d 200,204 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">\u00b611 Based on the plain meaning of improved or unimproved property as used in \u00a7 49-2-305(1), MCA, the District Court concluded that the MHRA prohibits discriminationin commercial real estate transactions. The court posited that a plain reading of the statute yields three categories of real estate transactions in which discrimination is prohibited: (1) housing accommodation transactions, (2) improved property transactions, and (3) unimproved property transactions. The court noted that only a \u201cstrained\u201d reading of the statute would support reading \u201chousing,\u201d which clearly modifies \u201caccommodation,\u201d as also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>modifying \u201cimproved property or unimproved property.\u201d The court further pointed out that, if improved property meant housing property, it would mean essentially the same things as a housing accommodation. Thus, the court concluded that under \u201capproved usage of language, improved property\u2019 includes commercial improved property, as there is no provision limiting it to residential improved property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b612 Bates argues that the District Court got it wrong. Specifically, he interprets \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property\u201d to mean \u201chousing accommodation or housing property.\u201d This interpretation, he suggests, reflects the Legislature\u2019s intention to make the MHRA equivalent to the Federal Fair Housing Act with regard to real estate transactions. He argues that this interpretation also better comports with \u00a7 49-2-305\u2019s title, which refers to discrimination in housing, and with its other subsections that reference housing. Further, he suggests that his interpretation gives proper weight to how the Montana Human Rights Bureau, charged with administering the MHRA, applied \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, only in housing transactions until it did otherwise in this case. Finally, he argues that his interpretation gives meaning to all of the statute\u2019s words because a housing property includes vacant housing whereas a housing accommodation does not.</p>\n<p id=\"ASPP\">\u00b613 We interpret statutes consistently with the Legislature\u2019s intent as crystallized in the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>In re Marriage of Rudolf, </em>2007 MT 178, \u00b6 41, 338 Mont. 226, 164 P.3d 907. Specifically, in interpreting a statute, we are \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in the terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. It is not our prerogative to read into a statute what is not there. <em>Rudolf, </em>\u00b6 41. As the District Court pointed out, to determine whether the MHRA applies to Neva\u2019s lease, one must ascertain the meaning of at least two terms: \u201chousing accommodation\u201d and \u201cimproved or unimproved property.\u201d \u201cWhere there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b614 First enacted in 1974, the MHRA recognizes and declares that \u201c[t]he right to be free from discrimination because of race, creed, religion, color, sex, physical or mental disability, age, or national origin\u201d is a \u201ccivil right.\u201d Section 49-1-102(1), MCA. The MHRA prohibits discrimination in a number of circumstances, including real estate transactions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">(1) It is an unlawful discriminatory practice for the owner, lessor, or manager having the right to sell, lease, or rent a <em>housing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>accommodation or improved or unimproved property </em>or for any other person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">(b) to discriminate against a person because of sex, marital status, race, creed, religion, age, familial status, physical or mental disability, color, or national origin in a term, condition, or privilege relating to the use, sale, lease, or rental of the housing accommodation or property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Section 49-2-305(1), MCA (emphasis supplied). The MHEA defines housing accommodation as \u201ca building or portion of abuilding, whether constructed or to be constructed, that is or will be used as the sleeping quarters of its occupants.\u201d Section 49-2-101(14), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b615 The MHRA does not define improved or unimproved property. \u201cWhen the legislature has not defined a statutory term, we consider the term to have its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Giacomelli v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 18, 354 Mont. 15,221 P.3d 666. In ascertaining plain meaning, we have \u2018long adhered to \u2018ordinary rules of grammar.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson v. J.C. Billion, Inc., </em>2013 MT 20, \u00b6 22 n. 5, 368 Mont. 299, 294 P.3d 397 (quoting <em>Jay v. Sch. Dist. No. 1 of Cascade Cnty., </em>24 Mont. 219, 225, 61P. 250, 252 (1900)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00b616 Bates argues that, in the phrase \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property,\u201d improved or unimproved property is limited to housing property. But that construction requires reading \u201chousing\u201d as modifying improved or unimproved property. Plain language and proper usage of grammar militate against that reading. Specifically, the series-qualifier canon of statutory interpretation, which calls for reading a pre-positive modifier as modifying all items that follow in a series, applies only where the items in the series have parallel construction. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1574 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2009). If the items do not have parallel construction because a modifier is interspersed between them, the result is that the pre-positive modifier applies only to the first item in the series and does not carry over. <em>Ward Gen. Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Emp\u2019rs Fire Ins. Co., </em>7 Cal. Rptr. 3d 844,849 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003) (\u201cMost readers expect the first adjective in a series of nouns or phrases to modify each norm or phrase in the following series <em>unless another adjective appears.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)); Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Gamer, <em>Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts </em>148 (2012) (\u201cThe typical way in which syntax would suggest no carryover modification is that a determiner ... will be repeated before the second element.\u201d). To illustrate, the phrase \u201cskinny men or happy or sad women\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>syntactically identical to \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property.\u201d But no reasonable reader would read \u201cskinny\u201d to modify \u201chappy or sad women.\u201d Instead, a reasonable reader would read \u201cskinny\u201d as modifying only \u201cmen\u201d and \u201chappy or sad\u201d as the sole modifiers of \u201cwomen.\u201d Likewise, because we adhere to \u201cthe ordinary rules of grammar,\u201d <em>Jay, </em>24 Mont, at 225, 61 P. at 252, we read \u201chousing\u201d to modify \u201caccommodation\u201d and not \u201cimproved or unimproved property.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b617 The MHRA\u2019s definition section confirms that \u201chousing accommodation\u201d and \u201cimproved or unimproved property\u201d are separate and distinct terms. As noted, the statute defines housing accommodation, \u00a7 49-2-101(15), MCA, but not improved or unimproved property. The phrase \u201chousing accommodation and improved or unimproved property\u201d is thus split, with only the first term in the phrase having been given a specific definition to be applied to the exclusion of the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. Reading \u201cimproved or unimproved property\u201d as dependent on \u201chousing\u201d contravenes the separation the Legislature created.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b618 Reading improved or unimproved property as dependent on \u201chousing\u201d also contravenes our obligation to, if possible, \u201cgive effect to all\u201d words in a statute. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited v. Mont. Dep\u2019t ofNat\u2019l Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2006 MT 72, \u00b6 23, 331 Mont. 483, 133 P.3d 224 (\u201cWe must endeavor to avoid a statutory construction that renders any section of the statute superfluous or fails to give effect to all the words used.\u201d). Bates argues that improved or unimproved property, as modified by \u201chousing,\u201d is different from a housing accommodation because improved or unimproved property accounts for vacant housing land, whereas a housing accommodation does not. But the definition of housing accommodation specifies that the term applies not just to housing that is constructed and in which someone resides, but also to housing \u201cto be constructed,\u201d and buildings that \u201cwill be used as sleeping quarters\u201d even if not currently used as such. Section 49-2-101(15), MCA. If improved or unimproved property is read simply to refer to vacant housing, the term will add nothing to the statute that is not already included in \u201chousing accommodation.\u201d \u00b619 We need not contrive a specialized meaning for improved or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>unimproved property because the plain and ordinary meaning of this phrase gives it a separate meaning from a housing accommodation. Improved property is a commonly-used term to refer to land with a structure on it. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1008 (defining \u201cimproved land\u201d as \u201cQ]and that has been developed; esp., land occupied by buildings and structures\u201d); Philip A. Benson &amp; Nelson L. North, <em>Real Estate Principles and Practices </em>48 (1924) (\u201cA purchaser in offering to buy improved property is always presumed to be intending to purchase three things: 1. the land, 2. the structure, capable of occupancy and rentable, and 3. the right to maintain it.\u201d). Unimproved property corresponds as land without a visible structure on it. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1009 (defining \u201cunimproved land\u201d as \u201c[r]aw land that has never been developed, and usu. that lacks utilities\u201d or \u201cQ]and that was formerly developed but has now been cleared of all buildings and structures.\u201d). The separation ofhousing accommodation from improved or unimproved property by the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d suggests that improved or unimproved property refers to types of real estate that a housing accommodation does not. Interpreting improved or unimproved property to include commercial real estate gives effect to all the statute\u2019s words.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b620 Bates questions this plain reading by pointing out that \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, refers many times to housing and ideas related to housing, but never explicitly mentions commercial real estate. This argument overlooks that most of \u00a7 49-2-305\u2019s references to \u201chousing\u201d \u00e1re within the phrase \u201chousing accommodation or property\u201d that is echoed throughout the statute and that plainly refers back to the phrase \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property\u201d in \u00a7 49-<em>2-305(1),MCA.See, </em>e.g\u201e \u00a7\u00a749-2-305(l)(a), (lXb), (lXc),MCA(emphasis supplied). This argument further overlooks that where the Legislature has added specific housing or residential limiting language, it has been to address particular housing issues such as housing for the disabled, \u00a7 49-2-305(5M6), MCA, and the financing, selling, or appraising of residential real property, \u00a7 49-2-305(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b621 Bates also calls our attention to \u00a7 49-2-305\u2019s title in the Montana code (\u201cDiscrimination in housing \u2014 exemptions\u201d) to suggest that the title reveals the Legislature\u2019s intent. But \u201cunless specifically and expressly adopted as part of the law by the legislature... catchlines, or other editorial material included in the Montana Code Annotated may not be construed as part of the legislative text but are only for the purpose of convenience, orderly arrangement, and information.\u201d Section 1-11-103(5), MCA. Titles in the code are subordinate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>statutory text and cannot be used to create ambiguity. <em>Manufacturers Acceptance Corp. v. Krsul, </em>151 Mont. 28, 35, 438 P.2d 667, 672 (1968); <em>State ex rel. Palagi v. </em>Regan, 113 Mont. 343, 351,126 P.2d 818, 824 (1942). Thus, barring any evidence that the Legislature specifically adopted \u00a7 49-2-305\u2019s current title, we will not rely on \u00a7 49-2-305\u2019s title in the code to call into question the plain meaning of the section\u2019s text. Moreover, the title that the Legislature gave to the MHRA in 1974was \u201cAn Act to Prevent Discrimination in Employment, Public Accommodations, Education, and Beal Properly Transactions...\u201d and, in the original version of the MHRA, the anti-discrimination provisions were combined in one section broadly entitled, \u201cDiscriminatory practices described and prohibited.\u201d These titles suggest that the MHRA was not designed to prohibit discrimination in housing transactions alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b622 Bates also points to our recognition that \u201c[t]he Montana Legislature has indicated its clear intent that the MHRA be interpreted consistently with federal discrimination statutes and case law.\u201d <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Feit, </em>2012 MT 147, \u00b6 8, 365 Mont. 359, 281 P.3d 225. Bates suggests that we should read tire MHRA as regulating discrimination only in housing because that is all that the Federal Fair Housing Act regulates.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Feit, </em>we held that obesity may constitute a physical or mental impairment under the MHRA. <em>Feit, </em>\u00b6 16. In discussing the definition of disability, we stated that the \u201cMHRA [is] to be interpreted consistently with federal discrimination statutes and case law.\u201d We specifically noted that \u201cthe definition of physical or mental disability [in the MHRA] is substantially identical to that in the [Americans with Disabilities Act]\u201d and that the Legislature in creating that definition in 1991 did so on the premise that the previous disability definitions \u201clacked clarity and are inconsistent with definitions used in federal civil rights statutes and court interpretations on the subject.\u201d Feii, \u00b6 8. \u00b624 In contrast to <em>Feit, </em>where the language and histoiy of the statute supported reading the MHRA\u2019s disability provisions identically to federal law, the language and histoiy of the statute do not support reading \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, as identical to federal law. Tellingly, with \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, the Legislature did not adopt substantially similar language to the MHRA\u2019s federal counterpart. The Federal Fair Housing Act purports to regulate only \u201cdwelling[s],\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604, defined as \u201cany building, structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a residence of one or more families, and any vacant land which is offered for sale or lease for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>construction or location thereon of any building, structure, or portion thereof.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602(b). Unlike the MHRA section considered in <em>Feit, </em>which included a term and definition (\u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d) adopted whole cloth from a federal statute, the Legislature in \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, did not employ the federal statute\u2019s key term (\u201cdwelling\u201d) or its definition. Instead, the Legislature used the term \u201chousing accommodation,\u201d for which it provided a residential definition, and the separate term \u201cimproved or unimproved property,\u201d for which it provided no definition. Section 49-2-305(1), MCA. We are bound to construe the Legislature\u2019s choice as deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b625 Finally, Bates argues that the Montana Human Rights Bureau, the agency charged with administering the MHRA, long has applied the statute only to housing transactions, and we should thus defer to an agency interpretation limiting the MHRA to housing transactions. This argument ignores that the Human Rights Commission in this very case determined that the MHRA is not limited to housing transactions and applies to commercial real estate transactions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azq\">\u00b626  The purpose of the MHRA is to protect the individual right to be free from discrimination. Section 49-1-102(1), MCA. If a provision in the MHRA is susceptibly to more than one plausible construction (Dissent, \u00b6 35), then we adopt the construction that provides the intended protection. <em>See Stokes v. Mont. Thirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2011 MT 182, \u00b6 15, 361 Mont. 279,259 P.3d 754 (\u201cIn our interpretation of a statute, \u2018we must view it as a part of a whole statutory scheme and construe it so as to forward the purpose of that scheme.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Wright v. Ace Am. Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 43, \u00b6 24, 359 Mont. 332, 249 P.3d 485)). It is not the Court\u2019s role to \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d and interpret improved or unimproved property to encompass only housing property, when the plain language of the statute does not supply that restriction. Section 1-2-101, MCA. That role belongs to the Legislature and it may choose to amend the MHRA if it sees fit to do so. <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 73, \u00b6 23,305 Mont. 53,31 P.3d 335 (\u201cET]o the extent that the statute does not accurately reflect the Legislature\u2019s clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>expressed intention, it is appropriate that the Legislature correct the problem, not the courts.\u201d).

In my view, the Court eschews critical canons of statutory construction in favor of focusing on an isolated phrase and analyzing its syntax. Further, the Court errs in its interpretation of the plain language of the statute. I thus disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the MHRA \u201capplies to Neva\u2019s commercial lease.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 1,26.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u00b629 In determining legislative intent, we are to be \u201cmindful of the rules of statutory construction that guide our review....\u201d <em>State v. </em>Heath, 2004 MT 126, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426. \u201c \u2018Statutory construction is a \u201cholistic endeavor\u201d and must account for the statute\u2019s text, language, structure, and object.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>S.L.H. v.

In this holistic endeavor, we must avoid a myopic focus: \u201cWhen construing a statute, it must be read as a whole, and its terms should not be isolated from the context in which they were used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>State v.

There is no expression of commercial applicability to which the Court\u2019s rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>of \u201cimproved or unimproved property\u201d may correspond. Bather, \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, is saturated with terms related to housing, such as \u201cresidential real estate-related transactions\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(7)), \u201cprivate residence\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(2)), \u201csleeping rooms,\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(2)), \u201csleeping quarters\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-101(14)), \u201csingle-family occupancy,\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(2)), \u201cmultifamily housing\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(6)), \u201cdwelling units\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(6)), \u201cdwellings\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(11)), \u201cresidence\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(11)), \u201cliving quarters\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(11)), \u201cresiding in\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(4)), \u201cfamilial status\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 49-2-305(10), (11), (12)), \u201cfamilies\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(11)), and \u201cneighborhood\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(1)(0). These terms are in addition to the term \u201chousing\u201d itself, which is used <em>24 times </em>within the section, including the sub-category of housing, \u201cHousing for older persons\u201d (\u00a7 49-2-305(10)).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b631 As they were when originally enacted in 1974, the anti-discrimination provisions of the MHRA are organized into sections by type of discrimination. Those sections have been labeled in the Montana Code Annotated for ease of understanding, including, for example, \u201c49-2-303. Discrimination in employment,\u201d \u201c49-2-304. Discrimination in public accommodations,\u201d \u201c49-2-306. Discrimination in financing and credit transactions,\u201d and \u201c49-2-307. Discrimination in education.\u201d Likewise, the section at issue here is labeled \u201c49-2-305. Discrimination in housing \u2014 exemptions.\u201d The identification of the section\u2019s content as \u201cdiscrimination in housing\u201d corresponds both to the abundance of residential language and absence of any commercial language within the section. The Court correctly notes that these catchlines were not enacted by the Legislature. Opinion, \u00b6 21. However, it cannot be denied, from a review of their content, that the anti-discrimination sections of the MHRA are organized precisely as they have been labeled, and that, consistent with its catchline, the subject of \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, is housing discrimination, because it contains extensive provisions related to housing discrimination, and no specifically commercial language.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b632 Bates correctly notes that the phrase, \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property,\u201d is used only once, while the phrase \u201chousing accommodation or property\u201d is frequently used within \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, thereafter. But there is more to this point. Following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>initial reference within -305(1) to <em>\u201ca </em>housing accommodation or improved or unimproved property,\u201d the accommodation is thereafter commonly referred to as \u201c <em>the </em>housing accommodation or property.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 49-2-305(1)(a) (it is unlawful to refuse to \u201csell, lease, or rent <em>the housing accommodation or property </em>to a person because of sex, marital status, race, creed, religion... .\u201d). This subsequent phrasing is an apparent reference to the initial wording used in -305(1), and indicates that a single accommodation concept is intended for the entire section \u2014 one premised on housing. In fact, had the Court properly analyzed the language of the phrase \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property\u201d within \u00a7 49-2-305(1), MCA, it would have reached the same conclusion as a matter of plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b633 The Court rejects Bates\u2019 interpretation of \u201cimproved and unimproved property\u201d as referring to vacant land because, as the Court sees it, the term \u201chousing accommodation\u201d encompasses vacant land because it includes buildings \u201cto be constructed,\u201d and therefore, Bates\u2019 interpretation of the phrase would add nothing to the statute. Opinion, \u00b6 18. However, the Court\u2019s interpretation distorts the plain wording of the statute. \u201cHousing accommodation\u201d is specifically defined by \u00a7 49-2-101( 14), MCA, to mean buildings only, whether already constructed or to be constructed. The fact that the term applies to buildings that will be constructed in the future does not somehow make the term applicable to vacant land on which no building will be constructed. Clearly, the term \u201cimproved and unimproved property\u201d adds to the statute\u2019s coverage those consumer housing options that do not require a building, for example: rental of land that has improvements, such as a mobile home park with sewer hook-ups (\u201cimproved property\u201d); and rental of raw land with no improvements, such as campgrounds or other locations without any services, intended for self-contained housingunits, such as motor homes (\u201cunimproved property\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without the phrase \u201cimproved and unimproved property,\u201d these other housing options would not be covered by the statute. Thus, under the definitions provided by the Legislature, \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property\u201d covers all of the housing options available to a consumer, building and non-building, and does not require application of the phrase to commercial leases in order to give it meaning. Indeed, the statute defines <em>\u201cresidential </em>real estate transaction\u201d as those including \u201cpurchasing, constructing, improving, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>repairing, or maintaining a <em>housing accommodation or property.\u201d </em>Section 49-2-305(7)(bXiXA), MCA (emphasis added). Thus, both the term \u201chousing accommodation\u201d and the term \u201cproperly\u201d are defined by the statute to be residential in nature. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 49-2-305(4), MCA <em>(presiding in ... </em>the housing accommodation or property\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b634 It is obvious that, for these reasons, the agency has interpreted this section, since its enactment, as applying only to housing discrimination claims. Administrative Rule of Montana 24.8.207, states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">(1) Within ten business days of the filing of the complaint, the Human Rights Bureau shall serve notice of filing upon the parties by mail. The notice shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">(d) <em>in cases filed pursuant to 49-2-305, MCA (housing cases), </em>advise the parties of their right to commence a civil action under 49-2-510(4)(a), MCA, in an appropriate district court....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Admin. R. M. 24.8.207 (2008) (Notice of Filing Complaints (emphasis added)). As the Hearing Officer noted, \u201c[t]he MHRA does not address discrimination in commercial, as opposed to housing, leases between private individuals.\u201d We follow the rule that \u201cwhere a particular meaning has been ascribed to a statute by an agency through a long and continued course of consistent interpretation, resulting in an identifiable reliance,\u201d such interpretation is entitled to \u201crespectful consideration.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Mont. PSC, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 25, 305 Mont. 260, 26 P.3d 91 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b635 All that said, even if the Court\u2019s grammatical analysis has correctly determined that commercial leases could be included within the phrase \u201chousing accommodation or improved or unimproved property,\u201d this presents a classic example of the rare case when the Court\u2019s proper duty nonetheless requires reversal of the District Court. As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">It is a familiar rule that <em>a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, </em>because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers. This has been often asserted, and the reports are full of cases illustrating its application. This is not the substitution of the will of the judge for that of the legislator, for frequently words of general meaning are used in a statute, <em>words broad enough to include an act in question, and yet a consideration of the whole legislation, </em>or of the circumstances surrounding its enactment, or of the absurd results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>which follow from giving such a broad meaning to the words, <em>makes it unreasonable to believe that the legislator intended to include the particular act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>Church of the Holy Trinity v.
