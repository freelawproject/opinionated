Christensen presiding, has certified the following questions to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">2. <em>Does Montana law recognize a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an injured parent </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">\n<em>2. If Montana recognizes a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an injured parent, what evidentiary standard must the plaintiff meet in order to assert such a claim?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">\u00b62 We accepted the certified questions and now answer that Montana law recognizes a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>iiyured parent, and that to assert such a claim, the plaintiff must show that (1) a third party tortiously caused the parent to suffer a serious, permanent and disablingmental or physical injury compensable under Montana law, and (2) the parent\u2019s ultimate condition of mental or physical impairment is so overwhelming and severe that it has caused the parent-child relationship to be destroyed or nearly destroyed. Relevant to establishing the plaintiffs cause of action, and to a jury\u2019s determination of damages, will be evidence of the severity of injury to the parent; the actual effect that the parent\u2019s injury has had on the relationship and is likely to have in the future; the child\u2019s age; the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parent; and the child\u2019s emotional, physical and geographic characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b63 The parties have stipulated to the following pertinent facts, set forth in the U.S. District Court\u2019s certification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b64 On August 12, 2009, Calvin Stucky (Calvin) was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Powell County on Highway 141, when a vehicle headed in the opposite direction crossed the center line and collided head-on with his Ford truck. As a result of this collision, he sustained significant injuries with extensive physical and emotional effects. At the time of the collision, his daughters, Sadee and Callie Jo, were eighteen and fifteen, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b65 North Pacific Insurance Company (NPIC) issued a Commercial Auto Policy (the Policy) to Earl Stucky and Glenna Stucky. The policy period at issue was from October 24, 2008, to October 24, 2009. The Policy names Calvin and his wife, Renee Stucky (Renee), as insureds under the Policy. Calvin purchased a 1980 Ford truck on or about May 27,2009. NPIC alleges that the 1980 Ford truck was never added to the Policy for insurance coverage. Calvin alleges that he did request the 1980 Ford truck to be added to the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b66 The Policy provides Under Insured Motorist (UIM) coverage in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">We will pay all sums the \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d The damages must result from \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by the \u201cinsured\u201d caused by an \u201caccident.\u201d The owner\u2019s or driver\u2019s liability for these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance, or use of the \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The Policy provides that an \u201cinsured\u201d includes any \u201cfamily members\u201d of an individual who is a named insured. A \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>as \u201ca person related to an individual Named Insured by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of such Named Insured\u2019s household, including a ward or foster child.\u201d Renee, Sadee and Callie Jo allege they are insureds under the Policy and are entitled to UIM benefits as a result of Calvin\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b67 Calvin was the only person occupying the 1980 Ford truck when the accident took place. His injuries from the accident are extensive and include: Traumatic brain injury (TBI)/closed head injury with executive level deficits and emotional dyscontrol; left acetabular fracture, sacroiliac joint disruption, S/P ORIF (open reduction internal fixation); left hip sciatic nerve entrapment secondary to left acetabular fracture and sacroiliac joint disruption; T10 vertebral fracture, S/P T8-T12 fixation; left hip extensive heterotopic ossification requiring surgical excision; mood disorder; loss of cognitive function; left lower extremity impairments; personality changes secondary to TBI; memory loss secondary to TBI; word finding difficulty secondary to TBI; headaches secondary to TBI; insomnia secondary to TBI; balance dysfunction secondary to orthopedic dysfunction; anger issues secondary to TBI; depression secondary to TBI; Bipolar I disorder secondary to TBI; chronic pain/hip arthralgias supported by chronic left hip pain secondary to HO; facial and orbital fractures; left hypertropia and esotropia due to motor vehicle accident; S/P eye surgery (right inferior rectus recession, right medial rectus recession); right shoulder posterior labral tear; likely chronic right shoulder pain and possible functional limitations. He underwent multiple surgeries as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b68 Although Calvin has made improvements, he still suffers from difficulty with word finding; memory loss; balance dysfunction; visual problems; mood fluctuations; angry outbursts; physical weakness; limited ability to move; depression; agitation from over-stimulation; physical violence toward family members; dislike for people; asocial behavior; hip, back and leg pain; balance difficulties; right foot pain; cognitive limitations; visual limitations; and neuropsychological issues. He requires 24/7 supervision because ofmemory, executive functioning and physical limitations. He has reached his maximum medical recovery and will continue to require 24/7 supervision and physical assistance. He will require a legal guardian. He cannot drive a motor vehicle. He will require neuropsychological follow up and behavioral intervention. He will require psychiatric intervention and monitoring. The deficits created by his injuries are permanent and are expected to worsen with the effects of aging. This will increase the level of care he will require over time, and will call for additional services. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>estimated that his life care will cost approximately $4,600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b69 Calvin filed a claim with the other driver\u2019s liability insurer and also filed a claim with NPIC. NPIC filed a complaint to obtain a declaration that there is no UIM coverage for the accident because the 1980 Ford truck was never added to the Policy- The Defendants filed their counterclaim to obtain a declaration that there is UIM coverage for the accident. They requested damages arising from breach of contract, alleging that NPIC breached its contract with them by failing to provide coverage and that NPIC should be held liable for refusing to provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b610 Sadee was eighteen years old at the time of Calvin\u2019s accident. While growing up, Sadee spent time every day with Calvin and Renee. Calvin coached Sadee\u2019s basketball team. He helped her learn how to rope, ride horses, play basketball and sing. He was the teacher of her life, her guidance counselor. She resided with her parents at the Stucky Ranch in Avon, Montana, lor her entire life until she went to college in Bozeman, Montana, in August 2009, the week after Calvin\u2019s accident. Had the accident not occurred, Calvin and Renee would have moved Sadee to Bozeman. Because of the accident, however, Calvin was in a coma in Seattle and Renee was with him, so neither was there to help Sadee move into the college dormitory. While living in the college dormitory, every day Sadee had to face the fact that all of the other girls had their fathers and she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b611 During the summer of 2009, Sadee worked part time at the Avon Cafe. From August 2009 until May 2010, Sadee lived in Bozeman on the Montana State University (MSU) campus and attended college. During the summer of 2010, Sadee moved back home to live with Calvin and Renee. She worked on the ranch and again part time at the Avon Cafe. During that time, she was available to spend time with Calvin and to help Renee care for him. In August 2010, Sadee returned to Bozeman to attend school and lived on campus until May 2011. From May 2011 to August 2012, Sadee continued to attend college at MSU and lived in Bozeman, off campus, with two roommates. She worked at Famous Dave\u2019s during this time. From August 2012 to December 2012, Sadee continued to attend college at MSU, lived in Bozeman, and worked part time at Famous Dave\u2019s. Engulfed by the pain Calvin\u2019s accident had caused her, Sadee was not able to keep up with college and dropped out in December 2012, with only one semester left. She emotionally and mentally could not return to college after December. Sadee has been working full time since January 2013. \u00b612 Sadee was raised to be strong and independent but, since the accident, has been struggling. Until recently, she has not sought any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>counseling as a result of her father\u2019s injuries because she could not open up and talk about it. She thought that as long as she did not seek counseling or discuss it, the pain would go away. Additionally, she financially could not afford counseling and her health insurance would not cover the cost. However, Sadee began seeing Dr. Kenneth Olson, a psychiatrist in Bozeman, on October 25,2013, and has continued to see him since. She has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), sleep dysftmction and cyclothymic disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b613 The entire family dynamics have changed since Calvin was injured. In addition to losing her father, Sadee has, in effect, lost her mother because Renee is too busy taking care of Calvin to provide love, affection, time, guidance and support. The accident and Calvin\u2019s injuries have affected Sadee\u2019s relationship with Renee and Callie Jo. Sadee finds it painful to go home to the ranch because everything is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b614 Calvin was taken from Sadee before she had a chance to develop an adult relationship with him. There are many things she would like to be able to ask Calvin, but she cannot. Prior to Calvin\u2019s accident, Sadee was very active and looked forward to doing and learning new things. Since the accident, she cannot develop the motivation to do things, she does not sleep well, and she has gained sixty-five pounds. The accident is in the back of Sadee\u2019s mind at all times. She cannot get it out of her head. She is frequently sad and experiences feelings of grief that Calvin will never be what or who he was. For the first two years after the accident, Sadee assumed Calvin would recover and return to his normal functioning. Now she has realized that he is never going to get better. He will not return to his old self and she cannot see ever living a normal life with him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b615 Sadee expected that she would have the love and affection of her father for all of her life. She expected that he would be there for her when she needed guidance, love and support; that he would have helped her financially with college; that when she went home for the summers during college they could work together on the ranch; and that they would be able to laugh, talk and share with one another. Had the accident not occurred on August 12, 2009, these expectations could have been realized, but now, they never will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b616 Sadee claims damages for loss of parental services, society, or consortium; loss of support; grief and sorrow; and mental and emotional distress; and seeks attorney fees. Her asserted legal basis for recovery is: \u201cPursuant to the insurance contract with Plaintiff (polity language), Sadee and Callie Jo are insured parties also, under the policy. Therefore, as insured family members, they are also entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>damages for the injuries caused by the third party tortfeasor, when the tortfeasor is underinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b617 NPIC moved for summary judgment with respect to Sadee\u2019s loss of consortium claim, asserting that Montana law does not recognize a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an injured parent. NPIC further contended that, even if Montana law did recognize a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an injured parent, it would require the plaintiff to establish \u201csignificant evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship\u201d as in the context of a claim for loss of consortium by the parent of an adult child. The federal court, which had diversity jurisdiction, concluded that resolving NPIC\u2019s motion involved important questions of public policy and thus, certified the matter to this Court pursuant to Rule 15 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b618 When answering a certified question from another qualifying court as permitted by M. R. App. P. 15(3), our review is \u201cpurely an interpretation of the law as applied to the agreed facts underlying the action.\u201d <em>Van Orden v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>2014 MT 45, \u00b6 10,374 Mont. 62, 318 P.3d 1042 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b619 <em>1. Does Montana law recognize a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an injured parent ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b620 The defendants assert, and NPIC seems to imply, that Montana law should recognize a claim for loss of consortium by an adult child based on injury to the parent. The parties differ as to how such a claim should be defined. NPIC argues that a loss of consortium claim brought by the adult child of an injured parent should be recognized only in narrow circumstances and should be subject to a very high level of proof. The defendants, and amicus Montana Trial Lawyers\u2019 Association (MTLA), argue that such a claim should be established by evidence of a loss, shown on a more-likely-than-not basis, which considers the facts and circumstances of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u00b621  We conclude that Montana law recognizes a loss of consortium claim by the adult child of an injured parent, and that such a claim, deriving from the common law, is supported by our statutes and Constitution. We have recognized that ^judicial modification of the common law is sometimes required to prevent great injustice or to insure that the common law is consonant with the changing needs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>society.\u201d <em>Miller v. Fallon County, </em>222 Mont. 214, 217-18, 721 P.2d 342, 344(1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b622 Historically, the law recognized only a husband\u2019s loss of consortium, claim when injury to his wife was caused by the intentional tort of another. <em>Pence v. Fox, </em>248 Mont. 521, 523, 813 P.2d 429, 431 (1991). The right expanded to include consortium claims when the loss was caused by an act of negligence. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 523, 813 P.2d at 431. Over time, the law also evolved to recognize the wife\u2019s right to bring consortium claims for losses of spousal consortium caused by intentional or negligent acts. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 523, 813 P.2d at 431. Montana\u2019s precedent follows the emerging trend of expanding common law loss of consortium claims. <em>See Bear Medicine v. U.S., </em>192 F. Supp. 2d 1053, 1067 (D. Mont. 2002) (recognizing a loss of consortium claim for parents of an adult child, reasoning that the Montana Supreme Court has \u201crecognized repeatedly\u201d its authority and responsibility for developing the common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b623 The first recognition of a wife\u2019s claim for loss of consortium caused by a defendant\u2019s negligence in Montana occurred in <em>Duffy v. Lipsman-Fulkerson &amp; Co., </em>200 F. Supp. 71 (D. Mont. 1961), by the Montana Federal District Court. The court noted that a cause of action is established by the combination of two elements: A right on the part of a plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by the defendant. <em>Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at 72. Although the court cited statutes defining a wife\u2019s rights under a marriage contract to support its opinion, it noted that there was \u201cno express statutory authorization\u201d for such an action and \u201cno Montana Supreme Court decision directly on the point.\u201d <em>Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at 72. The court reasoned that because the law recognized a husband\u2019s claim for loss of consortium caused by another\u2019s negligent harm to the wife, the law should recognize the same cause of action brought by the wife of a negligently injured husband. <em>Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at 74. Ultimately, the court concluded that \u201cMontana is committed to the common law as the law and rule of decision, and ... the common law recognized the husband\u2019s right to maintain such action.\u201d <em>Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at 75. Thus, the cause of action the federal court initially recognized is primarily founded in the common law. \u00b624 In <em>Dutton v. Hightower &amp; Lubrecht Constr. Co., </em>214 F. Supp. 298 (D. Mont. 1963), the federal court again addressed the wife\u2019s right to bring a loss of consortium claim for a defendant\u2019s negligent injury to her husband. In that case, the court relied on statutes defining the civil contractual relationship between husband and wife as the source of the right to consortium in its analysis. <em>Dutton, </em>214 F. Supp. at 300. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>court explained that statutes defining the rights a woman obtains by virtue other marriage had supplanted the common law, which denied the wife a cause of action or the right to sue for loss of consortium. <em>Dutton, </em>214 F. Supp. at 300. The <em>Dutton </em>court did not hold, however, that the source of a right giving rise to a loss of consortium claim necessarily had to be in statute; rather, the court reasoned that the legislature had passed statutes that supplanted the common law, to the extent that the common law had limited a wife\u2019s cause of action for loss of consortium due to a defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Dutton, </em>214 F. Supp. at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b625 Following in the footsteps of the federal court, this Court first recognized a cause of action for loss of consortium by the deprived spouse in <em>Bain v. Gleason, </em>223 Mont. 442, 726 P.2d 1153 (1986). In <em>Bain, </em>we determined that the husband of an injured wife could bring a loss of consortium claim \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the wife\u2019s claim against the tortfeasor and that the basis for such a claim was the statutory contractual obligation between husband and wife, set forth in \u00a7 40-2-101, MCA. <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont, at 445, 726 P.2d at 1155. We quoted this principle in <em>Priest v. Taylor, </em>227 Mont. 370, 379, 740 P.2d 648, 653 (1987), where we also explained that, though separate and distinct, the spouse\u2019s cause of action for loss of consortium is derivative of the other spouse\u2019s claim. We later clarified the relationship between the statutory basis for a consortium claim set forth in <em>Bain </em>and the common law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">Section 40-2-101, MCA, does not \u201ccreate\u201d the cause of action. It merely defines the obligations which inhere in the marriage relationship and upon which the common law action is based. ... The statute merely codifies the policy behind the common law by recognizing that spouses contract with one another for mutual obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 525, 813 P.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b626 In <em>Pence, </em>we recognized a minor child\u2019s loss of consortium claim related to the parent\u2019s injuries, where the parent had been rendered quadriplegic by a tortfeasor. We pointed out that like the rights of a spouse, the rights of a child to support, aid, protection, affection and society of the parent derive from both statute and case law. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 526, 813 P.2d at 432. In recognizing and defining a child\u2019s right to parental consortium, we cited with approval the Alaska Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">When a parent is seriously injured, his or her child suffers a loss of eryoyment, care, guidance, love and protection, and is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>deprived of a role model. Even courts that deny the parental consortium cause of action have acknowledged the reality of such emotional and psychological injury to the child, and the Alaska legislature has implicitly done so in allowing recovery by children for loss of consortium under Alaska\u2019s wrongful death statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Air\">Precluding minor children from maintaining a cause of action for loss of parental consortium arising from their parent\u2019s injury would, in our view, be inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s authorization of such recovexy when the parent dies, and with our prior holding in <em>Fruit </em>that a husband or wife may recover damages for loss of consortium when an injured spouse survives. The claim for loss of parental consortium presented in this case is not sufficiently distinguishable from either spousal consortium claims in injury cases or children\u2019s consortium claims in death cases to warrant nonrecognition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Pence, 248 Mont, at 526-27, 813 P.2d at 433 (quoting <em>Hibpshman v. Prudhoe Bay Supply, Inc., </em>734 P.2d 991, 994 (Alaska 1987) (citations omitted)). We concluded that the right of minor children to parental aid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance and training were supported by the best interest of the child test in custody determinations under \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, and the light of the child to seek damages under Montana\u2019s wrongful death statute. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 527, 813 P.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b627 We later refined <em>Pence </em>in <em>Keele v. St. Vincent Hosp. &amp; Heath Care Ctr., </em>258 Mont. 158, 852 P.2d 574 (1993), where we held that a parent need not have been rendered quadriplegic by an injury to give rise to a minor child\u2019s cause of action for loss of parental consortium. In that case, we adopted the two-part standard for asserting such a cause of action set forth by the Arizona Supreme Court in <em>Villareal v. Dept, of </em>Transp., 774 P.2d 213 (Ariz. 1989). We borrowed heavily from <em>Villareal </em>in <em>Keele </em>and, here, we once again find the Arizona Supreme Courtis remarks worth noting: \u201c \u201cWhile all family members enjoy a mutual interest in consortium, the parent-child relationship is undeniably unique and the wellspring from which other family relationships derive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Villareal, </em>774 P.2d at 217 (quoting <em>Frank v. Super. Ct., </em>722 P.2d 956, n. 3 (Ariz. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b628 Applying our precedent, the Montana Federal District Court recognized a claim for loss of consortium by the parents of an injured adult child in <em>Bear Medicine. </em>We endorsed that application in <em>Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Ill., </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6 58, 329 Mont. 347, 125 P.3d 597, reasoning that under certain circumstances ... the bond between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>parents and an adult child, and the loss experienced by the parents at the death of or serious injury to their child, may be of such quality as to warrant recovery by the parents for loss of consortium.\u201d We explained that the nature of the circumstances giving rise to such a claim was not capable of easy definition or determination and, instead, each case had to be determined based on the facts and evidence presented. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 58. We concluded that \u201csignificant evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship\u201d was necessary before a court could consider awarding loss of consortium damages to parents of an adult child. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 58. A \u201chigh level of proof\u201d was required, encompassing, for instance, evidence that the child had contributed to the parents\u2019 financial support or managed their property or holdings. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 61. This recognition reflected the federal court\u2019s observation in <em>Bear Medicine </em>that \u201cit is proof of the quality of the relationship that should logically govern the extent of any claim by a parent concerning their damages incurred by the death of their adult child.\u201d <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F. Supp. 2d at 1068. Neither <em>Bear Medicine </em>nor <em>Hern </em>relied on statutes to establish a legal right to consortium, however. The federal court in <em>Bear Medicine </em>found support for its decision to recognize a loss of consortium action for parents of an injured adult child in Montana\u2019s wrongful death statute, \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA, but primarily based its result in the common law. <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F. Supp. at 1068. In <em>Hern, </em>this Court relied entirely on <em>Bear Medicine </em>in its analysis of the loss of consortium claim there. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 50-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b629 The question of whether the adult child of an injured parent may assert a cause of action for loss of consortium is one of first impression in Montana. Other states\u2019 courts have, however, previously addressed this issue. The Iowa Supreme Court, in <em>Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc. v. Ill. Cent. &amp; Gulf R.R. Co., </em>335 N.W.2d 148, 152 (Iowa 1983), reconsidered an earlier decision in which it had limited loss of consortium recoveries to minor children, reasoning \u201ceven adult and married children have the right to expect the benefit of good parental advice and guidance.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The Washington Supreme Court, in recognizing a child\u2019s claim for loss of consortium of an injured parent, declined to limit recovery to minor children, but rather left the child\u2019s age as a matter for the jury to consider while fixing damages. <em>Ueland v. Pengo Hydra-Pull Corp., </em>691 P.2d 190, 195 (Wash. 1984). The Ohio Supreme Court, extending the loss of parental consortium claim to emancipated, adult children, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">[J]ust as minor children look to their parents for emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>support, [middle-aged] adult children who continue to enjoy a close relationship with their parents still depend upon their parents for affection, advice, and guidance as they become older.... Therefore, regardless of the age of the child, the loss to the parent-child relationship is real and should not be minimized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>Rolf v. Tri State Motor Transit Co., </em>745 N.E.2d 424, 426-27 (Ohio 2001). The trend among other courts is towards allowing recovery for the loss of the intangible benefits inherent in close familial relationships, in light of the enduring nature of family bonds. <em>See e.g. Marquardt v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>781 F. Supp. 1487, 1491-92 (D. Haw. 1992) (Hawaii law recognizes a claim for loss of filial consortium by parents of an adult child and the action is focused on loss of the intangible elements of love, comfort, companionship and society); <em>Nelson v. Four Seasons Nursing Ctr., </em>934 P.2d 1104, 1105 (Okla. Civ. App. 1996) (\u201cThere is simply no good reason to afford the personal right of companionship and the parent-child relationship less protection in cases involving adult children who seek to recover for injury to the parent-child relationship.\u201d); <em>Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., </em>984 S.W.2d 593, 601 (Tenn. 1999) (\u201cConsortium losses are not to limited to spousal claims but also necessarily encompass a child\u2019s loss, whether minor or adult.\u201d); <em>Fitzjerrell v. City of Gallup, </em>79 P.3d 836, 840-41 (N.M. Ct. App. 2003) (distinguished by <em>Lamphere v. U.S., </em>No. 06CV2174LAB (JMA), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22917, *13 (S. D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2008)) (allowing a plaintiff to bring a claim for loss of consortium as long as he or she established evidence of a sufficiently close familial relationship and foreseeability of injury to that relationship). We find these authorities persuasive and their rationale consistent with our precedent establishing the common law in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b630  Our statutes \u2014 although not directly on point \u2014 also reflect the recognition that parents and children provide a financial and emotional support system for one another well beyond the time when the child reaches the age of majority- For instance, our statutes require children and parents to support one another, where a child or parent becomes unable to provide for him or herself. Sections 40-6-214, -301, MCA. This Court has previously held that \u00a7 40-6-214, MCA, imposes on the parent of disabled adult children who are unable to care for themselves a duty to support the children to the extent of the parent\u2019s ability <em>In re </em>M.A.S., 2011 MT 313, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 363 Mont. 96,266 P.3d 1267. It is consistent with the policy underlying our statutory scheme to recognize a cause of action for loss of consortium brought by the adult child of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>injured parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b631 Finally, Article II, Section 16, of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[c]ourts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury of person, properly, or character.\u201d We discussed this right of fall legal redress extensively in <em>Meech v. Hillhaven </em>W., 238 Mont. 21, 30, 776 P.2d 488, 493 (1989), concluding that the right is not fundamental, but rather guarantees the right to access the courts to seek a remedy for wrongs recognized by common law or statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b632 We conclude that it is a natural extension of Montana\u2019s common law to recognize a cause of action for loss of consortium brought by the adult child of an injured parent. Such an action is consistent with our precedent, which has followed the national trend of expanding circumstances in which the law recognizes a cause of action for loss of consortium. It is farther supported by the policy of recognizing the enduring nature of the parent-child relationship which underlies our statutory scheme. Consequently, it is within our Constitution\u2019s guarantee of fall legal redress for recognized wrongs. We answer the first question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b633 <em>2. If Montana recognizes a claim for loss of consortium by the adult child of an injured parent, what evidentiary standard must the plaintiff meet in order to assert such a claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b634 NPIC, relying on <em>Hern, </em>urges that we limit loss of consortium claims for adult children of injured parents to cases in which there exists \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of an \u201cextraordinarily close and interdependent relationship.\u201d The defendants and amicus suggest, instead, that we require a claimant, on a more-likely-than-not basis, to establish a loss by presenting evidence to a jury of relevant facts including but not limited to: The severity of injury to the parent; the actual effect the parent\u2019s injury has had on the relationship and is likely to have in the future; the child\u2019s age; the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parent; and the child\u2019s emotional, physical and geographic characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b635 In <em>Keele, </em>we set forth the elements a minor child must prove to establish a claim for loss of parental consortium:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">1) a third party tortiously causes the parent to suffer a serious, permanent and disabling mental or physical injury compensable Tinder Montana law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">2) the parent\u2019s ultimate condition of mental or physical impairment must be so overwhelming and severe that it causes the parent-child relationship to be destroyed or nearly destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 162, 852 P.2d at 577 (citing <em>Villareal, </em>774 P.2d at 219). Discussing our adoption of that standard, we explained, as had the <em>Villareal </em>Court, that the first factor limits a minor child\u2019s claim to one for injuries that are \u201ccompensable under Montana law\u201d \u2014 or derivative of the parent\u2019s tort claim. <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 162, 852 P.2d at 577. We also emphasized that the second factor is meant to establish that the destruction or near destruction of the parent-child relationship as a result of the parent\u2019s impairment is a necessary element in establishing the cause of action itself, not merely a factor in computing damages. <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 163, 852 P.2d at 577; <em>see Villareal, </em>774 P.2d at 219 (\u201cNot all injuries to parents will result in a child\u2019s claim for loss of consortium. We limit our holding to allow loss of consortium claims only when the parent suffers serious, permanent, disabling injury rendering the parent unable to provide love, care, companionship, and guidance to the child. The parent\u2019s mental or physical impairment must be so overwhelming and severe that the parent-child relationship is destroyed or nearly destroyed.\u201d) (citations omitted). The requirement in Hem, that a parent seeking damages for loss of an adult child\u2019s consortium demonstrate evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship, instead served to define an evidentiary threshold in an action for wrongful death of an adult child.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b636 We can see no reason to adopt a different standard from the one set forth in <em>Keele </em>where an adult child\u2019s claim for loss of parental consortium is at issue. We conclude that the <em>Keele </em>standard better reflects the relationship between the parties when it is the parent who suffers a disabling injury; it is only the age of the child that is different from that in <em>Keele, </em>and that is a matter for the jury to consider. Once the elements necessary to establish a claim for loss of parental consortium have been met, <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 162, 852 P.2d at 577, we conclude that the factors set forth by the defendants and amicus are relevant to a jury\u2019s determination both of whether the <em>Keele </em>factors have been satisfied, and of what damages are appropriate. These factors, in fact, derive from <em>Villareal. </em>The <em>Villareal </em>Court, in setting the standard we adopted as modified in <em>Keele, </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">To bring a consortium claim, the child/plaintiff must show that the defendant injured the child\u2019s parent in a manner that would subject the defendant to liability under ordinary tort principles. The injury to the parent must cause severe damage to the parent-child relationship. The child may recover for the loss of the parent\u2019s love, affection, protection, support, services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>companionship, care, and society. In determining the amount of damages to award the child, relevant factors include, but are not limited to, the child\u2019s age, the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parent, the child\u2019s emotional and physical characteristics, and whether other consortium-giving relationships are available for the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><em>Villareal, </em>774 P.2d at 220-21. Thus, while we decline to adopt a new standard, we endorse the practice of presenting evidence \u2014 including, but not limited to, evidence of the severity of iqjury to the parent; the actual effect the parent\u2019s injury has had on the relationship and is likely to have in the future; the child\u2019s age; the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parent; and the child\u2019s emotional, physical and geographic characteristics \u2014 which tends to illustrate the nature of the loss to the jury. This is consistent with <em>Hern\u2019s </em>recognition that each case must be determined on the facts and evidence presented. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b637  The special relationship factor proposed by NPIC would impose too harsh a limitation on an adult child\u2019s cause of action for loss of consortium. The cause of action we recognize under the common law is not limited by its statutory \"basis\u201d as NPIC argues. Because our statutes do not define a cause of action, the common law governs, and may find support in the statutory framework. <em>See Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 525, 813 P.2d at 432. Although we recognize that the nature of the parent-child relationship may change when the child reaches adulthood, the child\u2019s need for parental support, aid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance and training do not evaporate upon reaching the age of majority. Rather, as the Ohio Supreme Court recognized in <em>Rolf, </em>an adult child\u2019s need for a parent\u2019s guidance may change or re-emerge as the child confronts the different obstacles he or she meets in new phases of life. As an \"independent person who is expected to navigate his or her own way through life\u201d the adult child\u2019s path may be illuminated and smoothed by the benefit of a parent\u2019s wisdom, love and insight. The extent and nature of the child\u2019s need for a close parent-child relationship, and the extent of the injury to the parent\u2019s ability to participate in one, may be evaluated by the jury as it determines whether the <em>Keele </em>factors have been satisfied and, if so, contemplates damages. It is worth noting, as well, that an adult child\u2019s reliance on a parent for guidance and support is likely different from the parent\u2019s reliance on a child that we discussed in <em>Hem. </em>No \u201cextraordinarily close and interdependent relationship\u201d is required for an adult child to be harmed, or even devastated, by the effective loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of a close parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b638  We conclude that Montana law recognizes a claim for loss of consortium brought by the adult child of an injured parent. To establish a cause of action for loss of consortium, the plaintiff must establish: 1) a third parly tortiously caused the parent to suffer a serious, permanent and disabling mental or physical ipjury compensable under Montana law; and 2) the parent\u2019s ultimate condition of mental or physical impairment is so overwhelming and severe that it has caused the parent-child relationship to be destroyed or nearly destroyed. In establishing his or her claim, the plaintiff may present evidence of factors including but not limited to the severity of injury to the parent; the actual effect the parent\u2019s injury has had on the relationship and is likely to have in the future; the child\u2019s age; the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parent; and the child\u2019s emotional, physical and geographic characteristics.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b62-8\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AFX\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u00b639 I join the Court\u2019s opinion and write to emphasize two points. First, loss of consortium claims spring from the common law, not from any statute, and exist to address interests beyond those the statutes on children and families are designed to protect. Second, there are significant legal and policy reasons to support extension of the common law to alow adult children to bring a claim for loss of consortium under appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b640 The Dissent criticizes the Court for characterizing Montana law as part of a \u201cnational trend\u201d of expanding circumstances under which a claim for loss of consortium is allowed, opining that a majority of states do not recognize a claim for loss of consortium by adult children. Dissent, \u00b6 63. A survey of state case law shows considerable variation among those courts that have considered the question. <em>See </em>Marjorie A. Shields, Annotation, <em>Adult Child\u2019s Eight of Action for Loss of Parental </em>Consortium, 12 A.L.R. 6th 241, \u00a7 2 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2014) (noting that \u201c[a] number of courts\u201d recognize an adult child\u2019s right of action for loss of parental consortium in an action involving a nonfatal injury to the parent; that \u201c[a] few courts\u201d have recognized limited rights of an adult child in such cases; and that \u201c[o]ne court declined to recognize an adult child\u2019s right of action for loss of parental consortium\u201d in a nonfatal injury case); <em>Brooks v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co., </em>2009 U.S. Dist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>LEXIS 74867, 9-10 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (citing three states that have not recognized a loss of consortium claim in cases involving relationships between parents and adult children and six states that have recognized a claim by adult children). Neither the parties nor the Dissent cite a case in which a state\u2019s highest court squarely rejected an adult child\u2019s claim for loss of consortium where it previously had recognized such a common law claim for a minor child \u2014 the issue we face here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">\u00b641 In actuality, there appear to be relatively few recent court decisions that decide the issue one way or the other. But much has been written about the topic, and \u201cmost legal commentary favors recognition\u201d of a cause of action for a child\u2019s loss of parental consortium, citing such factors as \u201c the fundamental importance of the parent-child relationship, the genuineness of the loss sustained, and the administrative feasibility of allowing compensation.\u2019 \u201d131 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 187, <em>Loss of Consortium in Parent-Child Relationship, </em>\u00a7 3 (quoting Jean C. Love, <em>Tortious Interference with the Parent-Child Relationship: Loss of an Injured Person\u2019s Society and Companionship, </em>51 Ind. L. J. 590, 634 (1976)). Montana accepted this principle in Perece and <em>Keele, </em>when we allowed a minor child to bring a loss of consortium claim for a parent\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b642 Although the Dissent finds no expressed reason to recognize such a claim after the child has reached the age of majority, numerous reasons exist to support this logical extension of existing law. First, this is not an area of the law in which rights of recovery derive from statutory duties. A claim for loss of consortium seeks to compensate for the \u201caid, protection, affection and society\u201d of the injured person, <em>Bain, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>223 Mont, at 445, 726 P.2d at 1155, not for financial support that the injured person is charged by statute with providing for a child. It is a claim that has its genesis in the common law, and addresses \u201cinjuries to emotional well-being.\u201d 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden <em>&amp; </em>Ellen M. Bublick, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 392, 583 (2d ed. 2011). Recognizing that the husband had a right at common law to maintain an action for loss of consortium, <em>Dutton </em>held that, as \u201cthe purpose of the \u2018Married Women\u2019s Act\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was to place the wife on a parity with the husband insofar as enforcing contractual rights in the courts,\u201d she also has the right to recover for loss of consortium. \u201cMontana is committed to the common law as the law and rule of decision, absent statutory law, and ... Montana has enacted no statute taking away this common lawright of the husband\u201d to maintain an action for loss of consortium. <em>Dutton, </em>214 F. Supp. at 300-01. The Married Women\u2019s Act simply served to abolish common law barriers that were based on outdated historical concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b643 We expressly rejected the argument in <em>Pence </em>that the claim for loss of consortium derived from statutes giving a husband and wife contractual obligations of mutual respect, fidelity, and support. Section 40-2-101, MCA \u201cThe inaccuracy of the defendants\u2019 conclusion that the legislature created the claim through \u00a7 40-2-101, MCA is proven by the fact that the statute has been on the books since 1895, but it was not until 1986that this Court recognized the claim. The statute merely codifies the policy behind the common law by recognizing that spouses contract with one another for mutual obligations.\u201d <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 525, 813 P.2d at 432. The same common law rule vesting the husband with all rights to recover for injuries to his wife gave the father an ownership interest in the services of his children and the right to recover the pecuniary value of those services when deprived of them through a defendant\u2019s intentional or negligent conduct. David P. Dwork, Note, <em>The Child\u2019s Right to Sue for Loss of a Parent\u2019s Love, Care and Companionship Caused by Tortious Injury to the Parent, </em>56 B.U.L. Rev. 722, 726 (1976). These vestiges of the common law slowly have been whittled away by the courts to allow wives and children to bring independent claims in their own rights. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 22-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b644 Second, the Dissent\u2019s reliance on the statutory basis for damages in wrongful death actions to deny a common law claim in nonfatal injury cases is misplaced. Wrongful death actions are a creature of statute, but actions for personal injury are not. Under Montana law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the legislature enacts statutes to <em>limit </em>rights that otherwise would be available at common law. <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, </em>each person is responsible not only for the results of the person\u2019s willful acts but also for an injury occasioned to another by the person\u2019s want of ordinary care or skill in the management of the person\u2019s property or person except so far as the person has willfully or by want of ordinary care brought the injury upon the person.\u201d Section 27-1-701, MCA (emphasis added). Moreover, we reaffirmed just recently that \u201cMontana does not statutorily define wrongful death claimants, but through the common law has identified survivors who may claim wrongful death damages, as well as the parameters of recovery.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bennett, </em>2013 MT 230, \u00b6 11, 371 Mont. 275, 308 P.3d 63 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b645 In this regard, recovery under Montana\u2019s wrongful death statute is no different from recovery in nonfatal injury cases. Section 27-1-323, MCA, allows a wrongful death claimant to recover \u201csuch damages... as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d Similarly, \u201c[t]he law of torts \u2019attempts primarily to put an injured person in a position as nearly as possible equivalent to his position prior to the tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, </em>Inc., 2007 MT 183, \u00b6 32, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 901 cmt. a (1997); <em>Butler v. Germann, </em>251 Mont. 107, 110, 822 P.2d 1067, 1069 (1991)). Accordingly, \u201cMontana law provides for monetary compensation to every person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another.\u201d <em>Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 76, 319 Mont. 307, 84 P.3d 38 (citing \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA); <em>see, e.g., </em>Montana Pattern Instructions (MPI2d) 25.00 (published by the State Bar of Montana, 2003) (\u201cIf you find for the plaintiff on the question of liability\u00bb then you must determine the amount of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate the plaintiff for all loss caused by the defendants), regardless of whether such loss could have been anticipated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b646 Finally, \u201ccourts have increasingly recognized and expanded the field of children\u2019s rights.\u201d Katarina Donohue, <em>Should California Extend its Current Law on Loss of Consortium to the Parent-Child Relationship In Cases Where the Child or Parent Has Been Negligently Injured by a Third Party?, </em>5 Whittier J. Child &amp; Fam. Advoc. 625, 634 (2005-2006). I have little trouble concluding, as have numerous other courts, \u201cthat the two relationships likely to be most severely affected by a negligent injury to a person are the husband and wife relationship and that of the parent and child[.]\u201d Reagan <em>v. Vaughn, </em>804 S.W.2d 463, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>466 (Tex. 1990). It certainly is foreseeable that a child will be severely impacted by a serious injury to the parent, even if the child is over eighteen at the time that iqjury occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b647 The loss of a parent\u2019s \u201ccare, companionship, and education\u201d is \u201ca genuine injury, and a serious one.\u201d William L. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 125, 896 (4th ed. 1971); <em>see also </em>Dobbs et al., \u00a7 392. Although the legal duty of financial support may in most cases terminate when a child reaches adulthood, <em>but see In re </em>M.A.S., \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, the law should not impose such an artificial extinguishment when it comes to the inherent filial right to a parent\u2019s affection, aid, and society. Rather, it is the nature of the parent-child relationship and the destruction of that relationship that should serve to determine whether the cause of action is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b648 Obviously, the older and more independent the child, and the further the distance between child and parent \u2014 geographically or emotionally \u2014 the more attenuated a loss of consortium claim becomes. <em>Ueland v. Pengo Hydra-Pull Corp., </em>691 P.2d 190, 195 (Wash. 1984). But the Court today properly leaves to the trial court the decision whether a sufficient claim has been made in the case before it to allow consideration by the jury. Opinion, \u00b6 36. Based on the facts to which the parties have stipulated, I concur that such a claim has been stated by Sadee Stucky.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-5\"> Of the five states the Dissent cites as having \u201cspecifically denied\u201d an adult child\u2019s claim, Dissent, \u00b6 63, two do not recognize even a minor child\u2019s claim for loss of consortium when aparent is injured. <em>Lewis v. Rowland, </em>701 S.W.2d 122, 123(Ark. 1985); <em>Natalini v. Little, </em>92 P.3d 567, 570 (Kan. 2004). One case considered, and rejected, only the claim of a non-adopted adult step-child. <em>Mendoza v. B.L.H. Electronics, </em>530 N.E.2d 349, 350 (Mass. 1988). In another, an intermediate appellate court concluded that any extension of a right of action must come from either the legislature or the state\u2019s supreme court. <em>Smith v. Vilvarajah, </em>57 S.W.3d 839, 844 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000). In the fifth, the Wisconsin Supreme Court decided for the first time that a minor child may bring a cause of action for the loss of a parent\u2019s society and companionship resulting from another\u2019s negligence. <em>Theama v.

Fallon Cnty., </em>222 Mont. 214, 217-18, 721 P.2d 342, 344 (1986)). This is a noble statement. Our responsibility to \u201creform common law as justice requires,\u201d <em>Pence v.

Opinion, \u00b6 22. This analogy is inapt. The expansion of this cause of action to provide equal redress for women was based upon the mutual rights and obligations inhering in the marriage contract, recognized in statute, and further supported by legislative policy intended \u201cto place husband and wife upon a <em>parity.\u201dDuffy v. Lipsman-Fulkerson &amp; Co., </em>200 F. Supp. 71, 74 (D. Mont. 1961). Without question, the common law in many instances harbored great injustices against women, and courts were justified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>recognizing reforms \u201cconsonant with the changing needs of society.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>222 Mont, at 218, 721 P.2d at 344. With respect to the question we face today, however, \u201c \u2018the reasoning supporting the recognition of the wife\u2019s claim, to end an [ujnjust discrimination in the law, is not applicable to a child\u2019s claim for loss of parental consortium.\u2019 \u201d <em>W.J. Bremer Co. v. Graham </em>, 312 S.E.2d 806, 808 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983) (quoting <em>DeAngelis v. Lutheran Med. Ctr., </em>84 A.D.2d 17, 26 (N.Y.

In relying generally on its authority to develop the common law, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, the Court misses the fact that substantially different social policies and historical circumstances justified the expansion of the cause of action to allow redress for wives as well as husbands.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b651 The Court also mischaracierizes the relationship between the loss of consortium cause of action and its foundation in a pre-existing legal right, which was relied upon by the federal court <em>in Duffy. </em>200 F. Supp. at 72-73. As the Court notes, <em>Duffy </em>looked to two elements defining a cause of action: a right on the part of the plaintiff, and the violation of that right by the defendant. Opinion, \u00b6 23; 200 F. Supp. at 72. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">Turning then to the first element of a cause of action, <em>the existence of a right in the plaintiff, </em>it is clear under Montana law that a wife obtains certain rights by virtue of the marriage relationship. [Section] 48-101, R.C.M. 1947, provides that marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which the consent of parties capable of making it is necessary. [Section] 36-101, R.C.M. 1947, provides that upon entering into a marriage, the husband and wife contract toward each other obligations of mutual respect, fidelity and support. Thus the mutual rights which arise in the husband and wife upon marriage may be termed contractual rights or legal rights. It is also clear that included in these rights which arise upon marriage are rights which are embraced within the meaning of the term consortium</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"><em>Duffy, </em>200 F.

Two years later, the federal court again confronted the question, and again based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>recognition of the cause of action on existing statutory and common law rights. <em>Dutton v. Hightower &amp; Lubrecht Constr. Co., </em>214 F. Supp. 298, 300 (D. Mont. 1963). The <em>Dutton </em>court explained that the right of a husband to recover for the loss of his wife\u2019s consortium existed in common law, and that those aspects of the common law denying a wife the same right had been changed by statute. 214 F.

Neither <em>Duffy not Dutton </em>created new rights; they recognized rights existing at common law and the manner in which legislative action had altered the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b653 When this Court addressed the issue in 1986, it held \"that the basis for a consortium claim lies in the Montana statutes in which the husband and wife contract for obligations of mutual respect, fidelity, and support,\u201d again referring to rights existing at common law and in contract, and the specific recognition of those rights by the legislature. <em>Bain v. Gleason, </em>223 Mont. 442, 445, 726 P.2d 1153, 1155 (1986) (citing \u00a7 40-2-101, MCA). <em>Bain </em>did not create \u201ca legal right to the aid, protection, affection and society of the other spouse,\u201d but acknowledged that such right already existed and thus deserved legal protection. 223 Mont, at 445, 726 P.2d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b654 In <em>Pence, </em>we were asked to address whether two minor children had a cause of action for loss of parental consortium when their father had been injured and rendered quadriplegic. 248 Mont, at 522, 813 P.2d at 403. In expanding the cause of action to parties other than spouses, we continued to rely on the existence of common law and statutoiy rights. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 525-26, 813 P.2d at 432. <em>Pence </em>relied on \u00a7 40-6-211, MCA, which then stated: The parent or parents entitled to custody of a child must give him support and education suitable to his circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 248 Mont, at 525, 813 P.2d at 432. <em>Pence </em>also recognized that this statute, like statutes governing marriage, codified pre-existing common law rights. 248 Mont, at 525-26, 813 P.2d at 432 (\"Like the rights of a wife, the rights of the child to support, aid, protection, affection and society of the parent derive from both statute and case law.\u201d) We later concluded that the parent need not be rendered quadriplegic in order for his or her minor children to claim loss of consortium. <em>Keele v. St. Vincent Hosp. &amp; Health Care Ctr., </em>258 Mont. 158, 161, 852 P.2d 574, 576 (1993). We continued to recognize that our expansion of the loss of consortium cause of action had its roots in both statutoiy and common law concepts: that is, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>finding an existing statutory right, we appropriately recognized a cause of action allowing aggrieved parties to recover for the violation of that right. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 525-26, 813 P.2d at 432. Our development of the common law was therefore based on existing legal rights. Though we recognized new claims allowing the enforcement of those rights, we did not create the rights themselves from whole cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b655 Each of the cases cited above addressed a common law loss of consortium claim based on non-fatal injuries to a spouse or parent. Another line of cases addresses damages for loss of consortium brought in the context of a statutory wrongful death action. Our consideration of the relationship between adults and their parents has been limited to the context of statutory wrongful death actions, until today. In <em>Dawson v. Hill &amp; Hill Truck Lines, </em>206 Mont. 325, 671 P.2d 589 (1983), we recognized that pursuant to our wrongful death statutes, parents were entitled to recover loss of consortium damages following the wrongful death of a minor child. Based on this decision, we later held that children, regardless of minority or majority, were entitled to recover loss of consortium damages following the wrongful death of a parent. <em>Ewalt v. Scott, </em>206 Mont. 503, 675 P.2d 77 (1983). We based these holdings on our construction of \u00a7 27-1-323, MCA, which provides that in a wrongful death action, \"such damages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b656 In <em>Bear Medicine v. United States, </em>192 F. Supp. 2d 1053, 1067-68 (D.

Frederickson, </em>2004 MT 324, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23,324 Mont. 86, 101 P.3d 773, we concluded that a mother was not the proper party to bring a wrongful death action because she was not the personal representative of her adult son\u2019s estate, but affirmed that \"loss of consortium and loss of comfort and society damages are examples of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u2018just\u2019 damages available in wrongful death actions,\u201d referring again to our interpretation of \u00a7 27-1-323, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b657 In Hern <em>v. Safeco Insurance Co. of Illinois, </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6 48, 329 Mont. 347, 125 P.3d 597, we again addressed a wrongful death action, as we had done in <em>Renville </em>and as the federal court had done in <em>Bear Medicine. </em>The mother of the deceased adult in that case argued that \u201c\u00a7 27-1-323, MCA recognizes a broad range of damages \u2018as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 49. Following the lead of the federal court <em>in Bear Medicine, </em>which relied on Backing Woman\u2019s role as a spiritual leader within his tribe and his contributions to running his parents\u2019 ranch, we concluded that the parent of a deceased adult could claim loss of consortium damages where there existed \u201csignificant evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship.\u201d <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b658 The Court is simply wrong when it states that \u201c[n]either <em>Bear Medicine </em>nor <em>Hem </em>relied on statutes to establish a legal right to consortium ... .\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. Both <em>Bear Medicine </em>and <em>Hern </em>were wrongful death actions, and therefore relied on the wrongful death statutes. Sections 27-1-323, -513, MCA. Unlike a common law loss of consortium claim resulting from a non-fatal injury, \u201c[a] cause of action for wrongful death is a legislative creation.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 25. <em>Bear Medicine </em>and <em>Hern </em>interpreted and applied our wrongful death statutes, as enacted by the legislature, to determine what damages were \u201cjust\u201d in those cases. Sections 27-1-323, -513, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b659 We have been asked to decide whether an adult may bring an independent common law claim for loss of consortium resulting from non-fatal injuries to her father. In so deciding, we may not rely on the breadth of our wrongful death statutes, but must return instead to those cases addressing the availability of the cause of action under the common law. Those cases have allowed claims for loss of consortium to be brought only by spouses or minor children. <em>See Dutton, </em>214 F. Supp. at <em>299-300; Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at <em>72; Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 159, 852 P.2d at 575; <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 522, 813 P.2d at 430; <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont, at 445, 726 P.2d at 1155. Recognition of a claim by an adult for the loss of consortium with his or her parent is not \u201ca natural extension of Montana\u2019s common law.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32. Rather, it is a distinct departure from the logic that has governed our previous analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b660 Our precedent, until now, has followed the approach outlined by the federal court in <em>Duffy: </em>in recognizing a new cause of action, we have first looked for an existing right on the part of the plaintiff. 200 F. Supp. at 72 <em>;Dillon, </em>38 Mont, at 496, 100 P. at 963. In <em>Duffy, Dutton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>and <em>Bain, </em>that right was found to inhere in the marital obligation and attendant rights, as recognized both at common law and by statute. <em>Dutton, </em>214 F. Supp. at 300; <em>Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at 72-73; <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont, at 445, 726 P.2d at 1155. In <em>Pence </em>and <em>Keele, </em>that right was found in the legal obligation of a parent to support his or her child, existing both at common law and in statute. <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 161, 852 P.2d at 576; <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont, at 526, 813 P.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b661 The Court departs from this precedent by premising its recognition of a new cause of action on a relational interest, rather than a legal one. The Court cites no authority establishing the right of an emancipated adult to receive the aid, protection, affection, and society of a parent. While minor children have a right to receive care necessary for their emotional well-being, <em>In re C.M.S., </em>187 Mont. 115, 122-24, 609 P.2d 240, 243-45 (1979), an adult has no similar right to be provided with affection, advice, or other benefits conducive to emotional well-being. An adult has no legal right to be supported, whether emotionally or financially, by his or her parent. <em>See In re Marriage of Haberkern, </em>2004 MT 29, \u00b6 20, 319 Mont. 393, 85 P.3d 743 (In Montana, parental obligation to support minor children ends when a child reaches the age of majority....\u201d). This can be a harsh reality, as many young adults discover, but it is no less true for that. The Court recognizes that we have no statutes \"directly on point\u201d which would establish such a right or obligation. Opinion, \u00b6 30 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 40-6-214, -301, MCA, establishing obligations of support between parents and adult children limited to circumstances of indigence or disability). Instead, the Court broadly states, with no support in Montana law, that\" \u2018even adult and married children have the right to expect the benefit of good parental advice and guidance.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc. v. Ill. Cent. &amp; </em>Gulf R.R., 335 N.W.2d 148, 152 (Iowa 1983)). They may well expect it, but in Montana they have no existing legal right to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b662 By contrast, in Iowa, a statute provides that in cases of \u201cwrongful or negligent iiyury or death,\u201d damages may be recovered for \u201cthe value of services and support as spouse or parent, or both ... .\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 613.15 (2013). It is this provision that the Iowa Supreme Court relied on in allowing a child to recover damages for loss of parental consortium in cases of non-fatal injury. <em>Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc., </em>335 N.W.2d at 151-52. The Iowa Supreme Court did not create a new right simply because it valued the parent-child relationship. Rather, it interpreted the language of \u00a7 613.15 and found it did not limit the availability of damages to the period of a child\u2019s minority, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>in so doing, it actually retracted previous recognition of a child\u2019s independent common law claim for loss of parental consortium. <em>Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, </em>Inc., 335 N.W.2d at 152. The court relied on public policy to support its statutory interpretation. <em>Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc., </em>335 N.W.2d at 152. Our pronouncements about the \u201cenduring nature of the parent-child relationship,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32, serve no similar purpose, as we have no applicable statute \u2014 outside the context of a wrongful death \u2014 to interpret.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b663 While the Court cites a \u201cnational trend\u201d in support of expanding recognition of claims for loss of consortium, Opinion, \u00b6 32, the majority of jurisdictions do not allow an adult to bring a claim for loss of consortium with his or her injured parent. <em>See </em>131 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 3d <em>Loss of Consortium in Parent-Child Relationship </em>\u00a7 4 (2013). The Concurrence observes that \u201cthere appear to be relatively few recent court decisions that decide the issue one way or the other.\u201d Concurrence, \u00b6 41. Indeed, only five jurisdictions have decisively concluded that an adult may bring a cause of action or claim damages for loss of consortium when his or her parent is severely injured. <em>See Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc., </em>335 N.W.2d at 152; <em>Rolf v. Tri State Motor Transit Co., </em>745 N.E.2d 424, 427-28 (Ohio <em>2001);Nelson v. Four Seasons Nursing Ctr., </em>934 P.2d 1104, 1105 (Okla. Civ. App. 1996); <em>Reagan v.

Pengo Hydra-Pull Carp., </em>691 P.2d 190, 195 (Wash. 1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An equal number have specifically denied an adult\u2019s right to bring a cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>loss of consortium with an injured parent. <em>See Lewis v. Rowland, </em>701 S.W.2d 122, 124 (Ark. 1985); <em>Natalini v. Little, </em>92 P.3d 567, 570 (Kan. 2004); <em>Smith v. Vilvarajah, </em>57 S.W.3d 839, 841 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000); <em>Mendoza v. B.L.H.

The Concurrence fails to observe the large number of jurisdictions in which an adult\u2019s cause of action for loss of parental consortium is unlikely ever to be addressed, because the same cause of action by a minor child has already been rejected. <em>See Borer v.

Super. Ct. 1986); <em>Taylor v. Beard, </em>104 S.W.3d 507, 511 (Tenn. 2003). In an additional three states, the parties who may claim loss of consortium damages in cases of nonfatal injury are limited by statute and do not include emancipated adults, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.0415 (2014); R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 9-1-41 (2014); S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-75-20 (2013), and one state, Utah, recognizes no independent causes of action for loss of consortium, <em>Boucher v. Dixie Med. Ctr., </em>850 P.2d 1179, 1184-85 (Utah 1992). In all, an adult\u2019s cause of action for loss of consortium with an injured parent is precluded in 30 states. This is not an undeveloped area of law in which persuasive authority is lacking. The \"trend\u201d referred to by the Opinion, \u00b6 32, and the \"legal commentary\u201d cited by the Concurrence, \u00b6 41, are decidedly in the minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b664 Furthermore, the decisions of other states cited by the Court do not necessarily support its position. As noted, the Iowa Supreme Court relied on a statutory right to recover damages for loss of parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>services and support. <em>Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc., </em>335 N.W.2d at 152. In fact, the court later declined to allow the parents of a deceased adult to bring an independent cause of action for loss of consortium or to claim loss of consortium damages in their wrongful death suit, in the absence of an existing statutory or common law right. <em>Kulish v. W. Side Unlimited </em>Corp., 545 N. W.2d 860, 862-63 (Iowa 1996). Two of the cases which the Court notes we relied on in <em>Pence, Hibpshman v. Prudhoe Bay Supply, Inc., </em>734 P.2d 991, 997 (Alaska 1987), and <em>Villareal v. Arizona Department of Transportation, </em>774 P.2d 213, 215 (Ariz. 1989), addressed only claims brought by minor children, and are not persuasive in our consideration of a claim brought by an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b665 The Court also cites a Tennessee case, <em>Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hospital, </em>984 S. W.2d 593,596 (Tenn. 1999), which interpreted that state\u2019s wrongful death statutes, but fails to observe that the <em>Jordan </em>court \u201cexpressed] no opinion as to whether the loss of parental consortium may be recovered in personal injury actions in which the parent or parents survive.\u201d Indeed, in a later case, the Tennessee Supreme Court \u201cdeclinetd] to create a common law cause of action for loss of parental consortium in personal injury cases.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>104 S.W.3d at 511. In so doing, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">In our view, the appellants do not simply request that we remove an impediment to the continual development of the common law, nor do they ask us to interpret an ambiguous statutory or constitutional provision. Rather, the appellants ask this Court to declare the public policy of this State by creating a previously unrecognized common law cause of action in an area where the legislature has taken action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\"><em>Taylor, </em>104 S.W.3d at 510-11.I believe we face the same circumstance in this case. Because I can find no existing legal right which has been violated, <em>Duffy, </em>200 F. Supp. at 72,I do not join the Court in declaring that an adult may bring a cause of action for the loss of consortium with his or her injured parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b666 In addressing whether an adult has a cause of action in such circumstances, the Concurrence observes that independent loss of consortium claims \"spring from the common law,\u201d and thus do not require the existence of a statutory right. Concurrence, \u00b6 39. Any cause of action, however, requires a legal right on the part of the plaintiff. <em>Dillon, </em>38 Mont, at 496, 100 P. at 963. Sadee Stucky\u2019s cause of action for loss of parental consortium does not have to be founded on a statute, but it does have to be founded on a legal right to the affection and society of her father. A minor child has a legal right to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>emotional and physical care from a parent. <em>C.M.S., </em>187 Mont, at 122-24, 609 P.2d at 243-45. A spouse has a legal right to the aid, protection, affection and society of the other spouse. <em>Bain, </em>223 Mont, at 445, 726 P.2d at 1155. An adult \u2014 even a young adult \u2014 has no legal right to continue to receive the affection and society of a parent. Parental support is nice to have, but it is not a legal entitlement. The \u201cinherent filial right\u201d referred to by the Concurrence, \u00b6 47, is not found anywhere in our law. Absent a legally cognizable right, a cause of action cannot be stated. <em>Dillon, </em>38 Mont, at 496, 100 P. at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b667 The Concurrence states that \u201cthere are significant legal and policy reasons\u201d to allow an adult to bring a cause of action for loss of consortium with an injured parent. Concurrence, \u00b6 39. Despite this assertion, the Concurrence provides no Montana precedent establishing the legal right at issue. Instead, the Concurrence cites \u201clegal commentary\u201d favoring increased recognition of children\u2019s rights. Concurrence, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43, 46. Children\u2019s rights are not at issue here. There is no impediment to the ability of an eighteen-year-old woman to bring a legal action, provided she has suffered legal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b668 To that end, the Concurrence also cites cases and commentaiy stating that injured persons should be compensated for their losses. Concurrence, \u00b6 45. The sources cited, however, refer to persons who have been directly injured. When we are asked to define the category of injured persons, it does not advance that inquiry to state that an injured person is entitled to compensation. Liability must end somewhere; a fine must be drawn. In recognizing an \u201cinherent filial right\u201d rather than a legally cognizable one, we blur this line to the point where it may no longer exist. As the Connecticut Supreme Court has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">In the constellation of family relationships, there are other formally recognized relationships \u2014 e.g., siblings, grandparent and grandchild, and aunt or uncle and nephew or niece \u2014 and others, less formally recognized but nonetheless just as real in an emotional sense \u2014 e.g., stepsiblings, and stepchild and stepparent \u2014 that could well, depending on the case, present equally strong claims of loss of consortium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\"><em>Mendillo, </em>717 A.2d at 1191. Following our decision today, can we draw any coherent distinction between these relationships in future cases, when a loved one claims an \u201cinherent right\u201d to the society of an injured person?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b669 In its broad statements about the function of loss of consortium claims to address \u201cinjuries to emotional well-being,\u201d the Concurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>seems to suggest that every instance of grief or sadness, by definition it would seem, presents a legally cognizable injury. Concurrence, \u00b6 42. There is no generalized right to emotional well-being. We have recognized that \u201c[t]he loss of or serious injury to a child, whether an adult or a minor, is no doubt a traumatic experience, but it is one experienced by countless parents every year.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 15. In spite of this, \u201c \u201clife goes on.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 15. The same is true when a young adult experiences the loss of or serious injury to a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b670 As far as the \u201cpolicy reasons\u201d alluded to, the Concurrence concludes that \u201cthe law should not impose such an artificial extinguishment when it comes to the inherent filial right to a parent\u2019s affection, aid, and society.\u201d Concurrence, \u00b6 47. Yes, the age of majority is a legal concept, arbitrarily set at 18 years rather than 19,16, or 21. That is not, in itself, reason to deprive it of legal significance. The Concurrence advocates a policy of indefinite childhood. This, too, is bad policy. The law should promote independence in young adults, rather than vesting in them the legal right to have a parent attend to their intangible needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b671 I feel sympathy for Sadee Stucky and her family, and I admire the close relationship Calvin Stucky built with his daughters. Embarking on an independent adult life is a challenging endeavor, and without question, Sadee\u2019s path has been made even more challenging by this family hardship. Absent a legally cognizable right, however, I do not believe this Court should create a new cause of action simply to fit the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b672 If the Court is to recognize such a cause of action, I believe we must clearly define the evidentiaiy standard to be applied. We must first recognize the distinction between the evidentiary standards we have applied to independent causes of action for loss of consortium and those for determining \u201cjust\u201d damages pursuant to the wrongful death statute. In <em>Keele, </em>we held that a minor child bringing a cause of action for loss of consortium with an injured parent must establish that the parent has suffered a serious, permanent and disabling mental or physical injury compensable under Montana law, and that the parent\u2019s ultimate condition of mental or physical impairment must be so overwhelming and severe that it causes the parent-child relationship to be destroyed or nearly destroyed. 258 Mont, at 162, 852 P.2d at 577. <em>Keele </em>required no proof of the nature of the relationship between parent and child, only the degree of injury. This was appropriate because the child was a minor, and close dependence could therefore be presumed. In <em>Hern, </em>we held that a parent claiming damages for loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of consortium with a deceased adult child in a wrongful death action must present significant evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship, Hern, \u00b6 58. <em>Hern </em>required no proof of the degree of injury or harm to the relationship. Again, this was appropriate because in a wrongful death, there could be no question that the relationship was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b673 In this case, the party claiming loss of parental consortium is not a minor child, and so a relationship of close dependence cannot be presumed. Similarly, because the injuries are non-fatal, we must require proof of the degree of injury and the resulting damage to the parental relationship. In short, neither the <em>Keele </em>standard nor the <em>Hern </em>standard is appropriate on its own. The Opinion claims to adopt the <em>Keele </em>standard, but in addition to requiring the two elements stated under <em>Keele, </em>states that \u201cthe plaintiff <em>may </em>present evidence of factors including... the actual effect the parent\u2019s injury has had on the relationship and is likely to have in the future; the child\u2019s age; the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parent; and the child\u2019s emotional, physical, and geographic characteristics.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6 38 (emphasis added). In <em>Hem, </em>we recognized that consideration of the nature of the relationship between an adult and his or her parent was necessary when addressing a claim for loss of consortium damages. The Court seems to find that consideration appropriate here, to some degree \u2014 but doesn\u2019t actually <em>require </em>any evidence of the nature of the relationship, and provides no guidance on the minimum showing a plaintiff must make to have the cause of action presented to a jury. Opinion, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b674 The \u201cstandard\u201d enunciated by the Court is not only legally confusing and inadequate, it draws a wholly unsupported distinction between the rights of a parent and the rights of an adult son or daughter in identical circumstances. The Court rejects the <em>Hem </em>standard, which we have already applied to the relationship between an adult and his or her parent in the context of a wrongful death action. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. Instead, the Court claims to apply the standard we set out for an independent loss of consortium claim by a minor child in <em>Keele, </em>concluding there is \u201cno reason to adopt a different standard\u201d when the plaintiff is an adult. Opinion, \u00b6 36. The Court reasons that \u201cit is only the age of the child that is different,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36, inexplicably ignoring the fact that age is precisely what makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the difference, legally, between a child and an adult. Section 41-1-101, MCA. It is not \u201conly the age of the child\u201d at issue: it is the fact that at a certain age, one is no longer a child. Under the law, that is reason enough to adopt a different standard. <em>See, e.g., Mode v. Barnett, </em>361 S.W.2d 525, 530 (Ark. 1962) (\u201cThe adult child who loses a parent is generally better able to withstand the blow than a minor child whose close and constant association with the parent in the home creates considerably more of a binding tie.\u201d); <em>Smith, </em>57 S.W.3d at 843 (\u201c[Tjhere is a legitimate basis for limiting recovery for loss of parental consortium to minor or unemancipated children.\u201d); <em>Theama, </em>344 N.W.2d at 522 (\u201c[T]he minor is one whose relationship is most likely to be severely affected by a negligent injury to the parent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b675 The Court declares that \u201can adult child\u2019s reliance on a parent for guidance and support is likely different from the parent\u2019s reliance on a child that we discussed in <em>Hern. </em>No \u2018extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship\u2019 is required for an adult child to be harmed, or even devastated, by the effective loss of a close parent-child relationship.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Setting aside the circuitous statement that a close relationship is not required for one to be devastated by the loss of a close relationship, the Court implies that a parent is comparably unlikely to be devastated by the loss of a close relationship with an adult son or daughter. The Court presents no support for this assertion. I find equal arguments to the contrary: in the course of life, it is natural and expected that one will eventually suffer the loss of one\u2019s parents. It is not expected, at any age, that one will lose a child. It is not for this Court to categorically declare one loss more devastating than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b676 In defining the standard to govern an adult\u2019s cause of action for loss of consortium with a non-fatally injured parent, if the Court should recognize such a cause of action, I would uphold the standard we have previously applied to the parent-child relationship when it exists between two adults, and require evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 58. Because a non-fatal injury is involved, I would also require proof that the parent has suffered a serious, permanent and disabling mental or physical injury compensable under Montana law, and that the parent\u2019s ultimate condition of mental or physical impairment must be so overwhelming and severe that it causes the parent-child relationship to be destroyed or nearly destroyed. <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont, at 162, 852 P.2d at 577. Requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate the severity and genuineness of his or her injury as a threshold matter is also consistent with our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>approach to causes of action for other intangible injuries, such as emotional distress. <em>See Sacco v. High Country Indep. Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 232, 896 P.2d 411, 425 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b677 For the reasons stated above, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\"> Section 40-6-211, MCA, now reads: \u201cThe parent or parents of a child shall give the child support and education suitable to the child\u2019s circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> In <em>Bear Medicine, </em>Leland Kicking Woman was injured in a logging accident and died nine months later as a result of those injuries. 192 F.

Under these facts, I admit it may he unclear, on a first reading, whether the court awarded loss of consortium damages to Kicking Woman\u2019s parents for the period during which he survived, but was severely injured, or for his wrongful death. This ambiguity is resolved by the court\u2019s statements that \u201c[floss of consortium damages are recoverable in wrongful death cases and are appropriate under the facts of this case,\u201d and \u201c[l]oss of consortium damages compensate the plaintiff for the loss ofcare, comfort, society and companionship of <em>the decedent.\u201d Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.

LEXIS 74867 at *10 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 21, 2009), which observed that six states had recognized such a claim. One of the states referred to, Arizona, recognized a child\u2019s claim for loss of parental consortium in a consolidated appeal involving several families. <em>Villareal v. Ariz. Dept. of </em>Transp., 774 P.2d 213 (Ariz. 1989). One of these, the VillarealGarcia family, included an adult daughter claiming loss of parental consortium with her injured father. The Villareal-Garcia family Bettled before the appeal was resolved, and thus the Arizona Supreme Court stated that its holding would apply only to the Newman and Fuentes children, who were minors. <em>Villareal, 774 </em>P.2d at 219-20. The Arizona Supreme Court reasoned that recognizing the cause of action was consistent with \u201cincreased recognition and awareness of children as persons with rights,\u201d a consideration irrelevant to recognition of an adult\u2019s claim. <em>Villareal, </em>774 P.2d at 217. Additionally, in Hawaii, the United States District Court has surmised that the Hawaii Supreme Court would likely overturn a 1957 case and allow an adult\u2019s claim for loss of parental consortium in cases of non-fatal injury. <em>Marquardt v. United Airlines, Inc., 781 </em>F. Supp. 1487, 1491 (D. Haw. 1992). The Hawaii Supreme Court has not yet acted.
