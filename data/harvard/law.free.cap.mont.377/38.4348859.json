The sentence shall not be reduced or increased unless it is clearly inadequate or clearly excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AyM\">DATED this 29th day of April, 2014.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The <em>majority </em>of the Division has determined that the sentence is clearly excessive. Specifically, Judge Seeley and Judge Gilbert find that the fact that this sentence was made to run \u201cconsecutive\u201d to the Defendant\u2019s other sentence imposed in DC-07-304, Missoula County, resulted in an excessive and unfair punishment, and would operate to prevent necessary programming and rehabilitation of the Defendant. The Division\u2019s decision is that the sentence imposed shall run \u201cconcurrent to the sentence imposed in DC-07-304, Missoula County.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The remaining terms and conditions of the sentence imposed are not clearly inadequate or clearly excessive and are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Done in open Court this 11th day of April, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-9\">Member Hon. Kathy Seeley and Member Hon. Brenda Gilbert.</judges>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The undersigned Judge, respectfully dissents. He believes the sentence was not shown to be clearly excessive or clearly inadequate and would affirm the sentence given by the sentencing court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-11\">Chairperson, Hon.
