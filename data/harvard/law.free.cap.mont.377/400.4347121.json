(Birth Mother) and S.B.C. (Biological Father) appeal from the order entered by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, terminating both parents\u2019 rights to their minor child, S.B.C., Jr. (S.B.C.), and granting the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division (Child Services) permanent legal custody with right to consent to adoption. The Birth Mother and Biological Father also challenge the District Court\u2019s order denying transfer of jurisdiction to the Blackfeet Tribal Court. The Blackfeet Tribe (Tribe) has filed a cross-appeal likewise challenging the denial of its motion to transfer jurisdiction to the Blackfeet Tribal Court and the termination of Biological Father\u2019s parental rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by denying the Tribe\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction to the Blackfeet Tribal Court?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Biological Father\u2019s parental rights?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\"><em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Birth Mother\u2019s parental </em>rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\u00b63 S.B.C. is a Native American child, whose biological parents are enrolled members of the Blackfeet Tribe. Because of S.B.C.\u2019s ancestry he is considered an \"Indian child\u201d under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\u00cd4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Birth Mother gave birth to S.B.C. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>June 2011. Birth Mother and Biological Father are not married. Biological Father's name did not appear on S.B.C.\u2019s birth certificate and he has not pursued a parental relationship with S.B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b64 On July 28, 2011, Child Services filed a petition in Missoula County for emergency protective services and temporary investigative authority. Child Services became involved after law enforcement officers were summoned to Birth Mother\u2019s residence because Birth Mother\u2019s other minor child, S.B.C.\u2019s half-sister, was found naked and unsupervised in the middle of a busy intersection. This was the fourth time in two weeks law enforcement officers had been called to Birth Mother\u2019s residence to deal with similar issues. Law enforcement discovered Birth Mother had left the residence and there was no adult to care for S.B.C. Child Services contacted Birth Mother and explained if she did not return home, S.B.C. would be placed in protective care. There was an outstanding arrest warrant for Birth Mother at that time and, when she failed to return home, S.B.C. was removed. He was then 27 days old. Biological Father knew of the removal, but declined to take custody of S.B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b65 At the time of removal, Child Services consulted with the Blackfeet Tribe\u2019s ICWA coordinator, Raquel Vaile, who advised that S.B.C.\u2019s paternal grandparents had expressed an intention to become licensed foster care providers. However, until that could be arranged and Title 1V-E funding initiated, Vaile asked that Child Services arrange for placement of S.B.C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b66 In September 2011, Child Services placed S.B.C. back with Birth Mother. They lived together at Mountain Home (a shelter for homeless mothers and children) for approximately three weeks. Birth Mother voluntarily left Mountain Home because she felt there were too many rules to follow. Within days of leaving, Birth Mother was arrested for her fourth offense of Driving under the Influence of Alcohol. Child Services requested Biological Father to take custody, but he again refused and questioned his paternity. Child Services subsequently set up appointments for Biological Father to establish paternity, but he failed to attend the appointments. Following removal, S.B.C. was temporarily placed in six different residences and with five different primary care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u00b67 In October 2011, Vaile met with Sheila Finley, a social worker for Child Services, to discuss more permanent placement options for S.B.C. Vaile explained Biological Father was refusing to care for S.B.C. until paternity was established, she was still assessing the possibility of placing S.B.C. with his paternal grandparents, and that no other kinship placements had yet been identified. Child Services then located a Native American foster parent (Foster Mother) and placed S.B.C. in her care; Foster Mother is an ICWA-qualified foster parent and the adoptive mother of three Native American children. Vaile was advised that Child Services had placed S.B.C. with Foster Mother and approved of the placement on behalf of the Tribe. S.B.C. has been in Foster Mother\u2019s care since the placement in October 2011, and Foster Mother wishes to adopt S.B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b68 In December 2011, the District Court ordered Biological Father to submit to paternity testing. Biological Father eventually submitted and in March 2012 his paternity of S.B.C. was confirmed. Biological Father did not attempt to be a placement option for S.B.C. or visit the child in the nine months following the establishment of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b69 In January 2012, the Tribe filed a notice of intervention in the action. On January 24, 2012, the District Court conducted a youth in need of care adjudication hearing. Vaile testified, in her capacity as the Blackfeet Tribe\u2019s ICWA coordinator, that she continued to support the placement of S.B.C. with Foster Mother; S.B.C. had \u201cbeen placed [with Foster Mother] in, compliance] with the Indian Child Welfare Act\u201d; there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence that supported] that active efforts [had] been engaged in by [Child Services] to prevent the breakup of this Native American family\u201d; and there was \u201cclearing [sic] and convincing evidence that [placing S.B.C. with Birth Mother] would result in serious emotion or physical damage\u201d to S.B.C. as Birth Mother was in custody for DUI. The court adjudicated S.B.C. a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b610 On February 29, 2012, the District Court ordered a treatment plan for Birth Mother to address her alcohol addiction and lack of attention and parenting skills in caring for her children. The treatment plan contained several specific requirements, including that Birth Mother successfully complete inpatient treatment; obtain a sober living environment, whether on her own or in a facility like the Carole Graham Home; inform her social worker of her plans for aftercare and obtain her social worker\u2019s approval for them; and successfully complete her aftercare.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b611 On September 28,2012, Child Services filed a motion to approve a permanency plan. Child Services\u2019 primary plan for S.B.C. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>reunification with Birth Mother with a concurrent plan for adoption of S.B.C. if reunification failed. In December 2012, after successfully completingher inpatient treatment,BirthMother enrolled in aftercare at the Carole Graham Home. However, before reunification with S.B.C. could be accomplished, Birth Mother was asked to leave because of her violations of house rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b612 On February 27,2013, during a status conference on the case, the attorney representing Child Services advised that the State would be pursuing termination of parental rights to S.B.C. The District Court set an initial hearing on the termination issue and all parties were served with a copy of the minute entry and \u201cnote of ruling\u201d reflecting this development, including counsel for the Tribe. On March 6,2013, the State filed a petition to terminate both biological parents\u2019 parental rights based on failed treatment plans and the best interests of the child, and also sought legal custody for the purpose of approving adoption of S.B.C. by Foster Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b613 On April 10,2013, the Tribe filed a motion to transfer jurisdiction to the Blackfeet Tribal Court. Birth Mother joined the motion, which was opposed by the State. The District Court initially issued an order granting the motion, but rescinded that order after the State filed an objection indicating it had a right to respond to the motion. The District Court conducted a hearing on the motion on May 14,2013. The Tribe\u2019s new IC WA coordinator, Anna Fisher, testified that she believed S.B.C. should be removed from his current placement and placed within the Tribe. Specifically, Fisher testified S.B.C. should be placed with Biological Father, who she believed would provide care for the child with the assistance of Biological Father\u2019s mother. Fisher stated, \u201cI think that, right now, in the best interest of [S.B.C.], I think that he would be better off with his own relatives,\u201d and affirmed that Blackfeet culture \u201cdoes not agree, in any event, of [sic] termination of parental rights.\u201d Fisher further opined that Foster Mother was not only unable to properly care for S.B.C., but was also unqualified to raise the other three Native American children she had already adopted because of cultural differences between the children\u2019s tribe and the Foster Mother\u2019s tribe.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When asked by Birth Mother\u2019s counsel if she thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201cthis case should have been transferred to the Blackfeet Tribe a long time ago,\u201d Fisher answered, \u201cYes, I do... it was somebody\u2019s fault. It fell apart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b614 On June 3, 2013, the District Court issued its findings of facts, conclusions of law, and order denying the request to transfer jurisdiction. The court noted that the transfer motion was filed \u201c547-days after [S.B.C.] was placed in his present foster home,\u201d and found that \u201ctransfer of jurisdiction to the Tribe at this stage of the State court proceedings would deny the Youth a permanent adoptive home, and the only home he has ever known, and would create a substantial risk of harm to [S.B.C.] and be a detriment to his physical and psychological well-being.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201cthe disruptive effect of transfer of jurisdiction, just before the termination and adoption proceedings were eminent [sic], to an entirely new court system for rehearings of matters already decided is manifest....\u201d The court concluded that the State has shown good cause to deny the motion seeking transfer of jurisdiction \u201cat this advanced stage of these proceedings,\u201d describing the motion as \u201cuntimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b615 On July 17,2013, Biological Father filed a Petitionfor Supervisory Control to the order denying request to transfer jurisdiction. On August 20, 2013, this Court denied the petition, reasoning that this Court\u2019s review of the District Court\u2019s good cause determination \u201cdoes not raise a purely legal question\u201d and therefore was not suited for the exercise of supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b616 On January 15, 2014 the District Court entered its order terminating both biological parents\u2019 parental rights and granting legal custody to Child Services with the right to consent to the adoption of S.B.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re J.W.C., </em>2011 MT 312, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>265 P.3d 1265. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 24, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>In re J.W.C., </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted). A district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts of a case is a legal conclusion which we review to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>In re J.W.C., </em>\u00b6 15 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b619 We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights. <em>In re J.M., </em>2009 MT 332, \u00b6 12, 353 Mont. 64, 218 P.3d 1213. A district court abuses its discretion if it \u201cacts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re J.M., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b620 We have not previously stated with particularity the standard of review this Court applies to a district court\u2019s determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d regarding a motion to transfer jurisdiction to a tribal court. While we exercise de novo review of good cause determinations in certain contexts, <em>see, e.g.,BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2012 MT 143, \u00b6 16, 365 Mont. 304, 281 P.3d 203, the good cause determination made pursuant to a motion to transfer is based on the best interests of the child, as further discussed herein. Although the best interest inquiry is somewhat unique in this context, we apply an abuse of discretion standard to best interest determinations when reviewing a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights. <em>See In re </em>M.A.L., 2006 MT 299, \u00b6 17, 334 Mont. 436, 148 P.3d 606. Under ICWA, \u201cthe term \u2018good cause\u2019 was designed to provide state courts with flexibility\u201d in addressing transfer issues. <em>In re T.S., </em>245 Mont. 242, 246, 801 P.2d 77, 80 (1990) (quotations omitted). Other appellate courts employ an abuse of discretion standard of review for this issue, noting this flexibility. <em>See, e.g., In the Interest of D.M., </em>2004 SD 90, \u00b6 5, 685 N.W.2d 768 (S.D. 2004) (\u201cDenial of a motion to transfer jurisdiction under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b) is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While a district court\u2019s interpretation of ICWA is an issue of law that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>review for correctness, <em>In re J.W.C., </em>\u00b6 15, a determination of good cause is itself not a purely legal question, as we noted in our denial of supervisory control over this matter. In this context, the good cause decision will be based upon subjective and personal facts regarding a child\u2019s best interest. In view of the nature of the issue, the best interest of the child standard, and the acknowledged flexibility given to states under ICWA to resolve transfer determinations, we adopt the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b621 1. <em>Did the District Court err by denying the Tribe\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction to the Blackfeet Tribal Court?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\"><em>A. </em>Indian Child Welfare Act and Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"Ac0\">\u00b622 ICWA established \u201cminimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902. Congress sought to achieve two goals with the passage of ICWA: (1) \u201cprotect the best interests of Indian children,\u201d and (2) \u201cpromote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b623 At the core of ICWA are its provisions concerning jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings. <em>Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, </em>109 S. Ct. 1597,1601, 490 U.S. 30, 36, 104 L. Ed. 2d 29,38 (1989). ICWA created a dual jurisdictional scheme for child custody proceedings involving Indian children. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911. Section 1911(a) establishes exclusive jurisdiction within tribal courts for child custody proceedings involving an Indian child \u201cwho resides or is domiciled within the reservation.\u201d In contrast, \u00a7 1911(b) creates presumptively tribal yet concurrent state jurisdiction over proceedings involving an Indian child who, as in this case, is \u201cnot domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child\u2019s tribe.\u201d Section 1911(b) further provides that presumptive tribal court jurisdiction may be overcome upon a showing of \u201cgood cause to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Good cause is not specifically defined within ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>B. Determination of Good Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b624 We have explained, as noted above, that \u201cthe use of the term \u2018good cause\u2019 was designed to provide state courts with flexibility in determining the disposition of a placement proceeding involving an Indian child.\u201d <em>In re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 246, 801 P.2d at 80 (citing 44 Fed. Reg. 67584). We have held that, pursuant to this flexibility given to state courts, \u201cthe host interests of the child\u2019 test will be applied in Montana in determining good cause not to transfer jurisdiction of custody proceedings of Indian children under \u00a7 1911(b).\u201dIn <em>re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 247, 801 P.2d at 80 (citing <em>In re </em>195 Mont. 329,336, 635 P.2d 1313, 1317, (1981)). We have called this a \u2018jurisdictional *best interests of the child\u2019 test\u201d that \u201cshould not be confused with\u201d other best interests of the child tests used in different contexts. <em>In re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 247,801 P.2d at 80. In order to satisfy the jurisdictional best interests of the child test, \u201cthe State must provide \u2018clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the child would be injured by such a transfer.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re J.W.C., </em>2011 MT 312, \u00b6 28, 363 Mont. 85, 265 P.3d 1265 (citing In <em>re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 245, 801 P.2d at 79).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b625 To aid state courts in interpreting and applying ICWA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has published guidelines, with accompanying commentary, in the Federal Register. <em>Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, </em>44 Fed. Reg. 67584-67595 (Nov. 26, 1979) (hereinafter, Guidelines). The Guidelines are \u201cnot published as regulations because they are not intended to have binding legislative effect.\u201dIn <em>re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 246, 801 P.2d at 80 (citation omitted). However, the Guidelines are persuasive authority and this Court considers them when interpreting ICWA. <em>In re C.H., </em>2000 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 299 Mont. 62, 997 P.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b626 The Guidelines provide a nan-exhaustive list of criteria that may be considered in good cause determinations. Under section (b) of the Guidelines, good cause to deny transfer may exist under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">(i) The proceeding was at an advanced stage when the petition to transfer was received and the petitioner did not file the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>promptly after receiving notice of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">(ii) The Indian child is over twelve years of age and objects to the transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">(in) The evidence necessary to decide the case could not be adequately presented in the tribal court without undue hardship to the parties or the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">(iv) The parents of a child over five years of age are not available and the child has little or no contact with the child\u2019s tribe or members of the child\u2019s tribe. 44 Fed. Reg. 67591.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The Guidelines also provide that \u201c[sjocio-economic conditions and the perceived adequacy of tribal or Bureau of Indian Affairs social services or judicial systems may not be considered in a determination that good cause exists.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67591.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">C. The District Court\u2019s Denial of Transfer of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">\u00b627 Birth Mother, Biological Father, and the Tribe advance several arguments challenging the District Court\u2019s determination that good cause existed to deny transfer to Tribal Court. First, they argue the court erred by concluding that the proceeding was in an advanced stage when the Tribe filed the motion for transfer, thereby making the motion untimely. This argument is in reference to subsection b(i) of the Guidelines, which provides that \u201c[g]ood cause not to transfer the proceeding may exist\u201d if the \u201cproceeding was at an advanced stage when the petition to transfer was received and the petitioner did not file the petition promptly after receiving notice of the hearing.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67591. This timeliness criterion is \u201cdesigned to encourage the prompt exercise of the right to petition for transfer in order to avoid unnecessary delays.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67591.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u00b628 The District Court was careful to acknowledge that nothing in the actual text of ICWA explicitly requires a tribe\u2019s transfer motion to be timely, but the Tribe makes a valid point with which we concur: the proceeding had not advanced to a stage that rendered the Tribe\u2019s motion, filed about 30 days after the petition for termination, untimely as a matter of law. ICWA does not set concrete timeliness for either tribal intervention or transfer requests. However, ICWA\u2019s purposes include sensitivity to delays in requesting transfers to tribal court. The commentary to the'Guidelines explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">While the Act permits intervention at any point in the proceeding, it does not explicitly authorize transfer requests at anytime. Late interventions do not have nearly the disruptive effect on the proceeding that last minute transfers do.... Although the Act does not explicitly require transfer petitions to be timely, it does authorize the court to refuse to transfer a case for good cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>When a party who could have petitioned earlier waits until the case is almost complete to ask that it be transferred to another court and retried, good cause exists to deny the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">44 Fed. Reg. 67590.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We thus consider the circumstances here, including the delay and the potential harm to the child that could occur by granting a transfer at the time the request was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b629 The Tribe received notice of S.B.C.\u2019s placement in foster care and intervened in January 2012. At the time of the Tribe\u2019s intervention, the problems identified with the biological parents\u2019 ability to care for S.B.C. were readily apparent: Birth Mother had forfeited the care of S.B.C., been arrested for her fourth BUI, and had failed in attempts to reunite with S.B.C.; similarly, Biological Father had denied paternity, refiised to voluntarily undergo paternity tests, and exhibited no interest in caring for S.B.C. \u2014 leading ultimately to the development of a concurrent plan for adoption of S.B.C. later that year. Given the emergent care situation, and the lack of a tribal option, Child Services located an ICWA-qualified foster home and conferred with the Tribe\u2019s representative about this placement, which Vaile approved. S.B.C. went there in October 2011 and progressed well in the care of Foster Mother. The Tribe was continually advised and approved of the situation. The Tribe filed a transfer motion in April 2013,18 months after S.B.C.\u2019s foster care placement, and 15 months after the Tribe intervened. The record does not demonstrate any reason that would have prohibited the Tribe from requesting transfer earlier. Although Fisher\u2019s testimony, that things \u201cfell apart,\u201d infers that tribal disorganization played a role, those problems, if any, should not accrue against S.B.C. and the permanency he achieved in the meantime. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that both the legal proceeding and S.B.C.\u2019s progress in his placement had significantly advanced by the time the Tribe filed its motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b630 The Tribe next argues the District Court improperly found clear and convincing evidence the best interests of the child would be injured by a transfer to Tribal Court. The commentary to the Guidelines states that the motion for transfer should be prompt and avoid delay because \u201c[l]ong periods of uncertainty concerning the future are generally regarded as harmful to the well-being of children. For that reason, it is especially important to avoid unnecessary delays in child custody proceedings.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67591-67592. This Court has likewise stated that \u201ccustody of children should be quickly fixed\u201d and \u201csubject[ing] a child to protracted custodial litigation\u201d is harmful to a child\u2019s best interests. <em>In re Matter of D.A., </em>2003 MT 109, \u00b6 16, 315 Mont. 340, 68 P.3d 735 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b631  The District Court found from testimony that separation from his current placement would be very traumatic for S.B.C. The court found Foster Mother is the only parent he has ever known and that removal would create a substantial risk of harm to him, and be a detriment to his physical and psychological well-being. It found that Foster Mother fully appreciates the laudable goals of ICWA, understands and is capable of helping S.B.C. learn his own heritage, culture and customs, and is willing to travel with him to participate in important tribal activities and rituals unique to his Blackfeet Tribe. The District Court did not err by finding there was clear and convincing evidence that subjecting S.B.C. to another court system and beginning the proceeding anew in Tribal Court would injure S.B.C.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b632 Lastly, the Tribe argues the District Court improperly considered the socio-economic conditions of the Tribal Court. Subsection (c) of the Guidelines prohibit. the consideration of the \u201c[s]ocio-economic conditions and the perceived adequacy\u201d of the tribal court system in making a determination of good cause. 44 Fed. Reg. 67591. In an attempt to demonstrate that the court based its decision on the inadequacy of the Tribal Court system, the Tribe draws our attention to a number of assertions the District Court made in its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The District Court remarked throughout its findings of fact and conclusions of law that the Tribe \u201cchose to sit on its hands and delay seeking jurisdiction over [S.B.C.] for tribal financial reasons.\u201d Further, the court insinuated that the Tribe believes its children are sacred \u201conly when it is in its best financial interests to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u00b633 We agree that the District Court made comments that were both unnecessary and inappropriate. While the court\u2019s financial comments validly reflected the testimony of Fisher to the extent she testified that the availability of funding necessarily factors into the Tribe\u2019s custody decisions, there was no reason to question the Tribe\u2019s motives with regard to the sacredness with which it views S.B.C. or other Blackfeet children, or that it exercise[s] its sovereign rights as a Nation... only when it is in its best financial interests to do so.\u201d Despite the inappropriateness of some of the court\u2019s statements, none were directed at the efficacy of the Blackfeet Tribal Court system itself. We conclude that the statements are not a basis for reversal. We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion for transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b634 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Biological Father\u2019s parental rights ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b635 Biological Father argues the District Court abused its discretion by terminatinghis parental rights. Biological Father asserts that there was no \u201ctestimony of qualified expert witnesses, that continued custody\u201d of S.B.C. would result in serious damage to the child as is required by 1CWA. The State, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Adoptive Couple v. Baby </em>Girl, 133 S. Ct. 255, 186 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2013), argues that no qualified expert testimony was required because Biological Father did not ever have custody of S.B.C., as the District Court held.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b636 Section 1912(f) of ICWA addresses the requisite expert testimony necessary to involuntarily terminate parental rights with respect to Indian children. Specifically, \u00a7 1912(f) provides that \u201cno termination of parental rights may be ordered ... in the absence of... <em>testimony of qualified expert witnesses, </em>that the <em>continued custody </em>of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Baby Girl, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c\u00a7 1912(f) does not apply in cases where the Indian parent <em>never </em>had custody of the Indian child.\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2560,186 L. Ed. 2d at 740 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court reasoned the phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d as referenced in \u00a7 1912(f) necessarily implies a prior term of \u201ccustody that a parent has\u201d or \u201chad at some point in the past\u201d that could be continued. <em>Baby Girl, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2560, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 739. <em>See also In re J.S., </em>2014 MT 79, \u00b6 31, 374 Mont. 329, 321 P.3d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b637  The record supports the District Court\u2019s determination that Biological Father never had custody of S.B.C. Biological Father was given opportunities to exercise custodial rights regarding S.B.C., but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>he steadfastly was unwilling or unable to do so. Biological Father initially denied paternity and failed to appear for paternity tests. Even after paternity was established by court order, Biological Father did not attempt to be a placement option for S.B.C., did not object to S.B.C.\u2019s placement elsewhere, and in nine months following the establishment of paternity, did not visit S.B.C. While he did have minimal visits with S.B.C., Biological Father testified he \u201cnever had [S.B.C.] in [his] care.\u201d Given this record, there was never any \u201ccustody\u201d by Biological Father that could be continued within the meaning of \u00a7 1912(f). Therefore, \u00a7 1912(f) is inapplicable and the District Court did not abuse its discretion by terminating Biological Father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b638 <em>3. Did. the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Birth Mother\u2019s parental rights ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b639 Birth Mother argues the District Court abused its discretion by terminating her parental rights. Birth Mother offers that there is insufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that she failed to complete her treatment plan. Pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1X0, MCA, a court may order termination of the parent-child relationship if the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist: (1) \u201can appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmW\">\u00b640 It is undisputed S.B.C. was adjudicated a youth in need of care, and that he had been in foster care for 30 consecutive months. Pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, \u201c[i]f a child has been in foster care under the physical custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b641 The treatment plan ordered by the District Court required Birth Mother to address her alcohol addiction issues and lack of parenting skills. The treatment plan listed specific tasks which included, among other things, that Birth Mother achieve a sober living environment, whether on her own or in a facility like the Carole Graham Home; inform her social worker of her plans for aftercare and obtain her social worker\u2019s approval for them; and successfully complete her aftercare.</p>\n<p id=\"AcV\">\u00b642 The record supports the District Court\u2019s determination that Birth Mother failed to comply with her treatment plan. Birth Mother did enroll in the Carole Graham Home, but she was asked to leave because of rules violations. Birth Mother\u2019s social worker testified at the termination hearing that Birth Mother still has \u201can alcohol problem,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cwarrants are out for her arrest for absconding from probation,\u201d and she \u201cfailed to last in a structured environment for two weeks.\u201d The record indicates Birth Mother was not present at the termination hearing of her parental rights and her whereabouts were unknown. The District Court found that her condition rendered her unfit, unable or unwilling to provide adequate parental care for S.B.C., which condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and that continued custody of S.B.C. by Birth Mother would be harmful to him. Birth Mother\u2019s social worker further testified that Birth Mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated \u201cdue to two failed reunifications\u201d with S.B.C. and because she is \u201cnot invested in developing that relationship with [her] son, and following a treatment plan, successfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b643  There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Birth Mother had not complied with her treatment plan, and it was not successful. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by terminating Birth Mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b644 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-18\"> The term \u201cIndian child\u201d means \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> Title IV-E is an entitlement program authorized under the Social Security Act that provides federal funding to assist states and Indian Tribes in providing foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship caregiver payments for children who meet the program\u2019s eligibility criteria. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671-679(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> Fisher so opined during her direct testimony, and then again under cross-examination by the State\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Q: It\u2019s your position that the foster mother cannot meet the cultural needs of [S.B.C.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">A: That\u2019s my position, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">Q: And, she can\u2019t meet the cultural needs of the three Crow children, that\u2019s [sic] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>she has already adopted, either, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">A: Actually \u2014 not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">Q: You\u2019ll have to clarify your answer for me.

Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, </em>490 U.S. 30, 32, 109 S. Ct. 1597, 1600 (1989). Testimony at the Congressional hearings emphasized the significant impact that removal of Indian children has on the tribe\u2019s role as a sovereign community, as well as the future of Native American society and heritage. <em>Holyfield, </em>490 U.S. at 34, 109 S. Ct. at 1601 (citations omitted). ICWA espressos a \u201cclear preference for keeping Indian children with their families, deferring to tribal judgment on matters concerning the custody of tribal children, and placing Indian children who must be removed from their homes within their own families or Indian tribes.\u201d <em>In re C.H., </em>2000 MT 64, \u00b6 13, 299 Mont. 62, 997 P.2d 776 (citing 44 Fed. Reg. 67, 585-86 (Nov. 26, 1979)). Federal regulations, guidelines, and any rules or statutes governing ICWA should be liberally construed in favor of the preferences. 44 Fed. Reg. 67, 586; <em>In re C.H., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">\u00b647 As the Court correctly notes (Opinion, \u00b6 23), this case implicates 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b), which provides for presumptively tribal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>concurrent state, jurisdiction. Under \u00a7 1911(b), the State bears the burden of establishing \u201cgood cause\u201d to block a transfer to tribal court. 44 Fed. Reg. 67, 591; <em>see also In re J.W.C., </em>2011 MT 312, \u00b6 28, 363 Mont. 85, 265 P.3d 1265. Although \u201cgood cause\u201d is not defined in ICWA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Guidelines for State Courts (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) provide guidance to state courts. Good cause may exist if \u201cthe proceeding was at an advanced stage when the petition to transfer was received and the petitioner did not file the petition promptly after receiving notice of the hearing.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67, 591.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ45\">\u00b648 The purpose of the \u201cadvanced stage\u201d rule is to avoid improper manipulation of the system. The Guidelines note that a party should not be permitted to use transfer as a \u201ctactic to wear down the other side by requiring the case be tried twice.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67, 590. While the Act allows intervention at any point in the proceeding, this guideline suggests that a parent whose rights have been terminated should not be permitted to transfer jurisdiction after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b649 I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the \u201cadvanced stage\u201d guideline. The State filed its termination petition on March 6, 2013. The Tribe, having intervened early in the case, moved to transfer jurisdiction on April 10,2013, thirty-five days later. The District Court order faulted the Tribe for seeking transfer after \u201call the critical court proceedings [were] completed and decisions made,\u201d yet the District Court had not conducted a hearing nor made a decision to terminate the parents\u2019 rights. The hearing was not held until September 10, 2013, and the order of termination was not signed until January 15, 2014, eight months after the motion to transfer was filed. This situation does not implicate the dangers the \u201cadvanced stage\u201d rule is designed to protect against and there is no indication of manipulation by any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b650 The majority opinion purports to concur with the Tribe that the case was not at an advanced stage (Opinion, \u00b6 28); however, the majority later faults the Tribe for not acting earlier, noting that the case \u201chad significantly advanced by the time the Tribe filed its motion.\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 29). Blaming the Tribe for not seeking transfer earlier, when problems with the parents were \u201creadily apparent\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 29), ignores the interests the Tribe sought to protect. The Tribe intervened early in this case, but did not move to transfer until it became clear that the plan to reunite the family would not be accomplished. When it became apparent that the Indian family relationship would likely be terminated, the Tribal interest in adjudicating the case became more significant, as its interest in retaining the child in the Blackfeet community and culture became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>more critical. This concern was not present prior to the State\u2019s motion to terminate the parents\u2019 rights. In my view, the good cause standard is not satisfied by the delay in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b651 In Montana, courts must consider the best interest of the child in its determination of \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>In re T.S., </em>245 Mont. 242, 247, 801 P.2d 77, 80 (1990). However, the \u201cbest interest\u201d test used in the ICWA context differs from the \u201cbest interest\u201d test used in custody determinations and termination of parental rights cases. <em>In re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 247, 801 P.2d at 80 (1990); <em>see also In re C.H., </em>\u00b6 29. ICWA \u201cexpresses the presumption that it is in an Indian child's best interests to be placed in accordance with the statutory preferences.\u201d <em>In re C.H., </em>\u00b6 29 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b652 The State bears the burden of establishing that a transfer to the tribal court would be against the child\u2019s best interest as considered by ICWA. <em>In re T.S., </em>245 Mont, at 245,801 P.2d at 79. Here, however, the District Court improperly shifted the burden to the Tribe, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">that\u2019s the burden I see on the tribe, when we start talking- what\u2019s the best interest of the child under the ICWA Act. There\u2019s no question that the priority for protecting the Indian heritage is very high. But, we, also, have the emotional wellbeing of the child, that probably has priority, and that\u2019s the burden I see on the Blackfeet Tribe, right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b653 As we stated in <em>In re Marriage of Skillen, </em>\u201cICWA indicates that regardless of the child's residence, tribal courts are uniquely and inherently more qualified than state courts to determine custody in the best interests of an Indian child.\u201d 1998 MT 43, \u00b6 39,287 Mont. 399,956 P.2d 1 <em>{overruled, in part, on other grounds by Big Spring v. Conway, </em>2011 MT 109, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121). There is no reason to believe that the Blackfeet Tribal Court would not fulfill its obligation to S.B.C. and determine what is in his best interest. The decision to deny the transfer to tribal court reflects an ethnocentric belief that state courts are better situated to determine the best interests of the Indian child and ignores the policy set by the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b654 Certainly, the foster mother must be commended for her generosity and willingness to welcome children into her home. However, the majority ignores the distinct cultural difference between native communities, the child\u2019s interest in being raised in his own culture, and the Blackfeet Tribe\u2019s interest in educating its own children. Moreover, there is no reason to assume that the Tribal Court would automatically discontinue the child\u2019s current placement. The Tribal Court would necessarily need to examine the same factors in deciding the child\u2019s best interest as the state court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u00b655 Finally, I agree with the majority that the District Court\u2019s repeated statements that the Tribe \u201csat on its hands\u201d until it had a financial reason to seek jurisdiction were inappropriate. The BIA Guidelines specifically provide that a state court cannot base the \u201cgood cause\u201d determination on \u201csocio-economic conditions and the perceived adequacy of tribal social services or judicial system.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. 67,591. These statements reflect, at best, a refusal to comply with the Guidelines and, at worst, a strong bias against the Tribe and the Tribal judicial system. Such statements have no place in the District Court\u2019s order and were highly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b656 For these reasons, I dissent. The State did not cany its burden of establishing good cause to block the presumptive jurisdiction in favor of the tribal court. The District Court abused its discretion when it failed to grant the Tribe\u2019s request to transfer jurisdiction. On remand, the District Court should grant the Tribe\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction to the Blackfeet Tribal Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-6\">JUSTICE BAKER and JUSTICE SHEA join in the dissenting Opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
