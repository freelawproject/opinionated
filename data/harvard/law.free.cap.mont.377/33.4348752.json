The State was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Before hearing the Application, the Defendant was advised that the Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division.

The Division\u2019s decision is to amend the Judgment to DECREASE the sentence to Ten (10) years commitment to the Department of Corrections with Five (5) years suspended. The Division is particularly cognizant of Judge Christopher\u2019s recommendation in her Judgment that the Defendant receive treatment at the Elk Horn Treatment Center followed by a pre-release aftercare program. The sentence reduction is made to effectuate Judge Christopher\u2019s intent and to facilitate those placements.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Done in open Court this 11th day of April, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-14\">Chairperson, Hon.
