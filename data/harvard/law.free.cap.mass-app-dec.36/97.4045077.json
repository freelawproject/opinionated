The defendants claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The reported evidence discloses that on February 10, 1961 the defendants, who were the sole officers and stockholders of the corporation executed an agreement guaranteeing payment of the corporation\u2019s account with the plaintiff. This was done to ensure delivery by the plaintiff of the corporation\u2019s 1961 Passover order. 1962 and 1963 Passover orders were also delivered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The guarantee reads in part: \u201cIn order to induce (the plaintiff to enter into contract or contracts with, make loan or loans and/or extend credit to (the corporation) and in consideration of such loans, advances or extensions of credit the undersigned (the defendants) hereby guarantee (to the plaintiff) . . . the full and prompt payment ... of any and every indebtedness, liability or obligation (of the corporation to the plaintiff) ....</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">There is no merit in the appeal of the defendants. The interpretation of this unambiguous contract presented to the trial judge, and to us, a \u201cpure question of law\u201d. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Gowetz, </em>339 Mass. 294, 300. <em>Daley </em>v. <em>J. F. White Contracting Company, </em>347 Mass. 285, 288. The guarantee did not contain a termination date. It was not limited to the 1961 order as argued by the defendants and the fact that this order was paid is of no consequence. Cf. <em>Zeo </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>246 Mass. 366, 369. <em>Atlantic Aluminum &amp; Metal Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stand</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>ard Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co., Inc., </em>347 Mass. 415.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b105-6\">Earle Alpert of Springfield for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Afj\">Bacon, Weltman and Cohen of Springfield for the Defendants</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The trial judge\u2019s action on the defendants\u2019 requests for rulings of law was correct. The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
