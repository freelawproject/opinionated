There was a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The denial of seven of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings of law, raised the issue, of whether the evidence warranted a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s sales manager testified the plaintiff sold the defendant as many as twenty to thirty cars a month, largely junk cars, some paid for by checks, some on open account. The plaintiff\u2019s office manager testified that she was in charge of its records. Introduced in evidence was a ledger card showing charges, payments and credits on the defendant\u2019s account covering the period from July 22, 1960 to November 1, 1962 which showed a balance due in the amount of the finding. She testified if money was received at the time the unit was picked up the sale was \u201cput through as a cash payment and would not be posted on the card.\u201d The defendant introduced no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\"> \u201c The general finding imports finding of subsidiary facts and the drawing of all rational inferences essential to that conclusion. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>finding must stand if permissible upon any reasonable view of the evidence.\u201d <em>Kennedy Bros.

From the dates, invoice numbers, charges, credits and balance shown on the ledger covering the period from July 22, 1960 to November 1, 1962, the judge could infer orders for and acceptance of the goods. <em>W.
