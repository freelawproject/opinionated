Dixon, Louisiana prisoner no. 305653, appeals the dismissal, as untimely, of his federal habeas application brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Dixon was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for killing his ex-wife. <em>See State v. Dixon, </em>620 So.2d 904, 906-07 (La.Ct.App.1993). The district court granted a Certificate of Appealability on whether the one year limitation period of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) should have been suspended \u201cfrom the time the [state] trial judge denied [Dixon\u2019s] application for post-conviction relief until the deadline the trial judge set for filing an application for supervisory writs with the court of appeal, even though that date was longer than the 30-day period pi-ovided in La. Ct.App. Rule 4-3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">The Supreme Court recently held that \u201c[a state post-conviction] application is pending as long as the ordinary state collateral review process is \u2018in continuance\u2019\u2014i.e., \u2018until the completion of that process.\u201d <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2138, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002). \u201cIn other words, until the application has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>achieved final resolution through the State\u2019s post-conviction procedures, by definition it remains \u2018pending.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; see Melancon v. Kaylo, </em>259 F.3d 401, 406 (5th Cir.2001). In <em>Melancon, </em>a panel of this court held that an application ceased to be \u201cpending\u201d when application to the next level of state-court review was not timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The state trial court in Dixon\u2019s case denied his application for post-conviction relief on August 12, 1999. Rule 4-3 of Louisiana\u2019s Uniform Rules, Courts of Appeal, provides that the trial court must state \u201ca reasonable time,\u201d \u201cnot to exceed thirty days,\u201d in which the applicant must apply to the appellate court. However, the rule further provides that \u201cthe trial court or the appellate court may extend the time for filing the application upon the filing of a motion for extension of return date by the applicant, filed within the original or an extended return date period.... \u201d La. CtApp. Unifokm Rule 4-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Although Dixon filed his application for supervisory writs more than thirty days after the denial of his original application for relief, Dixon had both timely requested and received on extension of the thirty day requirement. The state trial court denied Dixon\u2019s application for post-conviction relief on August 12, 1999; on August 20 or 23 Dixon filed in the trial court his \u201cnotice of intent\u201d to apply for supervisory writs to review that judgment in which he requested that the court grant \u201cleave to file his application for supervisory writs\u201d and that \u201cthis Court set a reasonable time of not less than sixty (60) days from the filing of this notice for the writ application to be filed with the First Circuit Court of Appeal.\u201d By order of August 26, the trial court both granted Dixon \u201cleave to file his application for supervisory writs\u201d and ordered \u201cthat the application for supervisory writs be filed with the First Circuit Court of Appeal by October 29, 1999.\u201d Dixon filed his application for supervisory writs with the First Circuit Court of Appeal on October 20,1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Louisiana courts consider the trial court\u2019s setting of a return date later than thirty days to be an implicit extension of the return date in accordance with Rule 4-3. <em>See Brock v. Duhe, </em>521 So.2d 1162, 1162 (La.1988). This is at least so when the filing of the return date is pursuant to the appellant\u2019s timely request for a return date beyond the thirty day limit, as it was in Dixon\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\u201cIf the notice of intent to seek writs and/or a motion and order requesting a return date was filed with the trial court within 30 days of the ruling at issue, this Court has interpreted a return date set outside the 30 day period as an implicit extension of the return date by the trial court.\u201d <em>Watts v. Dorignac, </em>681 So.2d 955, 956 n. 2 (La.Ct.App., 1st Cir., 1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Because Dixon timely both sought and obtained an extension of the appeal period, his application to the Louisiana Court of Appeal was not only timely filed but was never in an untimely status, and his case is thus distinguished from <em>Melan-con. </em>Accordingly, all of the time between the filing of his initial state post-conviction application and the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial of relief was tolled (it being undisputed that Dixon timely sought review in the Louisiana Supreme Court of the decision of the Louisiana Court of Appeal). In <em>Melancon </em>this court agreed with the general rule \u201cthat a state application is \u2018pending\u2019 during the intervals between the state court\u2019s disposition of a state habeas petition and the petitioner\u2019s <em>timely </em>filing of a petition for review at the next level.\u201d 259 F.3d at 406 (emphasis added). However, we held that \u201cMelancon no longer had an application [for post-conviction relief] \u2018pending\u2019 in state court when he failed to [timely] file an application for a supervisory writ with the Court of Appeal <em>and failed to obtain an extension.\u201d Id. </em>at 407 (emphasis added). A subsequently granted extension merely served to allow tolling during the time after the application for writs was actually filed pursuant thereto. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">In <em>Melancon, </em>the Louisiana trial court denied post-conviction relief on December 9, 1997, and the application for supervisory writs was not filed with the Louisiana Court of Appeal until May 8, 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 403. We observed that \u201c[w]hile the trial court set the return date as May 8, 1998, it did not extend the time for filing the application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404 n. 2. The opinion of the Louisiana Court of Appeal in that case, <em>State v. Melancon, </em>No. 98-K-1139 (La.Ct.App. 4th Cir. Aug. 13, 1998) (unpublished), a copy of which is attached to the appellant\u2019s brief in this court in <em>Melancon, </em>states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cThis writ appears to be untimely. The [trial] court ruled on December 9, 1997. The only evidence of a return date is the written notice of intent which was signed by the trial court on what appears to be either May 6th or May 8th, 1998. The return date was set for May 8, 1998, the date this writ was filed in this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Rule 4-3, Uniform Rules of the Courts of Appeal requires that an original return date be not more than thirty days from the date of the ruling at issue. Here, the return date is approximately five months later. There is no indication that an earlier return date was set and then extensions were granted. Nonetheless, because this Court ordered the evidentiary hearing in response to defendant relator\u2019s pro se writ, we will consider the merits of the relator\u2019s claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">We have reviewed the record and briefs in <em>Melancon </em>and there is nothing to indicate or suggest that the prisoner there ever, or ever during the thirty days next following the trial court\u2019s December 9, 1997, denial of relief, sought any extension or enlargement of the thirty day period provided in Rule 4-3 or filed any notice of intent to seek writs and/or any motion and order requesting a return date. Thus, in <em>Melancon </em>when the thirty days expired there was neither any order extending or fixing the return date to or at a time later than the thirty day period nor was there pending any undisposed of motion for any such relief, and no supervisory writ application had been filed. Thus Melancon\u2019s writ application ceased to be pending at the expiration of the thirty days. Here, by contrast, when the thirty days expired, the time for filing the supervisory writ application had already been fixed for a later date pursuant to Dixon\u2019s previously filed motion for such relief, and Dixon\u2019s supervisory writ application was filed prior to that thus fixed later date. Accordingly, Dixon\u2019s application for post-conviction relief re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>mained \u201cpending\u201d at all times from its initial filing until its final disposition by the Louisiana Supreme Court; it was never in an untimely status.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Under the correct calculation, only 862 unsuspended days passed between the date Dixon\u2019s conviction became final and date he filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition; thus, his petition was timely. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case REMANDED for further consideration of Dixon\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\">. The Court of Appeal on March 24, 2000 denied Dixon\u2019s application for supervisory writ on the merits; nothing in its order suggests that it viewed Dixon's application to it as having been even arguably untimely; the state has never taken the position, either before any state court or at any time in this federal habeas proceeding, that Dixon\u2019s application for supervisory writ to the Court of Appeal was untimely. It is undisputed, and the Magistrate Judge and District Court below found, that less than 30 days following the decision of the Court of Appeal Dixon timely applied for supervisory writs to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, which on February 9, 2001 denied the application without any explanation or comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-12\">. <em>See also Spangler v.
