Specifically, Searcy challenges the imposition of the two-level sentencing enhancement he received for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. This case presents the issue, one of first impression in this court, whether a threat not directly communicated to the intended target may serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. We conclude that it may and, for the reasons set forth below, AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement in this case was based upon Searcy\u2019s attempt, while on pretrial release, to retaliate against the confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) who had assisted law enforcement officers in the controlled drug purchase leading to his arrest by contacting a third party, who had a key to the Cl\u2019s residence, and asking the third party to \u201cplant\u201d approximately four ounces of crack cocaine in the Cl\u2019s residence. Searcy met with the third party, who, unbeknownst to him, was also a Cl, in furtherance of the plan, but the plan fell apart when Searcy was unable to secure the money to purchase the crack cocaine. As he did in the district court, Searcy argues that the enhancement was error because he did not directly threaten the Cl and because the Cl was never aware of the threat to her.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">The district court\u2019s determination that a defendant obstructed justice is a factual finding reviewed for clear error, meaning that it will be upheld so long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. </em>Huerta, 182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">Section 3C1.1 of the guidelines provides for a two-level increase if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.... \u201d \u00a7 3C1.1 \u201cObstructive conduct can vary widely in nature, degree of planning, and seriousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n.3. The commentary to the guideline provides a nonex-haustive list of the types of conduct to which the adjustment applies, including \u201cthreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant, witness or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">Searcy contends that the guideline and commentary do not encompass a threat not communicated to the intended target, and he argues that a threat made to a third party which was never intended to be communicated to the target cannot support the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. He relies on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>957 F.2d 1138, 1149-50 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Searcy is correct that, to justify the imposition of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the Fourth Circuit has required the threat to be made directly to the intended target or under circumstances in which there is some likelihood that the intended target will learn of the threat. <em>See id. </em>Searcy is also correct that the issue whether a defendant\u2019s threat to a third party which was not communicated to the intended target is covered by \u00a7 3C1.1 is one of first impression in this court. However, all other circuit courts which have addressed the issue have reached a conclusion different from the Fourth Circuit\u2019s in <em>Brooks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The first court to do so was the Second Circuit, in <em>United States v. Shoulberg, </em>895 F.2d 882, 885-86 (2d Cir.1990), wherein the court upheld a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement based upon the defendant\u2019s having written, prior to trial, a note to a third party containing threats regarding a potential Government witness which were never communicated directly to the witness. The Second Circuit determined that because the note was a threat relayed to an intermediary which could have been communicated to the witness had the Government not intervened, the threat, even though indirectly made, was an attempt to obstruct justice covered by \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Eighth Circuit similarly upheld the imposition of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement based on a threat not communicated directly to the intended target, a coconspirator who had become a Cl and, as in the instant case, was a potential Government witness. <em>United States v. Capps, </em>952 F.2d 1026, 1028-29 (8th Cir.1991). In <em>Capps, </em>after the defendant was arrested, she was heard making a statement to third parties in a local bar to the effect that she was planning to have some of her biker friends beat up the Cl for \u201csnitching on her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1028. Capps argued that the enhancement was error because the threat was never communicated to the CL <em>Id. </em>The Eighth Circuit rejected the argument, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">since the adjustment applies to attempts to obstruct justice, it is not essential that the threat was communicated to [the Cl] if it reflected an attempt by Capps to threaten or intimidate her conspirators into obstructing the government\u2019s investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1029. The court determined that the evidence showed that Capp\u2019s threat against the Cl was more than idle bar talk and concluded that the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement was therefore warranted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The Ninth Circuit has also upheld the imposition of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement based on indirect threats. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>974 F.2d 104, 106 (9th Cir.1992). In that case, after Fred Pittman, the defendant\u2019s friend and coconspirator, began cooperating with the Government, the defendant disseminated to various third parties copies of Pittman\u2019s cooperation agreement with the Government, with the words \u201cThe \u2018Rat\u2019 Fred Pittman\u201d and \u201cSnitch\u201d written on the top of the first page. <em>Id. </em>at 105. The Ninth Circuit held that the enhancement was appropriate because, although he did not directly threaten Pittman, Jackson had disseminated information which placed Pittman and his family in danger, potentially chilling Pittman\u2019s willingness to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 106. The court concluded, \u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s statements can be reasonably construed as a threat, even if they are not made directly to the threatened person, the defendant has obstructed justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Most recently, the Eleventh Circuit adopted the same approach, holding that communication of a threat directly to a Government witness was not required to support the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1314-15 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 304, 154 L.Ed.2d 204 (2002). The court noted the disagreement between the Fourth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits but concluded that the approach taken by the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits was more persuasive. <em>Id. </em>at 1315. It therefore held that an indirect threat to third parties was an appropriate basis for the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">This court also finds the reasoning of the Second, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits the more persuasive and concludes that the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement in the instant case should be upheld based on the reasoning of these courts and on the plain language of \u00a7 3C1.1 and accompanying commentary, which specifically allow for application of the enhancement to attempts by defendants to directly or indirectly threaten, intimidate, or influence a potential Government witness. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 4(a); <em>see also Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\u201c[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d). The Fourth Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Brooks </em>notwithstanding, there is nothing in the text of the guideline or commentary which restricts application of \u00a7 3C1.1 only to situations in which the defendant directly threatens a witness or communicates the threat to a third party with the likelihood that it will in turn be communicated to the witness. <em>See </em>\u00a7 -3C1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">It is undisputed that Searcy attempted to threaten the Cl indirectly by instituting a plan to have a third party plant crack cocaine in her residence prior to Searcy\u2019s trial. As the Government argues, had Se-arcy\u2019s plan succeeded, the credibility of a potential Government witness would have been undermined, adversely affecting the Government\u2019s ability to present its case. Searcy\u2019s conduct amounts to an indirect threat or attempt to influence a potential witness in an attempt to impede the judicial proceedings, warranting the obstruction enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Searcy argues that, even if a threat made to a third party and not communicated to the intended target can support a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, the enhancement was nevertheless improper in his case because he did nothing that could qualify as a true attempt to obstruct justice. He contends that he formed only a vague intent to have the crack cocaine planted in the Cl\u2019s residence but took no action likely leading to the actual commission of the offense. The uncontested findings of the PSR, however, show that Searcy met with the third party in furtherance of his plan to frame the Cl and that the plan fell apart when Searcy could not secure the money to purchase the cocaine to be planted in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">For .the foregoing reasons, Searcy\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-11\"> Searcy does not renew the other grounds upon which he objected to the enhancement in the district court, and those arguments are therefore waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993)(arguments not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
