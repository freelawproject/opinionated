Information Technology and Applications Corporation (\u201cITAC\u201d) appeals the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims denying its bid protest and granting the United States motion for summary judgment on the administrative record. <em>Info. Tech. &amp; Applications Corp. v. United States, </em>51 Fed.Cl. 340 (Fed.Cl.2001). Because we have determined that the Air Force\u2019s contacts with appellee RS Information Systems, Inc. (\u201cRSIS\u201d) were allowable requests for \u201cclarification\u201d of its proposal and did not constitute \u201cdiscussions,\u201d and because the appellant\u2019s other asserted grounds for reversing the decision of the Court of Federal Claims are without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">On March 19, 2001, the Air Force issued Solicitation and Request for Proposals No. FA2550-01-R-0001 (\u201cRFP\u201d) to obtain a contract for professional services in support of its Space Warfare Center. The winning contractor was to examine, assess and develop means of integrating national intelligence assets with the Department of Defense space systems, in order to enhance combat and research and development capabilities at the Space Warfare Center. The Air Force intended to make an award to one lead contractor, which would perform overall program management and integration, operations support, systems engineering and analysis, and other work related to the Space Warfare Center. The term of performance was to be twelve months, beginning on October 1, 2001, with seven one-year options.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">Under the RFP, the contract was to be awarded \u201cto an offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will best meet [the] requirements afford-ably.\u201d RFP at 81. In accordance with 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(a)(2)(A) and 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253a(b)(1), the RFP also disclosed \u201call the significant factors and significant sub-factors\u201d that the agency \u201creasonably expected] to consider,\u201d and their relative importance. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(a)(2)(A) (2000); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253a(b)(1) (2000); RFP at 81-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">ITAC, RSIS and a third offeror submitted timely proposals in response to the RFP. All three proposals anticipated that some of the work would be performed by subcontractors. RSIS\u2019s proposal relied heavily on the role of its subcontractors, which were to perform at least 75% of the work on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The Air Force sent various \u201cevaluation notices\u201d (\u201cENs\u201d) to all three offerors. These evaluation notices were brief letters to the offerors requesting additional information regarding their proposals. The Air Force sent three ENs to ITAC, five ENs to RSIS, and three ENs to the third offeror. At issue in this case are ENs Nos. 0001, 0002 and 0002a, which the Air Force sent to RSIS after the offerors had submitted \u201cpast performance\u201d information, but before the due date for the other parts of the proposals. The ENs at issue sought \u201cadditional information ... to verify relevant past performance for [the] lead and support roles\u201d of at least ten subcontractors that RSIS listed in its proposal. EN No. 0002. The Air Force sent ENs to the other bidders requesting additional information on their subcontractors as well.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The disputed ENs were labeled \u201cFAR 15.306(a) Clarification[s]\u201d and included the notice, \u201cPlease note that this clarification does not constitute oral discussions with the offeror.\u201d EN 0002, referring to 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">RSIS responded to the ENs on May 1, 2001, explaining which parts of the project each subcontractor would support and detailing the subcontractors\u2019 relevant experience with regard to those tasks. For example, in response to EN 0002, RSIS responded, \u201c[subcontractor] Aerojet has developed and integrated the CTPP/ ALERT and the JTAGS IR missile warning processing systems into the tactical missile warning C2 operational architecture, (Similarities to [contract] Requirements, V-57, and V-59).\u201d (RSIS Response to Evaluation Notice.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The Air Force gave both ITAC and RSIS an \u201coverall exceptional rating\u201d for their \u201cpast performance\u201d experience. (Proposal Analysis Report for RFP # FA2550-01-R-0001, July 11, 2001). The Air Force determined that prior contracts of RSIS and its subcontractors were relevant to their ability to perform the Space Warfare Center contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The Air Force performed an independent \u201cMost Probable Cost analysis\u201d on the proposals submitted by RSIS and the third bidder. The \u201cMost Probable Cost analysis\u201d was an independent analysis of the bidder\u2019s estimated cost for \u201creasonableness\u201d and \u201crealism.\u201d RFP at 85. The Air Force \u201cassessed] the compatibility of the overall proposed costs with the scope of effort to be performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>Force did not perform a \u201cMost Probable Cost analysis\u201d on ITAC\u2019s proposal, because its evaluation team found that ITAC\u2019s proposed hours were so minimal and unrealistic that it was infeasible to perform an adequate analysis. (Source Selection Decision Document at 4.) As a result of this independent analysis performed with respect to RSIS and the third bidder, the Air Force increased the estimated labor hours for RSIS and the third bidder, after determining \u201cthat additional hours were required in each labor category to successfully perform the effort.\u201d <em>Info. Tech. &amp; Applications Corp. v. United States, </em>No. 01-637 C, slip op. at 9 n. 15 (Fed.Cl. Dec. 7, 2001). There is no suggestion that these adjustments resulted from RSIS\u2019s responses to the disputed ENs.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">On July 23, 2001, the Air Force announced its decision to award the contract to RSIS. In its Source Selection Decision Document, the Air Force explained that all three proposals were rated equally for \u201cProgram Management and Integration\u201d and for \u201cPast Performance\u201d (which was the subject of the disputed ENs), and that these were not, therefore, \u201cdiscriminating factors.\u201d (Source Selection Decision Document at 2.) The Air Force determined that although \u201c[a]ll Offerors provided proposals which met minimum contract requirements,\u201d and \u201call proposals were fundamentally sound,\u201d \u201ckey discriminators were made in Mission Capability ..., Proposal Risk, and Cost/Price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. RSIS performed higher than ITAC in the categories of \u201cMission Capability\u201d and \u201cProposal Risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-4. In the area of \u201cCost/Priee,\u201d the Air Force found, \u201cRSIS provided the lowest overall price for the written Task Order and provided the best overall price to the Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The Air Force concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">In summary, RSIS offered an excellent proposal with lower risk and several innovative approaches to improve efficiency of SWC operations that were deemed to be beneficial to the Government. As a result, the RSIS proposal provided the overall best value to the Government. Based on my integrated assessment that the RSIS proposal provided a better technical and lower risk offer, I direct the award to RS Information Systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-7\"><em>Id. </em>Because \u201cCost/Priee\u201d was one of the categories in which RSIS scored higher than ITAC, the refusal of the Air Force to conduct a \u201cMost Probable Cost analysis\u201d of ITAC\u2019s proposal or make a similar adjustment to its labor hours to make them more realistic is alleged to have been a significant factor in ITAC\u2019s not winning the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">On August 6, 2001, ITAC filed a bid protest with the General Accounting Office (\u201cGAO\u201d). The GAO denied the bid protest and the Air Force awarded the contract to RSIS on November 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">On November 13, 2001, ITAC filed this post-award bid protest in the Court of Federal Claims. Among the grounds for the bid protest was ITAC\u2019s contention that the Air Force conducted \u201cdiscussions\u201d with RSIS by virtue of the ENs it sent to RSIS, but failed to conduct \u201cdiscussions\u201d with ITAC, in violation of 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b and 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306. ITAC argued that it was impermissible for the Air Force \u201cto engage in discussions with RSIS regarding the weaknesses and deficiencies in RSIS\u2019s past performance part of its proposal, and then hide [sic] from ITAC the perceived weakness and deficiencies in\u201d its cost proposal (resulting in the Air Force\u2019s declining to conduct a \u201cMost Probable Cost analysis\u201d with respect to ITAC). 51 Fed.Cl. at 353 (quoting Plaintiffs Consolidated Reply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>of Nov. 29, 2001). ITAC contended that the Air Force thereby improperly opened \u201cdiscussions\u201d with RSIS without holding \u201cdiscussions\u201d with all bidders. The theory was that if discussions had been opened, ITAC would have had the opportunity to cure the weaknesses in its proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The ability of the contracting officer to conduct \u201cdiscussions\u201d is governed by both statute and regulation. Under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b(d) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(4)(A), an agency may award a contract \u201cafter discussions with the offerors\u201d or \u201cbased on proposals received and without discussions with the offerors.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b(d) (2000); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(4)(A) (2000). If the agency decides to hold discussions, however, it first must establish a \u201ccompetitive range comprised of all the most highly rated proposals.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(c)(1) (2002). In order to determine the competitive range, the agency may engage in \u201ccommunications\u201d with the offerors, which are defined as \u201cexchanges, between the Government and offerors, after receipt of proposals, leading to establishment of the competitive range.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(b) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">If the agency decides to award the contract after holding discussions, it must hold discussions \u201cwith all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b(d)(1)(A) (2000); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(4)(A)(ii) (2000). However, the agency may hold \u201cdiscussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification\u201d with one or more offerors. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b(d)(1)(B) (2000); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(4)(A)(ii) (2000). The procurement regulations define \u201cclarifications\u201d as \u201climited exchanges, between the Government and offerors, that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)(1) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">On December 7, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims denied the bid protest, granting the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the administrative record. 51 Fed.Cl. at 342, 357. Contrary to ITAC\u2019s contention, the court determined that the Air Force had not conducted discussions. <em>Id. </em>at 353-55. The court reasoned that section 15.306(d) contemplates that discussions will occur after a determination of the competitive range of proposals has been made, and in the context of offerors\u2019 having the opportunity to revise their proposals. The court determined that, because the agency did not intend to allow offerors to revise their proposals and had not made a determination of the competitive range, none of the ENs constituted discussions. <em>Id. </em>at 354. The court concluded that the ENs were either \u201cclarifications,\u201d under section 15.306(a), or \u201ccommunications,\u201d under section 15.306(a)), and that the agency did not therefore improperly hold discussions with only one bidder. <em>Id. </em>at 354-55. The court also rejected the other grounds of the bid protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">ITAC timely filed this appeal of the court\u2019s December 7 decision. This court has exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from the Court of Federal Claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). <em>Myers Investigative &amp; Sec. Servs. v. United States, </em>275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">We review the grant or denial of motions for summary judgment upon the administrative record without deference. <em>Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1054, 1057 (Fed.Cir.2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>We reapply the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act to the Air Force\u2019s procurement decision. <em>See Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2001) (holding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b), by its plain terms and according to its legislative history, \u201c \u2018applies the Administrative Procedure Act standard of review previously applied by the district courts (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706)\u2019\u201d) (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-841, at 10 (1996)). Consequently, our inquiry is whether the Air Force\u2019s procurement decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In order to establish standing, ITAC must show that it is an \u201cactual or prospective bidder[] or offerorf] whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that ITAC was an interested party, prejudiced by the award to RSIS. <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed.Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1113, 122 S.Ct. 920, 151 L.Ed.2d 885 (2002). The Court of Federal Claims did not decide the question of prejudice, because it determined that there was no error in the procurement process, stating that, \u201c[i]f the court finds error, the court <em>then examines </em>whether the error was prejudicial to plaintiff.\u201d 51 Fed.Cl. at 346 (emphasis added). This approach was erroneous. In fact, because the question of prejudice goes directly to the question of standing, the prejudice issue must be reached before addressing the merits. As we said in <em>Myers, </em>\u201cprejudice (or injury) is a necessary element of standing.\u201d 275 F.3d at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">To establish prejudice, ITAC must show that there was a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d it would have received the contract award but for the alleged error in the procurement process. <em>Alfa Laval Separation, Inc. v. United States, </em>175 F.3d 1365, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citation omitted). In other words, the protestor\u2019s chance of securing the award must not have been insubstantial. <em>See Am. Fed\u2019n, </em>258 F.3d at 1302; <em>Impresa, </em>238 F.3d at 1334. Here ITAC argues that the award to RSIS should be set aside on a variety of grounds. If ITAC were successful, the award would be set aside, and ITAC might secure it. ITAC also argues that the Air Force improperly failed to conduct \u201cdiscussions\u201d with ITAC and that, if it had, ITAC would have been able to cure deficiencies in its bid. There is no question here that ITAC was a qualified bidder and that its proposal would have been improved and its chances of securing the contract increased if the problem with its cost estimate had been cured. The Air Force\u2019s decision letter stated that \u201c[a]ll offerors provided proposals which met minimum contract requirements\u201d and \u201call proposals were fundamentally sound.\u201d (Source Selection Decision Document at 1.) Under these circumstances, ITAC has established prejudice (and therefore standing), because it had greater than an insubstantial chance of securing the contract if successful on the merits of the bid protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">The appellant\u2019s primary argument, and the only argument worthy of extended treatment, is that the Air Force violated the statute and regulations by holding \u201cdiscussions\u201d with RSIS and not with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">The statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>(1) An executive agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with subsection (a) of this section and may award a contract\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">(A) after discussions with the offer-ors, provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">(B) based on the proposals received and without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b(d)(1) (2000). Substantively identical language appears in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(4)(A). The purpose of the rule that the government may not hold discussions with only one bidder is \u201cto prevent a bidder from gaining an unfair advantage over its competitors by making its bid more favorable to the government in a context where the other bidders have no opportunity to do so.\u201d <em>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, 78 </em>F.3d 1556, 1561 (Fed.Cir.1996). The government contends that the ENs in question did not constitute discussions, but rather were \u201cclarifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In order to construe the meaning of the terms \u201cdiscussion\u201d and \u201cminor clarification\u201d in the statute, we begin with an analysis of the language of the statute itself. <em>Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. v. United States, </em>201 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1183, 121 S.Ct. 1167, 148 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2001). If the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, then it controls, and we may not look to the agency regulation for further guidance. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Gallegos v. Principi, </em>283 F.3d 1309, 1312 (Fed.Cir.2002). Because neither 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253b nor 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305 defines the terms \u201cminor clarification\u201d or \u201cdiscussion,\u201d we assume that the terms have their ordinary, established meaning, for which we may consult dictionaries. <em>Pesquera Mares Australes LTDA v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Int\u2019l Bus. Machs., </em>201 F.3d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The relevant dictionary definitions are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">\u201cDiscussion\u201d is defined as, \u201cconsideration of a question in open usu. informal debate: argument for the sake of arriving at truth or clearing up difficulties.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s 3d International Dictionary </em>648 (1968) (\u201cWebster\u2019s\u201d). Webster\u2019s defines \u201cto clarify\u201d in the relevant sense alternatively as, \u201cto free (the mind or understanding) of confusion, doubt, or uncertainty\u201d; \u201cto explain clearly: make understandable\u201d; and \u201cto make less complex or less ambiguous: put in order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. Webster\u2019s defines \u201cminor\u201d in the relevant sense alternatively as, \u201c1 a: inferior in importance: comparatively unimportant: lower in standing or reputation than others of the same kind .... b: being the less important of two things.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Although these definitions make clear that \u201cdiscussions\u201d are more substantial communications than \u201cminor clarifications,\u201d none of these various definitions serves to illuminate with any precision which specific exchanges of information constitute \u201cdiscussions,\u201d and which exchanges constitute \u201cminor clarifications.\u201d \u201cThe existence of alternative dictionary definitions of [a term],\u201d or the failure of dictionary definitions to provide a plain and unambiguous meaning of statutory language, \u201cindicates that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>is open to interpretation.\u201d <em>Nat'l. R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston &amp; Me. Corp., </em>503 U.S. 407, 418, 112 S.Ct. 1394, 118 L.Ed.2d 52 (1992). Where, as here, an agency has adopted a regulation by notice- and-comment rulemaking, the <em>Chevron </em>standard of deference applies to that regulation. <em>United States v. Haggar Apparel Co., </em>526 U.S. 380, 390, 119 S.Ct. 1392, 143 L.Ed.2d 480 (1999); <em>Pesquera Mares Australes, </em>266 F.3d at 1379. In such a case, we must defer to a properly promulgated regulation, if it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>Gallegos, </em>283 F.3d at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We first note that the regulations were altered significantly in 1997. <em>Compare </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 15.601, 15.607, 15.610 (1991), <em>with </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306 (2002). The preexisting regulations strictly limited the definition and purpose of clarifications. Section 15.601 specified that clarifications were \u201cfor the sole purpose of eliminating minor irregularities, informalities, or apparent clerical mistakes in the proposal.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.601 (1991). All communications for larger purposes, specifically communications \u201c(a) involv[ing] information essential for determining the acceptability of a proposal, or (b) provid[ing] the offeror an opportunity to revise or modify its proposal,\u201d constituted discussions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Under the new regulation, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306, \u201cclarifications\u201d are defined as \u201climited exchanges, between the Government and offerors, that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a) (2002). The regulation further provides examples of clarifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals <em>(e.g., the relevance of an offeror\u2019s past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) </em>or to resolve minor or clerical errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)(2) (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">In contrast, under the regulation, \u201cdiscussions\u201d involve \u201cnegotiations\u201d: \u201cWhen negotiations are conducted in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment of the competitive range and are called discussions.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(d) (2002). Because discussions involve negotiations, they may include \u201cbargaining,\u201d which \u201cincludes persuasion, alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And unlike clarifications, discussions \u201care undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also unlike clarifications, discussions take place after the government has established a \u201ccompetitive range\u201d of the most highly rated proposals. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(c) (2002). Discussions need only be held with each offeror within the competitive range. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(d)(1) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">The stated purpose of the 1997 amendments to section 15 of the regulations was to \u201cprovide for empowerment and flexibility\u201d and \u201cshift from rigid rules to guiding principles.\u201d 62 Fed. Reg. 51,225 (Sept. 30, 1997). Specifically, the new regulations were intended to \u201c[s]upport[] more open exchanges between the Government and industry, allowing industry to better understand the requirement [sic] and the Government to better understand industry proposals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51,224. The order adopting the new regulations stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>We drafted the rule to allow as much free exchange of information between offerors and the Government as possible, while still permitting award without discussions and complying with applicable statutes....This policy is expected to help offerors, especially small entities that may not be familiar with proposal preparation, by permitting easy clarification of limited aspects of their proposals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 51,228-29. Thus, the definition of \u201cclarifications\u201d was significantly broadened. Rather than being \u201cfor the sole purpose of eliminating minor irregularities, informalities, or apparent clerical mistakes,\u201d clarifications now provide offerors \u201cthe opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals (e.g., the relevance of an of-feror\u2019s past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond)....\u201d <em>Compare </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.601 (1991), <em>with </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)(2) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">No claim is made or can be made that it is impermissible for an agency to change its interpretation of statutory terms or even significantly broaden the definition of a term. The Supreme Court has \u201crejected the argument that an agency\u2019s interpretation \u2018is not entitled to deference because it represents a sharp break with prior interpretations\u2019 of the statute in question.\u201d <em>Rust v. Sullivan, </em>500 U.S. 173, 186, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 862, 104 S.Ct. 2778). \u201cAn agency is not required to establish rules of conduct to last forever, but rather must be given ample latitude to adapt its rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186-87, 111 S.Ct. 1759 (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also Smiley v. Citibank, N.A., </em>517 U.S. 735, 742, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1995). Nor is the new interpretation an impermissible construction of the statute. <em>Barnhart v. Walton, </em>535 U.S. 212, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002). Because the regulation\u2019s definitions represent a reasonable interpretation of the statutory terms, we defer to them and turn to the question of whether this regulation was properly applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The communications in question in this case, ENs 0001, 0002 and 0002a, were for the purpose of obtaining additional information about the subcontractors that RSIS had listed in its proposal. Specifically, the ENs asked RSIS to provide \u201cadditional relevant past performance information, to further describe the lead role for [the subcontractors].\u201d EN 0002. In its response, RSIS explained which parts of the project each subcontractor would support and detailed their relevant experience with regard to those tasks. The government argues that these communications constituted clarifications, and not discussions. We agree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">First, these communications were not discussions. As explained above, the new regulation contemplates discussions as occurring in the context of negotiations. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(d) (2002). As such, when discussions are opened, bidders have the opportunity to revise their proposals, in order \u201cto maximize the Government\u2019s ability to obtain the best value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15.306(d)(2). In this case, the government did not give RSIS the opportunity to revise its proposal, and RSIS did not change the terms of its proposal to make it more appealing to the government. Under these circumstances, it is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>ENs 0001, 0002 and 0002a, and RSIS\u2019s response to them, did not constitute discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Second, the Air Force\u2019s request was merely a request for clarification of the relevant experience of RSIS\u2019s subcontractors, as permitted by the regulation. The regulation provides that \u201cofferors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)(2) (2002). One example that the regulation provides of such a clarification is \u201cthe relevance of an offeror\u2019s past performance information....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We can discern no distinction between this clear example in the regulation and the Air Force\u2019s request for clarification of the subcontractors\u2019 relevant experience in this case. We therefore conclude that the challenged communications, ENs 0001, 0002 and 0002a, were merely requests for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that the ENs could not be clarifications because they \u201crequested additional information.\u201d Any meaningful clarification would require the provision of information, and the example of a clarification given in the regulation, \u201cthe relevance of an offeror\u2019s past performance information,\u201d requires the provision of information. <em>Id. </em>The appellant also contends that a clarification cannot call for new information if the information is \u201cnecessary to evaluate the proposal.\u201d There is no requirement in the regulation that a clarification not be essential for evaluation of the proposal. As one commentary has observed, under the new regulations, \u201c \u2018clarifications\u2019 by one offeror could lead to an increase in its past performance score or perhaps tilt the award in its favor.\u201d John S. Pachter <em>et al., The FAR Part 15 Rewrite, </em>98-05 Briefing Papers 1, 6 (1998). Appellant\u2019s cramped conception of \u201cclarification\u201d is, moreover, not in harmony with the stated purpose of the 1997 amendments, which was to \u201c[s]upport[] more open exchanges between the Government and industry, allowing industry to better understand the requirement [sic] and the Government to better understand industry proposals.\u201d 62 Fed. Reg. at 51,224.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Even were the regulations not clear, we give deference to an agency\u2019s permissible interpretation of its own regulations. <em>United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., </em>532 U.S. 200, 218-19, 121 S.Ct. 1433, 149 L.Ed.2d 401 (2001); <em>Am. Express Co. v. United States, </em>262 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2001). The agency designated the ENs as \u201cFAR 13.306(a) clarifications\u201d and included the notice, \u201c[p]lease note that this clarification does not constitute oral discussions with the offeror.\u201d EN 0002 (referring to 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)). It was a reasonable interpretation of the acquisition regulations to view the ENs as clarifications, and we defer to that interpretation. We recently emphasized that \u201cthe [acquisition] regulations entrust the contracting officer with especially great discretion, extending even to his application of procurement regulations.\u201d <em>Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2002). The appellant here has not shown that the contracting officer misconstrued the regulations or that the procurement was not in accordance with the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims is</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\">. In addition to the disputed ENs concerning RSIS\u2019s subcontractors, the Air Force sent ENs to RSIS seeking Small Business Administration certification and completion of sections G-5 and G-6 of the solicitation. It sent ENs to ITAC seeking additional information on its subcontractors, Small Business Administration certification and clarification regarding the estimated price for one of its subcontracts. It sent ENs to the third bidder seeking information regarding its subcontractors, Small Business Administration certification and completion of solicitation section I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. We have considered and reject the appellant's other arguments on appeal. The appellant argues that the Air Force improperly gave RSIS a high past performance rating by relying on past contracts it alleges were irrelevant to the proposal and by relying on the experience of subcontractors it alleges were not performing a significant portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>work; that the Air Force\u2019s independent cost estimate of ITAC\u2019s proposal was flawed because it failed to take into account technology that would have made ITAC\u2019s cost lower; that the Air Force\u2019s failure to take into account this cost-saving technology led it erroneously to give ITAC\u2019s proposal a \"high risk\u201d rating and to conclude that ITAC\u2019s cost estimate was unrealistic, such that a \"Most Probable Cost analysis\u201d was unfeasible; and that the Air Force improperly gave exaggerated weight to the \"integration of efforts,\u201d \"innovation,\u201d and \"cross-utilization\u201d factors, in a way that was inconsistent with the RFP. Under our deferential standard of review, we conclude that these agency actions were not \"arbitrary and capricious,\u201d \"not in accordance with law\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5i\">The appellant also argues that the Court of Federal Claims improperly refused to allow discovery regarding alleged bias of the Air Force in the procurement process. An agency decision is entitled to a presumption of regularity. <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Do-menico Garufi, </em>238 F.3d at 1338. \u201d[D]iscov-ery of the contracting officer's reasoning is not lightly to be ordered and should not be ordered unless record evidence raises serious questions as to the rationality of the contracting officer\u2019s [decision].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. In this case, ITAC has pointed to no record evidence of bias. Instead it has merely reiterated its contentions that the Air Force erred in evaluating the proposals. This is not evidence of bias, and it is insufficient to overcome the presumption that the contracting officer acted in good faith. <em>Spezzaferro v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>807 F.2d 169, 173 (Fed.Cir.1986) (to overcome the presumption of good faith, \u201d[t]he proof must be almost irrefragable\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted); <em>cf. Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (holding that evidence of bias sufficient to require recusal of a judge must come from an extrajudicial source, rather than merely from unfavorable rulings). Therefore, the court did not err in refusing discovery on alleged bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b847-8\">PAULINE NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">I agree with the panel majority that the 1997 amendment to section 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations was intended to liberalize the protocol governing exchanges between federal acquirers and bidders during the procurement process. Section 15 was designed to enhance convenience, but without diminution in fairness. The amended regulation does not exonerate the agency\u2019s unusual procedure in this case, however generously it may be construed. Whatever the distinction between \u201cclarifications\u201d and \u201cdiscussions\u201d in 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306, the procedure by which the Air Force implemented its \u201cindependent cost evaluation\u201d without informing ITAC of the agency\u2019s action when advised that the labor hours of all bids were too low, does not meet any reasonable definition of \u201cclarification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">\u201cClarifications\u201d are defined as \u201climited exchanges, between the Government and offerors, that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.306(a)(1) (2001). The agency\u2019s unilateral increase of the labor hours of two of the three offerors, without disclosure to the third of the agency\u2019s concern, cannot be rationalized as mere \u201cclarification.\u201d It is surely not the type of individual interchange that was intended to be authorized by the amendment to section 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">ITAC states that had it been told that its labor hours were too low, it would have explained the economies that it expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>achieve through certain new cost-saving technologies. ITAC was no stranger to this contract; it was the incumbent contractor and it must be assumed to have known, as well as anyone, the labor needed to perform the contract. ITAC was not offered the same opportunity of a revised proposal as were the other bidders. Instead, the Air Force simply refused to perform a \u201cmost probable cost analysis\u201d on the ITAC proposal, thereby precluding the award to ITAC. While the labor hours of the other offerors were unilaterally increased by the evaluation team, by ten percent for one offeror and thirty percent for the other, ITAC was simply disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The purpose of the section 15 amendment was to \u201csupport!] more open exchanges between the government and industry, allowing industry to better understand the requirements and the government to better understand industry proposals.\u201d 62 Fed. Reg. at 51,224. It was not intended to authorize agencies to act without regard to fundamentals of fair procurement. From my colleagues\u2019 blanket ratification of a procurement that was seriously flawed, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
