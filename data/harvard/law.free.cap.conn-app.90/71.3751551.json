In that plan, the parents agreed that neither parent\u2019s home would serve as the children\u2019s primary residence. The trial court nonetheless granted the mother\u2019s motion for modification designating her as the children\u2019s primary custodian because, despite the parenting plan, the mother had in fact assumed the major role in taking responsibility for the children and her home had become the children\u2019s primary residence. The father argues that the court\u2019s support order was improper. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The marriage of the defendant father, Justyn F. Zit-nay, and the plaintiff mother, Allyson J. Zitnay, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>dissolved on November 6, 2002. On that date, with one exception, the parties adopted a shared parenting plan as recommended by the family services unit of the judicial branch. They disagreed with the recommendation that the mother should become the children\u2019s custodial parent. Instead, they agreed that \u201c[n] either parent\u2019s home shall be designated a primary residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">After two earlier child support orders, neither of which the father contested by way of an appeal, the father filed a motion to reduce his support payments because his present wages were less than what he had been earning at the time of the dissolution of the marriage. In response, the mother filed a motion for upward modification of child support based on the father\u2019s return to gainful employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She also requested that she be designated as the children\u2019s primary residential custodian. Over the father\u2019s objection, the trial court, <em>Brunetti, J., </em>found that she was indeed the children\u2019s primary custodian and awarded her $110 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In response to the father\u2019s motion for articulation, the trial court observed that, in accordance with \u00a7 46b-215a-3 (6)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, as a matter of law, adoption of a shared parenting plan authorized an order of child support that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>deviated from the child support guidelines, Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-l et seq. The support guidelines presumptively govern child support orders. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Marrocco </em>v. <em>Giardino, </em>255 Conn. 617, 625, 767 A.2d 720 (2001). In <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>87 Conn. App. 699, 701, 267 A.2d 111, cert. granted on other grounds, 273 Conn. 934, 875 A.2d 545 (2005),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we held, however, that \u201cthe amount of support to which the parties had agreed represented an acceptable deviation from the guidelines because the parties equally shared physical custody of their child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In deciding the amount of child support to award in this case, the court relied on the support guidelines, the evidence submitted by the parents, including their financial affidavits, and a time schedule prepared by the mother. In light of that schedule, the court found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mother to have assumed the role of \u201ccustodial parent\u201d because she \u201chad responsibility for the child[ren] approximately 60 to 70 percent of the time.\u201d The court ordered the father to pay $110 weekly as child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In his appeal to this court, the father has raised three issues. He maintains that (1) the shared parenting plan manifested the parents\u2019 agreement that neither parent would ever have primary custody of their children, (2) the court impermissibly deviated from the support guidelines because the mother did not satisfy the definition of a custodial parent under the guidelines, and (3) the parents\u2019 incomes and their shared parenting responsibilities were approximately equal. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In his first and principal claim, the father contends that the court should not have awarded <em>any </em>child support to the mother because, in their shared parenting plan, the parents had agreed that neither parent would have primary custody of their children. It is undisputed that, once the shared parenting plan was incorporated into the dissolution judgment, it became an enforceable contract. See <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 235, 737 A.2d 383 (1999); <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>56 Conn. App. 459, 470, 743 A. 2d 1135, cert. granted on other grounds, 253 Conn. 910, 754 A.2d 160 (2000) (appeal withdrawn September 27, 2000). In the absence of a claim that the terms of the plan are ambiguous, the proper construction of these terms is a question of law; <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>supra, 235; and our review of the judgment of the trial court is plenary. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">To understand the father\u2019s claim about the consequences of the parents\u2019 adoption of a shared parenting plan, we need to examine the kinds of shared parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>arrangements to which parents may agree upon the dissolution of their marriage as a matter of law. Although the law in other states has authorized a variety of shared parenting plans,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> our legislature expressly has recognized only two arrangements for the sharing of parental rights and obligations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 46b-215a-l (22) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which defines \u201cshared physical custody,\u201d and General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56a (a), which defines \u201cjoint custody,\u201d together authorize the shared parenting plan to which the parents agreed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Section 46b-215a-l (22) defines \u201cshared physical custody\u201d as \u201ca situation in which the noncustodial parent exercises visitation or physical care and control of the child for periods substantially in excess of a normal visitation schedule. . . .\u201d A \u201ctypical visitation schedule\u201d consists of \u201ctwo overnights on alternate weekends; alternate holidays; some vacation time; and other visits of short duration, which may occasion an overnight stay during the week.\u201d Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (1999) preamble, \u00a7 (h) (4), p. viii. Notably, \u00a7 46b-215a-l (22) expressly provides that <em>\u201cequal </em>sharing of physical care and control of the child is <em>not required </em>for a finding of shared physical custody.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>added.) Here, although this regulation did not require the parents to do so, their agreement contemplated the equal sharing of physical care and control of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56a (a) defines joint custody as \u201can order awarding legal custody of the minor child to both parents, providing for joint decision-making by the parents and providing that physical custody shall be shared by the parents in such a way as to assure the child of continuing contact with both parents. The court may award joint legal custody <em>without awarding joint physical custody </em>where the parents have agreed to merely joint legal custody.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Joint legal custody involves equal sharing of decisions regarding a child\u2019s welfare, such as education, religious instruction and medical care. See <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>5 Conn. App. 649, 656-57, 502 A.2d 933 (1985), cert. dismissed, 200 Conn. 804, 510 A.2d 192 (1986). Here again, the parents opted for joint legal custody <em>and </em>joint physical custody, which this statute did not require.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">There can be, therefore, no doubt that, as a matter of law, the shared parenting plan to which the parents agreed in this case authorized the trial court\u2019s decision to deviate from the established support guidelines. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-3 (6). The father has not argued to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The father claims that the court\u2019s support order nonetheless was improper because it was inconsistent with the broad based sharing of responsibilities contemplated in the shared parenting agreement. He emphasizes that the agreement provided, unambiguously, that neither party\u2019s home would be the children\u2019s primary residence. The inferences to be drawn from this agreement raise questions of law over which our review is plenary. <em>Issler v. Issler, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 235; <em>Amodio </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 470. We disagree with the father\u2019s assumption that the terms of the shared parenting plan implicitly precluded future modification of these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The father misunderstands the relationship between an initial support order and a motion for the modification of a support order. In its initial order, a court must consider all of the evidence, including the deviation criteria, the operative impact of a parenting arrangement and the respective incomes of the parties. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b. That order is not, however, sacrosanct. If there has been a substantial change of circumstances,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> authorizes a court to modify the terms of a dissolution agreement, including its provision for custodial and financial arrangements. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 718, 595 A.2d 297 (1991); <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>88 Conn. App. 246, 251, 869 A.2d 239 (2005).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The terms of the shared parenting agreement in this case did not include a provision precluding modification of the child support to which the parents had agreed. That option was available to them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We decline to interpolate a preclusionary term into the shared parenting agreement to which they subscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In sum, in its authorization of various agreements for sharing of parental authority after the dissolution of a marriage, the legislature has given parents considerable latitude to craft the arrangements that best suit their family. The legislature has not, however, made such arrangements nonmodifiable. If, as in this case, the parents do not themselves make their shared parenting plan nonmodifiable, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) authorizes a trial court to issue a modified support order that reflects a substantial change in the parents\u2019 circumstances. We conclude, therefore, as a matter of law, that the terms of the parties\u2019 parenting agreement did not preclude the court from modifying the agreement in light of its finding that a substantial change in circumstances had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The trial court based its decision to order the father to pay $110 in child support on the factual representations of the parents and the documentation they had prepared for the court. It found that \u201cthe evidence [showed that the mother] who is the custodial parent had responsibility for the children] approximately 60 to 70 percent of the time.\u201d In the father\u2019s challenge to this order, he claims that the court erroneously found that (1) the mother was a \u201ccustodial parent\u201d as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>term is defined in \u00a7 46b-215a-l (8)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and (2) the disparity in the parents\u2019 income was sufficient to warrant a modification of the support order. The viability of these claims of factual error depends on a showing that the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). The record does not substantiate the father\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Our consideration of any claim of factual error starts with an examination of the court record. In this case, the record is most notable for what it does not contain. Except for a reproduction of the terms of the shared parenting agreement, we have nothing other than a copy of the court\u2019s articulation of its order and a transcript of the testimony presented at the hearing on the modification motions. We have not been provided with any exhibits. The transcript indicates that only the parents testified at the hearing. A detailed schedule documenting the mother\u2019s daily custodial responsibilities<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is not before us. At the hearing, the father did not challenge the accuracy of this schedule, but relied instead on a biweekly custodial plan that was part of the original shared parenting plan<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as a basis for his otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>unarticulated contention that the mother had custody only 52 percent of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On this state of the record, the father\u2019s factual arguments are misguided. Although the father\u2019s motion for articulation asked the trial judge \u201cto explain how he arrived at the decision [in this case],\u201d the articulation did not put on the record the factual basis of the court\u2019s order, and the father made no further inquiry. It is axiomatic that, in a court hearing, the trial court determines the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Szczerkowski </em>v. Karmelowicz, 60 Conn. App. 429, 434, 759 A.2d 1050 (2000). The mother\u2019s testimony supported the court\u2019s finding that she had become the children\u2019s custodial parent for more than half the time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In the father\u2019s other factual arguments, he questions the amount of the child support order that the court ordered him to pay. He asks us to find that (1) the parents\u2019 incomes were approximately equal and (2) if he is required to comply with the court\u2019s order, he will lack the financial capacity to meet the basic needs of the children. Because the trial court made no findings with respect to these factual claims, we cannot address their merits. As an appellate court, we do not make findings of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>75 Conn. App. 423, 431, 816 A.2d 635, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 901, 829 A.2d 420 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> initially, the trial court, <em>DiPentima, J., </em>had ordered the father to pay $157 per week in child support. Thereafter, when the father was discharged from employment, the court, Walsh, J., reduced the father\u2019s child support obligation to $100 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\"> Section 46b-215a-3 (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201cIn some cases, there may be special circumstances not otherwise addressed in this section in which deviation from presumptive support amounts may be warranted for reasons of equity. Following are such circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">\u201c(A) Shared physical custody. When a shared physical custody arrangement exists, deviation is warranted only when: (i) Such arrangement substantially reduces the custodial parent\u2019s, or substantially increases the noncustodial parent\u2019s, expenses for the child; and (ii) Sufficient funds remain for the parent receiving support to meet the basic needs of the child after deviation. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The child support and arrearage guidelines promulgated pursuant to section 8 of public act 85-548 and any updated guidelines issued pursuant to section 46b-215a shall be considered in all determinations of child support amounts and payment on arrearages and past due support within the state. In all such determinations, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of such awards which resulted from the application of such guidelines is the amount of support or payment on any arrearage or past due support to be ordered. A specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case, as determined under criteria established by the Commission for Child Support Guidelines under section 46b-215a, shall be required in order to rebut the presumption in such case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u201c(c) In any proceeding for the establishment or modification of a child support award, the child support guidelines shall be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the criteria for such awards established in sections 46b-84, 46b-86, 46b-130, 46b-171, 46b-172, 46b-215, 17b-179 and 17b-745.\u201d The statute has been implemented by the support guidelines set forth in \u00a7 46b-215a-3 (6) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\"> The Supreme Court granted certification to appeal on the question of whether this court properly reversed \u201cthe trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis that the trial court had improperly imputed an amount of investment income to the defendant.\u201d <em>Weinstein v.

In that order, the court reduced the father\u2019s child support obligations to $100 per week to reflect his discharge from employment. The father did not challenge the amount of that award or the court\u2019s authority to order a modification of his support obligations.
