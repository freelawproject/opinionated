Williams and Barbara R. Williams,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendant, the Black Rock Yacht Club, Inc. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly (1) interpreted and applied \u00a7 33-1056 (a) and (2) limited their cross-examination of a defense witness by precluding them from introducing a document into evidence. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The court set forth the relevant findings of fact in its memorandum of decision. The defendant is a nonstock corporation, and its primary purpose is to be a yacht club with various dining and social and recreational facilities, such as a swimming pool, tennis court and boating facilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs submitted an application dated March 21, 1998, to join the defendant as members. In March, 2000, the defendant offered the plaintiffs admission<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as probationary members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The defendant\u2019s bylaws specifically required payment of a <em>nonrefundable </em>admission fee. After paying all of the applicable fees, dues and expenses, the plaintiffs were accepted as probationary members. At the last meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>of the season, the defendant\u2019s board of governors voted to extend the plaintiffs\u2019 probationary status for the 2001 season.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a letter dated October 26, 2000, the board explained that the reason for the second probationary year was \u201cdue to a number of reported incidents over the summer, whereby it was felt there was a disregard for the rules of the Club regarding your control over the actions of your children.\u201d The board indicated that it regretted taking such action and instructed the plaintiffs to contact either their sponsor, the chairman of the membership committee or any board member for further information.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Over the course of the 2001 season, the board received approximately twelve complaints regarding the plaintiffs. Those complaints repeatedly focused on the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to supervise their children adequately. For example, at two separate club events, the children were unable to find the plaintiffs, even with other club members assisting in the search. Another member observed the plaintiffs\u2019 young children unsupervised near a dangerously high seawall. Other complaints focused on violations of the club rule that required children younger than twelve to be accompanied by an adult.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result of those complaints,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the board sent the plaintiffs a letter dated October 10, 2001, terminating their association with the club. The letter stated: \u201cWe regret having to inform you that, at its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>October 9 meeting, the Board of Governors of the [defendant] voted not to extend your membership in the Club. This action was taken, by unanimous vote, as a result of your repeated disregard for Club Rules even after warnings and counseling by Club members. It is not a decision that the Board takes lightly. Having not seen an improvement in your compliance with the Rules during this past season, your second as Probationary Members, the Board felt compelled to terminate your association with the Club in accordance with its By-laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 operative complaint contained five counts. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant committed ultra vires acts and violated \u00a7 33-1056 (a) and General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. They sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment. Following a trial to the court, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant. The court concluded that the defendant was regulated by \u00a7 33-1056 (a) and was in compliance with the mandate of that statute. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly interpreted and applied \u00a7 33-1056 (a). Specifically, they argue that the court improperly concluded that (1) the bylaws concerning the admission were reasonable and (2) the bylaws were equally enforced as to all the members and candidates. After setting forth certain relevant background and legal principles, we will address each of the plaintiffs\u2019 specific arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth certain background information to facilitate our discussion. It is well established in both our jurisprudence and that of other states that generally \u201ccourts should be reluctant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>intervene in the affairs of private clubs . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Sterner </em>v. <em>Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 531, 537, 450 A.2d 369 (1982); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Windley, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. 382951 (November 6, 2001) (30 Conn.

A member is entitled to notice of the charges against him, notice of the time and place of the hearing, and a full and fair opportunity to be present and to offer a defense. <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Societa Giusippi Garibaldi, </em>96 Conn. 50, 57, 112 A. 693 (1921); see also <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Society of the Cincinnati, </em>46 Conn.

Our Supreme Court has explained that this \u201cprovision adopts common law standards of fair play and forms the basis for bylaws to be challenged by a member where they are not reasonable . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sterner </em>v. <em>Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club, Inc., </em>supra, 188 Conn. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>There are relatively few cases that squarely address the facts of the present case, which is not <em>an expulsion </em>case, but rather <em>exclusion from membership. </em>One court has explained that critical distinction. \u201c[T]he law accords important rights and status to members of voluntary organizations not extended to mere aspirants to membership therein. One wrongfully expelled from such an organization may be restored to membership by <em>mandamus. </em>... Or he may bring an action for damages <em>. ... On the other hand, there is no abstract right to be admitted to membership in a voluntary association . . . and a court will not compel the admission of a person to membership in such an organization who has not been elected according to its rules and by-laws </em>.... The general rule is that there is no legal remedy for exclusion of such an individual from admission into a voluntary association, no matter how arbitrary or unjust the exclusion. 4 Am. Jur., Associations and Clubs, \u00a7 11, p. 462 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Trautwein v. Harbourt, </em>40 N.J. Super. 247, 259-60, 123 A.2d 30, cert. denied, 22 N.J. 220, 125 A.2d 233 (1956). With the foregoing background in mind, we now turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly concluded that the club\u2019s bylaws concerning the admission procedures were reasonable. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the bylaws improperly require significant admission and capital assessment fees, and fail to offer probationary members the protection of notice and a hearing prior to termination and the corresponding loss of the fees paid to the club. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Pursuant to the applicable fee schedule, the plaintiffs paid the nonrefundable admission fee and other costs associated with obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>a probationary membership.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Article VI, \u00a7 1, of the defendant\u2019s bylaws sets forth the requirements for membership and provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cMembership requirements will be selective and only those persons who are economically solvent, </em>possess good character and integrity, and who will be socially compatible with the existing members of the Club will be accepted. Membership in the Club will not be denied any person because of race, color, sex, national origin, religion or creed. All prospective members shall meet the requirements for membership classification for which they apply.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">After serving an extra year as probationary members, the plaintiffs received a letter terminating their association with the defendant. They did not receive prior notice of the board\u2019s action or an opportunity to be heard. The letter indicated that the board acted unanimously. Section seven of article II of the defendant\u2019s bylaws states that the board \u201cshall have power by vote of seven of its members to suspend or, after notice and opportunity to be heard, to expel or drop any member of the Club for conduct which in its opinion endangers the welfare, interest and character of the Club or for failure to pay dues or other indebtedness to the Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We now identify the applicable standard of review. \u201cBecause this issue raises a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. ... A fundamental tenet of statutory construction is that statutes are to be considered to give effect to the apparent intention of the lawmaking body.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bruneau </em>v. <em>Seabrook, </em>84 Conn. App. 667, 670, 854 A.2d 818, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 930, 859 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>583 (2004). Our legislature recently enacted General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z, which provides that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As we have noted, our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sterner </em>provides us with some guidance. In that case, our Supreme Court instructed that in interpreting the predecessor to \u00a7 33-1056, courts should consider the common-law standards of fair play and the reasonableness of the club\u2019s bylaws. <em>Sterner </em>v. <em>Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club, Inc., </em>supra, 188 Conn. 535. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s bylaws comport with such standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">It is clear from the bylaws that one of the criteria to be utilized by the board when deciding to accept a new member is economic solvency. We cannot say that it was an unreasonable requirement for prospective members to pay a nonrefundable admission fee or other costs associated with the use of the facilities during the probationary period. The imposition of such fees also required prospective members to demonstrate the commitment expected by the board. The admission fee further provided a strong financial incentive to foster compliance with the club rules. The plaintiffs were aware of those fees when they submitted their application. Additionally, the court specifically noted the absence of any evidence that the bylaws, in particular the nonrefundable admission fee, served as some sort of \u201cmoneymaking scheme\u201d to benefit the defendant. The court made an explicit finding that instances in which probationary members were denied full membership were rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Finally, we are satisfied that the policy permitting the board to reject a probationary member without notice and a hearing does not rise to the level of a violation of the notion of fair play. It was within the board\u2019s discretion to retain the authority to reject a potential member without affording notice or a formal hearing detailing the reasons. \u201cMembership in a voluntary . . . association is generally held to be a privilege which may be accorded or withheld, and not a right which can be gained independently and then enforced. Generally, courts will not compel admission to a voluntary association, and one who has bee excluded from membership in a purely social organization cannot recover damages for the exclusion . ...\u201d 6 Am. Jur. 2d 406-407, supra, \u00a7 18. Furthermore, clubs such as the defendant generally are free to set their own qualifications concerning the admission to or exclusion from membership. Id., \u00a7 19, p. 408. As we have stated, courts are reluctant to become involved with the internal policies of social clubs. The present case does not afford a compelling reason to depart from that principle. In short, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant\u2019s rules and regulations are reasonable and germane to the club\u2019s purpose and, accordingly, did not violate \u00a7 33-1056 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly concluded that the bylaws were enforced equally as to all the members and candidates. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that they were singled out for unfair treatment; specifically, the board strictly enforced the bylaws when it came to their application for membership, but relaxed the standards when it came to other applicants. They further contend that the statute requires equal enforcement of the bylaws. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. During the course of the trial, the plaintiffs introduced evidence regarding several other families and individuals who were admitted to membership in the defendant club. The plaintiffs also demonstrated that in some cases, certain bylaws were not followed during the admission process. George Booth, a twenty-one year member of the club, testified that record keeping by the club had been inconsistent during his tenure. He also stated that a certain \u201clegacy\u201d member had received a letter that incorrectly indicated a probationary status requirement. Another \u201clegacy\u201d member was admitted to membership even though he had submitted his application after he had reached the age of thirty, in violation of the bylaw requiring submission of the application prior to becoming thirty. Another family received an improper class of membership due to the age of the head of the household.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Booth testified that during his three years as chairman of the membership committee, he had processed more than 100 applications. He stated that despite those and other minor inconsistencies, it was his practice to follow the bylaws to the best of his ability and that he never intentionally departed from them. He also explained that the defendant was managed by volunteers and that mistakes did occur from time to time. John Haskard, who was the defendant\u2019s present chairman of the membership committee, also indicated that every attempt was made to comply with the bylaws with respect to applications for membership and that at no time did he ever deviate intentionally from the applicable bylaws. The court specifically credited that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maritime Ventures, LLC </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>85 Conn. App. 38, 45, 855 A.2d 1011, cert. granted on other grounds, 271 Conn. 943, 861 A.2d 514 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The appropriate starting point for our discussion is the relevant statutory language. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 70, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). Section 33-1056 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c [m] embership shall be governed by such rules of admission . . . and [be] equally enforced as to all members.\u201d Concededly, the statute\u2019s text does not contain an intent requirement. Nevertheless, our Supreme Court has adopted the notion of fair play into the meaning of \u00a7 33-1056. We conclude, therefore, that a club such as the defendant is required only to make a good faith effort to apply its rules equally concerning admission. To impose a more stringent requirement would place an undue burden on such clubs, resulting in every accidental noncompliance with the bylaws constituting a statutory violation. This would be unreasonable, particularly for clubs such as the defendant that rely on volunteer members rather than professional managers. We cannot conclude that the legislature could have envisioned such a result. See <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, </em>250 Conn. 763, 778-79, 739 A.2d 238 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>In the present case, the court specifically found that the mistakes made by the board concerning the admission of some persons other than the plaintiffs were not relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Furthermore, \u201cthe various mistakes were not purposeful, and probably related to the fact that the defendant is operated by a volunteer and not a professional staff.\u201d There was ample evidence to support that factual finding. We conclude that under our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 33-1056 (a), in order to show that the bylaws were enforced unequally, at a minimum, the plaintiffs were required to demonstrate some evidence of an intent by the members to treat them differently from other candidates. To the contrary, there was evidence that another family was placed on a second year of probation for conduct similar to that of the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Faced with the court\u2019s specific factual finding, supported by the evidence, that any errors made in the admission process were the result of innocent mistakes made by volunteers, coupled with the absence of intent by the board or the membership committee to treat the plaintiffs differently from others seeking admission as members, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of unequal enforcement of the bylaws must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly limited their cross-examination of a defense witness by precluding them from introducing a document into evidence. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the court improperly prohibited them from challenging the credibility of Molly Edison, a club member<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who testified on behalf of the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Edison testified about her personal observations regarding the lack of parental supervision of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tiffs\u2019 children at the club. During cross-examination, the plaintiffs attempted to elicit testimony concerning her knowledge of certain criminal activity by two club members, Alfred Lenoci and Joseph Ganim. The plaintiffs attempted to introduce into evidence a newspaper article, dated October 10, 2001, that documented Lenoci\u2019s guilty plea to charges of bribery, mail fraud and various other crimes, as well as the public corruption scandal involving Ganim, the former mayor of Bridgeport. The plaintiffs contended that the purpose of that evidence was to challenge Edison\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">The defendant objected on the ground of relevance. Specifically, the objection was premised on the fact that the Lenocis were not probationary members and were not being considered for membership, and that the supervision of the Lenocis\u2019 children was not an issue. The court, in sustaining the objection, stated: \u201cThere\u2019s no indication [Edison] is on the board of directors at the time of the guilty pleas. There is no indication she reviewed it. There is no indication that she had anything to do or not to do with any of it. I do not see where we are going, so I will sustain the objection on the present, on the present foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The plaintiffs argue that they were harmed by the exclusion of that evidence because they were precluded from challenging Edison\u2019s credibility and motive regarding member conduct harmful to the club. They also contend that such evidence was relevant to their claim of selective enforcement, namely, the disparity in the treatment of the plaintiffs relative to misconduct by other members.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review, as well as certain legal principles that guide our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. \u201cIt is well settled that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . [Its] ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every <em>reasonable presumption </em>in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a <em>manifest abuse of </em>discretion.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>72 Conn.

App. 103, 111, 860 A.2d 285 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Additionally, we note that \u201c[e]vidence is admissible if it is relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1, commentary .... Relevant evidence is evidence which has a logical tendency to aid the trier of fact in the determination of an issue. ... No precise and universal test of relevancy is furnished by the law, and the question must be determined in each case according to the teachings of reason and judicial experience. ... It has been said that [o]ne fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of the one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Juchniewicz </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>86 Conn.

Code Evid. \u00a7 4-2.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The issue before the court concerned the defendant\u2019s denial of full membership to <em>probationary members. </em>The action or inaction of the defendant in taking disciplinary action against full members, such as Lenoci and Ganim, for personal misconduct had no relevance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>significance concerning the denial of full membership to the plaintiffs, who were at all times <em>probationary members. </em>Additionally, we agree with the court that because Edison was not a member of the board, she had no authority to commence disciplinary procedures against either full members or probationary members. Finally, we note that Edison\u2019s testimony concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct was based on her personal observations. In contrast, Edison lacked any direct or personal knowledge about misconduct on the part of Lenoci or Ganim. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the newspaper article.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> One commentary has stated that \u201c[t]he bitterness of a dispute is apt to be inversely proportionate to the area of conflict.
