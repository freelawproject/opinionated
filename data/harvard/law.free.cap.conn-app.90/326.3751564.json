The petitioner claimed that his trial counsel rendered ineffective legal assistance. The petitioner appeals following the court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">We have reviewed the issues raised by the petitioner in his amended petition as well as the court\u2019s thorough resolution of those issues. We conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues raised are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions raised deserve encouragement to proceed further. See <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). Having failed to satisfy any of those criteria, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal reflects an abuse of discretion. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 616, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
