On appeal, the defendant claims that the court deprived him of his right to a fair and impartial jury under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution by improperly (1) omitting any reference to drug dependency in the jury charge for \u00a7 21a-278 (b), (2) placing the burden of proving drug dependence on him and (3) exposing him to a penalty range higher than that mandated by the facts found as indicated by the verdict. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our analysis of the claims. On July 17, 2002, between 11:15 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., Officers Ronald Jersey and Keith Ruffin were working undercover for the tactical narcotics team of the Bridgeport police department. The officers approached the rear of 1458 East Main Street, a three story rooming house, where Jersey purchased a \u201cslab,\u201d or small plastic bag, of crack cocaine from the defendant with a marked $20 bill. Jersey and Ruffin then departed from the area and notified the arrest team of the defendant\u2019s description and location. The arrest team soon thereafter apprehended and arrested the defendant. At the time of his arrest, the defendant possessed crack cocaine and the marked $20 bill used earlier by Jersey to purchase the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">On April 21, 2003, during a charging conference, the state moved to amend its information so as to delete the reference in the information to drug dependence, but to maintain the charge of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (b). The court granted the state\u2019s request over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was convicted and sentenced to eleven years in prison, execution suspended after eight years, and three years of probation. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The defendant first claims that the court violated his sixth amendment right to a fair and impartial jury by improperly omitting any reference to drug dependence from its jury charge for \u00a7 21a-278 (b). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">\u201cWe note that the standard of review for a claim of an improper jury instruction is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>84 Conn. App. 283, 295-96, 853 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 928, 859 A.2d 584 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">\u201cThe law ... is clear that the absence of drug dependency is <em>not an element </em>of the offense of sale of narcotics under \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>81 Conn. App. 152, 163, 838 A.2d 1030, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 909, 845 A.2d 413 (2004). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>such, a court is not obligated to instruct the jury that in order to find that the defendant violated \u00a7 2 la-278 (b), it must find, inter alia, that he is not drug-dependent. On the contrary, the defendant must prove his drug dependence by a preponderance of the evidence in order to avoid liability under \u00a7 21a-278 (b). <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 609, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). \u201c[A] person charged with sale of narcotics pursuant to \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) is presumed not to have been drug-dependent, but may avoid liability under \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>41 Conn. App. 604, 609, 679 A.2d 3 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In this case, the defendant did not raise the issue of drug dependence at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court therefore had no evidence, let alone sufficient evidence, to instruct the jury on drug dependence. Accordingly, the state did not have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not drug-dependent. Instead, the state was entitled to rely on a presumption that the defendant was not drug-dependent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>24 Conn. App. 347, 354-55, 588 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134, 135, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 915, 112 S. Ct. 319, 116 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1991). Furthermore, because the issue of drug dependence was not before the jury, the court properly allowed the state to amend the information and to delete the reference to drug dependence in the information. The amendment to the information that deleted any reference to the defendant\u2019s not being a drug-dependent person did not change the offense and, thus, did not deprive the defendant of his right to fair notice of the charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>20 Conn. App. 386, 390, 567 A.2d 392 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The defendant next claims that shifting the burden of proving drug dependence to the defendant should be \u201creexamined\u201d in light of recent United States Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant, however, neither specifically states which Supreme Court decisions should be reviewed nor discusses which aspects of the law of such decisions are relevant to his claim. As discussed, the burden of proving drug dependence remains on the defendant, a rule firmly established in <em>Hart </em>and a rule that clearly forecloses any claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The defendant finally claims that, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), he was exposed to a penalty range higher than that mandated by the facts found as reflected in the verdict. The rule in <em>Apprendi </em>requires that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 490. <em>Apprendi </em>thus applies to factual findings that serve to enhance a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence beyond that allowable under the verdict alone. Conversely, the reference to a lack of drug dependency in \u00a7 21a-278 (b) operates as an affirmative defense to reduce the maximum sentence allowed by the statute. The purpose of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) is to punish persons who are not drug-dependent and sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>narcotics more severely than drug-dependent persons who sell those substances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>66 Conn. App. 709, 714-15, 785 A.2d 1198 (2001). Indeed, a defendant who is charged under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) is presumed to be aperson who is not drug-dependent and may avoid the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of five years only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In his brief, the defendant contends: \u201cWithout the reference [to drug dependency], \u00a7 2la-278 (b) becomes the functional equivalent of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> . . . allowing] the government to present a case on the lesser charge while imposing punishment intended for the greater charge.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant, having been charged with violating \u00a7 21a-278 (b), could have made his drug-dependence an issue. Because the defendant offered no evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the incident at issue, he may not avoid the imposition of the minimum sentence mandated by \u00a7 21a-278 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance . . . and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.
