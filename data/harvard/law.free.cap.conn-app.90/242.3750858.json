J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">The defendant PRF of Connecticut, Inc. (PRF), appeals from the judgment of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>sustaining the appeal of the plaintiff, Windsor Locks Associates, from the decision of the defendant planning and zoning commission (commission)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the town of Windsor Locks approving PRF\u2019s application for a site plan involving a valet parking facility and construction of a hotel. On appeal, PRF claims that the court improperly (1) considered the issue of whether a valet parking lot on the subject property was a legal nonconforming use because that issue had been adjudicated in a prior administrative hearing from which the time to appeal had expired and (2) determined that the plaintiff was not collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the valet parking lot\u2019s legality- We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the appeal. In 1999, PRF, along with another entity,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applied to the commission for approval of a site plan for property located near Bradley International Airport and in the town\u2019s business 1 zone. The site plan contemplated moving an existing valet parking lot from the front to the rear of the property and constructing a hotel in the original location of the parking lot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commission ultimately approved the site plan on August 14, 2000, and an appeal by the plaintiff followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff owns property contiguous to the property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>which the site plan pertains and is, therefore, statutorily aggrieved. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The plaintiff raised several claims in its appeal, but the court found one claim dispositive. Specifically, the court agreed that the operation of the valet parking lot on the subject property was an illegal, nonconforming use and, accordingly, the commission lacked authority to approve a site plan allowing for the continuance of such use. In reaching its decision, the court reviewed the town\u2019s zoning regulations promulgated in 1976, 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1998 and determined that none of them allowed for the operation of a valet parking lot in a business 1 zone. It noted that the commission\u2019s approval of the continuance of the valet parking lot as part of the site plan was premised on the assumption that the lot is a legal nonconforming use. The court found that there was no evidence in the record to show that use of the premises as a valet parking lot predated promulgation of the 1976 regulations disallowing such use or that such use ever was authorized by regulation or variance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It further found that use of the property for valet parking commenced at some time subsequent to 1982. Accordingly, the court concluded that the valet parking lot was an illegal nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The defendants did not present any evidence in support of their contention that the valet parking lot was a legal nonconforming use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, they argued that a prior administrative decision concerning the property precluded the court from reaching that issue. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cally, on April 13, 1995, the town\u2019s zoning enforcement officer (officer) had issued a cease and desist order against PRF on the basis of information that he had received indicating that PRF had abandoned use of the property as a valet parking lot and then, apparently, had resumed that use. The officer\u2019s information had come from two individuals who owned other valet parking facilities in the area. Pursuant to the town\u2019s zoning regulations, \u201c[w]here there is a non-use of a non-conforming use for a period of six (6) months, the use shall be deemed abandoned, unless there be proof offered of intent not to abandon such non-conforming use,\u201d and \u201c[n]o non-conforming use which has been abandoned shall be thereafter resumed. . . .\u201d Windsor Locks Zoning Regs., c. viii, \u00a7 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">PRF appealed from the cease and desist order to the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board), arguing that the valet parking lot had not ceased operating for six months and that there was no intent to abandon use of the property as a valet parking lot. After evidence was presented at a hearing held on July 11 and 18,1995, the board agreed with PRF\u2019s contentions and rescinded the officer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Thereafter, the competing valet parking lot owners appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. In a July 8, 1996 memorandum of decision, the court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>granted PRF\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. <em>Northeast Parking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 469143 (July 8, 1996). Therein, the court found that the competing owners\u2019 claimed injury to their business interests as a result of the board\u2019s decision was not enough to establish aggrievement so as to confer on them standing to appeal from that decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court consequently did not reach the merits of the competing owners\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The plaintiff in this case was not a party to the proceedings before the board or to the appeal from the board\u2019s decision, and the court in this matter so found. It found further that the issue of whether PRF\u2019s valet parking lot was a legal nonconforming use \u201cwas not litigated and . . . played no significant role in the court\u2019s decision on the motion to dismiss.\u201d On the basis of those findings, the court rejected PRF\u2019s contention that the plaintiff was precluded from raising that issue in the present proceedings. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">PRF argues first that the court improperly considered the issue of the legality of the use of its property as a valet parking lot because that issue had been adjudicated in a prior administrative hearing. It claims that the issue of the lot\u2019s legality was brought before the board when PRF appealed from the cease and desist order concerning abandonment. It argues that the plaintiff could have participated in the public hearing that was held and, as an aggrieved neighboring property owner, could have appealed from the decision that resulted. According to PRF, because the plaintiff did not file an appeal from the board\u2019s decision within fifteen days as required by statute, the decision became final and the court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider any appeal therefrom. That argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We begin with the applicable standard of review. Although PRF\u2019s claim was not raised in the trial court, \u201c[a] party may challenge a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction at any time, and whenever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>case . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Urbanowicz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>87 Conn. App. 277, 286, 865 A.2d 474 (2005). \u201cWhether the court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law to which the plenary standard of review applies.\u201d Id., 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Jurisdiction over appeals from the decisions of zoning entities is conferred on the Superior Court by statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-8. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b), if a party aggrieved by a decision of a zoning board wants to file an appeal from that decision, it must commence that appeal within fifteen days of the date on which notice of the decision was published. \u201cA statutory right to appeal may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport Bowl-O-Rama, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>195 Conn. 276, 283, 487 A.2d 559 (1985). Accordingly, \u201c[i]f the appeal period has expired when an appeal is filed the trial court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\u201d <em>Cardoza </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 78, 82, 557 A.2d 545 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">PRF does not complain that the plaintiff failed to file its appeal within fifteen days of publication of notice of the commission\u2019s decision approving PRF\u2019s site plan. Rather, it endeavors to cast the plaintiffs claim as one contesting the 1995 decision of the board that rescinded the cease and desist order issued against PRF. That characterization is based on a hypothetical rather than on the actual state of affairs and, as such, clearly is inapt. By its plain terms, the plaintiffs appeal challenges the decision of the commission approving PRF\u2019s site plan. The commission, not the board, is named as a defendant, and the multiple errors alleged all pertain to the commission\u2019s approval of the site plan. Insofar as the continuation of the valet parking lot operation was one of the uses of the property contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the site plan, a claim pertaining to the lot\u2019s illegality is appropriately raised in an appeal from the decision approving the site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The cases cited by PRF in support of its argument are distinguishable in that each involved a party attempting to challenge in a later proceeding some decision arrived at in a prior proceeding from which no appeal was filed. On appeal, each attempt to collaterally attack the decision in a separate proceeding or action was disallowed. For example, in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 616 A.2d 793 (1992), the plaintiff did not appeal when a zoning permit was issued to challenge a condition included therein, but attempted to raise that challenge three years later in an appeal from a cease and desist order concerning the plaintiffs violation of the condition. Id., 101-104. In <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979), the plaintiff did not appeal timely from a zoning commission\u2019s implicit approval of a subdivision plan, but instead brought an action for equitable relief, arguing that the commission\u2019s action was void and seeking to enjoin the subdivision of the property at issue. In <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Power Facility Evaluation Council, </em>177 Conn. 623, 419 A.2d 342 (1979), the plaintiffs did not appeal from the issuance of a certificate of environmental compatibility regarding a proposal that affected their property, but attempted to contest that issuance by appealing from a later amendment to the certificate, the approval of which did not aggrieve them. Id., 625-30.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In each of those cases, the plaintiffs were held to be foreclosed in later proceedings from contesting the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>decisions from which they previously had declined to appeal. Here, in contrast, the plaintiff has timely appealed from the decision of the commission approving PRF\u2019s site plan and is not attempting to contest the board\u2019s prior decision rescinding the cease and desist order. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that PRF\u2019s first claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">PRF next claims that the court improperly failed to find that the plaintiff was collaterally estopped from litigating the issue of whether the valet parking lot was an illegal nonconforming use. It argues that all of the requirements for collateral estoppel to apply were met because the \u201cidentical\u201d issue had been addressed in the hearing before the board regarding the cease and desist order and the plaintiff had received notice and the opportunity to participate in the prior proceeding and, further, was in privity with other parties to that proceeding, namely, the competing valet parking lot owners. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Whether collateral estoppel is applicable under a given set of facts is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>DaCruz </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>268 Conn. 675, 686, 846 A.2d 849 (2004); <em>Waterbury Equity Hotel, LLC </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>85 Conn. App. 480, 493, 858 A.2d 259, cert. denied, 272 Conn. 901, 863 A.2d 696 (2004). \u201c[C]ollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion . . . prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties or those in privity with them upon a different claim.\u201d <em>Efthimiou </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>268 Conn. 499, 506, 846 A.2d 222 (2004). \u201cAn issue is <em>actually litigated </em>if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined. ... 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 27, comment (d) (1982).\u201d <em>Efthimiou </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>Smith, </em>supra, 507; <em>Dontigney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>87 Conn. App. 681, 685, 867 A.2d 93 (2005). \u201cA judgment is not conclusive in a subsequent action as to issues which might have been but were not litigated and determined in the prior action.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), [supra, \u00a7 27, comment (e)]; see also 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 541 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Here, Judge Holzberg dismissed the competing valet parking lot owners\u2019 appeal from the decision of the board because they lacked standing to file that appeal; the merits of the appeal were never litigated. Consequently, PRF argues that it is the board\u2019s decision itself that should have been given preclusive effect. It is true that the doctrine of collateral estoppel may apply to give preclusive effect to administrative rulings as well as to court judgments. See <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>262 Conn. 45, 61-62, 808 A.2d 1107 (2002); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>83 Conn. App. 599, 602, 851 A.2d 320, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 909, 859 A.2d 561 (2004). Nevertheless, we conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the basic requirements of collateral estoppel are lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">First, the issue raised in the present action, i.e., the legality of the valet parking lot as a preexisting nonconforming use, differs from those litigated before the board, i.e., whether PRF had abandoned use of its property as a valet parking lot for six months and had intended such abandonment. In the proceedings before the board, the legality of the valet parking lot to begin with apparently was assumed. We note particularly that the zoning officer\u2019s letter to the principals of PRF directing them to cease and desist operations did not mention the lot\u2019s initial legality, but focused on abandonment. Only the regulation pertaining to abandonment was cited. Similarly, a letter from PRF\u2019s counsel notifying the board that PRF intended to appeal from the officer\u2019s order included argument addressed solely to the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of abandonment. Finally, transcripts of the two public hearings at which PRF\u2019s appeal was heard by the board reveal that the only topic on which it took evidence and considered was PRF\u2019s purported abandonment of the use of its property for valet parking; the legality of the lot\u2019s nonconformity was not discussed. In sum, the issue of legal nonconformance was not raised, submitted or determined by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u201cFor collateral estoppel to apply, the issue concerning which relitigation is sought to be estopped must be identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>255 Conn. 477, 490, 774 A.2d 927 (2001). Further, \u201c[t]he [party seeking estoppel] has the burden of showing that the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was actually decided in the first proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 364, 377, 727 A.2d 1245 (1999). Here, it is clear that the issues before the board and the commission were not identical and that the issue of legal nonconformance was not actually decided. Hence, PRF has not met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Next, it is equally apparent that the plaintiff is not in privity with the competing valet parking lot owners who caused the cease and desist order to be issued and participated in the proceedings before the board. \u201c \u2018Privity is not established . . . from the mere fact that persons may happen to be interested in the same question or in proving or disproving the same facts.\u2019 46 Am. Jur. 2d, [supra] \u00a7 532. While the concept of privity is difficult to define precisely, it has been held that a key consideration for its existence is the sharing of the same legal right by the parties allegedly in privity.\u201d (Intemal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 173, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987). \u201c[C]ollaterai estoppel should be applied only when there exists such an identification in interest of one person with another as to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the same legal rights so as to justify preclusion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lundborg </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>63 Conn. App. 451, 456, 776 A.2d 519 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Here, the plaintiff and the competing valet parking lot owners possess different legal rights and have diverging interests such that it cannot be said that they are in privity. As mere business competitors of PRF, the parking lot owners lack the statutory rights conferred on contiguous property owners such as the plaintiff. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1). Moreover, the record indicates that the competing owners likely lacked the incentive to raise the issue of whether PRF\u2019s valet parking lot was an illegal nonconforming use. Specifically, in his memorandum of decision dismissing the appeal from the board\u2019s decision, Judge Holzberg referred repeatedly to the competitors\u2019 \u201cunderstanding\u201d that both they and PRF were valid nonconforming users, an understanding that apparently had not been confirmed officially. Insofar as a successful challenge to the status of PRF\u2019s nonconformity could have led to a similar result vis-a-vis the competing valet parking lots, there existed a strong disincentive to the raising of that challenge. Cf. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>60 Conn. App. 107, 117, 758 A.2d 452 (findingno privity between primary insurer, excess carrier because former lacked incentive to contest damages beyond its maximum exposure), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 906, 762 A. 2d 912 (2000). At best, the plaintiff and the competing valet parking lot owners share only an interest in proving or disproving similar facts, a commonality insufficient to establish privity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As to PRF\u2019s claim that the plaintiff received notice and had the opportunity to participate in the proceedings before the board, we note that an unexercised right to participate does not result in preclusion. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>supra, 60 Conn. App. 115 (defendant not precluded from contesting arbitration findings by declining invitation to participate in arbitration when not contractually obligated to do so); see also 47 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 659 (\u201cright to intervene in an action does not, in the absence of its exercise, subject one possessing it to the risk of being bound by the result of the litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u201c[T]he \u2018crowning consideration\u2019 in collateral estoppel cases and the basic requirement of privity [is] that the interest of the party to be precluded must have been sufficiently represented in the prior [proceeding] so that the application of collateral estoppel is not inequitable. ... A [proceeding] in which one party contests a claim against another should be held to estop a third person only when it is realistic to say that the third person was fully protected in the first [proceeding].\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>240 Conn. 799, 818, 695 A.2d 1010 (1997). \u201cThe reason for the rule lies in the deep-rooted fundamental doctrine of the law that a party to be affected by a personal judgment must have a day in court and an opportunity to be heard on the matter.\u201d 47 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The plaintiff in this matter was not sufficiently represented or fully protected in the proceedings before the board by virtue of the participation of the competing valet parking lot owners. The court properly afforded it a day in court and an opportunity to be heard regarding the legality of PRF\u2019s nonconforming use. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that PRF\u2019s collateral estoppel argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\"> The commission is a party to this appeal, but has not filed a separate appellate brief. Rather, it joined in the brief filed by PRF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\"> The other entity, the defendant Windsor Locks Suites, LLC, is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> As noted by the court in its memorandum of decision, the valet parking lot is of a type known popularly as a \u201cpark, ride and fly\u201d lot intended to \u201cprovide parking and transportation to and from the airport for customers who need to park their vehicles for extended periods of time while traveling.
