But the motion was addressed to the sound discretion of the District Judge, and we are not satisfied that it was not properly exercised, in the interests of preventing litigation of insignificant importance. Had the application been made by the original creditors it would be regarded with more favor. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
