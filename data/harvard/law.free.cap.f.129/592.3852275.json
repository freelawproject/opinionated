No case is made fn the bill of diversity of citizenship, nor was jurisdiction of the Circuit Court invoked on that ground. The appellant contends, however, that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court does not rest alone upon the fact that the case involves the construction of a treaty or law of the United States, but that it is conferred by the act of August 15, 1894, c. 290, 28 Stat. 286-305, which gives to the Circuit Courts \u201cjurisdiction to try and determine-any action, suit or proceeding arising within their respective jurisdictions involving the right of any person in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent to any allotment of land under any law or treaty.\u201d This provision, if applicable at all to the present case, does not confer a jurisdiction which otherwise would not exist, nor does it render the cause any the less one which involves the construction of a treaty of the United States, and which, under section 5 of the act establishing the Circuit Court of Appeals (Act March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 827 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 549]), is made appealable from the Circuit Court directly to the Supreme Court. In American Sugar Refining Company v. New Orleans, 181 U. S. 277-281, 21 Sup. Ct. 646, 45 L. Ed. 859, the court, referring to the act creating the Circuit Court of Appeals, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cThe intention of the act in general was that the appellate jurisdiction should be distributed, and that there should not be two appeals. And the right to two appeals would exist in every case (the litigated matter having the requisite value) where the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court rested solely on the ground that the suit arose under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, if such cases could be carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals, for their decisions would not come within the category of those made final. As, however, a case so arises where it appears on the record, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s own statement, in legal and logical form, such as is required by good pleading, that the suit is one which does really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy as to a right which depends on the construction or application of the Constitution or some law or treaty of the United States (Gold Washing &amp; Water Co. v. Keyes, 96 U. S. 199 [24 L. Ed. 656]; Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., 175 U. S. 571 [20 Sup. Ct. 222, 44 L. Ed. 276]; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Ann Arbor Railroad Company, 178 U. S. 239 [20 Sup. Ct. 867, 44 L. Ed. 1052]; and as those eases fall strictly within the terms of section 5, the appellate jurisdiction of this court in respect of them is exclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">There can be no doubt that the present case is one which involves a construction of the treaty with the Puyallup Indians, and an adjudication of the rights of the appellee thereunder. Such a case is appealable to the Supreme Court, and no provision is made for its appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The motion to dismiss will be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
