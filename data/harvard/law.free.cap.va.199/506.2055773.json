It was alleged that under the terms of the policy the Insurance Company had agreed to pay to Sallie Parker the amount claimed in the event of Morgan\u2019s \u201closs of life;\u201d that Sallie Parker, the named beneficiary, had been convicted and sentenced to prison for the felonious killing of the insured, Morgan, and that, therefore, the amount due under the policy was payable to the plaintiff administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The Insurance Company filed an answer admitting the issuance of the policy and the death of the insured in the manner alleged by the plaintiff, but denying that it was obligated to pay the amount sued for because, it said, under the \u201cEXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS\u201d clause of the policy it is expressly stipulated that death or \u201closs resulting from <em>* * * </em>illegal acts of any person,\u201d such as is the case here, is not insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">By agreement of the parties the matter was tried by the lower court without a jury and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff against the Insurance Company for the amount claimed. We granted the Insurance Company a writ of error. The sole question presented is whether the death of the insured, in the manner stated, was a risk excluded under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The facts are not in dispute. On March 28, 1955, the Insurance Company wrote an \u201cAccident and Sickness\u201d policy on George Morgan, the named insured, for the sum of $2,000. The indemnity for loss of life was payable to Sallie Parker as the named beneficiary. While the policy was in effect Sallie Parker killed Morgan and shortly thereafter was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to prison for the killing. It was conceded at the trial of the suit on the policy that because of the illegal act of Sallie Parker, the named beneficiary, the proceeds of the policy, if due under its provisions to anyone, are payable to Morgan\u2019s personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The policy contains these pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cATLANTIC LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY * * * Hereby insures the person named in the Policy Schedule as the Insured against <em>loss</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as specified herein, (1) resulting directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injuries (herein called such injuries) sustained while this policy is in force and (2) from disability caused by sickness or such injuries while this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>policy is in force, subject to all the provisions, exclusions and conditions of the policy, and agrees to pay:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">#*#####</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cIII. THE PRINCIPAL SUM INDEMNITY for death due under Part III, <em>\u2018Loss </em>of Life by Accident.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">####*##</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cPART III\u2014LOSS OF LIFE BY ACCIDENT. If within ninety (90) days after the date of the accident irrespective of total disability, such injuries shall result in the death of the Insured, the Company will pay the principal sum specified in the Policy Schedule; # # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">\u201cPART V\u2014EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS. * * * This policy does not cover disability or <em>loss </em>resulting from taking poison, inhaling gas (voluntary or otherwise), or <em>illegal acts of any person or persons, </em>or participation in an assault or felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The question presented is whether the death of the insured in the manner stated was a \u201closs resulting from * * * illegal acts of any person\u201d which was excluded from coverage under PART V of the policy. It is the contention of the plaintiff administratrix that the death of the insured was not a \u201closs\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion clause, while the Insurance Company takes the opposite view.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">The trial court in a written opinion held that \u201cthe word \u2018loss\u2019 is ambiguous and being ambiguous is to be strongly construed [against the Insurance Company] and does not cover death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">We do not agree with that view. We see nothing ambiguous, doubtful, or uncertain in the use of the word \u201closs\u201d in the exclusion clause. The word \u201closs\u201d is a word of common use and its meaning is plain and easily understood. It is commonly used to denote the death of a person, and such an event is frequently referred to as a \u201closs\u201d to his family and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. (1935), defines the word \u201closs\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">\u201c1. State or fact of being lost or destroyed; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201c7. <em>Insurance. </em>Death, injury, destruction, or damage in such a manner as to charge the insurer with a liability under the terms of the policy; * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Among the definitions of the word found in American College Dictionary, Random House, 1948 Ed., are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201c4. A being deprived of * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201c11. <em>Insurance </em>a. Occurrence of a risk, as death or damage to property, covered by a contract of insurance so as to result in insured liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, 14th Ed., defines the word thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYc\">\u201cLOSS. In Insurance. The destruction of or damage to the insured subject by the perils insured against, according to the express provisions and construction of the contract. <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cLoss under a life policy is simply the death of the subject by a cause the risk of which is not expressly excepted in the policy, * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI6\">Moreover, it is perfectly plain from a reading of the policy as a whole that the word \u201closs\u201d is used in a general sense to cover any instance where the Insurance Company will be called upon to pay under the provisions of the policy. The very first line of the policy \u201cinsures the person named in the Policy Schedule as the Insured, against <em>loss </em>as specified herein.\u201d Then follow four provisions for the payment of indemnity for losses insured against. Among these is the promise to pay \u201cINDEMNITY for death due under Part III, <em>'Loss </em>of Life by Accident.\u2019 \u201d This clause is the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to recover the proceeds of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Under \u201cGENERAL PROVISIONS\u201d we find these stipulations wherein the word \u201closs\u201d is similarly used in a general sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201cTIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years from the date of issue of this policy, no misstatements <em>* * * </em>made by the applicant <em>* * * </em>shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for <em>loss </em>incurred * <em>* * .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">\u201c(b) No claim for <em>loss </em>incurred * * * commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">\u201cNOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the Company within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any <em>loss </em>covered by the policy, * * <em>* .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">\u201cCLAIM FORMS: The Company, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of <em>loss. * * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cPROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of <em>loss </em>must be furnished to the Company <em>* * * .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">\u201cTIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this policy for any <em>loss </em>other than <em>loss </em>for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such <em>loss. * * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201cPAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for <em>loss </em>of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such payment * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">It is perfectly plain then that the word \u201closs,\u201d as frequently used throughout the policy, includes the death of the insured. Indeed, the very basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that such death was a \u201closs\u201d which was insured against by the first line of the policy. If it is plain that \u201closs\u201d means loss of life or death under the insuring clause, as we think it does, it is equally plain that it means loss of life or death under the exclusion clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The conclusion which we have thus reached is in accord with the holdings in <em>Maclin </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>(172 Term. 244, 111 S. W. 2d 1019), and <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Meadows </em>(242 Ala. 476, 7 So. 2d 29), involving similar policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">As was aptly said in the <em>Maclin </em>case, supra, \u201cThe word \u2018loss\u2019 used in the exceptions must be accorded the breadth of meaning as is specifically given it in the insuring clause of the contract.\u201d (111 S. W. 2d, at page 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">None of the cases cited by the plaintiff touches upon the precise point with which we are here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Since it is undisputed that the death of the insured resulted from the illegal act of another, we hold that it was a loss which was excluded under the terms of the policy and for which no recovery can be had. Accordingly, the judgment will be reversed and a final judgment will be here entered for the defendant Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\"> Emphasis is added here and in the subsequent quotations from the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
