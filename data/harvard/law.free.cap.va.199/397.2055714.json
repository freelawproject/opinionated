Unlawfully and against the peace and dignity of the COMMONWEALTH. These are, therefore, in the name of the COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, to command you forthwith to apprehend and bring before the Judge of the County Court the body of the said defendant named above to answer the said complaint, and to be further dealt with according to law, and to summon the witness named on the back hereof to appear on the next day following the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cGiven under my hand and seal this 1st day of Nov., 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201cEugene C. Adkins, Special Justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">A fine of $15.00 was assessed against the defendant; an appeal from this judgment was had to the circuit court; whereupon, at the request of the defendant and with the consent of the court and the Commonwealth, the court heard the case without the intervention of a jury. Upon this hearing an order was entered finding the defendant guilty \u201cas charged in the warrant\u201d and imposing a fine of $15.00, from which order we granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">After the evidence had been presented in the circuit court, the defendant moved to strike the evidence and to dismiss or quash the warrant, upon the ground that sections 18-327<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18-328,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Virginia, 1950, were unconstitutional in that they violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">While the circuit court, in dealing with this motion, sustained the constitutionality of the statutes, in our view of the record it was not necessary to pass upon the constitutional question for the reason that the warrant of arrest fails to charge a crime. As will be seen from the face of the warrant it nowhere indicates the race or color of the defendant; it does not allege that the defendant, in violation of Code, \u00a7 18-328, had failed to take and occupy a seat assigned to her under the provisions of \u00a7 18-327; nor does it allege that in these or any other respects the conduct of the defendant violated \u00a7 18-328'. In fact, the warrant fails to allege any offense prohibited either at common law or by statute. While in this jurisdiction the same particularity is not required in warrants of arrest as is required in formal indictments, they must, nevertheless, point out the offense for which the defendant is to stand trial. <em>Old </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Gratt. (59 Va.) 915, 930; <em>Lacey </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>93 Va. 159, 173, 24 S. E. 930, 57 Am. St. Rep. 795, 31 L. R. A. 822; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doss, </em>159 Va. 968, 167 S. E. 371; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>160 Va. 943, 169 S. E. 550; 19 M. J., Warrants, \u00a7 3, p. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The defendant did not testify nor did she introduce witnesses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>her behalf. Five witnesses were introduced by the Commonwealth, none of whom was questioned regarding the race or color of the defendant. Thus, according to the record before us, the race or color of the defendant was neither alleged in the warrant nor proved by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In appellate proceedings this court sits to review and correct errors of trial courts, and in exercising this jurisdiction we are limited to the record of the proceedings which have taken place in the trial court and have been there settled and certified to us. <em>U. S. Mineral Co. </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>106 Va. 663, 666, 56 S. E. 561, 117 Am. St. Rep. 1028; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>177 Va. 101, 107, 12 S. E. 2d 791; 1 M. J., Appeal and Error, \u00a7 189, p. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It was conceded in argument before us that the defendant\u2019s conduct on this occasion was for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 18-327 and 18-328.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">It was urged on her behalf that this court disregard the manifest invalidity of the proceedings and the lack of proof, and decide the constitutional question regardless. This we must decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">One of the most firmly established doctrines in the field of constitutional law is that a court will pass upon the constitutionality of a statute only when it is necessary to the determination of the merits of the case. This principle is recognized by appellate courts generally. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Quillin, </em>167 Va. 255, 260, 261, 188 S. E. 216; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doss, supra; </em>4 M. J., Constitutional Law, \u00a7 60, pp. 150, 151; <em>Ohio River &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Dittey, </em>232 U. S. 576, 58 L. ed. 737, 34 S. Ct. 372; <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>323 U. S. 101, 104, 65 S. Ct. 152, 89 L. ed. 101; 11 Am. Jur., Constitutional Law, \u00a7 93, p. 720 and cases cited under Footnote 1 page 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">For the reasons stated the judgment of conviction is reversed and the warrant dismissed.
