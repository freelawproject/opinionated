It joined in the prayer of the bill that the rights of the parties be adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The case was heard on the pleadings and a stipulation of facts. The trial court held adversely to the City, and we granted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The stipulated facts, so far as pertinent, may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">(1) The County \u201cenacted a zoning ordinance on September 5, 1933, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 15 of the Acts of Assembly of 1927, which ordinance has been amended and revised from time to time, particularly on July 18, 1956, when a zoning district for penal and correctional institutions was established within which jails and jail farms may be constructed, operated and maintained, and excluded from other districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">(2) The land of the City is situated in a zoning district \u201cpresently outside any penal and correctional institution district, to wit: in an agricultural district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">(3) The City is the owner in fee simple of the land on which it proposes to construct and operate its jail and city farm, the land having been acquired for the purpose of enlarging and improving an airport, to which use it has heretofore been devoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">(4) The establishment, operation and maintenance of a jail or jail farm is a governmental function of the City, and its construction has been duly authorized by the Council of the City as.of June 25, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">(5) The County, prior to June, 1956, notified the City that its proposed use of the land was subject to the County\u2019s zoning ordinance; and</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">(6) The City notified the County that it intended to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>with its plans to establish and operate the jail and jail farm, without complying with the zoning ordinance of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The County contends that its zoning ordinance enacted pursuant to general statutes applies to all land within its territorial limits, regardless of the ownership of the land; that there is no conflict between the statutes involved and the provisions of the charter of the City; and that, if there be any conflict, the statutes and the charter must be read in the light of the purposes for which they were enacted, and the conflict resolved to give effect to both, if that can be reasonably done.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The City contends that it has the right, both under the general law and under the provisions of its charter, a special law, to construct and operate its penal institution in the County, without complying with any zoning ordinance adopted by the County; and that the power delegated to the City does conflict with the zoning power of the County, and the conflict should be resolved in favor of the City, because of the provisions of Code, \u00a7 15-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In determining the respective rights of the City and County, a consideration is required of the following statutes and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In Title 15, Code of 1950, entitled \u201cCounties, Cities and Towns,\u201d \u00a7 15-8 (5), of Chapter 1, dealing with the general powers of boards of supervisors, it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u201cIn addition to the powers conferred by other sections, the board of supervisors of every county shall have power:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">* * * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\">(5) To adopt such measures as they may deem expedient to secure and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of their respective counties, not inconsistent with the general laws of this State. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">Code, \u00a7 15-10 (1) further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-14\">\u201cThe boards of supervisors of counties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-15\">(1) Adjoining and abutting any city, within-or without the State, having a population of one hundred and twenty-five thousand or more, * * *, are hereby vested with the same powers and authority as the councils of cities and towns by virtue of the Constitution of the State of Virginia or the acts of the General Assembly passed in pursuance thereof, * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">The County of Henrico adjoins the City of Richmond, which has a population exceeding 125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Title 15, Chapter 24, Article 3, \u00a7 15-855, under the title \u201cZoning in Certain Counties,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201cFor the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community, the board of supervisors of any county:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">#######</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201cAdjoining a city having a population of one hundred thousand or more,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">#######</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cmay regulate by ordinance and restrict</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArB\">####*##</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201cthe location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Then follows \u00a7 15-856, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-12\">\u201cFor any or all of such purposes the board of supervisors may divide the county into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of this article and within such districts it may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">Code, \u00a7 15-686, Chapter 21 requires that the council of every city shall provide a jail, the cost thereof, and the land on which it may be erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">Code, \u00a7 15-6 (3) gives every city and town authority to provide all buildings necessary for a prison house and work house, and to maintain and operate the same; but contains no requirement with respect to the location of such prison house.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">In Title 15, Chapter 1, \u00a7 15-2, the following provision is made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-16\">\u201cExcept when otherwise expressly provided, the provisions of this title shall in no wise repeal, amend, impair or affect any other power, right or privilege conferred on cities and towns by charter or any other provisions of the general law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-17\">Code, \u00a7 53-129 empowers the corporation court of any city to order jails erected and repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Code, \u00a7 53-195 as amended by Chapter 193 of the Acts of Assembly 1954, authorizes the governing body of any county or city of this State to establish and maintain a farm \u201cwithin their respective jurisdictions or elsewhere\u201d for \u201cany person convicted and sentenced to confinement in the jail of such city * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Chapter 116 of Acts of Assembly, 1948, pages 175 <em>et seq., </em>provides a new charter for the City of Richmond. Section 203 of that charter provides that, in addition to the powers granted by other sections of the charter, the City shall have the power to \u201ccontrol and regulate the use and management of all property of the city, real and personal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Section 2.04 (c) authorizes the City to \u201cprovide for * * * the regulation of the use of parks, playgrounds, * <em>* * </em>and other public property, whether located within or without the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Charter \u00a7 2.05 (e) authorizes the City \u201cto establish, maintain and operate, within or without the City, a jail for the confinement of prisoners, ordered or sentenced to be confined therein and a jail farm, * * *\u201d Acts 1948, page 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Section 17-10 authorizes the City to adopt a comprehensive zoning plan, (Acts of Assembly, 1948, page 250) and \u00a7 17-16 prescribes the appointment of a board of zoning appeals by the judge of the Hustings Court of the City of Richmond. Acts of Assembly, 1948, page 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Section 17.20 (c) specifically prescribes the powers and duties of the board of zoning appeals in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\u201cTo permit, when reasonably necessary in the public interest, the use of land, or the construction or use of buildings or structures, in any district in which they are prohibited by the ordinance, by any agency of the city, county or state or the United States, provided such construction or use shall adequately safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the occupants of the adjoining and surrounding property, shall not unreasonably impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, shall not increase congestion in streets and shall not increase public danger from fire or otherwise affect public safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The County bases its contention upon the general statutes. The City bases its right under the general law and the special act.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Section 65 of the Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">\u201cThe General Assembly may,x by general laws, confer upon the boards of supervisors of counties, and the councils of cities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>towns, such powers of local and special legislation as it may, from time to time, deem expedient, not inconsistent, with the limitations contained in this Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In Virginia, counties and cities are independent of each other politically, govemmentally and geographically. Each of them, within its particular boundaries, is a coequal political subdivision and agency of the State.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In <em>Donable </em>v. <em>Harrisonburg, </em>104 Va. 533, 535, 52 S. E. 174, we approved the following statement from Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Section 89:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201c \u2018It is a general and undisputed proposition of law that a municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers and no others: First, those granted in express words; second, those necessarily or fairly implied in or incidental to the powers expressly granted; third, those essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient but indispensable. Any fair, reasonable doubt concerning the existence of the power is resolved by the courts against the corporation and the power is denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>93 Va. 711; 25 S. E. 1001, 57 Am. St. Rep. 822; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>94 Va. 204, 26 S. E. 586, 36 L. R. A. 554; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Dameron, </em>95 Va. 545, 28 S.

E. 276:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-11\">\u201c \u2018The general rule is that a municipal corporation has no extraterritorial powers; but the rule is not without exceptions. The legislature has undoubted authority to confer upon cities and towns jurisdiction for sanitary and police purposes in territory contiguous to the corporation * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">\u201c \u2018The power of a municipality, unlike that of the state legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>must be exercised pursuant to an express grant, and in the particular manner prescribed if one is specified. <em>South Hill </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>177 Va. 154, 163, 12 S. E. 2d 770; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>94 Va. 204, 26 S. E. 586, 36 L. R.

E. 2d 804.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\u201cThe doctrine that a special act should be construed as an exception to the general law is not to be invoked unless the two acts cannot be harmonized or reconciled in any other way.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>146 Va. 113, 125, 136 S. E. 186.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In <em>Scott </em>v. Lichford 164 Va. 419, 422, 180 S. E. 393, this is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIK\">\u201cRepeal by implication is not favored, and the firmly established principle of law is that where two statutes are in apparent conflict, it is the duty of the court, if it be reasonably possible, to give to them such a construction as will give force and effect to each.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In <em>South Norfolk </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>190 Va. 591, 601, 58 S. E. 2d 32, we said that \u201ca later act does not by implication repeal an earlier act unless there is such a clear, manifest, controlling, necessary, positive, unavoidable, and irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy, that the two acts cannot, by a fair and reasonable construction, be reconciled,\u201d and on page 602, 190 Va., <em>supra, </em>we further said: <em>\u201c* * </em>* that where two statutes are passed by the same session of the legislature, as was the case here, that fact furnishes strong evidence that they were intended to stand together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">See M. J., Statutes, \u00a7 40, page 294 and 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 547, page 553; <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Va. 1003, 1008, 76 S. E. 2d 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">It is a well established rule of construction that full force and effect must be given to each provision of statutory law. It must clearly appear that the statute is in conflict with a former statute and that the two are so inconsistent that both cannot prevail before the prior statute may be held to be repealed or inoperative. Apparent inconsistencies must be reconciled if reasonably possible. Repeal of a statute by implication is not favored. <em>Nexsen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>142 Va. 313, 320, 128 S. E. 570; <em>Bray </em>v. <em>County Board, </em>195 Va. 31, 77 S. E. 2d 479; <em>County of Fairfax </em>v. <em>Alexandria, </em>193 Va. 82, 68 S. E. 2d 101. The same rule applies to statutes enacted at the same session of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Code, \u00a7 15-855, formerly \u00a7 1, Chapter 15, of the Acts of Assembly, 1927, as amended, was amended and reenacted by Chapter 133, Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of Assembly, 1948, approved March 5, 1948, the date of approval of the charter of' the City of Richmond, Chapter 116, Acts, 1948, page 175. The last sentence of \u00a7 3034 of Code of Virginia, 1919, was recodified as \u00a7 15-2 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, by an Act of the General Assembly, approved April 6, 1948. Thus, the charter of the City of Richmond, the County\u2019s power to zone, and \u00a7 15-2, Code of Virginia, 1950, were all approved at the same session of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In <em>Wicker Apartments </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>199 Va. 263, 99 S. E. 2d 656, we gave effect both to the statutes empowering the City to establish a jail and to the zoning ordinance of the City. We held that before the City of Richmond could make use of its land within its boundaries and construct buildings thereon for a detention home for juveniles, it must apply for and obtain a permit from its board of zoning appeals, (Charter \u00a7\u00a7 17.16 and 17.20 (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The purpose of zoning by a county is the same as that by a city, that is, to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community, to protect and conserve the value of buildings and encourage the most appropriate use of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The statutes relied on by the City give it the right to establish a jail beyond its corporate limits and no more. They protect the City in the performance of an extraterritorial Act, which might otherwise be <em>ultra vires. </em>They do not, however, expressly or impliedly authorize the City to establish a penal institution at any place, inside or outside of the City, in violation of the zoning ordinance of such place. Had the legislature intended that the City should have such right, it would have said so in the enactments conferring the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">We find no conflict between the statutes giving the County the right to enact zoning laws and those authorizing the City to maintain and operate a penal institution outside of its boundaries. Each of them, by a fair and reasonable construction, can be given full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Nor do we find anything in the legislative history of Code, \u00a7 15-2 which supports the claim of the City that this section exempts it from compliance with the zoning ordinance of the County. The ordinance of the County does not take away, impair, or amend the right of the City to establish its jail beyond the limits of the City. The City may establish its jail or jail farm in the district of the County within which such institutions are permissible, or it may follow the procedure prescribed in the ordinance of the County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>and request an amendment of the ordinance to permit the use of its land for the desired purpose. From arbitrary or unreasonable action by zoning officers of the County, it may apply for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We find it difficult to believe that the legislature intended that a city should be subject to its own zoning regulations, but free from similar regulations in a county in the exercise of the extraterritorial power'to establish a jail beyond its borders. Surely the legislature did not intend to give a city power to establish a jail or jail farm in any residential area outside of a city, in violation of laws designed to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the inhabitants of such area.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In support of its contention, the City cites and relies upon textbook authorities and some cases from other jurisdictions, holding that the Federal Government, States, municipalities, and other political subdivisions are not bound by the requirements of a zoning ordinance, especially when the proposed use does not constitute a nuisance, and where the buildings are for government purposes and not merely for proprietary purposes. In most of the cases cited, the decisions depend upon the peculiar laws of the State involved and the facts to which they are applicable. In none are the facts stated identical with those here. We do not think that the holding of the authorities cited by the City is controlling under the peculiar facts of the case before us, which must be determined in accordance with long settled rules of construction adopted in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">For the reasons stated, the decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-13\">Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>162 Va. 64J, 174 S.
