Upon its appearing to the Commission that applicants had taken proper steps to bring the application for the transfer of the certificate to its attention, the Commission set the case for hearing on October 16, 1956. It ordered the applicants to cause notice to be published in the newspapers of the city of Harrisonburg and town of Broadway, and served upon the persons designated by law. On the date set for hearing, no one appeared in opposition to the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">D. W. Fawley, president of Fawley Motor Lines, Incorporated, testified that his company had been engaged in the motor vehicle transportation business since 1917; that it had agreed, subject to the approval of the Commission, to purchase certificate No. HG-52 from McDaniel Transfer Company; that his company\u2019s equipment had been approved by the State Highway Commission, and that it proposed to adopt the present tariffs of the McDaniel Transfer Company then on file with the Commission and to conduct operations under the certificate in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Commission, if the requested transfer received the Commission\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The evidence also shows that during the past ten years there has been a substantial increase in population and business in the city of Harrisonburg and the county of Rockingham, and that the proposed transferee desired to purchase all the rights of the then holder of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">At the conclusion of the testimony the presiding officer of the Commission stated from the bench that \u201cthe application is granted as applied for.\u201d However, the Commission\u2019s final order is not in accord with this statement. That order, subsequently entered on October 16, 1956, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cFrom the testimony before the Commission, it appears that the public convenience and necessity requires the services of a household goods carrier between the City of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County on the one hand and all points in Virginia on the other hand and the transfer of the certificate is proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201cIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED, That the transfer of the cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tificate is approved upon the filing of proper insurance and upon the adoption of tariffs or the publication of new tariffs as required by Chapter 12.1, Title 56, Code of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, That a new certificate of convenience and necessity -for the transportation of household goods by motor vehicle between the City of Harrisonburg and the County of Rockingham on the one hand and all points in Virginia on the other hand be issued to Fawley Motor Lines, Incorporated, and that certificate HG-52 be cancelled upon the issuance of a new certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">From this order applicants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The holder of the old certificate, No. HG-52, was authorized to \u201cengage in the business of a household goods carrier * * * over regular and irregular routes between all points within this State.\u201d Code, \u00a7 56-338.8. Under the Commission\u2019s order, the new certificate authorizes the transferee to transport household goods only to, and from, a definite point, that is, \u201cbetween the City of Harrisonburg and the County of Rockingham on the one hand and all points in Virginia on the other hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Appellants contend that on the evidence presented, the Commission had no power to suspend, revoke, alter or amend the old certificate and issue a new certificate therefor, limiting and restricting the operations of the transferee to, and from, a definite point in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The same issue was before this Court in <em>Cook Transfer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 384, 83 S. E. 2d 733. The facts in that case were that Cook Transfer, with its principal office in Covington, Virginia, held a certificate of convenience and necessity to transport by motor vehicle, as a household goods carrier, household goods between any and all points within the Commonwealth. Cook Transfer, the transferor, and the Greyvan Storage of Virginia, the transferee, with its principal office in Richmond, filed an application, similar to the one filed in this case, requesting the Commission to approve the transfer. The Commission made the same disposition of that case which it did of this; that is, it cancelled the old certificate and issued a new certificate altering and amending the old certificate by limiting and restricting the operations of the transferee between Covington and all points in Virginia. We held that the Commission exceeded its power in cancelling the old certificate and issuing a new certificate restricting the transferee\u2019s operations to, and from, a definite point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>reversed its order and remanded the case for the entry of a final order in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The Commission in its opinion, and in the brief filed in its behalf in this Court, argues that the decision in the <em>Cook </em>case is not controlling in this case because an amendment of Code, \u00a7 56-338.14, made in 1956, changed the statutory law applied in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The original statute, construed in the <em>Cook </em>case, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMr\">\u201cAny such certificate may be transferred or leased subject to the approval of the Commission, and under such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Commission. The application shall be made jointly by the transferor and transferee, seller and purchaser, or assignor and assignee, or lessor and lessee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The statute as amended in 1956, with the added words italicized, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cAny such certificate may be transferred or leased <em>if the Commission after a public hearing shall find the proposed transfer or lease justified by public convenience and </em>necessity, and under such reasonable rules, regulations, <em>and restrictions </em>as may be prescribed by the Commission. The application shall be made jointly by the transferor and transferee, seller and purchaser, or assignor and assignee, or lessor and lessee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">This section, before the amendment, was section 7 of chapter 532 of the Acts of 1948, which chapter defines \u201cHousehold Goods Carriers\u201d and provides for their regulation, supervision, control, etc. The Act is codified in the 1950 Code as sections 56-338.1 through 56-338.18, and deals exclusively with \u201cHousehold Goods Carriers.\u201d Such carriers are defined in Code, \u00a7 56-338.1 (e) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201c \u2018Household goods carrier\u2019 means any person who or which undertakes whether directly or by a lease or other arrangement, to transport \u2018household goods\u2019, as hereinafter defined, by motor vehicle for compensation, on any highway in this State, between two or more points in this State, whether over regular or irregular routes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3j\">Code, \u00a7 56-338.8 provides: \u201cNo person, not herein exempted, shall engage in motor vehicle transportation of household goods, as herein defined, for compensation on any highway within the State, unless and until he has obtained from the Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a household goods carrier. Such certificate <em>shall authorize </em>the holder to engage in the business of a household goods carrier, as herein defined, <em>over regular and irregular routes between all points within this State </em>and, subject to approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of vehicles by the State Highway Commission as provided by \u00a7 56-338.9, <em>on all of the highways of this State.\u201d </em>(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Commission held and in its brief contended in the <em>Cook </em>case that the foregoing section was modified by \u00a7 56-338.11, under which the legislature had delegated to it the power, on an original application, to limit and restrict the scope of operations of a household goods carrier to, and from, a definite point in the State. That section reads as follows: <em>\u201cHearing and </em>determination.\u2014Upon the filing of an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a household goods carrier, the Commission shall, within a reasonable time, fix a time and place of hearing of such application. If the Commission shall find the proposed operation justified by public convenience and necessity, it shall issue a certificate to the applicant, subject to such terms, limitations and restrictions as the Commission may deem proper. If the Commission shall find the proposed operation not justified, the application shall be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We rejected this contention of the Commission in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cIt is held by the Commission in its written opinion which has been adopted bv the Commonwealth as the major part of its brief, that this clear nrovision as to the scope of the certificate is Qualified by 5 56-338.11, authorizing the initial issuance of a certificate. Since this section provides in part, \u2018* * <em>* </em>If the Commission shall find the proposed operation justified by public convenience and necessity, it shall issue a certificate to the applicant, subject to such terms, limitations and restrictions as the Commission may deem proper. * * *\u2019, it is argued that the Commission can place in an original certificate any reasonable \u2018limitations and restrictions\u2019 it deems proper, including a restriction as to point of origin. It is further contended that as \u00a7 56-338.14, which authorizes the transfer of a certificate, provides \u2018any such certificate may be transferred or leased subject to the approval of the Commission, and under such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Commission\u2019, that the two sections read together impliedly give the Commission the right to issue a new certificate to a transferee and to place reasonable limitations and restrictions therein which were not incorporated in the original certificate. We cannot agree with either conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201c* * * The Act, as we have shown, does not require a point of origin to be specified therein and, in our opinion, no such designation is contemplated by the Act. The Commission is not concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the route or routes to be employed by household goods carriers. The legislature has specified that \u2018such certificate shall authorize the holder to engage in the business * * * between <em>all points </em>within this State and <em>* </em>* * on <em>all </em>of the highways of this State.\u2019 (Italics supplied).\u201d 196 Va., at page 388.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Appellants applied for the transfer of an unrestricted and unlimited certificate of public convenience and necessity as a household goods carrier. We agree with the Commission that the evidence in this case \u201cmade a case similar to the case of <em>Cook Transfer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth,\" </em>but we do not agree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the 1956 amendment of Code, \u00a7 56-338.14 so changed the statute as to give it the power to alter and amend the original certificate, No. HG-52, by limiting and restricting the transferee\u2019s operations to, and from, a definite point.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The general rule is that in the construction of a statute the court will look to the whole body of the Act to determine the true intention of each part. All of its parts must be examined so as to make it harmonious if possible. <em>Mason and Dixon Lines </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 877, 41 S. E. 2d 16; 17 Michie\u2019s Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 41, p. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Code, \u00a7 56-338.12 provides that: \u201cCertificates issued pursuant to this chapter shall be effective from the dates specified therein and shall remain in effect until terminated as herein provided.\u201d It then states the conditions upon the violation of which the Commission may impose a fine, or suspend, revoke, alter or amend the certificate, and concludes: \u201cNo such certificate shall be suspended, revoked, altered or amended for any cause not stated in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">It is not charged that the holder of certificate No. HG-52 violated any of the conditions stated in the statute. However, if the order of the Commission stands the certificate would be materially altered and amended, which would be in violation of the statute and contrary to our previous construction of the whole Act, as stated in the <em>Cook </em>case, thus: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>cated therein, with the hamlet designated as the point of origin. Even this would not answer the needs of citizens living in remote rural sections; such citizens would have no choice except to use the services of unregulated carriers who \u2018occasionally or infrequently\u2019 engage in the transportation of household goods and are exempted from the operation of the Act under subsection (d) of \u00a7 56-338.2.\u201d 196 Va., at page 392.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\u201cThe nature of the business transacted by a household goods carrier and the wording of the Act negative the Commission\u2019s right to specify a point of origin as was done in the instant case. As stated, the Act provides that such carrier may operate between <em>all points </em>in this State and over <em>all </em>of the highways of the State. Such phraseology does not contemplate a point of origin. If it be mandatory that a point of origin be required, it would be necessary for every hamlet in Virginia to have a certificated household goods carrier lo-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Code, \u00a7 56-338.6 provides that the Act dealing with household goods carriers shall be controlling, and \u201cno laws in conflict herewith, or inconsistent herewith, shall have any application to such carriers.\u201d No certificate is required of a person who desires to serve only local needs of any city or town in the Commonwealth, or to infrequent transfers of household goods to any lesser distance than thirty miles. Code, \u00a7 56-338.2. The Act as a whole is designed to permit the holder of a certificate as a household goods carrier, to transfer the property defined, by motor vehicle for compensation, on any highway and between all points in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The amendment in question did change the existing law relating to the transfer of a certificate under the Household Goods Carriers Act. The statute, without the amendment, gave the Commission power to approve the transfer of such certificate under such reasonable rules and regulations as the Commission might prescribe. It did not require a public hearing on the application for a proposed transfer or that the proposed transfer must be ascertained to be justified by public convenience and necessity. The amendment provides that a certificate may be transferred only after, (1) a public hearing, and (2) after a finding by the Commission that the proposed transfer is justified by public convenience and necessity. There is nothing in the title to the amendment or in the amendment itself to indicate a legislative intent to delegate to the Commission the power to restrict or limit an unrestricted and unlimited certificate of convenience and necessity of a household goods carrier to, and from, a definite point.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Code, \u00a7 56-338.14, as amended, is couched in substantially the language of Code, \u00a7 56-338.11, applicable to original applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity as household goods carriers. The latter section requires the Commission to hold a public hearing on an original application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and provides: \u201cIf the Commission shall find the proposed operation justified by public convenience and necessity, it shall issue a certificate to the applicant, subject to such terms, lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>itations and restrictions as the Commission may deem proper.\u201d And Code, \u00a7 56-338.14, as amended, relating to the transfer or lease of such certificate, provides that, \u201cAny such certificate [an original certificate] may be transferred or leased if the Commission after a public hearing shall find the proposed transfer or lease justified by public convenience and necessity, and under such reasonable rules, regulations, and restrictions as may be prescribed by the Commission.\u201d Thus, the provisions of the Act requiring a public hearing and a finding by the Commission that the application is justified by public convenience and necessity were formerly applicable only to an original application for a certificate of convenience and necessity. The 1956 amendment of Code, \u00a7 56-338.14 makes such provisions applicable to the transfer of such certificate. Likewise, the notice required on the hearing of an application to transfer a certificate is the same as that required on an original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The language of Code, \u00a7 56-338.11 was construed in the <em>Cook </em>case, <em>supra, </em>where we expressly held that it gave the Commission no authority to limit or restrict an original certificate to, and from, a definite point within the State. The legislature is presumed and deemed by the courts to have used the language under consideration in its judicially established meaning in the absence of anything to indicate a different intention. <em>Richmond </em>v. Sutherland, 114 Va. 688, 77 S. E. 470; 17 Michie\u2019s Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 86, p. 350. This presumption is conclusive \u201cwhere the object to which the words are applied, or the connection in which it stands, does not require it to be differently understood in the two statutes, or where a contrary intention of the legislature is not made clear by other qualifying or explanatory terms.\u201d 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 322, p. 314. See also, <em>Noblin </em>v. <em>Randolph Corp., </em>180 Va. 345, 23 S. E. 2d 209; <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp., </em>186 Va. 116, 41 S. E. 2d 469; <em>Masters </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>189 Va. 969, 55 S. E. 2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">To hold as the Commission contends would result in irreconcilable conflict in the meaning of the same language used in different sections of the same Act. The construction resulting in no conflict should be adopted where a statute lends itself to two constructions, one of which will result in irreconcilable conflict between its provisions and the other will result in no conflict. <em>Ebbert </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>123 W. Va. 385, 15 S. E. 2d 583; 17 Michie\u2019s Jur., Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 80, 86 and 87, pp. 343, 350 and 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Inasmuch as we have decided that the written order of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>mission is erroneous and must be reversed, it is unnecessary to discuss appellant\u2019s second contention, namely, that the verbal opinion of the Commission announced at the conclusion of the evidence is in conflict with its written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The Commission erred in its refusal to transfer certificate No. HG-52 to Fawley Motor Lines, Incorporated, as requested by appellants. Therefore, the order entered on October 16, 1956 is reversed and annulled, and the case remanded to the Commission for the entry of a final order in accordance with the principles herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
