In particular, BCW appeals the court\u2019s decision that the Closing Agreement did not allow BCW to use its actual 1987 data, rather than the estimate it computed at the beginning of 1987, to calculate its \u201cunpaid loss reserve\u201d for 1987. We <em>reverse </em>the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and <em>remand </em>for consideration of extrinsic evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b907-21\">In 1993, BCW and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settled a tax dispute by entering into the Closing Agreement that is now before this court. The details of the dispute resolved by the Closing Agreement are discussed in the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 opinion. <em>See Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United of Wisc. &amp; Subsidiaries v. United States, </em>56 Fed.Cl. 697, 698-99 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-22\">The Closing Agreement contains the following paragraph, with the language most relevant to this appeal underlined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>(3) As of January 1, 1987, the taxpayer was an \u201cExisting Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization\u201d as this term is defined in subparagraph (c)(2) of section 833, Subtitle A, IRC. As <em>such, the folloiuing attributes apply to the taxpayer as of that date:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-4\">(a) if otherwise in compliance with the terms of THE TREG, the taxpayer may participate in the filing of the \u201cnew group election\u201d cited in subparagraph (d)(5)(v) of THE TREG;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">(b) the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income will be computed pursuant to the provisions of section 833, Subtitle A, IRC, and the \u201cspecial rules for Existing Blue Cross or Blue Shield organizations\u201d stated in section 1012(C)(3) of the TRA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">(c) the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income will be computed without the reduction in \u201cunearned premium reserves\u201d otherwise required by section 832, Subtitle A, IRC;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">(d) the taxpayer is not \u2014 solely because of its becoming, on January 1, 1987, an \u201cExisting Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization\u201d as this term is defined in subparagraph (c)(2) of section 833, Subtitle A, IRC \u2014 subject to the adjustments set forth in section 481, Subtitle A, IRC;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-8\">(e) <em>the taxpayer\u2019s January 1, 1987 loss reserve for incurred-but-not-paid claims will be determined in accordance with actual claims paid data for 1987; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">(f) for the purposes of section 1011, Subtitle A, IRC, the adjusted bases of all the taxpayer\u2019s assets shall be the respective fair market value of the individual assets as of January 1,1987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaaL\">(emphases added). Further, paragraph (4) of the Closing Agreement states that BCW was \u201cdeemed to have the following net operating loss carryovers, no elements of which are deemed to be attributable to any specific loss or deduction\u201d; the enumerated net operating loss carryovers for 1984, 1985, and 1986 sum to $25,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Pursuant to its interpretation of the Closing Agreement, BCW computed its unpaid loss reserve<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for 1987 to be $42,267,000, based on the claims it actually paid out during that year. The use of actual claims paid figures was a departure from what the Government contends is the ordinary practice, in which Blue Cross organizations use the estimate generated at the start of a given year to calculate their deductions. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 846(b)(1) (2000). (For purposes of this appeal, BCW does not challenge the Government\u2019s claim that the Internal Revenue Code ordinarily mandates the use of the estimate.) At the beginning of 1987, BCW had overestimated its unpaid loss reserve by a considerable margin in comparison with the amount it ultimately paid out during that year. Therefore, BCW\u2019s deduction derived from the actual claims paid data was approximately $37,000,000 greater than it would have been based on the estimate. The IRS ultimately ordered BCW to pay the larger amount derived from the use of the estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">BCW filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a refund of the difference between its tax liability calculated using the estimate and its liability de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>rived from the actual claims paid figures. Both parties moved for partial summary judgment regarding the method that BCW should use to calculate its losses incurred deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In support of their motions, the parties advanced their respective interpretations of the Closing Agreement. BCW asserted that the Closing Agreement unambiguously permitted the company to use its actual claims paid data to calculate its 1987 deduction under \u00a7 832(c)(4). The Government contended that the Closing Agreement had to be viewed in the context of the negotiations that led to its signing, which show that the IRS never agreed to any change in BCW\u2019s \u00a7 832(c)(4) deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Holding that the language of the agreement had an unambiguous meaning, the court declined to rely on the extrinsic evidence put forth by the parties. In the court\u2019s view, the provisions of paragraph (3) were a laundry list of characteristics that applied to BCW under \u00a7 833 because it was, as the agreement declared, an \u201cexisting Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization\u201d as of January 1, 1987. The court reasoned that the words \u201c[a]s such,\u201d which appear after \u201cexisting Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization, as this term is defined in subparagraph (c)(2) of section 833, Subtitle A, IRC[,]\u201d indicate that the information that follows is simply a list of attributes of such an organization. According to the court, \u201c[\u2018as such\u2019] can only be interpreted to mean that, as an entity qualifying under IRC \u00a7 833, the plaintiff has the following attributes.\u201d <em>Blue Cross, </em>56 Fed. Cl. at 714. Moreover, \u00a7 833 is the only code section that is mentioned in the introduction to paragraph (3), and, in the court\u2019s view, the other provisions of paragraph (3) all relate to \u00a7 833 or Tax Reform Act \u00a7 1012, which is the public law that enacted \u00a7 833. Thus, the use of \u201c[a]s such,\u201d the mention of \u00a7 833 alone in the introduction to paragraph (3), and the apparent relationship of all the other provisions of paragraph (3) to \u00a7 833 convinced the Court of Federal Claims that paragraph (3)(e) must have referred to \u00a7 833. The court further explained that, specifically, paragraph (3)(e) referred to the \u201cspecial deduction\u201d available to Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations under \u00a7 833(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">The court entered final judgment against BCW after the company stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>to dismissal of the remaining issues. BCW filed a timely appeal to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">BCW appeals the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States, which was based on the court\u2019s interpretation of the Closing Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Contract interpretation is an issue of law that this court reviews <em>de novo. Giove v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>230 F.3d 1333, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>Metric Constructors, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Aeronautics &amp; Space Admin., </em>169 F.3d 747, 751 (Fed.Cir.1999). The court also reviews a grant of summary judgment by the Court of Federal Claims <em>de novo. Berkley v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 1076, 1083 (Fed.Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">B. Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">BCW argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred in holding that paragraph (3)(e) of the Closing Agreement unambiguously refers to I.R.C. \u00a7 833(b). It asserts that the record clearly establishes that neither party intended that paragraph to refer to \u00a7 833(b), and that therefore such an interpretation is impermissible. BCW further claims that the only reasonable conclusion to draw from the extrinsic evidence is that the IRS, like BCW, understood (or should have understood) paragraph (3)(e) to refer to the \u00a7 832(c)(4) losses incurred deduction. Likewise, BCW says, the Closing Agreement on its face unambiguously implicates \u00a7 832(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">The Government defends the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 view that the contractual language of paragraph (3)(e), on its face, cannot reasonably be understood to refer to \u00a7 832(c)(4) and must instead refer to \u00a7 833. Alternatively, the Government contends, extrinsic evidence of negotiations establishes that paragraph (3)(e) concerns \u00a7 833, not \u00a7 832(c)(4). These negotiations were directed toward resolving whether BCW was tax-exempt in 1985 and 1986. According to the Government, the subject of \u201closses incurred\u201d deductions never came up in those negotiations. And, although the Government apparently concedes that BCW intended paragraph (3)(e) to refer to \u00a7 832(c)(4), it argues that BCW kept that understanding secret from the IRS in an effort to \u201chornswoggle\u201d the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">This case is principally a matter of contract interpretation. Closing agreements are interpreted pursuant to general principles of contract law. <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, </em>42 Fed.Cl. 267, 274 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-18\">1. Plain Meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">Where contractual language is unambiguous, extrinsic evidence plays no role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>determining the contract\u2019s meaning. <em>Coast Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1035, 1037 (Fed.Cir.2003). \u201cA contract is ambiguous only when it is susceptible to two reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>A-Transport Northwest Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1576, 1584 (Fed.Cir.1994). In the event that a contract has two or more reasonable interpretations, extrinsic evidence can be relied upon to determine the parties\u2019 intentions at the time of contract formation. <em>See Sylvania Elec. Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>198 Ct.Cl. 106, 458 F.2d 994, 1005 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We hold that the contractual language at issue here is ambiguous. We understand the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 reliance on the phrase \u201c[a]s such,\u201d but we are unable to accord it the same level of clarity \u2014 in our view, this phrase is commonly, but not always, used to introduce a series of characteristics that necessarily apply to a previously mentioned thing (here, an \u201cexisting Blue Cross or Blue Shield organization\u201d) simply because it is that thing. Occasionally, the phrase is used in a way that does not introduce necessarily applicable characteristics. It can be used in a manner akin to \u201cbearing that in mind,\u201d or similar phrases, to indicate that what follows happens to be a characteristic of the previously mentioned thing, but is not necessarily so simply by virtue of being that thing. It can also be used as an essentially generic transitional phrase.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the phrase may have the meaning the court gave it, or it may not \u2014 it is ambiguous and does not mandate a particular interpretation of paragraph (3)(e). Moreover, reasonable minds could disagree with the court\u2019s construction of paragraph (3)(e)\u2019s reference to \u201cincurred-but-not-paid claims\u201d as connected to \u00a7 833(b), because the concept of \u201cincurred-but-not-paid claims\u201d is clearly, albeit indirectly, involved in \u00a7 832. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 832(c) (2000) (\u201cIn computing the taxable income of an insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 831, there shall be allowed as deductions ... losses incurred, as defined in subsection (b)(5) of this section .... \u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 832(b)(5) (defining \u201closses incurred\u201d to include discounted unpaid losses outstanding at the end of the taxable year minus discounted unpaid losses outstanding at the end of the previous taxable year); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 846 (providing that \u201cdiscounted unpaid losses\u201d are derived from \u201cundiscounted unpaid losses,\u201d which are \u201cthe unpaid losses shown in the annual statement\u201d \u2014 i.e., the estimate of incurred-but-not-paid claims, adjusted for expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">On the other hand, we also are not persuaded by BCW\u2019s contention that paragraph (3)(e) unambiguously empowers it to calculate its unpaid loss reserve for its \u00a7 832(c)(4) deduction based on actual claims paid data. Paragraph (3) mentions \u00a7 833 and describes several of the statute\u2019s provisions, while it makes no mention of \u00a7 832 and is arguably at odds with both the \u201c[a]s such\u201d language and the specified $25,000,000 deduction in paragraph (4). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>fact, even BCW suggests the need to turn to extrinsic evidence when it asserts that \u201c[t]he language of the contract \u2018must be given that meaning that would be derived from the contract by a reasonably intelligent person <em>acquainted with the contemporaneous circumstances.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Nonetheless, our opinion is not based on BCW\u2019s present belief about the clarity of the agreement, whatever it may be, but on the agreement itself. For the reasons indicated above, we hold that the agreement is facially unclear and must be construed in light of extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">2. Extrinsic Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">On remand, one issue before the court will be the meaning that should be attributed to the Closing Agreement in light of the extrinsic evidence. Both parties have presented a considerable amount of extrinsic evidence to this court in their briefs. For example, BCW points out that it insisted on the inclusion of paragraph (3) during the negotiations. However, if paragraph (3)(e) referred to I.R.C. \u00a7 833(b), then that contract provision would have <em>decreased </em>BCW\u2019s deduction, and BCW would never have pressed for a provision that had such an effect. The Government, meanwhile, offers the correspondence between BCW and the IRS during negotiations to show that the IRS negotiator was never given reason to think that paragraph (3)(e) referred to \u00a7 832(c)(4). Our point here is not to give credence to the extrinsic evidence of one side or the other; that is not our role in this type of appeal. Instead, we simply hold that the contract is ambiguous and that the matter must be remanded for consideration of the extrinsic evidence by the trier of fact. <em>See, e.g., Beta Sys., Inc. v. United States, </em>838 F.2d 1179, 1183 (Fed.Cir.1988); 4 S. Williston, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 616 (3d ed. 1961) (\u201cThe general rule is that interpretation of a writing is for the court.... Where, however, the meaning of a writing is uncertain or ambiguous, and parol evidence is introduced in aid of its interpretation, the question of its meaning should be left to the jury.\u201d); 3 A.L. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 554 (1960) (\u201cThe question of interpretation of language and conduct\u2014 the question of what is the meaning that should be given by a court to the words of a contract, is a question of fact, not a question of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">In interpreting the Closing Agreement on remand, the court may also wish to consider whether BCW knew or should have known of the IRS\u2019s interpretation of the agreement when it was concluded. The meaning the IRS assigns to paragraph (3)(e) could prevail if, at the time the agreement was made, BCW knew or should have known how the IRS understood the provision and did nothing to correct that misunderstanding. <em>Perry &amp; Wallis, Inc. v. United States, </em>192 Ct.Cl. 310, 427 F.2d 722, 725 (1970); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 201(2) (1981); <em>see also HPI/GSA 3C, LLC v. Perry, </em>364 F.3d 1327, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2004) (characterizing the rule that \u201ca party that enters without objection into a contract with knowledge of the other party\u2019s reasonable interpretation is bound by that interpretation\u201d as \u201can unassailable rule of contract law\u201d). Some information presented by the IRS suggests that this may have been the case. However, based on the evidence before us, we are unable to determine what BCW knew or should have known when the closing agreement was signed. That determination is for the Court of Federal Claims to make on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">It is also possible that, on remand, the extrinsic evidence will show neither that the parties shared a common understanding of the Closing Agreement nor that BCW had reason to know of the IRS\u2019s interpretation of it and did nothing to correct that understanding. In such a case, the Restatement prescribes that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>side\u2019s interpretation controls. <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 201(3). \u201cThe result may be an entire failure of agreement or a failure to agree as to a term. There may be a binding contract despite failure to agree as to a term, if the term is not essential or if it can be supplied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 201, cmt. (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In the event that the evidence on remand shows that there was a failure of assent regarding paragraph (3)(e), there are three possible outcomes. If paragraph (3)(e) is not essential, the remainder of the agreement stands. If it is essential, either the court can supply a term that is \u201creasonable in the cireumstances[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 204, or, if that is not feasible, then the entire agreement fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment for the United States and remand for consideration of extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-15\">. On remand, the Court of Federal Claims may, of course, continue to consider intrinsic evidence in conjunction with the extrinsic evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-10\">. \"Unpaid loss reserve\" refers to the amount of money the company will need to satisfy its incurred-but-not-paid claims, plus an estimate of the administrative costs to process these claims.
