The appellant was informed that his father was one of the targets of the grand jury\u2019s investigation. Santarelli subsequently filed a motion to quash the subpoena on several grounds, the one relevant to this appeal being the claim that a common law parent-child privilege is embodied in Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence which justified his refusal to testify. The motion was denied, and Santarelli was directed to appear on July 10. Santarelli appeared as ordered, but refused to answer all relevant questions, again invoking a parent-child privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-26\">In light of Santarelli\u2019s refusal to testify, the court conducted a contempt hearing. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested that a hearing be held to allow Santarelli to present evidence in support of a parent-child privilege. The district court held that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary, and found Santarelli in civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-27\">The sole issue in this appeal is characterized by the appellant as follows: \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the district court erred in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing concerning appellant\u2019s invocation of the parent-child privilege in response to a grand jury subpoena, and further erred in holding appellant in contempt for refusing to testify.\u201d The district court bottomed its conclusion that Santarelli\u2019s refusal to testify could not be based on a parent-child privilege, upon the former Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Starr), </em>647 F.2d 511 (5th Cir.1981). In <em>Starr, </em>the appellant was subpoened to testify before a grand jury concerning her mother and stepfather\u2019s involvement in a homicide. She refused to testify, and was held in contempt. On appeal, she justified her refusal to testify upon a parent-child privilege. The court of appeals rejected her claim: \u201cWe can find no federal judicial support or recognition of a \u2018parent-child\u2019 privilege, and decline to create one under the circumstances of the present appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">The holding in <em>Starr </em>is consistent with that of every court of appeals that has had occasion to address questions of family privilege outside the context of interspousal communications. <em>In re Matthews, </em>714 F.2d 223 (2d Cir.1983) (rejecting a privilege not to testify against one\u2019s in-laws); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>683 F.2d 817 (4th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. (Under Seal), </em>714 F.2d 347, 349 n. 4 (4th Cir.1983) (rejecting parent-child privilege); <em>United States v. Penn, </em>647 F.2d 876 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201cthere is no judicially or legislatively recognized general \u2018family\u2019 privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Santarelli seeks to avoid the binding effect of <em>Starr </em>on two grounds: first, that the appellant in <em>Starr </em>had failed to develop the facts necessary to sustain a successful claim of parent-child privilege, and second that the <em>Starr </em>court rejected the appellant\u2019s claim on the ground that there was \u201cno federal judicial support\u201d for a family privilege, but that since <em>Starr </em>was decided, two district courts have found that such a privilege exists. <em>See In re Agosto, </em>553 F.Supp. 1298 (D.Nev.1983); <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Greenberg), </em>11 Fed.R. Evid.Serv. 579 (D.Conn.1982). As previously noted, the Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits have uniformly declined to acknowledge the existence of a family privilege. In <em>Starr, </em>the former Fifth Circuit did likewise, and we are bound to follow. Given that no family privilege exists, the district court properly refused Santarelli\u2019s request to present evidence in support of his position that his claim to the privilege was justified. Santarelli\u2019s suggestion that the two district court\u2019s decisions rendered after <em>Starr </em>furnish judicial support for the creation of a privilege is ill-taken. In <em>In re Matthews, </em>714 F.2d 223, 224 (2d Cir.1983), the court made reference to the two district court decisions in question, and while refusing to comment on their propriety, characterized them as \u201cdepartures from the traditional rule in federal courts, that other than the spousal privilege, there is no privilege that permits a person not to testify against family members.\u201d In any event, this panel is bound by the decision in <em>Starr. </em>\u201cPrivileges against forced disclosure\u201d are \u201cexceptions to the demand for every man\u2019s evidence\u201d and are \u201cnot lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 709-10, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3108, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
