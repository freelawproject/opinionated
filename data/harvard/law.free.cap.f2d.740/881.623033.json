The district court held that they were, and on this basis, denied child\u2019s insurance benefits to two foster children. Holding that such payments are contributions toward a child\u2019s support under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416(e), we affirm the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>The facts of this case are not in dispute. Margaret Kelly and her husband, Thomas Kelly, operated a home for foster children in Connecticut. In 1966, the State of Connecticut placed the infants, Wayne and Kenneth Hays, in the Kellys\u2019 home. The boys have remained in the Kelly household since that initial placement. The State of Connecticut has provided $70.00 a week for the care of the boys under the state\u2019s foster care program.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Beginning as early as 1973, the Kellys expressed an interest in adopting Wayne and Kenneth. Three years later, state officials obtained a termination of parental rights from the boys\u2019 natural parents so that adoption by the Kellys could be possible. On June 30, 1978, Thomas Kelly died. On July 14, 1978, Margaret H. Kelly applied to the Social Security Administration for child\u2019s insurance benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(d) for the two children. On July 20, 1978, Margaret Kelly filed an agreement to adopt the two children. A little over a year later, on September 6, 1979, the adoption became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The Social Security Act provides insurance benefits to dependent children under the age of majority if a parent who is covered under the Act dies. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(d). A child adopted after the death of a covered individual is entitled to the same insurance benefits if the child was not \u201creceiving regular contributions toward his support from someone other than [the covered] individual or his spouse, or from any public or private welfare organization which furnishes services or assistance for children.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416(e). The sole issue in this case is whether the payments the Kellys received from Connecticut constituted regular contributions toward the support of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Margaret Kelly contends that the foster care payments fees were paid to foster parents for their services, not regular contributions for child support. As support for this proposition, she cites <em>Damon v. Secretary of HEW, </em>557 F.2d 31 (2d Cir. 1977). The issue in that case was whether foster care payments by the State of Vermont should be counted as support provided by the state or by the person caring for the child. Mr. and Mrs. Damon were raising a foster child and receiving foster care payments when Mrs. Damon became eligible for old age Social Security benefits. Subsequently, the Damons adopted the child. Under section 402(d)(8)(D)(ii) of the Social Security Act, a child adopted by an individual eligible for old age benefits is entitled to child\u2019s insurance benefits if among other things the child \u201cwas ... receiving at least one-half of his support from that individual ... for the year immediately before the month in which such individual became entitled to old-age insurance benefits____\u201d Over one-half of the</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Damons\u2019 foster child\u2019s support was provided by the foster care payments. After reviewing the Vermont law on foster care payments, the Second Circuit held that Vermont foster care payments are the property of the foster parents and thus the Damons provided over one-half of their foster child\u2019s support. The court was persuaded by Vermont statutory language describing foster care as a valuable consideration and the practice of Vermont officials of not requiring foster parents to account for the manner in which foster care payments are spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">An examination of Connecticut law reveals that even if the <em>Damon </em>court\u2019s property focus is correct, the foster care payments in this case are the property of the foster children. The Connecticut statute on foster care payments provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-10\">(1) <em>Expense of care and maintenance. </em>Said commissioner shall pay directly to person or persons furnishing goods or services determined by said commissioner to be necessary for the care and maintenance of such child the reasonable expense thereof, payment to be made at intervals determined by said commissioner____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 17-62(e). This statute clearly links the amount of foster care payments to the needs of the foster child. The payments are received for the child\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>In a carefully reasoned opinion, a federal district court in Connecticut has determined that foster children have a property interest in foster care payments. <em>Sockwell v. Maloney, </em>431 F.Supp. 1006, 1012 (D.Conn.1976), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>554 F.2d 1236 (2d Cir.1977). That court noted: \u201cfoster children depend on foster care payments for their living essentials. Foster parents obligate themselves to care for these children on the assurance that they will receive support from the state.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Since Connecticut\u2019s foster care payments are regular contributions toward their support from a public welfare organization, Kenneth and Wayne Kelly are not entitled to child\u2019s insurance benefits under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
