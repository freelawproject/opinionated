Judgment affirmed (see <em>People vDeutsch, </em>71 AD2d 1029). We note that the defendant agreed, on the record, to \"contribute\u201d the sum of $156.50 to the patient fund at the nursing home in question. Therefore, the court\u2019s use of the word \"restitution\u201d constituted a mere technical error which did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantive rights (see CPL 470.50, subd 1). Hopkins, J. P., Damiani, Titone and Mangano, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
