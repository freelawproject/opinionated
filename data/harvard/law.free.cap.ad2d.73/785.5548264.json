Memorandum: The limited use permitted defense counsel of the police report in this case when he sought to examine prior written statements of the prosecution witnesses for purposes of cross-examination was an error under <em>People v Rosario </em>(9 NY2d 286). We find, however, that there is no reasonable possibility that this error might have contributed to the conviction and that it was, therefore, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 237).
