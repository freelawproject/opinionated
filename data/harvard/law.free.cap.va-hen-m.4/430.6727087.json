Under these circumstances, I consider the sale valid, as made by the executor in this case, and should *be confirmed; which some of the legatees have done since they came of age, by executing a deed for that purpose; and I believe that this opinion will be found to accord with the universal understanding of the people of this country; for there is nothing more common than for an executor to be a purchaser of his own sale of his testator\u2019s estate, and most commonly to the advantage of the legatees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
