The prayer of the bill was for an injunction and general relief. To this bill John Haskins filed an answer, and stated, among other things, that if the inattention relied on in the present case be deemed a sufficient ground for the interposition of a Court of Equity, it would always be in the power of a party to make his defence in a Court of Equity, instead of a Court of Law. And a motion was now made to dissolve the injunction which had been awarded.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-20\">\u00abEquitable Relief \u2014 Fraud\u2014Surprise.\u2014In Holland v. Trotter, 22 Gratt. 141, itis said: \u201cTile cases in which courts of equity have refused relief, have been cases where the failure to make defence in a court of law has resulted from the laches or negligence of the party setting up his demands in a court of equity. They have always granted relief, however, when it is shown that the reason why the defence was not made, was founded in fraud, accident, surprise, or some adventitious circumstance beyond the control of the party. Mason v. Nelson, 11 heigh 227; <em>Mosbv v. </em>Haskins, 4 <em>lien. &lt;h Munf. </em>427; (De-graffenreid v.

By these plain and simple principles then, let the present question as to jurisdiction be tested. A suit in Chancery had been brought, which might have embraced this very subject, and the defendant, the present plaintiff, was served, as he supposed, with process in that suit, and therefore he may have been so far mistaken, as to aver with great truth, that he had no remedy at law, since he suffered a judgment to go against him, when in fact he did not know that he was sued. Could there have been a more complete surprise, than in the first instance to \"have met with an execution instead of a capias? There certainly could not to my mind; and hence a good ground for relief in equity. But it is said, that this will always admit a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>make his defence in equitj, instead of at law. To this argument two sufficient answers may be given; 1. Tljat if, upon the coming in of the answer, the circumstances relied upon in the bill appear not to be true, the Court will always dissolve the injunction ; as in this case, if the defendant could shew that before the judgment at law the plaintiff really' knew of the suit, he should not be any longer entertained in this Court, but should abide the consequences \u2022 of his own neglect; and, 2. Though the circumstances may be true, and relief afforded, yet, in general, it must be at the costs of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\">Attention to these rules will afford, as it is believed, a sufficient corrective to those who might otherwise be disposed to sport with the sacred obligation of an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Motion to dissolve denied, and the accounts referred to a Commissioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
