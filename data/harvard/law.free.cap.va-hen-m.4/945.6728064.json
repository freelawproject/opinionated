Cooper, 15 W. Va. <em>673, </em>it is said: \u201cThere has been a question whether the personal representative of a mortgagor of land in fee. or the grantor in a deed of trust conveying land in fee, who occupy similar attitudes, is a necessary party, when a mortgage is to be foreclosed or the land sold by a decree of the court. In England it has been held he is not. See Story\u2019s Mq. PL, sec. 175, p. 209, sec. 186, p. 222, and authorities cited. See also, <em>Patton v. Page, i Hen. &amp; 21. </em>449. But it has been held by the court of appeals of Virginia that he ought to be made a party in such a suit. See Harrison v. Harrison, etc., 1 Call 419.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AM1\">See monographic <em>note </em>on \"Mortgages\u201d appended to Porkner v.
