In the case before the Court, the executor is at large upon the return of cepi corpus, and if he was brought up by the Serjeant of the Court, the course would be to commit him until he should clear his contempt; that is to say, until the Court could be satisfied that its order would be obeyed. This would be the regular course of proceeding, but attended with more inconvenience, than the mode that was adopted by this Court in the case of Fisher against Pisher, the effect of which is the same; and therefore the Court would prefer that mode now: and an order was made to this effect; that if the said executor do, on or before the tenth day of August next, comply with the terms of the decretal order pronounced in this cause, the 13th September, 1805, to the satisfaction of the Commissioners therein named, to be certified to this Court, the said attachment is to be discharged as an act of this day; but if the said Commissioners should certify to this Court, that the said executor had failed to comply with the said decretal mode in manner aforesaid, then it is ordered, that the Sheriff of the county of Boudon do commit the said executor to the gaol of the said county, until the Judge of this Court, in Court or out of Court, is satisfied that the said executor hath fully complied with the said decretal order, and shall order him to be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
