This was consented to. The defendant Randolph\u2019s answer stated that a previous sale of all his goods, including the tobacco, had been made to William Fleming, to indemnify him as a security, and referred to the deed, which had but one witness to it, and was not recorded, nor was there any other proof of it than the affidavit of the witness thereto. The cause came on to be finally heard.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-3\">By the Chancellor,.</author>\n<p id=\"Aho2\">The deed not having been recorded as prescribed by law, as to creditors, is as to them, clearly void: the injunction must be made perpetual, and the plaintiff allowed to take the proceeds of the tobacco out of bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The defendant Randolph to pay costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
