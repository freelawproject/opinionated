Whether a conveyance by two of three executors, all of whom had qualified and were living, (the testator having directed the sale and conveyance to be made by his executors, in general terms,) was valid in law? 2. If it was not, could it be aided in equity? and, 3. If it could not, did the purchase-money, if paid, create a lien on the land, which would subject it in equity to the repayment of the money?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-24\">Joint Executors \u2014 Sale of Land by One \u2014 Validity.\u2014 In Glasgow v.

And as to the third question, if the purchase-money was paid, it created no lien upon the land, because the plaintiff neither derived a legal nor an equitable right thereto: and he must be left to his remedy at law. _ _</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
