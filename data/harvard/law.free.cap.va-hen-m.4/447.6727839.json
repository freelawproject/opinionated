Verdict at Law against a Party \u2014 When Not a Bar to Decree in Equity. \u2014 A verdict at law against a party is no bar to a decree in his favour if he is brought into Chancery by the adverse party; otherwise, if he were the plaintiff in equity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-21\">The report in this case (which was a bill brought for an account) was in favour <em>of </em>the defendant, against whom a verdict and judgment had been rendered at law, in an action brought by him against the plaintiff, and the questions submitted to the Court were, 1. What should be the effect of the rule where, at law, or in equity, you take an account of one of the parties as evidence against him; and, 2. Whether the judgment at law, as above stated, should bar the defendant from a d.ecree in his favour for the balance so reported.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-30\">Evidence \u2014 Production of Books of Adversary. \u2014 In Rowan v. Chenoweth, 49 W. Va. 287, 38 S. E. Rep. 546, it is said: \u201cThe rule is that, when a party calls for the production of and uses a writing or account of his adversary, the whole writing, the whole account, debits and credits, is thus made evidence in the case. It cannot be garbled; one side or showing of it merely cannot be used for hurt of one party to the benefit of another. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 563: Whart.

For example, the account should not be evidence, so far as any error should be apparent on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-23\">As to the second question: if the defendant had brought this suit, the judgment at law against him would be a clear bar; but as the suit is brought against him by his. adversary, at law, the judgment is no bar.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">Decree for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
