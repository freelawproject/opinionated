In September following, there was an additional order for an account. In June last, the suit was revived,' and the cause now coming on, upon the report made in pursuance of the order of September, 1807, Mr. Wickham objected to the report, because the representatives of Charles Patterson were not then in Court; but Mr. Williams said the practice had been both ways; either to bring on the cause upon the order of publication, or to revive the suit upon that order, and then to bring it on.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-10\">By the Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AO9\">This is the first time such a case has occurred before me; and if the practice has been as Mr. Williams states it, it was unauthorized, for when a suit abates against a resident party, it cannot be revived unless there is an appearance for him, or process returned executed, and then the order is made, and not before: and so with respect to a non-resident party, on whom process cannot be served, in lieu of which an order of publication is made, for two months in a public newspaper; and then, and not before, the suit should be revived ; and then, and not before, it should be proceeded in : and, therefore, the last report in this case must be recommitted, as having been made under an order which was made wnen the representatives of Charles Patterson were not before the Court. The practice upon this point is now settled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
