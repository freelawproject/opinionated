Triplett.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b158-4\">Spring Vacation,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AgBJ\">1809.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b158-5\">Interlocutory Decrees \u2014 Affirmation by Appellate Court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014Effect.\u2014An interlocutory decree being affirmed by the Court of Appeals, does not change its terms; but it remains to be executed here in the same manner as it did before the appeal; therefore. in this case, the appeal being affirmed without a deduction of war interest on a British debt, such deduction will be made in this Court; especially as the plaintiff is asking the aid of the Court to carry that decree into effect.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">The bill in this case was filed to foreclose a mortgage, dated October, 1774, and the Commissioners to whom the accounts were referred, had reported a balance due thereupon of 6091. 17s. 3d. on the 14th September, 1775, with interest from that time till paid, upon which *this Court, in September, 1793, decreed that unless that sum, with the interest upon that part thereof which was principal money, and the costs', (deducting the amount of a bond of 801. payable 1st October, 1774, and interest due by Francis Willis, which the plaintiff had received and not returned,) should be paid by the 1st day of April, 1794, the defendant was to be barred and foreclosed in his equity to redeem the mortgaged premises, and Commissioners were also appointed to make sale thereof. From this decree there was an appeal, but the decree was affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">On the 19th March, 1798, the plaintiff and Bernard Hough agreed, that as the latter had bought part of the mortgaged premises for 1,0001. the former should secure the payments due for the same, and relinquish the said mortgage, and look to the said Triplett for any balance that might be due by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">In 1801, this Court again appointed Commissioners to ascertain the balance due upon the mortgage, and to carry the decree aforesaid into effect; and they made two statements; 1. Charging the interest for the war, the balance due to the plaintiff was $827 37 cts.' ; 2. Deducting the war interest, a balance of $186 22 cts. was due to the defendant; and they reported, that if the second statement was correct, the balance due thereupon should be subject to the plaintiff\u2019s costs before the date of' his agreement with Hough, by which they conceived the . mortgaged premises to be released.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">In June, 1808, Commissioner Keith, on the motion of the plaintiff, was directed to state the balance due on the mortgage, and to report the same, which he did accordingly. 1. Charging the war interest, and deducting Willis\u2019s bond and interest, on the 14th May, 1789, when it was assigned to the plaintiff, made the balance due to him on the 25th August, 1808, 3331. 12s. 4d. and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-13\">2. Deducting the war interest and Willis\u2019s bond, on the 14th Sept. 1775, with interest from 1st October, 1774, *made a balance due to the defendant of 581. 11s. 5d. Upon this report three points were submitted to the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-14\">1. As the decree of this Court did not deduct the war interest, and had been affirmed in the Court of Appeals, could that interest now be deducted?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-15\">2. Was not the agreement with Hough a release of the mortgage?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-16\">3. At what time should Willis\u2019s bond be credited?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\">See monographic <em>note </em>on \u201cAppeal and Error\u201d appended to Hill v.
