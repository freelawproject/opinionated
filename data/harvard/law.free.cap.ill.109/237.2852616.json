Richard Prendergast, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\" pgmap=\"238\">This was a petition by the South Chicago Railroad Company, under the Statute of Eminent Domain, for the condemnation of a strip of ground thirty feet in width, extending north from Seventy-first street, in Hyde Park, through blocks 12, 7 and 4, crossing Seventieth and Sixty-ninth streets, to a lot of land, part of block 4, occupied by the water-works of the village of Hyde Park and town of Lake,\u2014a distance of 1651 feet. The petition alleges the petitioner to be a corporation organized under the laws of the State, and authorized to construct and operate a line of railroad from a point on the line of the Illinois Central railroad between the stations of Hyde Park and Grand Crossing, on said road, in the township of Hyde Park, to the village of South Chicago, in said township; that petitioner had located its line of road, and that the said strip of ground was necessary for the right of way, side-tracks, depot grounds, appurtenances, etc., required by the petitioner to construct its railroad. Certain of the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the petition, and the affidavit of William D. Kerfoot in support of the motion. In opposition to the motion, the petitioner submitted its articles of incorporation, an ordinance passed by the president and trustees of the village of Hyde Park on the 3d of April, 1882, giving the petitioner permission to construct its line in said village, and locating the part in question upon the strip sought to be condemned, and the affidavit of Edward T. Jeffrey. A plat of the premises was offered, showing the land described in the petition, and the location of the railroad. The court sustained the motion, and entered an order dismissing the petition, and the petitioner appealed to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\" pgmap=\"238(34) 239(231)\">By the ordinance of the board of trustees of the village of Hyde Park, of April 3, 1882, the petitioner is granted permission to locate and construct a line of railroad upon the following route in the village of Hyde Park, namely: Beginning at a point on the Illinois Central railroad near Seventieth street, thence south-easterly on a curve to Seventy-first street, and thence east on the center thirty feet of Seventy-first street to Railroad avenue; thence on Railroad avenue, and along that part of it lying within fifteen feet on each side of the center line thereof, etc., to South Chicago; also, from a point on the first described line, near the east line of section 24, northerly, on a curve, to a point near the west line of Yates avenue, thence north on land west of Yates avenue to the Hyde Park water-works. The last is across the lands here sought to be condemned. The ordinance further provides, \u201cthat one or more tracks shall be laid down and ready for operation, from the junction with the Illinois Central railroad to South Chicago, and from that line to the Hyde Park water-works, within twelve months from the passage of this ordinance; and said company shall switch to said waterworks for the village of Hyde Park, at the usual rates charged for similar service, such coal, in car load lots, as may be needed for use at said works, in default whereof (including other requirements) the rights and privileges hereby granted shall cease, and be null and void.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239(131) 240(21)\">The affidavit of Kerfoot sets forth that he is a real estate agent, and that the strip of ground in the petition mentioned is a strip which, after making the curve therein described, extends upon a line perpendicular to said Seventy-first street, north, to the water-works of the village of Hyde Park; that the strip is now actually occupied by the railroad company, not as a part of its line to South Chicago, but as a branch or spur road, running northerly therefrom, and is used, or designed to be used, by certain coal dealers who supply, or are expected to supply, coal to be used at said water-works; that such branch is not designed to be used or available for use by the general public, either for freight or passenger traffic, or for any other or different use than that to which it is to be put by said coal dealers.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240\">The affidavit of Jeffrey is, that he is the general superintendent of the South Chicago Railroad Company; that the company has completed a double track railroad, extending from the Illinois Central railroad to South Chicago, it being, for the most part, upon and along certain public streets in the village of Hyde Park; that the land sought to be condemned is required for a side-track, which is necessary for the convenient and successful operation of the railroad, as well as to reach the water-works; that as the company is restricted to the use of thirty feet in width along the center of said streets, there is not sufficient room in the space so limited for the construction of any side-track, and the company is compelled to seek such necessary facilities, outside of the street, as will best suit its business and the accommodation of the public; that the use of the said side-track is indispensable for the delivery of freight, and for the switching, storing and handling of cars; that, in his opinion, it would be impossible for the railroad company to operate conveniently and successfully its line of road if deprived of the side-track in question, it being impracticable, under the provisions of the ordinance, to locate and construct a suitable side-track except upon the premises in question. The South Chicago railroad extends five miles in length.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-7\" pgmap=\"240\">Mr. W. C.

The power to condemn property for the purpose of switches, turn-outs and side-tracks, is conferred, in express terms, by section 17 of the act. By the act, the persons incorporating a company are to name the places from and to which -it is intended to construct the proposed railway, but no limitation is laid down as to the places where switches, turn-outs, or side-tracks are to be constructed. When it is necessary to cross or occupy streets in cities or villages, the consent of the authorities thereof must first be obtained, as provided by clause 5, of section 19, of the act. Hyde Park is incorporated as a village under the general law, and clause 25, section 62, of the law, confers power on the board of trustees \u201cto provide for the location, grade and crossing of any railroad. \u201d This railroad and this proposed track being within the limits of the village of Hyde Park, its board of trustees have by ordinance fixed the location of the main line of the road and this proposed track, determining what streets the road might occupy and cross.</p> <p id=\"b243-6\" pgmap=\"243\">The question in the case is, whether the proposed track is a switch or side-track, or is it an independent branch road. Appellant contends for the former, and appellee for the latter, and it is conceded by appellant\u2019s counsel if the track he this latter, there is no right to build it, and no power to condemn land for it.</p> <p id=\"b243-7\" pgmap=\"243\">As showing the proposed track to be an independent branch road, the fact of the track running to the water-works of the village, and being used for carrying coal to those works, is relied upon, as also the provision of the ordinance making it a condition that this track should be built to these waterworks of the village. It is insisted that this is a mere private use, and that the track was built to serve this use, and because the company was obliged to build it by the requirement of the ordinance. This certainly shews that the track does serve this private use, and that it was designed to do so; and if it served this use merely, and was not an aid in the convenient operation of the main line of the railroad, appellee\u2019s position would be maintained. But if, in addition to serving such use, the track be one which is necessary for the convenient operation of the main line of the railroad, then it may properly come within the purview of a side-track. A side-track can surely be none the less such, because, in addition to the purposes of a side-track proper, it subserves some other private individual use.</p> <p id=\"b243-8\" pgmap=\"243(53) 244(52)\">There is little force in the circumstance that the track runs perpendicular to the main line. That was the location made by the board of trustees, who had the power of fixing the location. It appears that within the thirty feet in width along the streets to which the company was restricted, there was not room, in addition to the two main tracks, for the construction of any side-track, and the company was compelled to go outside of the street for a side-track, and the place of its location it was for the company and the authorities of Hyde Park alone to determine.</p> <p id=\"b244-5\" pgmap=\"244\">All that appears in the record upon the subject of the character of the track is the petition, plat, and the affidavits of Kerfoot and Jeffrey. As between the opposing opinions of the two latter whether the proposed track is a branch road or a side-track, that of the manager of the railroad is, we think, entitled to higher consideration than that of the real estate agent. To deny \"the petition it should appear that what is sought is clearly an abuse of power, and a taking of private property for an object not required for the convenient operation of the road. See Matter of B. and A. R. R. Co. 53 N. Y. 574; In re N. Y. C. R. R. Co. v. M. G. L. Co. 63 id. 326; Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific R. R. Co. v. Town of Lake, 71 Ill. 333; Smith v. Chicago and Western Indiana R. R. Co. 105 id. 511; C. and P. R. R. Co. v. Speer, 56 Pa. St. 325; In re N. Y. C. and H. R. R. Co. 77 N. Y. 248.</p> <p id=\"b244-6\" pgmap=\"244\">The petition avers that the land asked to be condemned is necessary for the right of way, side-tracks, etc., required to construct the railroad. The statement of the manager, Mr. Jeffrey, is most distinct that the land is required for a side- \u2022 track, which is necessary for the convenient and successful operation of the railroad. It can not, we think, be said, from anything appearing in the record, that the proposed track was for a use foreign to the purposes of the main line of the railroad, and not needful for its operation.</p> <p id=\"b244-7\" pgmap=\"244\">We are of opinion the court below erred in dismissing the petition, and not submitting the case to the jury to assess the damages, and the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b244-8\" pgmap=\"244\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
