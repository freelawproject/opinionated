Following the commencement of the action, the defendants moved for summary judgment based on the absence of notice of the allegedly hazardous condition.</p><p id=\"b531-9\">On a motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint based on lack of notice, a defendant is required to make a prima facie showing affirmatively establishing the absence of notice as a matter of law <em>(see, Dwoskin v Burger King Corp., </em>249 AD2d 358; <em>Gordon v Waldbaum, Inc., </em>231 AD2d 673). In opposition, in order \u201c[t]o prove a prima facie case of negligence in a slip and fall case, a plaintiff is required to show that the defendant created the condition which caused the accident or that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>condition\u201d <em>(Bradish v Tank Tech Corp., </em>216 AD2d 505; <em>Gaeta v City of New York, </em>213 AD2d 509).</p><p id=\"b532-3\">The deposition testimony submitted by the defendants established the absence of notice as a matter of law. The evidence submitted by the plaintiffs in opposition to the motion failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3212 [b]) as to whether the defendants either created the hazardous condition or had actual or constructive notice of the condition.
