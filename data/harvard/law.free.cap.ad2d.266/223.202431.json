Thus, as of October 2, 1996, the date of his petition, the support payments should be reduced to the extent indicated (see, <em>Matter of Dox v Tynon, </em>90 NY2d 166, 173-174).</p><p id=\"b266-4\">The father\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. O\u2019Brien, J. P., Santucci, Altman and Krausman, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
