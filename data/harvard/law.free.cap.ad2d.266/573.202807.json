Claiming misconduct and deception, defendant and his wife discharged the attorney and retained another attorney who negotiated a plea bargain. Pursuant to the plea bargain, defendant entered an <em>Alford </em>plea of guilty to a single count of criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree in full satisfaction of all charges pending against him and he was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 3 years. As part of the plea bargain defendant waived his right to appeal. Nevertheless, defendant appeals, claiming that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his first attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\">Although a defendant may challenge the competency of his or her legal representation despite a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to appeal <em>(see, People v Harris, </em>242 AD2d 782, <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 1008), the claim is limited to the impact of the alleged ineffective assistance on the voluntariness of the guilty plea <em>(see, People v Lynch, </em>256 AD2d 651, <em>lv denied </em>93 NY2d 1004; <em>People v Ellett, </em>245 AD2d 952, 954, <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 925), and there is nothing in the record to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s plea was infected by any ineffective assistance of counsel <em>(see, People v Defino, </em>200 AD2d 907, <em>lv denied </em>83 NY2d 851). In any event, having knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea while represented by the second attorney, who was aware of the alleged deficiencies of the first attorney, provided effective assistance and negotiated a favorable plea bargain, defendant forfeited any claim regarding the competency of the first attorney <em>(see, People v Petgen, 55 </em>NY2d 529, 534-535; <em>People v Cance, </em>155 AD2d 764).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Cardona, P. J., Mikoll, Yesawich Jr. and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
