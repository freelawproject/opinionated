Hershey et al. </em>v. <em>Reclamation District No. 108 et al., ante, </em>p. 550 [254 Pac. 542],  The main questions presented by this appeal were specifically disposed of in the ease of <em>Ella L. Hershey et al. </em>v. <em>Reclamation District 108 et al., supra. </em>In appellant\u2019s opening brief he concedes the legality of the assessment levied upon all the lands within the district \u201cfor drains, levees, pumps and other matters incident to reclamation as the same had always been known and recognized prior to the amendment of section 3455, Political Code, as amended by the legislature of 1917 (Stats. 1917, p. 1197) and under the new section added to the Political Code by the legislature of 1921 . . . (Stats. 1921, p. 1590).\u201d The objection specifically urged is to \u201cthat part of the assessment that has to do with the strictly irrigation features.\u201d No other questions not decided in the case above referred to are raised in appellant\u2019s opening brief. In the reply brief appellant questions the correctness of two find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ings upon minor matters which could not in any event affect the result of the decision. Upon the grounds heretofore stated the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
