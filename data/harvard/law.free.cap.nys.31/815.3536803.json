The. sole question litigated upon the trial, and now presented, relates to the construction of the by-laws with regard to the defendant\u2019s undertaking to defray the expenses of a funeral for a deceased member in good standing, which this decedent was admitted to be. According to the terms of these by-laws, the aim of the society was \u201cmutual aid, protection, and moral and material support among its members. * * * To this end the society grants to each member (1) financial relief in case of sickness; (2) legal protection in case of wrongs; (3) relief in case of death of legitimate wife; (4) funeral in case of the event of death.\u201d It is claimed by the appellant that the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>sion for a funeral intended merely that the members of the society should be called upon to attend the deceased member\u2019s burial, and that the society could be in no way called upon to defray the expenses of such funeral. This contention cannot prevail. The natural and accepted meaning of the phrase noted, and the sense in which only it could have reasonably been understood by the member (Nibl. Mut. Ben. Soc. \u00a7 15), would intend a promise to pay the expenses of his decent burial. The terms of the other by-laws, and of a certain receipt in evidence, admit only of an interpretation that the \u201cfuneral\u201d to be provided involved a pecuniary benefit to the member\u2019s estate. Provision is made for a \u201ctax for funerals,\u201d and the funeral is classed among the other substantial benefits to be derived from membership, and which, in case of certain defaults in payment of assessments, should be withheld. The fact that the by-laws also provide that notice be given to the members of the society upon the death of one of their number, in order that their attendance should be secured at the funeral of the deceased member, in no way presents any inconsistency with the other provisions noted. The terms of the agreement are clear, and no construction that the party accepting them, as consideration for the payments required, did so merely with the expectation of finally securing an impressive escort to possibly a pauper\u2019s grave, could reasonably obtain. While in some cases the opinions of officers of an association may be given for the purpose of construing technical, ambiguous, or uncertain terms of a by-law, the evidence offered in that regard in the present c\u00e1se was properly excluded, the by-law;s being susceptible of definite construction without extraneous proof.
