It may plainly be seen, therefore, that the sum fixed to be paid by the defendants in avoidance of the injunction represents the consequential fee damage. After a careful examination of the whole case, we are of the opinion that substantial justice has been done .between the parties, and that there is no exception which calls for a reversal of the judgment. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
