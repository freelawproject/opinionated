The plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s statements concerning, that phase of this,litigation, were correctly submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>the jury. They decided in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and there is ample evidence justifying their finding. The question at folio 100 was perhaps wrong in form, but the answer shows what the receipt in full was for, and plaintiffs had a perfect right to explain the meaning of the receipt referred to. Such a receipt may always be explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The letter referred to in appellants\u2019 second point was rightfully excluded. Defendant had no right to create evidence in its favor in that way. Again, the court was justified in refusing to permit the defendant to introduce in evidence other work done by plaintiffs for it. The question was, did they perform their contract in this instance? The receipts, because they read \u201cin full payment,\u201d etc., for that reason cannot be said to be an accord and satisfaction of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. They can be explained as before stated.' There was a sufficient offer of delivery of the goods in question, and also a sufficient demand, as the evidence shows; As to the preponderance of testimony, I think the jury was right in determining that it was in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. The whole appeal record shows that the judgment was a fair one, and it is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
