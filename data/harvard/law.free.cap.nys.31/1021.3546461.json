It first alleges that on a given date defendant, for value, made and delivered his promissory note to one Vendello. It then sets out the note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-19\">\u201cBuffalo, N. Y., December 29, 1893.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-20\">\u201cSix months after date I promise to pay to. the order of M. Vendello three hundred and thirty-one (8331.02) dollars and two cents, at Third National Bank, Buffalo, N. Y. Value received. J. B. Craven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-21\">Second. Alleges that on or about the 20th day of February, 1894, \u00abaid note was \u201cassigned, transferred, delivered, and indorsed\u201d to the plaintiff. Third. That no part of the said note, which is due, lias been paid; that on the 2d day of July, 1894, it was protested for nonpayment,\u2014\u201call to the damage of the plaintiff in the sum of $332.23,\u201d and interest from said 2d of July. Then demands judgment for the last-mentioned sum, with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-22\">The first objection is that it is not alleged that the owner ever transferred the note to plaintiff. But it is alleged that the note was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>assigned, transferred, delivered, and indorsed to the plaintiff. This allegation creates the presumption that the note was lawfully delivered, and that plaintiff has title. In Prindle v. Caruthers, 15 N. Y. 431, the allegation was that the contract became plaintiff\u2019s property by purchase, and the court say: \u201cThe allegation cannot be true, unless he purchased of the parties having the lawful right to dispose. The whole matter will be capable of litigation on the trial.\u201d Legally, this note could not be assigned and delivered to plaintiff except by one having right and title so to do. But it is not necessary to allege this; it is sufficient to aver the fact of assignment and delivery. So in Hays v. Hathorn, 74 N. Y. 491, it is said: \u201cThe production of the paper by him was prima facie evidence that it had been delivered to him by the payee, and that he had title to it.\u201d These are cases upon which defendant relies. But this doctrine supports the allegation of the complaint. It is not necessary to allege consideration for the assignment, for, if it be the fact that it is assigned, it is of no consequence whether it be for value or not. Certainly the maker cannot complain. It is said that the complaint does not allege the facts required by section 534 of the Code, in that it fails to state that there is due the plaintiff on this note the sum named therein, or any other sum. This is true, but it does not follow that the complaint is bad for that reason. It does allege that the note is due, and that no part of it has been paid; that it has been protested,\u2014all of which has damaged the plaintiff $332.23, for which sum and interest judgment is demanded. We have no difficulty in spelling out of this allegation that defendant has made default in payment of his note, or any part of it, and that he is now owing thereon, and that plaintiff is entitled to the sum due. It does not comply with section 534, Code, because it does not state in .place of \u201cto the damage,\u201d etc., \u201cthat there is due to plaintiff thereon.\u201d But it does, imperfectly and poorly, yet sufficiently, comply with section 481, in that it does, coupled with the other allegations, state a cause of action. Smith v. Fellows, 26 Hun, 384; Vogle v. Kirby, 4 N. Y. Supp. 99; Keteltas v. Myers, 19 N. Y. 231; Sanders v. Soutter, 126 N. Y. 193, 27 N. E. 263. Judgment should be ordered for plaintiff on the demurrer, with costs, with leave to defendant to answer in 20 days on payment of costs-All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
