From the affidavit of counsel for the appellants sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>mitted on this motion, it appears that judgment of reversal was entered in the court below when the appeal from the order granting a new trial was argued, submitted, and determined. The return of the court below did not include the judgment of reversal in extenso; but, if the return was defective in that respect, the respondent could have had it amended upon proper application. Failing such an application, she must be deemed to have waived the defect. This court was justified in entertaining and determining the appeal, since from the return of the court below, certified as required, it appears that \u201cjudgment was in due form entered\u201d on the order of reversal and granting a new trial. Motion for reargument denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
