On the first trial of the action there was a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and upon appeal the judgment was reversed, and a new trial ordered. The new trial was ordered in the month of November, 1888, and the case was not brought to trial until the month of January, 1894, and upon said second trial an attempt was made to introduce evidence of custom with reference to the guaranty contained in each contract that the skins should not lose over 6 per cent, from their invoice weight This evidence was excluded. A juror was thereupon withdrawn, with the consent of the court, in order that this motion might be made at special term, and the application comes from the court on those facts. I am of the opinion that the motion should be denied. The provisions of the guaranty in each of the three contracts under which the skins were sold are clear and explicit, to wit, that the skins are guarantied not to lose over 6 per cent, from invoice weight. There is certainly no ambiguity in this language, and the rule is too well settled that usage and custom cannot be proved to contravene a rule of law or to alter or contradict the express or implicit terms of a contract free from ambiguity, or to make the legal rights or liabilities of the parties to contract other than they are by the terms thereof. Hopper v. Sage, 112 N. Y. 530, 20 N. E. 350; Markham v. Jaudon, 41 N. Y. 236; Bradley v. Wheeler, 44 N. Y. 495; Baker v. Drake, 66 N. Y. 518. In this particular case the usage or custom of the trade which is sought to be pleaded is an allowance for any excess of loss of weight over and above 6 per cent, from the invoice weight. Such a usage or custom would be entirely in conflict with the plain terms of the guaranty, and it therefore results that the motion must be denied on that ground, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b331-12\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
