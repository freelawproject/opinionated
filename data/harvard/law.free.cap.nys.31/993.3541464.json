This issue was, in our judgment, clearly established in defendant\u2019s favor by a preponderance of evidence. The fact that the defendant remained in possession of the demised premises until June Gth, under the circumstances, did not make him liable for the dune rent, for the reason given by the general term of this court. See 25 N. Y. Supp. 528; also, Wallace v. Lent, 1 Daly, 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">The plaintiff suffered no injury because of the denial of his motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The jury found against the defendant upon said counterclaim. The same thing may be said of the alleged error of the trial justice concerning the admission of evidence to sustain the counterclaim. If there were any errors, evidently, they were harmless, so far as plaintiff was'concerned. After carefully reading the record, we are convinced that the judgment is a just one, and should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
