Reformation of Contracts\u2014Fraud and Mistake.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-11\">In a suit to reform a guaranty of collection of a mortgage bond so as to make it one of payment, plaintiff testified that defendant solicited him to buy the bond, which he at first refused to do, whereupon defendant agreed to guaranty its payment in consideration of 1 per cent of the principal. Plaintiff\u2019s brother testified that defendant told him that plaintiff had agreed to buy the bond with defendant\u2019s guaranty, for which he had charged 1 per cent. Defendant denied guarantying the payment of the bond, but said that he agreed to sell the bond with a guaranty, the form of which he would make up and send later. Plaintiff paid for the bond when the agreement was made, and defendant, three months after-wards, sent the bond with a guaranty of collection. <em>Held, </em>that the guaranty should be reformed because of fraud on part of defendant Van Brunt, P. J., dissenting.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-12\">3.

The agent, having no knowledge of the agreement, failed to call his principal\u2019s attention to the form of the guaranty.

Southard v. Curley, 134 N. Y. 148, 31 N. E. 330, and cases cited. The judgment under review decrees that an instrument in writing, which on its face is a guaranty of collection of a certain bond and mortgage, should be so reformed as to guaranty its payment. That such- an instrument may be reformed by a court of equity, as well as deeds, mortgages, and contracts generally, which have been repeatedly the subject of reformation, is supported by Prior v. Williams, 3 Abb. Dec. 624. The question, then, is whether, applying the principles which should govern courts in decreeing that a contract- be reformed to the evidence adduced on the trial, the findings of the court at special term should be sustained. The direct testimony upon the question in issue was given by three witnesses,, and how much their bearing while on the witness stand may have-contributed towards satisfying the conscience of the court that the guaranty was not such as was agreed to, and that the change in the agreement was brought about through mutual mistake, or the mistake of one party and the fraud of the other, we cannot know. Our examination must be confined to the record. The first inquiry should be, what was the agreement? For it is not enough to prove that the plaintiff so understood the contract, and that the defendant knew he so understood. It must further appear that the defendant so agreed. The plaintiff and the defendant Taylor had been personal friends for years prior to this transaction. Some measure of plaintiff\u2019s confidence in Taylor can be taken from the fact that after plaintiff had agreed to take the bond and mortgage, and defendant\u2019s guaranty, and pay $10,000 therefor, the plaintiff gave him the amount in advance of the papers being ready for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>livery. Indeed, they were not prepared and sent to him for nearly three months thereafter. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the agreement was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201cMr. Taylor came to me, and wanted me to invest in this Peyton Montgomery mortgage, which was $10,000, and bearing seven per cent interest, and I told him it was too large a risk for me to take; I did not care to-invest so much money in one thing. He said it was perfectly good, and he considered it as good as a government bond, in his judgment. I said, if that was so, if he would guaranty the payment of it, I would give him one per cent., and I said I would be satisfied with six, and he said he would. He promised to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">John Simpkins, a brother of the plaintiff, testified that he had a conversation with Taylor after his brother had agreed to take the loan. They were playing billiards at the club, when Taylor\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anf\">\u201cTold me that my brother had agreed to take $10,000 loan with a guaranty of the firm, and he stated that the firm had to charge the one per cent, as a guaranty as a matter.of business; that they could not make a guaranty, or it would not be business for them to make a guaranty, of any loan payment of it, without taking one per.cent, for so doing. I replied to his statement that I thought my brother had been very foolish to have made a loan of $10,000 unless the payment of the principal and interest was guarantied, because, having a family, I did not think he could afford to take the risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The other witness on this point was the defendant Taylor. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201cI said nothing to Mr. Simpkins, at the conversation which took place in. May, 1886, or about that time, in regard to guarantying the payment of this bond and mortgage. I said that I \u00a1would sell him the loan with a guaranty, and that, upon my return to Kansas, I would have the form of guaranty made up and sent on to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">He does not say that he proposed to Simpkins that he would sell him the loan with only a guaranty of collection. According to his-own version of it, there was no such limitation suggested. Nor does he say it was his intention to so restrict the guaranty. He contents himself with a denial that at the time there was anything said in regard to guarantying the payment of the bond and mortgage. Now, the court before whom the witnesses appeared finds the fact to be that he did so agree, and, in view of the testimony to which we have referred, this court should sustain the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Immediately after the making of the agreement, the plaintiff gave Taylor the $10,000, who, nearly three months later, sent to him the bond and mortgage, and with it a guaranty of collection signed by the defendants. It was received by plaintiff\u2019s agent, and retained by him with other papers of the plaintiff. The agent had authority to open plaintiff\u2019s letters, and did so in this instance, simply reporting the fact of their receipt by him to the plaintiff. Thus it happened that plaintiff\u2019s attention was not called to-the form of the guaranty. Certainly discussion is not needful to&gt; make it appear that, so far as he was concerned, the fact that the written agreement was different from the real agreement of the parties was due to mistake. That the execution of a different contract of guaranty than that agreed upon was due to fraud on Taylor\u2019s part seems equally apparent. He agreed to give a guaranty of payment if Simpkins would loan the money. He did not do it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>An opportunity to perpetrate the fraud was presented, and he took advantage of it. He had Simpkins\u2019 money, who also had confidence in him, and was at the time of its- execution and delivery at a seaside resort. So he prepared a guaranty, but one quite different from that which he had agreed to have executed by the firm and delivered. He must be presumed to have intended the necessary consequences of his act which was to perpetrate a fraud on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We do not concur in the view expressed by appellant\u2019s counsel that by reason of the long delay the plaintiff should be held to have acquiesced in the guaranty delivered. The paper came into the hands of his agent, who did not call his attention to the peculiar form of the guaranty. And the circumstances were such that he never read the paper until he regarded it necessary to call in the loan. With reasonable promptitude thereafter he commenced this suit. Savings Inst. v. Burdick, 87 N. Y. 40-46, justifies the refusal of the trial court to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on that ground. An examination of the authorities cited by the appellant on this question will disclose that there were present in each case facts entirely different from the controlling facts in this one as to justify the assertion that they are not in point Calhoun v. Millard, 121 N. Y. 69, 24 N. E. 27, was a suit in equity to compel the surrender and cancellation of certain town bonds. For many years, without protest or objection, taxes had been levied upon the property of the town to pay the interest annually accruing on the bonds, and it was applied to that purpose. The court held the party guilty of unreasonable laches. Avery v. Society, 117 N. Y. 451, 23 N. E. 3, was a suit to reform a policy of life insurance after the tontine period of 15 years had expired, and the beneficiary had been tended the cash value of the policy. The complaint offered no excuse whatever for the delay, and judgment was rendered on a demurrer to the complaint. Syms v. Mayor, 105 N. Y. 153, 11 N. E. 369, had for its purpose the reformation of two leases, one executed in 1840 and the other in 1861. The court disposed of the case in this sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cBut there was no proof of any mistake or fraud' in their execution, or in -the terms inserted in them, and therefore, even if the statute of limitations is not a bar to the action to reform the leases, there was no basis or ground for their reformation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The law of the case was not further discussed. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">FOLLETT, J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"b200-9\">VAN BRUNT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYr\">I cannot concur in the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Justice PARKER in this case. I do not think that the proof offered, in this case was of so clear and convincing a character as to justify the reformation of the instrument in question. It is attempted to establish the mutual mistake of the parties by the testimony of the plaintiff and his brother, the plaintiff testifying to the arrangement, and his brother to an admission alleged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>have been made subsequent, to the date of the transaction in question. The defendant contradicts the testimony of the plaintiff pointedly, and refers to certain circumstances which tend to impair the credit to be given to that testimony. He shows that the guaranty was sent to the plaintiff, and he testifies without contradiction that he asked the plaintiff some time thereafter whether he had received the papers, and the plaintiff answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The defendant then asked him, \u201cIs the guaranty-\u2014is that form of guaranty\u2014all satisfactory?\u201d and the plaintiff said, \u201cYes.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s brother testifies to a conversation had between himself and the defendant some time after the transaction in question, while they were playing billiards at the Union League Hotel, in which he says that the defendant told him\u2014what he already knew to be the fact \u2014that his brother had agreed to take a $10,000 loan with a guaranty of the firm, and he stated that the firm had to charge the 1 per cent, as a matter of business; that they could not make a guaranty, or it would not be business for them to make a guaranty, of any loan\u2014payment of it\u2014without taking 1 per cent, for so doing. It appears certain from the evidence in this case that the words \u201cpayment of it\u201d were an interpolation by the witness in the conversation, and were not words used by the defendant. They do not fit anywhere into the conversation. The conversation was complete without them. But the witness had in mind the necessity, in order for his brother\u2019s success, that the words \u201cpayment of it\u201d should be injected, and he was equal to the occasion.He says that the language used was that they would not make a guaranty, that it would not be business for them to make a guaranty of any loan,\u2014and then he injects the words \u201cpayment of it,\u201d\u2014 without taking 1 per cent, for so .doing. The very method in which the witness testified to this conversation shows that these words were not used, certainly that the defendant did not use them on any such occasion. This view is confirmed by the answer of the witness to the next question. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201cI replied to his statement that I thought my brother had been very foolish to have made a loan of \u00a710,000 unless the payment of the principal and interest was. guarantied, because, having a family, I thought he could not afford to take the risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The language of the witness here seems to imply that he understood that his brother had made the loan without the guaranty of payment, because he speaks of his brother as having been very foolish in acting in the way in which he did, whereas, if he had acted in the way the witness says he did, he would not have been at all foolish in making the loan. It seems to me that under these circumstances the plaintiff, having these papers under his control for a long period of time,\u2014it is true, there is no evidence that he had looked at them,\u2014having acknowledged the correctness of the guaranty, his attention being called to it by correspondence, there is no such clear and distinct evidence of mutual mistake or of mistake on one side and fraud on the Other as would justify the reformation of this contract. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
