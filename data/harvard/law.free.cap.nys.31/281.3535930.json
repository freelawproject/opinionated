Apart, however, from any statutory prohibition, there can be no question but that such an agreement would have been void at common law; and, in addition to the illegality under the early statutes in this state relating to maintenance and champerty, such an agreement was made a crime. The penalty with the offense having been repealed, and no express statute existing which in terms decrees that an agreement of the character alleged is illegal, it yet remains to be determined wdiether such an agreement can be enforced. Having in mind the fact that it is void at common law, I do not see upon what ground its legality can be placed, unless some express sanction or authority can be found in some statute or decision which would give it support. Such agreements directly tend to promote litigation, to disturb the peace of individuals, and are directed to subverting the settled policy of this state, which, as shown by the history of the enactments on the subject, more particularly those applicable to attorneys (sections 73 and 74 of the Code), has sought to prevent the stirring up of strife and litigation. Here, concededly, an entire stranger to the transaction obtruded himself into it, and not only instigated a suit, but agreed to procure counsel and maintain the suit, the fruits of which, if successful, he was to share; and, more than this, he undertook to furnish the evidence upon which the recovery was to be assured. Such an agreement is repugnant to every instinct of propriety and justice, and the portion of it which provides for pay as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>consideration for procuring evidence should be regarded as immoral, illegal, and void. Unless, therefore, some' sanction or authority can be found for its enforcement, or some statute legalizing such an agreement is shown to exist, the rule as it existed at common law should prevail. I have been referred to no statute and to no decision, either in England or in this country, by which such an-agreement has been sanctioned. The plaintiff relies upon the case of Fowler v. Callan, 102 N. Y. 395, 7 N. E. 109; but that, as shown by the facts stated in the opinion, was a case wherein it appeared that the defendant, as devisee under a will, was entitled to certain real estate which was imperiled in some manner by threatened proceedings before the surrogate, and \u201cmade, a defense essential to its protection. In this emergency he sought the aid and professional services of the plaintiff, and retained him as an attorney. The latter neither sought the retainer nor did anything to induce it. So far as it appears, it was not occasioned by any offer or solicitation of his, but originated in the free and unbribed choice of the client. The evidence does not show whether the defendant had gained possession of the land devised or was out of possession, but he gave to the attorney a deed of the one undivided half part of the property, taking back his covenant to conduct the defense to its close, paying all costs and expenses of the litigation, and indemnifying the devisee against all such liability.\u201d The validity of the agreement was upheld upon the distinct ground, as shown by the sentence in the opinion that follows those above quoted, that \u201cthe agreement appears to have been purely one for compensation. * * * The contract in no respect induced the litigation. That was already begun, and existed independently of the agreement, and originated in other causes.\u201d And, as enforcing this ground, the opinion closes with the following language: \u201cBut our conclusion rests more strongly upon the conviction that the agreement made Avas one for compensation merely, and had in it no vicious element of inducing litigation or holding out bribes for a retainer.\u201d It is true that in that case it was a question between client and attorney, where the client approached the attorney in the first instance; but there can be no doubt that if, as stated by the court, the elements had been present shoAving that the attorney had induced the litigation, or had held out a bribe for the purpose of securing a retainer, the judgment would have been different. The present case differs from that in all its essential features. Here was a layman, Avho, as stated, was a stranger to the transaction, and who forced himself upon the attention of the defendant Avith a statement of his ability, in consideration of a percentage of the recovery, to employ counsel, instigate the litigation, pay the necessary disbursements, and procure the evidence; thus introducing every vicious element. Were it not for the abolition of the statutes relating to maintenance and champerty, this agreement would be both illegal and criminal, and it is one such as has never received the approval or sanction of any court. In my opinion, such an agreement cannot be enforced, and should be condemned, for which reasons the demurrer to the complaint should be sustained, upon the ground that such complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and judgment absolute should be ordered for the defendant, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b310-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

It is clear that such a contract is against public policy. The recognition of contracts of this character would be the introduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tion of all sorts of fraud and deception in proceedings before courts of justice, in order that parties might receive compensation out of the results of their successful manufacture of proofs to be presented to the court, thus holding out a premium upon subornation. The mere statement of the proposition seems to show that such a contract could never be recognized in any court of justice. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
