Relator\u2019s process of manufacture was described by one of its officers as follows: \u201cWe take tea in the original state, and expend labor upon it, by which we produce a mixture known as a special manufacture. We mix different kinds of tea together, and that makes a combination tea, and we ship it in that form. That is all we do, so far as manufacture is concerned. Forty-five per cent, of the tea we sell is treated in that way, and the remaining fifty-five per cent, we sell straight, just as we purchase it. We manufacture coffee. We buy in the raw state, roast it, bag part of it, and another part of it is ground and mixed and sold in that condition. Ninety-seven per cent, of the coffee we handle is treated in that way, and three per cent, sold straight. The coffee is purchased in New York, and a great portion of it is shipped in bags direct to our store, and put in bins. To illustrate: We take bags of coffee,, roast it, and ship it to our store in Albany. In some instances we mix different binds of coffee together, and that makes a combination coffee. That is all. The spices we buy boxed, and ship to our stores. Baking powder we take in cans, box it, and ship it. No change is made in it, or in the spices or condensed milk.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b272-6\">Argued before MAYHAM, P.

Wemple (N. Y. App.) 29 N. E. 808. \u201cThe application of labor and skill to materials that exist in a natural state gives to them a new quality or characteristic, and adapts them to new uses, and the process by which this result is brought about is called manufacturing, whether the change is accomplished by means of manual labor or by means of machinery.\u201d People v. Wemple, 29 N. E. 808, 129 N. Y. 513. \u201cAccording \u2019to Webster, a manufacturer is one who works raw materials into wares suitable for use.\u201d People v. Dock Co., 92 N. Y. 488.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-9\">Theodore E. Hancock, Atty. Gen. (John W. Hogan, of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">Relator is not a manufacturing corporation. Manufacturing corporations include those companies whose chief and principal business is the manufacture and sale of artificial products. The term' \u201cmanufacture\u201d presupposes: First, the raw material; second, the application thereto of labor, skill, and manipulation; third, the production of a new and distinct article, due wholly to the application of labor and skill of man to the raw material. People v. Ice Co., 1 N. E. 669, 99 N. Y. 181; People v. Dock Co., 92 N. Y. 487; Byers v. Coal Co., 106 Mass. 131; Dudley v. Jamaica P. Aqueduct, 100 Mass. 183; Frazee v. Moffitt, 18 Fed. 584, 20 Blatchf. 267.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-11\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"At0\">We think that relator cannot be deemed either a manufacturing corporation or one wholly engaged in carrying on manufacture within this state, and hence that it was liable to taxation under the provisions of chapter 5-42 of the Laws of 1880 and acts amendatory thereof. The determination of the comptroller as to the amount of capital stock employed by relator in this state should not be overruled, unless on ,the motion for revision it was clearly shown to be wrong. People v. Wemple, 129 N. Y. 558-566, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>29 N. E. 812. After a careful examination of the proofs presented on the motion for a revision, we are unable to say that the reduction of the valuation of relator\u2019s property within the state then made was not all it was entitled to. We think the estimate then made of the value of relator\u2019s property in this state was not shown to be erroneous. An opinion does not seem to be called for in the case. The determination of the comptroller should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
