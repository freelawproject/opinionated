The defendant, with her answer, served on October 20,1894, a written offer to allow judgment for $170, interest, costs, and disbursements; and the plaintiff thereafter, on October 24th, served a written acceptance of this offer, and upon November 2d he entered judgment upon this offer and his acceptance thereof for $192.28. However, before entry of this judgment, plaintiff obtained, on November 1st, an order permitting him to enter judgment for $170, with interest and costs, and to continue his action for the .recovery of the balance. Appellant contended at trial that this offer of judgment, acceptance thereof, and the entry of judgment thereon, was a bar to plaintiff\u2019s recovery of the balance of Ms claim in tMs action; and tMs contention seems correct, for the court had no right to grant this order of severance, upon the facts as disclosed in the papers upon which it was obtained. Appellant\u2019s counsel contends \u201cthat if defendant\u2019s contention be sustained the result will necessarily be that plaintiff will lose $550 of a debt admitted to be just, and for wMch plaintiff holds defendant\u2019s notes\u201d (this is not so, for he still can sue on the notes), \u201cand, in addition, that the plaintiff will be mulcted in a large sum for costs.\u201d But even so; this will be due to the mistaken practice of Ms counsel; and moreover, if plaintiff\u2019s contention is sustained, the defendant will be mulcted in costs, and not because of any mistake made by her or her counsel. The. judgment should be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
