The statement of facts was not filed until November 12th, which was more than ninety days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>after adjournment of court. Our state\u2019s attorney calls attention to the delayed filing in a motion to strike the statement of facts from the record.
