In his argument the district attorney in effect stated to the jury that appellant made no explanation concerning his connection with the burglary at the time he was arrested by an officer; that if he (the district attorney) had been caught under such suspicious circumstances he would immediately have told the officer that another man committed the offense. The argument carried the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>imputation that appellant\u2019s silence at the time of his arrest was destructive of the truthfulness of his explanation given at the time of the trial. Timely objection was made to the argument and proper written instruction presented to the court. The court overruled the objection and refused to give the instruction. Error was committed. The state would not be permitted to prove that appellant remained silent at the time he was arrested. It follows that it was error to advert to appellant\u2019s silence as being destructive of his explanation of his connection with the alleged offense. Brown v. State, 276 S. W. 929, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
