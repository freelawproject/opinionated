Appellant admitted the manufacture of the beer. Not far from the house was found a still, three barrels of whisky mash, two five-gallon jugs with about a gallon and a half of whisky in them, and other smaller jugs with some little whisky in them. A plain path led from appellant\u2019s house to the still. One witness testified that soon after getting to the place he went down to where the still was and secreted himself. In a short time appellant\u2019s wife and son came down and began over-turning the barrels of mash. He stopped them. The evidence seems ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Two bills of exception are in the record. One complains of the action of the court in letting the State ask appellant, while a witness, if he was not under indictment for another felony. This is held proper under all of our authorities, as affecting his credibility as a witness. The other bill sets up objections to the affidavit for search warrant for reasons stated,, but nowhere in the bill is the affidavit or any part of same set out. Such bill of exceptions manifests no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
