An attorney for the defendant is not authorized to take affidavits of the character shown herein. Garner v. State, 272 S. W. 167. It is recited in the order overruling the motion for a new trial that evidence was heard. Such evidence is not brought forward. We must therefore indulge the presumption that the court\u2019s action in overruling the motion was correct, and that the trial court acted upon evidence which was sufficient to justify his action.
