No complaints of the court\u2019s charge are brought forward for review. There are three bills of exceptions. One of these is but an exception to the action of the court in overruling the motion for new trial, which presents no question of fact or other matter justifying discussion. The evidence is to the effect that prior to the homicide the appellant and Stroud were together and perhaps were, or had been, drinking intoxicants. A negro by the name of Davis met the appellant and deceased upon the public road and was accosted by the appellant. The witness was asked where he was going and was told that he had better stop. The witness said:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u201cI looked back there at him and I saw his knife in his hand. He asked me to stop again, but I didn\u2019t stop. He \u2018run\u2019 his hand in his bosom and I didn\u2019t stop. I supposed there would be trouble on the road and I kept going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">This testimony was objected to as irrelevant. The witness further said:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">\u201cHe (appellant) did not make any effort to harm me, no more than running his hands in his bosom like he had something in his bosom that he would stop me with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Neither the relevancy nor the harm of the testimony is perceived when considered in the light of the undisputed testimony and the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The appellant did not testify but called as a witness Mrs. Chandler, who testified in his behalf that shortly after the difficulty in which the deceased lost his life the appellant came to her home traveling rapidly and asked that she telephone for the officers. He said that there had been trouble; that Mr. Stroud had been hurtthat he was cut and that he (appellant) had cut Stroud because he threatened to shoot his heart out. He said he had been struck by Stroud and knocked down,</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>In commenting upon the testimony mentioned State's counsel said :</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u201cGentlemen of the Jury: This is the testimony of the defendant second-handed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The appellant contends that the remark was an allusion to the appellant\u2019s failure to testify. To this contention we are unable to assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b111-10\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ACp\">Appellant insists that the reception of Davis\u2019 testimony was hurtful to him. We have again carefully examined the evidence complained of. It seems to have been abundantly established that appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The conduct of appellant in the incident related by Davis was attributable to appellant\u2019s condition and the claimed injurious effect of such incident is we think largely magnified.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
