The condition of said bond was \u201cfor his personal appearance before the district court of said county (Dallam County) at the next regular term thereof to answer the state of Texas upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>said charge abovenamed (selling intoxicating liquor).\u201d He was required by the terms of said bond to appear before said court and \u201cthere remain from day to day and term to term of said court until discharged by due course of law, then and there to answer said accusation against him.\u201d It is shown in the statement of facts that said appearance bond was forfeited on November 21st, 1927. At the next term of the court, the judgment nisi was made final, after appellants DeShazo and Camel had appeared and filed answer and evidence had been heard. It is not disclosed by the record that an indictment had been returned against Davison. The state offered an indictment in evidence, the nature of which is not disclosed. Said indictment was excluded upon the objection that an offense different from that set forth in the judgment nisi was charged. It not being shown that an indictment had been returned, the state was in no position to demand compliance with the bond. When the accused is held by a magistrate to \u00e1nswer to the district court, said court has no authority to demand compliance with the bond until an indictment has been returned. Harris et al v. State, 279 S. W. 817. It follows that the evidence is insufficient to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
