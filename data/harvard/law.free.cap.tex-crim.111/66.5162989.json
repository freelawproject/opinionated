Later an application for habeas corpus was presented to the Honorable Criminal District Court of said county seeking to have her released from said school.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Art. 1091, 1925 C. C. P., provides, in so many words, that where one is proceeded against in the juvenile court, it is the privilege of the court or jury to substitute as a place of confinement or commitment any detention home, parental school, or school for girls or boys, established by any county, etc. The judgment of the County Court of Harris county seems in every way correct. The place to which this appellant is committed is one of those enumerated by the statute. No complaint appearing of any irregularity or illegality in any of the necessary steps taken prior to the commitment\" of this appellant, and it appearing that she was properly committed to the place where she now is, \u2014 we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below remanding her was in accordance with law, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
