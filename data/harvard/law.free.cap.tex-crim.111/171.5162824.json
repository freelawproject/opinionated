The proof showed that said liquor was what is commonly known as \u201chome brew.\u201d No effort was made to show that \u201chome brew\u201d was a spirituous liquor. Having seen fit to charge in its indictment that appellant possessed a spirituous liquor, it was incumbent upon the state to support said allegation by proof. In Chaves v. State, 275 S. W. 1006, it was averred that the liquor alleged to be possessed for the purpose of sale was spirituous, vinous and malt. The proof showed that the accused was in possession of tequila and that said liquor was intoxicating. The indictment in that case, as in this case, was drawn under the provisions of Article 666 P. C. In determining that the proof failed to sustain the allegation that the liquor was spirituous, vinous or malt, Judge Lattimore called attention to the fact that there was no testimony in the record to show that tequila was either a spirituous, vinous or malt liquor. We quote his language as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">\u201cIf tequila be either spirituous, vinous or malt liquor, this fact should be shown by testimony. Can it be said that proof of the fact that tequila is intoxicating meets the universal requirement in every case, viz., that the allegation in the indictment and the proof correspond? If there were no other intoxicating liquors save such as are spirituous, vinous, or malt, then proof of the fact that the liquor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>intoxicating would meet the allegations above mentioned. In Allred v. State, 89 Ala. 112, 8 So. 56, it, is held that liquor may be highly intoxicating and yet not spirituous. In Commonwealth v. Herrick, 60 Mass. (6 Cush.) 465, and Commonwealth v. Gray, 68 Mass. (2 Gray) 501, 61 Am. Dec. 476, it is said that the word \u2018intoxicating\u2019 is a broader word, and includes a larger class of cases than \u2018spirituous,\u2019 and that, although spirituous liquors are intoxicating, all intoxicating liquors are not spirituous. It is manifest that spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors refer to different kinds of liquor, and whether these three descriptives comprehend all kinds and classes of intoxicating liquor is a matter of which this court has no knowledge, and is a matter not established by any proof in the case under consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">See also Jackson v.
