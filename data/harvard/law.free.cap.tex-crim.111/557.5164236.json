The issue being joined, he waived the first ground and offered proof on the question of there being a dangerous combination against him instigated by influential persons. He averred that by reason of such combination he could not expect a fair trial. We deem it unnecessary to recite the testimony heard by the trial court. Appellant wholly failed to show that such combination existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was based in part on newly discovered evidence. The order of the trial court overruling the motion recites that evidence was heard. The evidence is not brought forward. We must, therefore, ifidulge the presumption that the court\u2019s action in overruling the motion was correct, and that the trial court acted upon evidence which was sufficient to justify his action.
