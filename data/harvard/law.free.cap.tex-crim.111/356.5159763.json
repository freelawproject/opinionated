Page 13 of the transcript contains a short notation apparently of the docket entry and of the recognizance made by appellant Bettis, but if there was any entry of the judgment in the minutes the same is wholly omitted here. Being without any judgment, this court has no jurisdiction of the appeal, and the same is accordingly dismissed. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
