Appellant told a State\u2019s witness that he had left a fruit jar full of whiskey some forty or fifty steps inside of appellant\u2019s pasture close to prosecuting witness\u2019 house. The whiskey was thereafter found at this point by such witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">Only one bill of exception appears in the record. This relates to the action of the Court in permitting the State to prove by prosecuting witness that at the time of appellant\u2019s appearance at his home he knocked him down because he had insulted his wife. It appears that this matter was first gone into by appellant on cross-examination in an effort to show that the prosecuting witness was mad at appellant because of trouble between them arising out of appellant\u2019s refusal to stand good for supplies furnished prosecuting witness. On redirect examination the witness was properly, we think, permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>explain why he hit appellant after an attempt had been made to discredit the witness by showing that his animus was due to a matter not connected with the transaction under investigation. Under these circumstances there was no error in the Court\u2019s action. Speights v. State, 1 Tex. Crim. App. 553; Kunde v. State, 22 Tex. Crim. App. 65; Branch\u2019s P.
