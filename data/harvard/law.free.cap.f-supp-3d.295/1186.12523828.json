Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration, filed March 2, 2017 (Doc. 5)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on July 12, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether the parties' Arbitration Agreement is illusory, which depends on whether Defendant Red Lobster Restaurants, LLC (\"Red Lobster\") provided consideration; (ii) whether asking Plaintiff Mary Grace Laurich to sign the 2014 Dispute Resolution Process Acknowledgment, filed March 2, 2017 (Doc. 5-2)(\"2014 Agreement\") during a work shift makes the Arbitration Agreement procedurally unconscionable; and whether (iii) Red Lobster breached the Arbitration Agreement in such a way that precludes it from enforcing the Arbitration Agreement. The Court concludes that: (i) the Arbitration Agreement is not illusory, because both parties provided consideration; (ii) the Arbitration Agreement is not unconscionable, because Laurich was not deprived of meaningful choice to enter the arbitration agreement; and (iii) whether Red Lobster breached the Arbitration Agreement in such a way that precludes it from enforcing the Arbitration Agreement is a question for the arbitrator and not for the Court. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion, and stays the proceeding pending the arbitration's resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court draws its facts from Laurich's Complaint for Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the New Mexico Human Rights Act, Wrongful Discharge and Negligent Hiring and Supervision, filed February 2, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\"), from the Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration \u00b6 1, at 2, filed March 16, 2017 (Doc. 9) (\"Response\"), and from the Motion hearing, Draft Hearing Transcript, taken July 12, 2017 (\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court recites Laurich's version of the facts not out of any predisposition to believe her side of the story, but to establish a cogent, internally consistent version of events for its analysis. Moreover, Red Lobster stated, at the Motion hearing, that the Court may assume Laurich's version of events to be correct when deciding the Motion, because Laurich's account allegedly supports Red Lobster's position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:21-5:10 (Court, Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Laurich began working as a server at a Red Lobster restaurant in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 11, at 2; Response \u00b6 1, at 2. In 2014, Red Lobster purchased the Red Lobster restaurant chain-which included the Albuquerque Red Lobster restaurant-from\n   GMRI, Inc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 2, at 2. Around that time, Laurich was working a shift when one of her managers instructed Laurich to \"review a lengthy employment agreement on a computer terminal.\" Response \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, at 3. Laurich asked for a hard copy to review, but \"was told that none were available.\" Response \u00b6 4, at 3. The manager told her that, if she did not sign the electronic document, \"she would be taken off the work schedule.\" Response \u00b6 5, at 3. Laurich then \"registered her initials on the computer terminal\" and returned to work. Response \u00b6 6, at 3. The employment documents which Laurich electronically signed included a provision stating that both she and Red Lobster would be subject to Red Lobster's Dispute Resolution Process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 6; Motion at 3; 2014 Agreement at 1; Dispute Resolution Process, filed March 2, 2017 (Doc. 5-3)(\"DRP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Starting in July, 2016, a Red Lobster cook named Willie Prather \"began harassing [Laurich] based on her race and sex,\" Complaint \u00b6 15, at 2, calling her names like \"fat bitch\" and \"white bitch,\" and making threatening statements, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, at 2-3. Laurich complained to management about Prather, but they \"did nothing to address Mr. Prather's behavior or Plaintiff's work environment.\" Complaint \u00b6 21, at 3. Laurich asserts that, on or about August 5, 2016, Prather \"continued to harass her verbally\" and intentionally gave her incorrect orders to serve to customers. Complaint \u00b6 23, at 3. Laurich alleges that, after Laurich complained about Prather's actions, Prather \"accused her of 'snitching' to the manager, and told her that 'snitches get stiches' \" and then \"shoved [Laurich] into a shelf.\" Complaint \u00b6 25, at 3. Laurich was, at the time, about seven-and-a-half months pregnant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 12, at 2. After Prather shoved Laurich, a manager intervened and told Laurich to wait outside the restaurant, near the restaurant's entrance, while, Laurich asserts, \"[u]pon information and belief, the manager took Mr. Prather into an office.\" Complaint \u00b6 26, at 3. While standing outside the restaurant, Laurich used her cellular telephone to call her boyfriend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 27, at 3. Laurich alleges that, while she was on her cellular telephone, \"Mr. Prather then emerged from the restaurant, incorrectly assumed that Plaintiff was using the cellphone to call the police, and punched Plaintiff in the face, knocking the cell phone out of her hand. Mr. Prather took the Plaintiff's phone and ran away.\" Complaint \u00b6 27, at 3. Afterwards, Laurich told Red Lobster that she \"was not comfortable returning to work unless she could be assured that Mr. Prather would not be there.\" Complaint \u00b6 28, at 4. Laurich asserts that, \"[w]hile waiting and hoping that a reasonable accommodation could be made, [Laurich] learned that she had been terminated by Defendant.\" Complaint \u00b6 30, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Laurich filed her Complaint on February 2, 2017. First, Laurich asserts that Red Lobster violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"Title VII\"), by subjecting her to \"a hostile working environment as a result of discrimination based on her sex and race.\" Complaint \u00b6 37, at 5. Laurich asserts that Red Lobster either \"knew or should have known\" of Prather's history of violence, including violence against women, and had received \"numerous complaints of [Prather's] threats and harassment from multiple female employees.\" Complaint \u00b6 44, at 5. Despite this knowledge, Laurich asserts, Red Lobster \"did nothing to remedy an obviously dangerous situation,\" and \"made no good-faith effort to remedy the hostile working environment or to protect its female employees, or to otherwise comply\n   with the requirements of Title VII.\" Complaint \u00b6 44-45, at 5. Laurich also contends that Red Lobster's decision to terminate her employment \"was discriminatory and based on her sex and race,\" and her \"late state of pregnancy,\" as Red Lobster knew she was \"about take maternity leave.\" Complaint \u00b6 46, at 5. Laurich contends, in summary, that Red Lobster \"acted intentionally, willfully and with reckless disregard and deliberate indifference to [her] safety and well being.\" Complaint \u00b6 48, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, Laurich asserts that Red Lobster's actions violate the New Mexico Human Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-1-1\">\n    N.M.

In support of this count, Laurich proffers the same allegations made in support of her Title VII claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 50-63, at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Third, Laurich alleges that Red Lobster was negligent in hiring and supervising its employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 64-72, at 7-8. She argues that Red Lobster had a duty to exercise reasonable care for its employees' safety, and Red Lobster breached that duty by hiring and continuing to employ Prather \"despite his criminal record, history of violence, history of violence toward women, and continued threats and acts of violence toward women during his employment.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 65-66, at 7. Laurich asserts that, as a result of Red Lobster's negligence, she \"was harassed and physically battered by Mr. Prather while she was at work.\" Complaint \u00b6 67, at 8. Laurich also contends that Red Lobster is vicariously liable for Prather's actions, because, by \"refus[ing] to address multiple complaints by multiple female employees,\" Red Lobster \"implicitly and tacitly authorized and ratified Mr. Prather's behavior.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 71-72, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, Laurich asserts that she was wrongfully discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 73-76, at 8. She argues that Red Lobster terminated her employment for reasons \"contrary to public policy,\" because Red Lobster terminated her employment \"based on her race, sex and pregnancy,\" and \"in retaliation for her repeated complaints of harassment and/or pregnancy.\" Complaint \u00b6 74, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Compel Arbitration\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Red Lobster moves to compel arbitration and requests that the Court \"stay this proceeding pending resolution of the arbitration.\" Motion at 1. Red Lobster contends that Laurich's \"claims are barred from this proceeding in this Court by a binding arbitration agreement\" covered by the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"FAA\"). Motion at 2. First, Red Lobster asserts that, when Laurich applied for a job at the Red Lobster restaurant on August 11, 2008-then owned by a different company, GMRI, Inc.-she signed and submitted application form which featured the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I UNDERSTAND THAT GMRI, INC. D/B/A RED LOBSTER HAS IN PLACE A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, AND I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF I AM OFFERED AND ACCEPT EMPLOYMENT, ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN ME AND GMRI, INC., RELATING TO MY EMPLOYMENT AND/OR MY SEPARATION FROM EMPLOYMENT, SHALL BE SUBMITTED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DAY WHICH I LEARNED OF THE EVENT AND SHALL BE RESOLVED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Motion at 2 (quoting Laurich Application Form at 2, filed March 2, 2017 (Doc. 5-1)). Red Lobster then asserts that Laurich,\n   when she was hired, signed a \"Dispute Resolution Process Acknowledgment\" form, which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I agree as a condition of my employment, to submit any eligible disputes I may have to the company's DRP and to abide by the provisions outlined in the DRP. I understand that his includes, for example, claims under state and federal laws relating to harassment or discrimination, as well as other employment-related claims as defined by the DRP. Finally, I understand that the company is equally bound to all of the provisions of the DRP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Motion at 2 (quoting 2008 Dispute Resolution Process Acknowledgment at 1, filed March 2, 2017 (Doc. 5-2)(\"2008 Agreement\")). Red Lobster contends that Laurich \"again acknowledged the DRP as a condition of continued employment\" when GRMI, Inc. \"sold its Red Lobster business in 2014\" to Red Lobster. Motion at 3. That acknowledgment reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I agree as a condition of my employment, to submit any eligible disputes I may have to the DRP and to abide by the provisions outlined in the DRP. I understand this includes, for example, claims under state and federal laws relating to harassment or discrimination, as well as other employment related claims as defined by the DRO. Finally, the Company is equally bound to all of the provisions of the DRP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Motion at 3 (quoting 2014 Agreement). Red Lobster asserts that \"[t]he Acknowledgments drew [Laurich's] attention to the DRP\"; when Laurich \"signed the Acknowledgments[,] ... [she] acknowledged that she had reviewed and agreed to abide by the DRP.\" Motion at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Red Lobster asserts that the \"DRP contains various steps, with arbitration identified as the final step.\" Motion at 3. Red Lobster contends that the DRP \"expressly states that employees cannot pursue covered claims in court.\" Motion at 3. The DRP reads: \"The DRP, instead of court actions, is the sole means for resolving covered employment-related disputes. Disputes eligible for DRP must be resolved only through DRP, with the final step being binding arbitration heard by an arbitrator. This means DRP-eligible disputes will not be resolved by a judge or a jury.\" Motion at 3 (quoting DRP at 1). Red Lobster contends that the DRP applies to Laurich's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Red Lobster argues that the FAA applies to the DRP, and, therefore, Laurich must arbitrate her claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 4. Red Lobster asserts that the FAA \"provides that any 'written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce' \" to settle a controversy arising out of the contract or transaction through arbitration is valid unless the contract is revocable on some legal or equitable ground. Motion at 4 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Red Lobster asserts that the FAA covers Laurich's claims, because the term \"involving commerce\" is interpreted broadly, covering \"any arbitration agreement that affects commerce in any way.\" Motion at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.

Red Lobster began by stating that the \"limited issues before the Court [are] whether there is a valid arbitration agreement and ... whether [Laurich's] claims are covered by the agreement.\" Tr. at 2:17-20 (Lamont). Red Lobster stated that Laurich has not argued that the agreement does not cover the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:21-22 (Lamont). Rather, Red Lobster summarizes Laurich's position as comprising three arguments: (i) that the arbitration agreement is illusory, because there is no consideration; (ii) that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable, because Laurich did not have adequate time to review its terms; and (iii) that Red Lobster cannot enforce the arbitration agreement, because it did not follow the DRP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:22-3:7 (Lamont). Red Lobster addressed the first argument-that the arbitration agreement is illusory-and asserted that Laurich worked for six years at the Red Lobster restaurant when it was owned by GMRI, Inc., and was subject to a dispute resolution process that is \"very, very similar\" to Red Lobster's DRP. Tr. at 3:10-23 (Lamont). Red Lobster explained that, when it acquired the Red Lobster restaurant chain from GMRI, Inc., and \"as part of its consideration to hire Ms. Laurich as an employee to this new corporation,\" Red Lobster required Laurich to agree to Red Lobster's DRP. Tr. at 3:24-4:7 (Lamont). Red Lobster then asserted that Laurich's account of how her restaurant manager asked her to agree to the DRP-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"requiring her to review employment documents while waiting tables\"-\"defies logic if you've been a diner or server in a restaurant\" given that \"the last thing the management wants is for you to divert your attention from the guests.\" Tr. at 4:8-15 (Lamont). Red Lobster added that, although Laurich says she was denied a paper copy of the agreement, \"[s]he doesn't contend that she wasn't allowed to review it on the computer if she wanted to.\" Tr. at 4:15-18 (Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court interjected, asking whether, for the purposes of the Motion, it should \"go ahead and assume the plaintiff's version of events.\" Tr. at 4:21-23 (Court). Red Lobster replied that, \"for the purposes of this case, you can,\" because Laurich's affidavit and pleadings \"actually support the argument that she was about to be employed by a new employer, and that the consideration for her to stay on the schedule and to be employed by the new employer was to execute a DRP.\" Tr. at 5:4-10 (Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court then asked Red Lobster whether Laurich's \"illusory argument is also the procedural unconscionability argument,\" and Red Lobster replied that \"I think it all wraps together.\" Tr. at 6:5-11 (Court, Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court then gave Laurich an opportunity to discuss the illusory agreement argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:17 (Court). Laurich disputed that an ownership change means that Laurich began a new job, asserting that \"there [was] no new paperwork for a new job, and there [was] no new application.\" Tr. at 6:19-25 (Bregman). The Court asked, \"if you've got an at-will arrangement ..., what would be wrong with them saying, 'Ms. Laurich, if you don't sign this, you're going home right now'?\" Tr. at 7:1-4 (Court). Laurich responded that, in this case, Red Lobster did not simply require Laurich to sign the arbitration agreement; they told her that she had to sign the agreement during a work shift, and it is not clear that anyone told Laurich that she had to sign the new agreement because of the ownership change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:12-8:1 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Laurich then stated: \"I don't think you can sign off on arbitration without having a proper time to review the document,\" especially considering Laurich requested a hard copy but was not given one. Tr. at 9:3-9 (Bregman). The Court stated that it did not understand why not being given a hard copy would invalidate a contract or make it illusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:10-16 (Court). Laurich replied that the circumstances made it illusory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [If Red Lobster is] not giving her a fair opportunity to read it, what's her choice? ... [I]gnore all my tables out there and ... read [the entire document or] wait on the people that are sitting waiting on dinner? That's not a very good choice for her, and they put her in that situation.... [I]t's almost signing under duress because if she doesn't do it, she's going to have a lot of people mad at her out there and she's not going to make the same kind of money tips-wise if she's ignoring her customers while at the same time she's being required to sign off on a legal document ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Tr. at 9:7-10:20 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Next, the Court asked Laurich about Red Lobster's argument that \"she's better off than most people who sign arbitration agreements because she'd worked there for six years,\" and knew that \"she had signed arbitration agreements before and was signing them again.\" Tr. at 13:4-10 (Court). Laurich stated that she does not agree with the Court's characterization, stating that \"I think that's a slippery slope\" to presume someone has knowledge of an agreement based on past agreements. Tr. at 13:22-14:7 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court asked whether Laurich agreed that the \"illusory argument is also the same as your procedural unconscionability argument [-that they] are one and the same.\" Tr. at 14:8-10 (Court). Laurich agreed that they were the same arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:11 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court then asked Red Lobster whether it had more thoughts to share on the illusory agreement and procedural unconscionability issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:17-18 (Court). Red Lobster noted that Laurich's employment ended in August, 2016, \"two years after she electronically acknowledged the arbitration agreement.\" Tr. at 15:5-7 (Lamont). Red Lobster contended that \"two years is plenty of time ... to get on the computer, ask a question, say I don't want to be bound by this, and it was not even brought up ... until after [Laurich] had filed suit.\" Tr. at 7-13 (Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court asked what would happen if it grants the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:23-16:1 (Court). Red Lobster stated that the parties would go straight to the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), and that Laurich would make the AAA filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:2-24 (Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court then switched gears to whether Red Lobster violated its DRP policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:1-4 (Court). Red Lobster stated that Laurich had the burden to initiate the DRP's peer review process, but she did not do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:7-9 (Lamont). Red Lobster asserted that it \"would not in and of itself say, well, maybe we better have a peer review process of our decision to terminate this employee who never returned to work.\" Tr. at 17:9-12 (Lamont).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Laurich then returned to the podium and asserted that arbitration would be very expensive-ranging from about $7,000.00 to $20,000.00-and Laurich is unemployed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:10-13 (Bregman). Red Lobster asserted that AAA procedures hold that the company pays the fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:16-25 (Court, Lamont). Laurich argued that Red Lobster \"breach[ed] the contract\" when it failed to respond to Laurich's verbal and written complaints, pursuant to the DRP's first step.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. at 19:4-23 (Bregman)(referencing DRP at 4). Laurich asserted that the party that breaches the contract should not be allowed to enforce it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:20-23 (Bregman). The Court expressed its concern that, if a company cannot enforce an arbitration agreement when it does not first follow its policies meant to resolve disputes before they reach arbitration, then the Court would be put in \"a difficult position of determining some merits issues\" before deciding whether the arbitration clause applies. Tr. at 19:24-20:10 (Court). Laurich responded that she understands the Court's concern, but stated that those policies \"are part of the arbitration process itself ... [and] if they breach step one, then how do we get to step four if they're required to do step one?\" Tr. at 20:11-19 (Bregman). The Court asked whether Laurich alleged any claims relating to a breach of an employment contract, and Laurich said she was not bringing such a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:20-21:2 (Court, Bregman). The Court asked whether the steps leading to mediation \"are more policies than they are contracts,\" and Laurich replied that they are part of a contract, \"because that's how arbitration clauses have been continually analyzed throughout the state courts in New Mexico.\" Tr. at 21:3-10 (Court, Bregman). Laurich added: \"The overall issue [in this case] may not arise under an employment contract, but the arbitration is a contract between the employer and the employee.\" Tr. at 21:13-17 (Bregman). The Court stated that \"I thought New Mexico and the federal courts had made a distinction between policies and contracts,\" such that \"a company could have a whole bunch of policies but [they are not] contractual for purposes of an employment contract.\" Tr. at 21:18-25 (Court). Laurich replied that \"common sense tells me if it's just a policy, why are they having the employees sign off on it [unless] it's a contract?\" Tr. at 22:5-8 (Bregman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Red Lobster took to the podium and argued that the steps outlined in the DRP are not mandatory: step one-the open door step-\"says that if the employee has a workplace concern or dispute, employee should bring it to the attention of his manager-should.\" Tr. at 23:21-25 (Lamont). Red Lobster continued: \"[T]he first two steps are not musts.\" Tr. at 24:3-4\n   (Lamont). The Court asked whether there is anything \"that binds the company in any way,\" and Red Lobster answered that there was not anything that bound the company, \"but the company has to participate if the employee initiates the peer review process.\" Tr. at 24:10-15 (Court, Lamont). Red Lobster discusses the DRP's other steps, noting that \"it says that if either party doesn't like the outcome of the peer review they can request mediation,\" and, if a party is not satisfied with mediation, \"that party must demand arbitration.\" Tr. at 24:12-25:6 (Court, Lamont).

Laurich argues this is unconscionable, because: (i) she was pressured to sign it quickly, because the longer she took, the more time she would not be serving customers and earning tips; (ii) she was told that \"she would be taken off the work schedule\" if she did not sign; and (iii) she asked for a hard copy to read but was not given one. Response at 3. Although Laurich may have felt pressure to enter the agreement, these circumstances do not rise to the level of unconscionability, because they did not deprive her of a meaningful choice, and the terms were not patently unfair. The 2014 Agreement is not long, with the English language text taking up only half a page.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Agreement at 1. Laurich was familiar with an arbitration agreement's implications, because she had agreed to and worked under a similar arbitration agreement for six years before Red Lobster asked her to enter into a new one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:1-7 (Lamont). Furthermore, although the threat of being \"taken off the work schedule\" may represent a meaningful consequence, it is not permanent one; Laurich does not allege that Red Lobster threatened to fire her if she did not sign the agreement then and there. Finally, while it may have been in an adhesion contract in the sense that it was a take-it-or-leave-it offer, the terms are not so patently unfair that the agreement is unconscionable: the DRP binds both Laurich\n   and Red Lobster, and Laurich will not have to pay the arbitration fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:25 (Laurich).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This account is at odds with Laurich's written complaint-which Red Lobster submitted along with the Hochsprung Decl.-which begins by stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n    Willie [Prather] yelled [and] cussed at me to \"get the fuck out of his way\" and said [that Laurich was] \"a nasty [unintelligible] bitch.\" So we got in an argument and he threw the scoop from the [unintelligible] at me.... [T]he next day, I asked [Prather] to give me the [unintelligible] that I let him borrow the week before [and] he said \"Fuck you and [your] 20 dollars, I ain't paying you shit, you snitched on me out to [unintelligible] and James, you are a bitch ass snitch, and you are going to get [what's] coming to you.\" I was walking away and he followed me [unintelligible] hospitality yelling and cussing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Written Complaint at 1. Laurich then asserts that Prather deliberately messed up Laurich's customers' orders for four consecutive days.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Written Complaint at 2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Red Lobster's apparent failure to adequately resolve an issue does not, however, represent a breach, particularly in light of the subsequent steps that the DRP contemplates in the event that Step One is not satisfactory. Additionally, the DRP does not indicate that each step must be followed before moving onto the next.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DRP at 11-12 (stating that \"[i]t is recommended that the steps ... be followed in order,\" but not required).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
