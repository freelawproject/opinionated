SUMMARY OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Shannon Rutherford, seeks damages for personal injuries sustained on Redstone Arsenal: a 38,125 acre (7.9 square mile) United States Army garrison adjacent to the City of Huntsville in Madison County, Alabama.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Access to the Arsenal is restricted because the garrison is a military installation, and important research and development functions are performed there. More than sixty federal organizations and contractor operations occupy facilities on the Arsenal, including nine Commands of the United States Army,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   five agencies of the United States Department of Defense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the National\n   Aeronautics and Space Administration's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Persons authorized to enter the garrison do so through one of six gates, which are referred to in Army regulations as \"Access Control Points (ACPs).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The events leading to this action occurred at \"Gate 1\" on Martin Road East: a four-lane highway that traverses the Arsenal from east to west. The security guards who served at that Gate were employed by the United States Army Aviation &amp; Missile Command, and had at their disposal an \"active vehicle barrier\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   known as a \"Ground Retractable Automobile Barrier (GRAB),\" which is described as an \"electrically powered, hydraulically operated, sub-surface mounted device designed to be fully functional at stopping a vehicle attempting unauthorized entry on the installation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Colonel Michael Robert Sheehy (U.S. Army Ret.) was Director of Emergency Services at Redstone Arsenal on the date of the events leading to this suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that the GRAB Barriers at Gate 1 were located\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   approximately 900 feet from the Access Control Point itself [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the entry gate house at which Security Guards were stationed]. And in between the inbound and outbound lanes there is ... a [concrete] physical barrier that would prevent vehicles from passing from one side to the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The distance [between the gate house and GRAB System barriers] is designed to give the guards ... enough time to assess the situation and to activate the GRAB net barrier before a potential threat can enter the Arsenal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Doc. no. 51 (Transcript-Sheehy), at 42 (alterations and ellipses supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was employed at NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center as a \"Flight Systems Engineer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   She had\n   obtained permission to be off work for several hours on Thursday, May 10, 2012, on \"sick leave,\" in order to be examined by a private physician in the Huntsville Hospital Medical Mall on Governors Drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was driving her personal automobile in the right-hand, outbound lane of Martin Road at approximately 9:30 a.m., and about to exit the Arsenal through Gate 1: a point that was approximately five miles from plaintiff's NASA workplace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly before plaintiff reached the exit, however, a pick-up truck driven by an older man named Tommy Bannister approached Gate 1 from the opposite direction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Bannister did not possess credentials to enter the Arsenal, and appeared to Gate Guard James Jones to be \"a little confused\" and \"lost.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Bannister said that he was attempting to reach the municipal airport or some other address on the opposite, west side of the Arsenal, off Government property, and thought he could cut across the garrison as a means of shortening the driving distance to his intended destination. Gate Guard Jones explained to Mr. Bannister \"that he couldn't just pass through, that it was a controlled area,\" and instructed him to drive forward a few feet, to the so-called \"turn-around lane,\" where he could make a \"U-Turn\" into the outbound lanes of Martin Road.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Bannister did not follow that instruction, however. Instead, he drove past the turn-around lane,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   but only \"at an average take-off speed\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   of \"about 10 to 15 miles an hour.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones stepped into the Gatehouse and depressed a button to activate the GRAB System,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and steel-net barriers rose from the ground under\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the inbound\n   <em>\n    and outbound\n   </em>\n   lanes of Martin Road.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before Jones activated the GRAB System, he did not make any attempt to survey the outbound lanes of Martin Road in order to determine whether the barrier might impact innocent motorists about to exit the Arsenal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, plaintiff's automobile collided with the barrier that rose from the ground under the outbound lanes, and she was seriously injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   She filed an administrative claim with the United States Army Aviation &amp; Missile Command on October 30, 2012, and commenced this action on April 3, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Moreover, as a result of the fact that the radio in his vehicle \"was broken,\" he was not \"listening to any music\" and \"could hear just about anything.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, as he was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   just about to come to that barrier ...\n   <em>\n    maybe 10 yards from it, I thought I noticed out of the corner of my right eye a light change color, a traffic signal type light changing color.

The video image also established that the windows of plaintiff's automobile were rolled up when she collided with the barrier. And, Mr. Schneider emphasized that, \"[i]f my windows had been closed and/or if my radio was on, I do not think I could have\n   heard that horn or siren. It's only because my radio was off and the windows were open that I heard that horn or siren.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   He described the volume of the horn or siren as \"faint,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he could \"only guess[ ] what the visual signal and the audible signal meant. Nobody teaches that stuff out at the Arsenal, what it means .... But even worse, the signaling at the different gates [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the warning signals at Gates 1 and Gate 9] are all different.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, \"It's confusing.

Consequently, the Government did not prove that she was negligent as a matter of law for ignoring either signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

A defendant may desire to argue that reimbursement of the plaintiff for medical expenses already paid by an insurer is a double recovery. On the other hand, a plaintiff may wish to argue that the defendant reaps a windfall unless additional damages are awarded, beyond the mere expense of the insurance or other collateral-source benefits, so as to compensate the plaintiff for having the discipline and foresight to devote money or earning power to paying the expense of acquiring the insurance or other collateral-source benefits rather than paying for some immediate gratification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.
