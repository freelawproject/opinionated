(Dkt. # 53) ), Eddie Bauer's reply (Reply (Dkt. # 57) ), the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. Being fully advised,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Eddie Bauer's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Veridian alleges the following pertinent facts in its first amended complaint:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Eddie Bauer is headquartered in Washington but operates approximately 370 stores throughout the United States. (FAC \u00b6 12.) Eddie Bauer accepts credit and debit cards for payment from customers at it point-of-sale (\"POS\") registers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) In January 2016, hackers accessed Eddie Bauer's POS systems and installed malicious software (or \"malware\") that infected every Eddie Bauer store in the United States and Canada (\"the Data Breach\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Through this malware, hackers stole credit and debit card data from Eddie Bauer's systems and sold it to other individuals who made fraudulent transactions on those payment cards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 25, 29, 32, 35-36, 96-97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Veridian is an Iowa-chartered credit union with its principal place of business in Iowa. (FAC \u00b6 11.) Veridian issued payment cards compromised in the Data Breach and alleges that it suffered significant property damage to the unique data included on the payment cards (including the ruination of the payment card itself) and financial losses in connection with covering its customers' losses due to the Data Breach and in reissuing credit and debit cards to its customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 22, 96-98, 135.) Veridian alleges that the Data Breach and Veridian's injury were the foreseeable results of Eddie Bauer's inadequate data security measures, which Eddie Bauer knew were insufficient to protect against recognized threats, and Eddie Bauer's refusal to implement industry-standard security measures due to the cost of such measures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Veridian filed a putative class action complaint against Eddie Bauer on March 7, 2017. (Compl. (Dkt. # 1).) Eddie Bauer filed a motion to dismiss on April 21, 2017. (MTD (Dkt. # 28).) On June 5, 2017, instead of responding to Eddie Bauer's motion directly, Veridian filed a first amended putative class action complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC.) On June 15, 2017, Eddie Bauer filed a motion to dismiss Veridian's first amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d MTD.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its first amended complaint, Veridian alleges claims against Eddie Bauer for (1) negligence (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 119-28), (2) negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-35), (3) declaratory and injunctive relief (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136-43), (4) violation of RCW 19.255.020 (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 144-51), and (5) violation of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (\"CPA\"), RCW ch. 19.86 (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 152-65). Veridian alleges that Washington law applies to its claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112-18.) Eddie Bauer, however, asserts that Iowa law applies. (2d MTD at 3-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Veridian also brings its first amended complaint as a putative class action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-111.) Specifically, Veridian brings its action \"individually and on behalf of all other financial institutions similarly situated\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) Veridian defines its putative class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All Financial Institutions-including, but not limited to, banks and credit unions-in the United States (including its Territories and the District of Columbia) that issue payment cards, including credit\n   and debit cards, or perform, facilitate, or support card issuing services, whose customers made purchases from Eddie Bauer stores from January 1, 2016 to the present (the \"Class\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court now considers Eddie Bauer's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Veridian alleges no harm from \"the destruction of competition,\" and it alleges neither that it is a customer nor a competitor of Eddie Bauer. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FAC.) The court concludes that Section 5 of the FTC Act is not designed to protect either the class of persons that includes Veridian or the interest that Veridian alleges Eddie Bauer invaded. Thus, Section 5 of the FTC Act fails the test under Section 286 of the Restatement, and Veridian cannot allege that Eddie Bauer owes it a duty predicated on this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    RCW 19.255.020\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Unlike Section 5 of the FTC Act, however, the court finds that, in the context of this lawsuit, RCW 19.255.020 meets the test of Section 286 of the Restatement. RCW 19.255.020 states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   If a processor or business fails to take reasonable care to guard against unauthorized access to account information that is in the possession or under the control of the business or processor, and the failure is found to be the proximate cause of a breach, the processor or business is liable to a financial institution for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs related to the reissuance of credit cards and debit cards that are incurred by the financial institution to mitigate potential current or future damages to its credit card and debit card holders that reside in the state of Washington as a consequence of the breach, even if the financial institution has not suffered a physical injury in connection with the breach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   RCW 19.255.020(3)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"class of persons\" that this statute is designed to protect is comprised of \"financial institution[s]\" that have incurred \"actual costs\" related to the unauthorized access of their credit card and debit card holders' account information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722077\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/233/#p244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Veridian and its putative class of similarly situated financial institutions fall within this \"class of persons.\" In addition, the particular interest which the statute seeks to protect-the security of the financial institutions' credit card and debit\n   card holders' account information-is the same interest that would be protected by imposing a duty on Eddie Bauer with respect to Veridian's negligence claim. Finally, the harm or hazard that a violation of RCW 19.255.020 causes-actual costs due to the unauthorized access of account holders' information-is the same as the harm alleged by Veridian in its negligence claim. Accordingly, the court finds that RCW 19.255.020 meets the test set forth in Section 286 of the Restatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Based on its application of Section 286 of the Restatement, the court concludes that the \"reasonable care\" standard found in RCW 19.255.020 defines the minimum standard of conduct under Washington law for processors or businesses whose alleged failure to protect from unauthorized access credit and debit card account information that is in their possession causes damage to financial institutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20P.3d%20386\">\n    96 P.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding based on the application of the four-part test of Section 286 of the Restatement that RCW 66.44.200(1), which forbids the selling of alcohol \"to any person apparently under the influence of liquor,\" defines the minimum standard of conduct for commercial hosts whose alleged overservice causes a drunk driving accident injuring a third party);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kappelman v.

Violation of RCW 19.255.020\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Veridian alleges a claim directly based on Eddie Bauer's violation of RCW 19.255.020. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 144-51.) Eddie Bauer argues that Veridian's claim must be dismissed because Veridian fails to specifically allege that it reissued cards to Washington residents. (2d MTD at 25.) The statute states in part that, in the event of certain unauthorized cyber-intrusions, a \"business\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   or \"processor\" is liable \"to a financial institution for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs related to the reissuance of credit cards and debit cards that are incurred by the financial institution to mitigate potential current or future damages to its credit card and debit card holders that reside in the state of Washington.\" RCW 19.255.020. The court declines to hold that Veridian's allegations are inadequate here. Veridian brings this action as a putative class action on behalf of a nationwide class of financial institutions. (FAC \u00b6 99.) Veridian alleges that Eddie Bauer is Washington company with approximately 370 stores across the United States and Canada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Veridian asserts that it has more than 209,000 customers throughout the United States, including Washington. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Veridian alleges that its putative class of similarly-situated financial institutions cancelled and reissued payment cards affected by the alleged data breach in Eddie Bauer stores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Viewing these allegations in the light most favorable to Veridian, the court finds that it is reasonable to infer that financial institutions in the putative nationwide class reissued payment cards to Washington residents. Accordingly, the court denies Eddie Bauer's motion to dismiss this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

Veridian alleges that Eddie Bauer failed to take proper measures to protect account information of credit and debit card holders with respect to its POS and data security systems. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 5, 39, 40-42, 57-62, 71-76, 81, 82-86, 157.) Indeed, \"[t]he key wrongdoing at issue in this litigation\" is \"Eddie Bauer's [alleged] failure to employ adequate data security measures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.) In light of known cyber-intrusion risks and breaches, Veridian alleges that it was foreseeable that Eddie Bauer's failure to take reasonable security measures to protect the data of payment card holders would result in harm to thousands of customers and the payment card issuers, and Eddie Bauer's failure did, in fact, result in this harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7-9, 46-56, 83, 93-98.) These allegations constitute \"substantial injury\" to consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merriman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20P.3d%20351\">\n    396 P.3d at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Eddie Bauer argues, however, that Veridian nevertheless has failed to adequately allege an \"unfair act\" because consumers could have avoided the risk of data theft by paying for items at Eddie Bauer stores with cash. (2d MTD at 30.) In light of the ubiquitous use of credit and debit cards in all types of commerce, the court finds this argument disingenuous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v.

Cal. July 24, 2017) (\"[I]n a modern economy ... credit card transactions are a ubiquitous feature.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Further, the court agrees with Veridian that customers had no way of knowing that Eddie Bauer's cyber-security measures were allegedly deficient or that Eddie Bauer had allegedly failed to implement appropriate software updates or other reasonable security measures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 159.) Without this knowledge, and given the broad adoption of credit and debit cards as forms of payment in our economy, consumers had scant ability to avoid the harms engendered by Eddie Bauer's alleged security failures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Eddie Bauer further argues that Veridian has not alleged an act or practice that is \"likely to cause substantial harm\" because inadequate security practices do not by themselves cause direct harm to consumers, but rather only cause harm when the information is stolen by a third party. (2d MTD at 30.) The court agrees with Veridian that this argument distorts the causation analysis under the CPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. at 25.) Courts apply a \"but for\" proximate causation standard under the CPA, and the unfair act or practice need not be the sole proximate cause of the harm.\n   <em>\n    Indoor Billboard/Washington Inc. v.

Here, Eddie Bauer's alleged failure to take reasonable security measures constitutes an unfair act because it knowingly and foreseeably put Eddie Bauer's customers and payment card financial institutions at\n   a risk of harm from data theft and fraudulent payment card activity and this harm allegedly occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 24, 55, 156.) Because the court concludes that Veridian adequately alleges an \"unfair act\" under the CPA, the court denies Eddie Bauer's motion to dismiss Veridian's claim on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

But construing Veridian's allegations for declaratory and injunctive relief as forms of relief only, the court declines Eddie Bauer's invitation to dismiss them at this time. The court, however, may reconsider its ruling in the context of a motion for summary judgment if appropriate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    \"EMV\" stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa.

The statute defines a \"processor\" as \"an individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, government entity, or any other legal or commercial entity, other than a business as defined under this section, that directly processes or transmits account information for or on behalf of another person as part of a payment processing service.\" RCW 19.255.020(1)(h). Neither party argues that Eddie Bauer does not fall within one these definitions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Eddie Bauer argues that the Washington Legislature \"provided a carefully limited duty on the part of vendors to protect a card issuer only for costs to reissue [cards] to Washington residents.\" (Reply at 12.) First, the statutory language that Eddie Bauer relies is unclear, and the court is not convinced that RCW 19.255.020 limits damages in the manner Eddie Bauer asserts. Nevertheless, the court need not decide that issue at this juncture because the statute also expressly provides that \"[t]he remedies under this section are cumulative and do not restrict any other right or remedy otherwise available under law.\" RCW 19.255.020(6). Thus, although RCW 19.255.020(3)(a) defines the minimum standard of conduct applicable to Eddie Bauer because it meets the test set forth in Section 286 of the Restatement, the statute expressly does not restrict the remedies that Veridian may otherwise seek in an action based on negligence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Eddie Bauer also asserts that if a Washington vendor has a duty beyond simply protecting card issuers for the costs of reissuing cards to Washington residents, \"then RCW 19.255.020 would be completely unnecessary and meaningless.\" (Reply at 12-13.) The court disagrees. The remedies that the Legislature provides in the case of violation of RCW 19.255.020 are distinct from common law remedies available in a negligence action. For example, \"[i]n any legal action brought pursuant to [RCW 19.255.020(3)(a) ], the prevailing party is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the legal action.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The same is not true for a common law negligence action. Accordingly, the court rejects Eddie Bauer's argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    \"Washington's CPA is modeled after federal consumer protection laws and incorporates many ... provisions of the federal acts....
