The Court further ruled that the inclusion of these costs violated the FDCPA. Plaintiffs now seek to prevent Defendants from arguing that the inclusion of those improper costs in applications for writs of garnishment through the state courts was the result of a bona fide error due to a mistaken belief that Michigan law permitted prevailing party status for a garnishment plaintiff to carry over from the action of the underlying judgment. Plaintiffs further request the Court prevent Defendants from introducing evidence that they maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid violations of the FDCPA because none were disclosed during discovery.

Mich. Nov. 30, 2016) (Bell, J.) (discussing cases). There is no clear direction one way or other from the Sixth Circuit, though a panel has recently stated the Supreme Court's discussion in\n   <em>\n    Jerman II\n   </em>\n   \"makes clear that mistakes of state law can give rise to liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Wise v.

The conclusion is consistent with several other courts, including one from this district, to have discussed the issue. In\n   <em>\n    Harden\n   </em>\n   , the district court reasoned that each of the above justifications \"also apply to mistakes of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Harden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206997905\">\n    2016 WL 6997905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Similarly in\n   <em>\n    McDermott v.

Mass. Nov. 20, 2012), the court found that the principles used in\n   <em>\n    Jerman II\n   </em>\n   \"lead to the conclusion that section 1692k(2) does not encompass mistakes based on state law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290767\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/911/1/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees that this conclusion is the best reading of the\n   <em>\n    Jerman II\n   </em>\n   decision as applied to mistakes of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. Defendants point out there is more complexity to Michigan law than the FDCPA, and rely on an out of circuit district court decision that found \"[t]he trend in the case law appears to be toward allowing the bona fide error defense where the law is not clear.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

Wash. 2015). The cases cited in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , however, all predate the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jerman II. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4028236\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1283/#p1289\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, any additional complexities in state law are insufficient on this record to distinguish the principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Jerman II\n   </em>\n   or the courts' analyses in\n   <em>\n    Harden\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDermott\n   </em>\n   that found those principles bar debt collectors from raising a mistake of state law defense under Section 1692k.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants also point out that the Supreme Court based its decision, in part, on reasons that may be applicable to mistakes of the FDCPA, but are not applicable to mistakes of state law. Defendants focus on the safe harbor provision in the FDCPA that provides protections for debt collectors who rely on advisory opinions from the Federal Trade Commission. Defendants admit the Court's analysis found that a reading Section 1692k to encompass mistakes of the FDCPA would render that safe harbor provision largely unnecessary and would in fact provide a perverse incentive for debt collectors to refrain from seeking advice from the FTC.\n   <em>\n    Jerman II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    559 U.S. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582239,12448255\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1605/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Defendants aver that these concerns would not be present when it comes to mistakes of state law. (ECF No. 237, PageID.3014-3015). The Court does not disagree with Defendants that the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jerman II\n   </em>\n   contains analysis that is tailored to violations of the FDCPA, but that does not mean that the other principles articulated by the Court cannot be applied to mistakes of state law or are any less persuasive to the matter at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   regarding mistakes of state law will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    B. Rule 37(c)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs seek to prevent Defendants from introducing other evidence or argument that their violations are subject to the bona fide error defense because Defendants have not disclosed information indicating they maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid their violations. (ECF No. 231, PageID.2963). As noted, the third element of Section 1692k requires a debt collector to prove that \"the collector maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid\" the error.\n   <em>\n    Jerman I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127325\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/469/#p476\">\n    538 F.3d at 476-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs argue the procedures Defendants have disclosed \"do not amount to procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the violations that the Court has already found as a matter of law.\" (ECF No. 231, PageID.2964). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure to was substantially justified or is harmless.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 37(C)(1). Defendants do not meaningfully argue they had procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the errors the Court previously identified and the Court is satisfied that a ruling in Plaintiff's favor will best avoid confusing the jury and unnecessarily lengthen the trial. Therefore, the Court holds that Defendants may not raise a defense based on Section 1692k based on any claimed process that was not disclosed to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED THAT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1.
