Hanna's Orders (Record Document 156, 170, and 172) were converted to Reports and Recommendations. After independent review of the record, and consideration of the objections filed, this Court concludes that the Magistrate Judge's Reports and Recommendations (Record Document 156, 170, and 172) are correct and adopts the findings and conclusions therein as its own. Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , by agreement of counsel, the procedural arguments asserted in the Motion to Dismiss (Record Document 123), namely, whether Plaintiff, Cormier (\"Cormier\"), can maintain a direct action against Scottsdale Insurance Co. (\"Scottsdale\") because the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") preempts the Louisiana Direct Action statute, and whether the FLSA claim is a contract claim which falls outside the purview of the Louisiana direct action statute, are\n   <strong>\n    WITHDRAWN\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, the sole issue before the Court is whether Scottsdale's policy excludes coverage for the FLSA wage and hour claims brought by the Plaintiffs herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that given the Court will consider the Scottsdale policy with respect to the sole remaining issue before this Court, the Motion to Dismiss (Record Document 123) is hereby\n   converted to a Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

HANNA, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before the Court is the Motion to Reconsider filed by the defendant Scottsdale Insurance Company (\"Scottsdale\"), which seeks reconsideration of this Court's September 28, 2016 Order entered following the September 27, 2016 hearing of Scottsdale's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [rec. doc. 157]. Plaintiff, Justin Cormier (\"Cormier\"), and defendant, Dale P. Martin, Jr. (\"Martin\"), have filed Opposition, to which Scottsdale filed a Reply. [rec. docs. 163, 164 and 165].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court's September 28, 2016 Order memorialized the agreement of counsel, entered during the September 27, 2016 hearing of Scottsdale's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss that the procedural arguments asserted in the Motion to Dismiss, namely, whether Cormier can maintain a direct action against Scottsdale because the FLSA preempts the Louisiana direct action statute, and whether an FLSA claim is a contract claim which falls outside the purview of the Louisiana direct action statute, were withdrawn, and accordingly, the sole issue remaining before the Court for disposition is whether the Scottsdale policy excludes coverage for the FLSA wage and hour claims brought by the plaintiffs. The September 28, 2016 Order additionally memorialized the Court's conversion of Scottsdale's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [rec. doc. 156].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By this Motion, Scottsdale seeks reinstatement of its procedural arguments on grounds that it did not intend to withdraw its procedural arguments, and to the extent the counsel withdrew those arguments, counsel was without authority to do so. Scottsdale additionally seeks reversal of this Court's conversion of its Motion to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment. Alternatively, in the event the Court maintains its prior conversion of the Motion to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment, Scottsdale seeks clarification of the scope of discovery permitted by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the following reasons, the Motion to Reconsider [rec. doc. 157] is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a motion for reconsideration\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shield Pack, LLC v.

Scottsdale further argues that if the arguments were withdrawn by counsel, Mr. West, it \"did not authorize counsel to withdraw them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882977\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/2/606/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court has examined the transcript of the September 27, 2016 hearing and finds that there was no miscommunication. During Mr. West's argument, the Court initially advised that it \"was not running with [Scottsdale]\" with respect to its preemption argument as the case relied upon by Scottsdale \"was a different kind of case.\" [rec. doc. 159, pg. 8]. The Court then went on to explain how the direct action statute applies in a \"garden variety direct action claim.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, if the direct action statute does not apply, as argued by Scottsdale in their Motion, and the case proceeded to trial solely against an insolvent defendant and a judgment was rendered against Turnkey, then Turnkey would seek coverage under the policy and the parties would \"all be back here again arguing about policy defenses.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pg. 8-9]. Therefore, the Court proposed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   So kind of from a judicial efficiency standpoint-and I believe there is case law, and I'm sure the plaintiffs are going to tell me about it, that says that an FLSA case does have a tort element to it, albeit an intentional tort. So, I'll tell you that my inclination at this point, unless you want to persuade me otherwise, is that there is enough authority to say they can bring the claim, which allows me to address the policy language itself. And I don't think preemption applies. That was a different context.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pg. 9].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court then expressly asked Mr. West, \"Do you have a big problem with that result, Mr. West?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Mr. West responded clearly and without hesitation, \"I do not, Your Honor.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court then expressly asked plaintiffs' counsel, \"Well, you heard what I just said to Mr. West. Do you agree with that?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10]. Plaintiffs' counsel likewise agreed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court then re-confirmed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I think I can justify it with the jurisprudence, but if everybody is kind of okay with that-I mean, we might as well get to the meat of the coconut instead of go have a trial against an insolvent defendant and come back here and argue the same thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During this entire colloquy, Mr. West voiced no objection. To the contrary, he expressly agreed with the Court's proposal\n   thereby waiving Scottsdale's procedural arguments, which were unique to the procedural posture of this case given that the plaintiffs and not Turnkey had sued Scottsdale, so that the Court could resolve the ultimate question, that is, whether the Scottsdale policy excludes coverage for wage and hour claims. Indeed, had counsel not waived Scottsdale's procedural claims, the Court would have, as advised, simply rejected those arguments for the reasons stated by the Court on the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, although Scottsdale now argues that its counsel, Mr. West, was without authority to waive its procedural claims, that argument fails to meet the stringent standard required for this Court to reconsider its September 28, 2016 Order.

La. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Scottsdale essentially now argues, as it did in its Motion to Dismiss, that its policy language is clear and unambiguous and unequivocally excludes coverage for the plaintiffs' claims. Thus, extrinsic evidence was unnecessary to resolve the coverage issue. Cormier and Martin disagree. In their Opposition to both the original Motion and the instant Motion for reconsideration, both Cormier and Martin argue that the policy language is ambiguous and leads to absurd results. Both requested reasonable discovery to resolve these ambiguities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court long ago succinctly set forth the obligation of this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The purpose of liability insurance is to afford the insured protection from damage claims. Insurance contracts, therefore, should be interpreted to effect, not deny, coverage... The extent of coverage is determined from the intent of the parties as reflected by the words of the insurance policy. The role of the judiciary in interpreting insurance contracts is to ascertain the common intent of the insured and insurer as reflected by the words in the policy... When the words of an insurance contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, courts must enforce the contract as written and may make no further interpretation in search of the parties' intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Words in an insurance contract are to be given their generally prevailing and ordinary meaning, unless they have acquired a technical meaning... Courts lack the authority to alter the terms of insurance contracts under the guise of contractual interpretation when the policy's provisions are couched in unambiguous terms.... An insurance contract is construed as a whole and each provision in the policy must be interpreted in light of the other provisions so that each is given meaning. One portion of the policy should not be construed separately at the expense of disregarding other provisions.... An insurance contract, however, should not be interpreted in an unreasonable or strained manner under the guise of contractual interpretation to enlarge or to restrict its provisions beyond what is reasonably contemplated by unambiguous terms or achieve an absurd conclusion.... That is, the rules of construction do not authorize a perversion of the words or the exercise of inventive powers to create an ambiguity where none exists or the making of a new contract when the terms express with sufficient clearness the parties' intent... If, after applying the other general rules of construction, an ambiguity remains, the ambiguous contractual provision is to be construed against the insurer who furnished the policy's text and in favor of the insured finding coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

Specifically, the definitions contained in the \"Employment Practices Coverage Section\" of Scottsdale's Business and Management Indemnity Policy are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    Employees\n   </strong>\n   means any person who was, now is or shall become:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   a. a full-time or part-time employee of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   , including interns, voluntary seasonal and temporary employees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   b. any individual who applies for employment with the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n   c. any natural person who is a leased employee or is contracted to perform work for the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   , or are independent contractors of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   , but only to the extent such individual performs work or services for or on behalf of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   7.\n   <strong>\n    Insured Persons\n   </strong>\n   means all persons who were, now are or shall become:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   a. a director or officer of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   b. any\n   <strong>\n    Employee\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   c. the functional equivalent of a director, officer or\n   <strong>\n    Employee\n   </strong>\n   in the event the Company is incorporated or domiciled outside the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   8.\n   <strong>\n    Insureds\n   </strong>\n   means the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   and any\n   <strong>\n    Insured Persons\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The insuring clause found in Endorsement 36 provides coverage for \"\n   <strong>\n    Costs, Charges and Expenses\n   </strong>\n   of the\n   <strong>\n    Insureds\n   </strong>\n   which the\n   <strong>\n    Insureds\n   </strong>\n   have become legally obligated to pay by reason of a\n   <strong>\n    Wage and Hour Claim\n   </strong>\n   ... for a\n   <strong>\n    Wage and Hour Wrongful Act\n   </strong>\n   ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Applying these definitions to the insuring clause, Scottsdale would be required to pay costs, charges, and expenses to the Company (Turnkey) and any persons who \"were, now are or shall become\" directors, officers, full or part-time employees, interns, voluntary and seasonal and temporary employees, as well as any person \"who was, now are or shall become an individual who applies for employment\" if the costs, charges, and expenses were incurred by reason of a Wage and Hour Claim for a Wage and Hour Wrongful Act. In short, every person who ever was a company employee or officer-or ever was to apply to become an employee or a director or officer-could be an \"Insured\" under this section of the policy-even people not normally considered \"employees\" when the term is given its usual meaning, rendering the definitions capable of multiple meanings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The \"Directors and Officers and Company Coverage Section\" of the same policy, contains the following definitions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    Directors and Officers\n   </strong>\n   means any person who was, now is, or shall become:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   a. a duly elected or appointed director, officer or similar executive of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   , or any member of the management board of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   b. a person who was, is or shall become a full-time or part-time employee of the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   c. the functional equivalent of directors or officers of a\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   incorporated or domiciled outside the United States of America.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   5.\n   <strong>\n    Insured\n   </strong>\n   means the\n   <strong>\n    Company\n   </strong>\n   and the\n   <strong>\n    Directors and Officers\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, every person who \"was, is or shall become a full-time or part-time employee\" of the Company is not only a Director or Officer, but an Insured. If Directors and Officers were intended to include every past and future and possible full or part-time employee, then the generally recognized and accepted need for Directors and Officers insurance coverage would be rendered meaningless. Further, since the \"Insured\" purportedly agreed to this policy language, then the insured would include\n   every past and future employee, i.e. all the plaintiffs in this collective action, and all would have had to agree-a point this Court finds highly unlikely as to Scottsdale's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At the September 27, 2016 hearing, this Court stated that it \"found it puzzling that a D &amp; O policy would include every employee that there is as a D &amp; O.\" The Court had \"never seen a definition like this and it troubles me\" and that the Court was therefore \"in unchartered waters.\" [rec, doc. 159, pg. 11 and 23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court thus preliminarily suggested that the policy could be construed as ambiguous and could be read to lead to absurd results. Since by Scottsdale's interpretation of its own definition, every past or future employee could be an \"Insured,\" whether under the Employment Practices section or the Directors and Officers section, this Court determined that it would accept matters outside the pleadings of this collective action and determine the issues under the rules applicable to summary judgment motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at pg. 22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   By this Motion, without providing anything which was not available prior to this Court's September 28, 2016 Order, Scottsdale merely reasserts its prior arguments that the policy clearly and unequivocally excludes coverage and that extrinsic evidence is unnecessary, arguments which were previously considered and rejected by this Court. Although Scottsdale disagrees with this Court's determination that the Motion will be converted and determined under the standards applicable to summary judgment motions after an adequate opportunity for discovery, such disagreement does not present a clear error of law or fact, nor manifest injustice. Scottsdale's request for an additional chance to sway the Court is simply not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See Arena quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Durkin\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sundaram\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texaco Exploration &amp; Prod., Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atkins,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7856265\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/130/625/#p627\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Request for Clarification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court also need not clarify the scope of discovery which will be permitted\n   in the context of this Motion to reconsider. As previously stated during the September 27, 2016 hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court will address the nature and scope of the discovery which will be permitted after considering the Rule 56(d) and Rule 12(d) submissions of the parties.
