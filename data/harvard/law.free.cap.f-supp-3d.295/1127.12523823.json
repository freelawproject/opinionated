While driving northbound on I-15 at approximately 7:11 pm on April 8, 2017, Mr. Wrobel was pulled over by Idaho State Police Trooper Kenneth Peeples for failing to signal for five seconds before changing lanes. During the traffic stop, Trooper Peeples asked Mr. Wrobel to exit his vehicle, conducted a patdown, and then conducted a canine search of the exterior and interior of Mr. Wrobel's car. Based on the behavior of his K-9 Partner, Trooper Peeples determined he had probable cause to search the vehicle. During the search, Trooper Peeples discovered a substance that field-tested positive for methamphetamine and arrested Mr. Wrobel. Mr. Wrobel moves to suppress the evidence obtained from Trooper Peeples's search of the vehicle on the grounds that Trooper Peeples violated his Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully prolonging the traffic stop and conducting a search of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court heard testimony at an evidentiary hearing on December 5, 2017, and received closing briefs from the parties on December 11, 2017. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While patrolling I-15 on April 8, 2017, Trooper Peeples observed Mr. Wrobel change lanes without signaling for five seconds, as required by Idaho law.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 3, Dkt. 18-2. Trooper Peeples pulled Mr. Wrobel over, and approached the passenger side window of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When he arrived at the vehicle, Trooper Peeples noticed that Mr. Wrobel had rolled down both front windows.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples explained why he had stopped Mr. Wrobel, and asked him for his license, registration, and insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As Mr. Wrobel retrieved the relevant documents, Trooper Peeples invited him to roll up the driver's side window, and asked him where he was \"headed up to now.\"\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B at 19:13:13, Dkt. 18-3. Mr. Wrobel rolled the window halfway up, and informed Trooper Peeples he was going to see a friend in Montana.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 3, Dkt. 18-2. When Trooper Peeples asked how long he would be in Montana, Mr. Wrobel replied he was going for about three days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As they spoke, Trooper Peeples noticed the strong smell of air freshener coming from the vehicle, and that Mr. Wrobel's upper lip quivered when he spoke.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He again invited Mr. Wrobel to roll up the driver's side window, which was still halfway down, and Mr. Wrobel complied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples also noticed a lighter and used ashtray in the center console, and identified the program playing on the car radio as a Mormon religious music program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Wrobel handed Trooper Peeples the documents he requested, including his rental agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agreement showed that the vehicle was rented in Los Angeles on April 4, 2017 and had a return date of April 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples then asked Mr. Wrobel to close his eyes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After a moment, Trooper Peeples returned to his patrol car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this point, Trooper Peeples had developed a suspicion that Mr. Wrobel was involved in criminal activity based on his actions, the answers he gave to Trooper Peeples's questions, and Trooper Peeples's observations of him in comparison with other interactions he had in the past.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Trooper Peeples relied on the following facts: 1) The strong smell of air freshener in the vehicle; 2) the fact that Mr. Wrobel was driving a rental\n   vehicle; 3) the fact that Mr. Wrobel rolled down both windows, and didn't immediately roll up the driver's side window all the way when invited; 4) the fact that Mr. Wrobel planned to be in Montana for about three days but had rented the car for three weeks; 5) the fact that Mr. Wrobel's lip quivered when he spoke; and 6) the fact that he was playing Mormon religious music, which Trooper Peeples believed could indicate that Mr. Wrobel was overcompensating by attempting to affiliate with the local religious community.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Trooper Peeples returned to his patrol car, he reviewed the documents briefly and asked dispatch to conduct a wants and warrants check and a prior controlled substance criminal history check on Mr. Wrobel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He then exited his patrol car and returned to Mr. Wrobel's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples testified that when he decided to approach the vehicle for the second time, he was already suspicious that Mr. Wrobel was involved in criminal activity. He stated that he intended to conduct the dog sniff unless Mr. Wrobel's acted in some way to dispel that suspicion. Specifically, Trooper Peeples testified that he intended to conduct the dog sniff unless Mr. Wrobel's nervousness abated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Trooper Peeples approached the car for the second time, he asked Mr. Wrobel if there was anything illegal inside the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Wrobel responded \"no, no, no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples then asked whether his K-9 partner, Apollo, would alert to the odor of drugs coming from the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Wrobel shook his head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples asked Mr. Wrobel to exit the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Wrobel asked why he needed to exit the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples explained that he was going to have Apollo walk around the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Holding the keyless ignition fob in his hand, Mr. Wrobel pressed the ignition button on the dash of the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples testified that he heard the engine turn over, and asked why Mr. Wrobel turned the car on. Mr. Wrobel stated he was turning it off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trooper Peeples noted that the key fob did not have a rental car tag on it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Wrobel exited the vehicle and consented to a pat down search, which Trooper Peeples performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. As Trooper Peeples completed the pat down search, dispatch informed him there were no outstanding warrants for Mr. Wrobel.\n   <em>\n    Def's Br.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B at 19:17:41, Dkt. 18-3. Trooper Peeples then retrieved his K-9 partner from the car, and walked him on the leash around the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Apollo then walked back to the passenger window, and jumped through the window into the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:18:55. Trooper Peeples assisted Apollo into the vehicle, and called for backup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Trooper Peeples, he then observed Apollo engage in a trained response, which indicated the presence of illegal drugs on the driver's side floorboard.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

In\n   <em>\n    Rojas-Millan\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found the defendant's travel plans to be \"oddly vague\" and sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion when the defendant had driven nearly 200 miles to meet a friend, but did not know where he was meeting the friend or how to get in touch with him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11148348\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/464/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rojas-Millan\n   </em>\n   indicated that after meeting his friend, he intended to make the 200-mile return trip, \"a considerable distance for such a short visit,\" that same night.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11148348\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/464/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The officer specifically testified that the defendant's travel plans suggested \"a drug delivery or some type of delivery of something illegal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11148348\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/464/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, Trooper Peeples testified that he found it suspicious Mr. Wrobel intended to go to Montana for \"maybe three days,\" because his rental agreement was for three weeks, and because \"drug traffickers are often vague about trip details and tell conflicting stories to cover up their real trip plans.\"\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 8, Dkt. 23. But Trooper Peeples only asked Mr. Wrobel where he was headed \"up to now\" and failed to ask any follow-up questions regarding Mr. Wrobel's itinerary. Nor did he inquire about the length of Wrobel's rental agreement, or any apparent discrepancy between the length of the rental and Mr. Wrobel's travel plans. Mr. Wrobel did not tell any stories that conflicted with his plans to go to Montana for approximately three days. Nor was his trip plainly inconsistent with the long-term rental, particularly given the absence of facts establishing his subsequent plans. And, unlike driving 400 miles in one day for a brief meeting with a friend, going to Montana for \"probably three days\" is not so odd that it reasonably suggests a person is engaged in drug delivery or other illegal activity. Thus, the Court finds that Mr. Wrobel's travel plans do not support a reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the Court does not assign any weight to Trooper Peeples's testimony that Mr. Wrobel's reaction to being asked if there were drugs in the vehicle made Peeples suspicion of criminal activity. Trooper Peeples testified that the denial Mr. Wrobel gave to his first question, \"no, no, no\" was suspicious, but could not articulate why. He testified that repeating the word no could be interpreted either as adamant, or as not adamant. Trooper Peeples also testified that the denial Mr. Wrobel made to the second question, shaking his head, was suspicious because it was not adamant enough. The Court finds that, even accounting for officer experience and training, the Goldilocks standard employed by Trooper Peeples is inherently subjective. Thus, it is insufficient to support an objective\n   reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that the facts known to Trooper Peeples at the time he ordered Mr. Wrobel to exit the vehicle were not sufficient to support a reasonable articulable suspicion, and thus that Trooper Peeples unlawfully expanded the scope of the traffic stop at that time. Because the exit order was the \"impetus for the chain of events\" leading to the discovery of the methamphetamine, that evidence is \"tainted\" by the illegality of the seizure and must be suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276514\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/706/#p715\">\n    859 F.3d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Based on the totality of Trooper Peeples's interaction with Mr. Wrobel, there is simply no evidence to support Trooper Peeples's theory that Mr. Wrobel intended to hide the fact that he was driving a rental car, such that the absence of a tag on the key fob is significant. Instead, Mr. Wrobel openly admitted to Trooper Peeples that he was driving a rental and readily provided two separate documents indicating the car was a rental during their first interaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, the Court finds that the fact that Mr. Wrobel appeared to start the car did not objectively and reasonably indicate he was considering fleeing the scene. Trooper Peeples testified that it appeared Mr. Wrobel started the vehicle when he pressed the start/stop button because the engine turned over. The video evidence shows that Trooper Peeples was startled by something, and his reaction appears consistent with an initial suspicion that Mr. Wrobel was considering fleeing. Objectively, however, maintaining that suspicion beyond the initial moment would require discarding\n   the additional facts that were available to Trooper Peeples. Trooper Peeples testified that Mr. Wrobel made no attempt to put the car in drive. When asked why he turned the car on, Mr. Wrobel stated that he was turning it off, and exited the car without further delay. Trooper Peeples knew the car was a rental, and likely unfamiliar to Mr. Wrobel. The totality of the circumstances test must take into account \"both factors weighing for and against reasonable suspicion.\"\n   <em>\n    Manzo-Jurado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790808\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/457/928/#p938\">\n    457 F.3d at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, an objective analysis of the totality of the circumstances indicates that Mr. Wrobel was not contemplating fleeing, but was simply fumbling in an attempt to turn off a rental car with which he lacked familiarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, the Court does not find Trooper Peeples's interpretation of Mr. Wrobel's reaction to being instructed to exit the vehicle to be reasonable. Neither Trooper Peeples nor the government adequately explain why it would be objectively suspicious for a person to be confused or nonplussed at being asked to exit their vehicle and submit to a search after being pulled over for a minor traffic violation; or to question why they were being asked to do so. Nor do they explain how such behavior makes it more likely that a person is involved in criminal activity. Thus, the Court does not find that Mr. Wrobel's reaction to being asked to exit the vehicle reasonably contributed to a suspicion that he was engaged in criminal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the Court does not find that evidence of Mr. Wrobel's continued nervousness throughout the interaction was sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion. Nervousness alone is insufficient to form the basis of reasonable suspicion. And even where it is a relevant factor among many, it carries little weight because \"[e]ncounters with police officers are necessarily stressful for law-abiders and criminals alike.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, Trooper Peeples's testimony regarding Mr. Wrobel's nervousness was inconsistent. At the hearing, he stated it was the determinative factor in deciding to conduct the dog sniff, and that if Mr. Wrobel had not continued to display nervous behavior Trooper Peeples would have let him go with a warning. But Trooper Peeples's failure to even mention Mr. Wrobel's continued nervousness in the report he wrote documenting the stop undermines the credibility of his later testimony. Further, the fact that Trooper Peeples declined to document Mr. Wrobel's continued nervousness also undermines the suggested inference that it was any more pronounced than that of a typical driver. For these reasons, the Court finds that Mr. Wrobel's nervousness was insufficient to support reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The facts available to Trooper Peeples did not objectively give rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that Mr. Wrobel was involved in criminal activity.

As the discovery of the methamphetamine was the fruit of the unlawfully prolonged stop, it must be suppressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276514\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/706/#p715\">\n    859 F.3d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the Court will grant the Defendant's Motion on the grounds that Trooper Peeples lacked reasonable articulable suspicion to expand or prolong the stop, it necessarily follows that he lacked probable cause to search Mr. Wrobel's vehicle. The Court will therefore not address that related argument by the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   1.

Even absent this explanation, however, the Court does not agree that Mr. Wrobel's initial failure to roll up his driver's side window, while also searching for and his paperwork and responding to questions from Trooper Peeples, reasonably indicated that he was attempting to cover up the smell of narcotics.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Court also finds that Trooper Peeples's subjective analysis of the second interaction was less credible because it appeared to be colored by his admitted predetermination that Mr. Wrobel was engaged in criminal activity. This finding is supported by contradictory testimony given by Trooper Peeples during the hearing, and the Court's own objective analysis of these factors. Thus, the Court considers all the relevant facts available to Trooper Peeples, but assigns less weight to the inferences Trooper Peeples drew from these facts.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p17\">\n     392 U.S. at 21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p17\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1868\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
