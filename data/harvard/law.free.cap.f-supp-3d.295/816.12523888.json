Bowman, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case involves the thorny issue of how to determine whether a standard contingency fee agreement in a social security\n   case should be approved as a \"reasonable\" fee, or reduced to avoid an impermissible \"windfall.\" Pursuant to local practice, the attorney's motion for the award of such a fee has been referred to the undersigned for initial review. For the reasons stated, and adhering to five guideposts established by controlling case law, the undersigned recommends that the requested fee be reduced in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For a variety of reasons, the wheels of justice turn slowly in social security cases. This case presents a particularly egregious example. Plaintiff Charles Ringel alleges he became disabled more than a dozen years ago, in September 2005. After his March 2008 application for benefits was initially denied, Plaintiff's case remained under review by the Social Security Agency for more than four years, until May 2012, when the Appeals Council denied further review. Dissatisfied, Plaintiff, through counsel, filed a federal judicial appeal in July 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Ringel's appeal was one of nearly 20,000 such appeals filed annually nationwide, and one of 42 filed by his attorney, Ms. Pehowic, that same year in this district alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the percentage of adverse disability decisions appealed to the federal courts is a small fraction of the half million decisions decided annually at the administrative level, such appeals make up approximately 7% of all civil cases on federal court dockets, nearly all of which are referred to magistrate judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the cases in which a claimant\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursues such relief, a judicial appeal often meets with success. Despite great variability among district courts, the rate of reversal on judicial appeal of adverse disability decisions nationally averages approximately 45%, with district courts within the Sixth Circuit remanding-on average-36.9% of the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to a 2016 report, the Southern District of Ohio, which ranks among the \"top ten\" districts nationwide as measured by the number of decided cases, averages a 46.6% remand rate for SSA appeals, close to the national mean.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite the large volume of social security appeals, few judicial decisions are published.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Just over four years ago, Mr. Ringel became a successful appellant, winning a remand for further administrative review of his disability claim under sentence four of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 16, 17). After this Court entered Judgment, the Court granted Ms. Pehowic's unopposed motion for an award of her fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\"), awarding $3,315.00 for the hours put to effective use in this Court, plus the filing fee. (Doc. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After remand, the case went through multiple additional administrative proceedings, resulting in the passage of several more years before Mr. Ringel at last obtained a favorable decision: an award of past-due benefits dating back to March 2007. Because benefits had accrued for more than a decade by the time that the May 2, 2017 Notice of Award was issued, the amount of those benefits had grown large, totaling $130,943.00. Based upon a contingency agreement signed in 2010, Ms. Pehowic timely filed a motion seeking an award of attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion seeks $26,735.75 as compensation for the 19.5 hours that counsel spent before this tribunal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Commissioner filed a memorandum in opposition, arguing that the requested fee constitutes \"a windfall at the expense of her disabled client.\" (Doc. 23 at 1). The Commissioner points out that the award sought by Plaintiff's counsel amounts to an extraordinarily high hourly rate, effectively $1,371 per hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing multiple cases in which fees have been reduced under similar \"windfall\" reasoning, and chiefly relying on the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lasley v. Com'r of Soc. Sec.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290550\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/308/\">\n    771 F.3d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2014), the Commissioner asks this Court to reduce the fee award to an effective rate of $400 per hour. In her reply memorandum, Ms. Pehowic offers to compromise her fee award to an effective rate of $750 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The undersigned now recommends that counsel's motion be granted, but that the award be reduced to an effective rate of $600.00 per hour, which appropriately honors the contingent nature of the fee contract, but avoids a windfall occasioned almost solely by the exceptionally slow pace of justice in this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Unique Nature of Contingency Fee Agreements in the Context of Social Security Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Social Security Act requires federal courts to \"determine and allow as\n   part of its judgment a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   fee ... not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). By statutorily capping contingency fee contracts in social security cases at 25%, Congress attempted to protect often-desperate (and sometimes mentally incompetent) plaintiffs from giving up too much of their awards for the sake of obtaining legal representation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute makes charging a fee in excess of the statutory cap a criminal offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Case law emphasizes the affirmative obligation of courts to determine whether a fee award is \"reasonable,\" even when supported by an unopposed motion that relies on a standard contingency fee agreement within the 25% statutory cap.\n   <em>\n    Lowery v. Com'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223189\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/689/#p691\">\n    940 F.Supp.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691 (S.D. Ohio 2013) (approving unopposed motion for fee where counsel did not request full 25% fee authorized by agreement, but instead voluntarily reduced fee to 14.5% of past-due benefits award). A primary reason for all this scrutiny is that, unlike the EAJA award received by Ms. Pehowic in 2014 for the same work, the \u00a7 406(b) fee award is paid directly out of, and therefore directly reduces, the amount of the past-due benefits paid to the disabled claimant.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royzer v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536530\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/981/#p982\">\n    900 F.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 982 (6th Cir. 1990) (reversing trial court's flat rejection of a contingent fee agreement, but warning that \"[c]ontingent fees in social security cases are different than in other cases of the law because Congress has put the responsibility on the federal judiciary to make sure that fees charged are reasonable and do not unduly erode the claimant's benefits\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Still, federal courts-far more accustomed to enforcing contracts than to breaking them-are understandably reluctant to rewrite the key term of a facially valid contract for payment between a lawyer and his/her client. Because standard contingency agreements universally seek the statutory maximum fee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   courts have only two choices: to approve the 25% contract as written or to reduce that award, implicitly voiding the contract. Yet, if fees are reduced below the contracted amount, will counsel still be fairly compensated for what clearly was meritorious work? If too many contingency fee awards are reduced by courts, will practitioners disappear, leaving no one to file judicial appeals on behalf of worthy claimants who have no ability to do so themselves? After all, \"[r]ational\n   plaintiffs-or their representatives-do not embark on extended litigation journeys unless they think they are sufficiently likely to win or expect to gain something very valuable when they do win (or both).\"\n   <em>\n    A Study of Social Security Litigation in the Federal Courts\n   </em>\n   , 2016 Full Report at 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, review of \u00a7 406(b) fee motions continues to challenge trial courts. Although the instant motion is contested, most such motions are unopposed since the only party with any financial incentive is the disabled claimant, who previously agreed to the contingent fee agreement and whose attorney has filed the motion with his client's presumed consent. Unopposed motions are more likely to be granted by busy courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Unlike the underlying judicial appeal or an EAJA award, the Commissioner has no direct financial stake in the \u00a7 406(b) fee. Filing any opposition to a fee motion not only requires the Commissioner's attorney to devote scarce resources to briefing a matter in which his client will not benefit, but also requires counsel to reverse his/her earlier role and advocate in support of the Commissioner's previous opponent, who has not asked for such assistance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

Unfortunately, in some cases in which the Commissioner has filed opposition in a limited \"trustee\" role, the effort has been met with hostility from the reviewing court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Evolution of \"Windfall\" Case Law: In Search of Consistency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Consistency is the hallmark of any effective judicial system. In the context of social security fee awards, inconsistency persists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lack of consistency feeds upon\n   itself, encouraging satellite litigation that results in more time spent trying to determine a fee award than on the merits of the underlying case. With the modest ambition of amplifying the concerns previously expressed in controlling case law, including but not limited to the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lasley v. Com'r\n   </em>\n   , the undersigned magistrate judge undertakes the Sisyphean task of clarifying when a discretionary award of a \u00a7 406(b) contingency fee amounts to an impermissible windfall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I begin with\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht v.

The Ninth Circuit used a strict \"lodestar\" approach, defining a \"reasonable rate\" almost\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   by reference to a standard hourly rate times the number of hours expended, consistent with fee-shifting statutes. In so doing, the Ninth Circuit declined to give effect to contingency fee agreements, allowing courts to consider them as only one of a dozen factors that could hypothetically alter the lodestar rate, but with no requirement that courts so much as articulate that consideration. By contrast, the Sixth Circuit started not with a flat lodestar fee, but with the contingency fee agreement, giving those agreements presumptive but not absolute weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriquez v.

Where an attorney has a \"standard rate\" for comparable noncontingent fee cases, it is appropriate for this Court to consider such evidence. As a practical matter, however, few attorneys who practice exclusively in the area of social security law will be able to produce such evidence, because like Ms. Pehowic, they simply do not take on noncontingent fee cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Barring any evidence of counsel's standard rate in noncontingent social security cases,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   courts have adopted the hourly rate that the attorney receives under the EAJA as proxy for the \"standard rate\" in the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   test.

In the phrase \"standard rate,\" the word \"standard\" is an adjective, akin in meaning to \"normal,\" \"average,\" or \"typical.\" The suggestion by\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   that the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   use of a \"standard rate\" should not represent \"\n   <em>\n    average or typical\n   </em>\n   hourly rates\" but instead should reflect \"the\n   <em>\n    highest\n   </em>\n   rate routinely accepted\" flips on its head the most common meaning, and undercuts the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   for choosing a multiplier of 2. Moreover, in rejecting evidence of the plaintiff attorney's stated hourly billing rate of $150,\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   disregards\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht\n   </em>\n   (which suggested as a comparison rate the attorney's \"normal\" rate for non-contingent work). Finally, while a different \"standard rate\" (even if EAJA-based) may apply in other districts,\n   <em>\n    Lasley\n   </em>\n   recognized and affirmed this Court's use of an EAJA rate as the \"standard rate\" in the Southern District of Ohio. In short, the EAJA-based \"standard rate\" has been sufficiently established in the Southern District of Ohio to be entitled to presumptive weight under\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   in the absence of evidence of counsel's normal billing rate for comparable, noncontingent work. Ms. Pehowic's proffer of state bar data does not overcome that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Importantly, the presumptive use of EAJA rates in the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   test does build in consideration of state bar data over time, because the EAJA rate ultimately is derived from that data. Submission of state bar data makes a great deal of sense in the EAJA context, where the focus is\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   on the statutory rate and lodestar, as opposed to the \u00a7 406(b) context, in which the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   test is only the first of several factors used to evaluate windfall. The EAJA limits counsel to an hourly rate of $125 \"unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved justifies a higher fee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A).

First, the 2013 OSBA report reflects that only six practitioners of social security law statewide reported their billing rates, a very small sample size. Further complicating the issue is the fact that virtually all social security cases are taken on a contingency basis, leaving the undersigned to wonder whether the few practitioners who responded are an anomaly unto themselves. The same report reflects widespread gender disparities in hourly billing rates, and that social security practitioners may earn less than attorneys who practice in other areas. Even if the extremely small sample size is considered, their \"median\" hourly billing rate is $250. And, Ms. Pehowic's reference to attorneys with more than 26 years of practice is perplexing since she had practiced for 10 years at the time she worked on this case. The hourly rate for attorneys across all areas of practice with 6-25 years of practice was $200. Other statistics cited by Plaintiff make no distinction between partners at large downtown firms practicing in the areas of health care or environmental law, and the solo practitioner practicing social security or family law. In contrast to any of the referenced data, counsel states that she exclusively handles social security disability claims on a contingent fee basis, and admittedly earns \"a great deal less than $350 per hour\" in the cases in which she files judicial appeals. (Doc. 21 at 5). In short, the undersigned finds the amount previously awarded to Ms. Pehowic under the EAJA for the same work in this case ($170 per hour) is an appropriate standard rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The average remand rate for social security appeals has not significantly changed in the decades since\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   was decided.

In this case, a contingency fee applied to more than a decade's worth of past-due benefits, including the accrual of more than three years' worth of benefits after remand was recommended, should give any court pause. The slow pace of justice for Mr. Ringel clearly resulted in an inordinately large past-due award. While Ms. Pehowic is to be commended for her patience and persistence (particularly at the administrative level which is not compensable by this Court), the fact remains that she spent only 19.5 compensable hours on this case under \u00a7 406(b). Having endured the injury of being disabled for more than a decade without access to the benefits to which he was entitled, Mr. Ringel should not be further penalized by an unreasonably large reduction of his long-awaited benefits in favor of his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

An unusually high number may signal greater difficulty, but also could reflect the expenditure of \"unnecessary hours\" that do nothing but reduce the effective hourly rate below the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   floor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jeter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786472\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/371/\">\n    622 F.3d at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that attorneys could have \"a perverse incentive to delay proceedings or expend unnecessary hours\" if courts focus exclusively on the hourly rate).

In such cases, counsel should not pay a penalty for efficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In this case, the issues presented in Mr. Ringel's appeal were not novel or complex, but represent routine claims. The case did not require any level of federal appellate review beyond this Court. Under\n   <em>\n    Rodriquez\n   </em>\n   , such factors favor a reduction of fees. In her reply, Ms. Pehowic points out that the Commissioner does not argue that she expended \"minimal effort\" or that she acted improperly or provided ineffective assistance. But again, the fact that counsel was guilty of no misconduct does not immunize her fee from windfall reduction. Nor does the fact that Ms. Pehowic's work can be described as \"simple and routine\" detract from the reality that she performed her job admirably, achieving a significant benefit on Mr. Ringel's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Consistent with the high volume nature of social security practice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to illustrate the routine nature of the work performed in this case, the undersigned undertook review of five appeals filed by Ms. Pehowic in the same month as Mr. Ringel's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   As expected, each case was initiated with a virtually identical \"boilerplate\" complaint. Each of the five\n   Statements of Errors liberally cites well-established case authority and arguments, reflecting no significant legal research, but instead tailoring standard arguments to the medical record in each case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each Statement is formulaic, beginning with a regurgitation of the claimant's medical history and standard of review applicable to this Court. Mr. Ringel's case involved just two claims developed over 9 pages: (1) the improper evaluation of medical opinion evidence; and (2) the improper evaluation of his credibility. All five of the cases filed by Ms. Pehowic that month included the first claim, and three included the improper evaluation of the claimant's credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition to pointing out the routine nature of Mr. Ringel's case, the Commissioner quibbles with a few of Ms. Pehowic's hours, noting the relative brevity of hours spent on brief-writing (consistent both with the routine arguments and Ms. Pehowic's experience), but contrasting other time entries that suggest clerical or administrative time, or otherwise appear excessive for the nature of the task (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 2 hours for that 1.5 page boilerplate complaint). In her reply, Ms. Pehowic implies that the Commissioner should be deemed to have waived any concerns with the number of hours, because the Commissioner filed no objection to those same 19.5 hours in opposition to her EAJA motion. \"It would be entirely inappropriate for Plaintiff to submit a different timesheet with the Application for EAJA fees and expenses as compared with the current motion for fees under \u00a7 406(b), since both requests for fees relate to the same body of work.\" (Doc. 24 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The undersigned finds no waiver. In the context of the EAJA petition, the much smaller fee award may not have merited the Commissioner's time in a cost/benefit analysis. Admirably, given the fact that the Commissioner does not reap any direct benefit, the opposition to the \u00a7 406(b) motion has been filed not to represent the Commissioner, but on behalf of the disabled claimant whose interests in retaining his benefits and proportional risk of loss are much greater. And, while the undersigned expresses no view on the propriety of claiming a smaller number of hours under \u00a7 406(b), the law requires a reduction under \u00a7 406(b) to avoid a windfall. If no other factor favored reduction, the undersigned may well approve the hours as reasonable overall, since they fall within the standard range. However, in combination with the other factors discussed, the quality and quantity of hours expended on such routine claims favor a downward adjustment of fees in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Whether Counsel Has Already Compromised The Fee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In many unpublished cases in which an unusually high effective hourly rate has been awarded, the trial court will do so after noting that the fee requested does not, in fact, represent the full contracted amount. In those cases, courts point out that the motions reflect a voluntary compromise\n   of the contingent fee well below the agreed-upon 25%, in recognition of the fact that the contract would result in a windfall.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223189\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/689/#p691\">\n    940 F.Supp.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting unopposed motion where counsel sought only 14.5% of past-due benefits representing an effective hourly rate of $406, rather than full contingent fee);\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

This common error leads Ms. Pehowic to mistakenly calculate her effective hourly rate as $1,201 per hour rather than the true rate of $1,371 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   It is true that the EAJA's Savings Clause bars duplicative awards, and that an attorney who recovers a second, larger fee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) must refund the duplicate EAJA fee to the claimant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the effective hourly rate can be calculated only prior to the subtraction of the\n   <em>\n    duplicate\n   </em>\n   prior EAJA award; subtracting the EAJA award from the total fee sought is incorrect, as the EAJA fee is a wash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Ms. Pehowic seeks a total\n   fee of $26,735.75. Her effective hourly rate is calculated by reference to that total (including her prior EAJA award) divided by the total number of hours expended. The return of an EAJA fee is not a compromise and does not reduce the effective hourly fee sought but only prevents double recovery for the same work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Ms. Pehowic's second subtraction, of the $6,000 she will receive for her work performed at the administrative level under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), is consistent with the Social Security Administration's retention of an aggregate 25% of the past-due benefits in its Notice of Award. It is unclear whether Ms. Pehowic intended that subtraction to reflect a voluntary compromise of her fee. However, in contrast to the subtraction of the EAJA offset, the subtraction of a fee received for work performed at the administrative level does constitute a true \"compromise\" under Sixth Circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Agency's withholding practice is consistent with the view of several circuits which hold that the 25% cap on attorney's fees applies to the\n   <em>\n    aggregate\n   </em>\n   of fees paid for counsel's work performed both at both the administrative level and in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

However, in the Sixth Circuit, the 25% cap on attorney's fees applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to fees awarded under \u00a7 406(b), and has no bearing on the separate award of \u00a7 406(a) fees made by the agency.\n   <em>\n    Horenstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523585\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/261/\">\n    35 F.3d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wrenn ex rel.

The impact of the Sixth Circuit's approach increases the amount of payment that may be recoverable by plaintiff's attorneys, since they are permitted to seek the full 25% of past-due benefits under \u00a7 406(b) without any reduction to account for the agency's payment under \u00a7 406(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Ms. Pehowic's initial motion for fees seeks an unusually high effective hourly rate of $1,371, but still reflects some \"compromise\" to the extent that her contingent fee contract and\n   <em>\n    Horenstein\n   </em>\n   allow a maximum total award of $32,735.75, at an effective rate of $1,678.75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Ms. Pehowic's reply memorandum offers greater compromise, reducing her effective rate to $750 per hour, for a total award of $14,625, a sum that is less than half the maximum fee she could have sought under Sixth Circuit law. That degree of compromise is significant, but must be considered in proportion to other guideposts, including the significant delay in this case.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

As discussed above, such opposition is relatively rare, and is taken seriously in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Because fee awards ultimately require the exercise of discretion, the list of five guideposts set forth above is not intended to be exhaustive. While not as common, additional factors that may warrant a reduction include: (1) whether counsel failed to first seek a fee under the EAJA (since that fee is paid by the Commissioner); and (2) whether specific language in the fee contract provides for an \"aggregate\" approach to the 25% cap, or if some other contractual element disfavors an award of the statutory maximum fee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Although the undersigned has endeavored to exercise her judicial discretion in a manner consistent with those guideposts, the referral of a discretionary motion does not alter the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review applicable to any objections made by the parties to the district judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCombs v.

Conclusions and Recommendations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht\n   </em>\n   , this Court begins with the contingency fee agreement, which here authorized the statutory maximum fee of 25% of the past-due benefits award. Because the motion was timely filed under Local Rule 54.2 with no evidence of attorney misconduct, the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   test is applied to determine whether further analysis is warranted to prevent a windfall. The standard EAJA rate previously awarded for the same work is presumed to apply for that test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Ms. Pehowic's initial motion sought a fee 8 times the standard rate, well above the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   floor. Even in her reply memorandum, she continues to seek an award that is 4.4 times her previously awarded standard rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   When the requested fee exceeds the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   floor, as it does here, the Court will further consider the following guideposts: (1) the number of years that past benefits have accrued and whether extraordinary delay has resulted in an inordinately large past-due benefits award (without regard to any fault of counsel); (2) the quality and quantity of hours, including the typicality of claims, the efficiency of the attorney performing those hours, and any non-compensable work; (3) the extent to which counsel has compromised the fee; and (4) whether the motion is opposed by the Commissioner, and/or any other factors that provide a reasoned basis for the exercise of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   On the record presented, four of the five factors favor some reduction (the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   test, the extraordinary delays that resulted in an inordinately high past-due benefits award, the quality and quantity of hours, and the Commissioner's opposition). Counsel's somewhat belated offer to significantly compromise her fee lessens the need for reduction, but must be viewed in the context of, and in proportion to, the record as a whole. All in all, the undersigned recommends that a \"reasonable\" fee be awarded in the amount of $11,700. That sum reflects an effective hourly rate of $600, which-at more than 3.5 times counsel's standard rate-adequately compensates her for the contingent nature of her contracted fee for work performed in this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   without straying into the realm of a windfall at the expense of her long-suffering client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   1.

Past-due benefits are awarded in the amount of $48,000. Attorney seeks $12,000 under \u00a7 406(b), but promises to return the $1,800 EAJA fee as required to avoid double-payment. If an offset is used for convenience, the net additional fee would be $10,200, reflecting 25% of a large past-due benefits award (the full $12,000) less the offset/return of the earlier EAJA award. The offset provides only a convenient shortcut to the need for counsel to write a check to return the $1,800 overpayment. The offset prevents a double recovery but does not reduce the total fee award. The total fee remains $12,000 and represents an effective hourly rate of $1,200: [$1,800 (EAJA fee previously awarded) + $12,000 (\u00a7 406(b)(1) fee requested) - $1,800 (fee to be refunded to Plaintiff) = $12,000].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"40\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Of course, an attorney who seeks to recover a full 25% contingent fee under\n    <em>\n     Horenstein\n    </em>\n    may face practical challenges to recovering the additional payment directly from his/her disabled client.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Booth v.
