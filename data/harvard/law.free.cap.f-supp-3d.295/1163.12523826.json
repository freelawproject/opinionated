Thus, after the third alleged representation was made, the parties negotiated and memorialized obligations related to the third representation as part of the Amendment; in particular, RE/MAX obligated itself to provide certain additional marketing services.

It seeks to hold RE/MAX liable for being incapable of providing services that RE/MAX allegedly knew it could not provide when the third representation was made. Docket No. 56 at 28, \u00b6 59-60. To the extent that, through the Amendment, RE/MAX did not obligate itself to provide such services, the economic loss rule bars Quicken Loans' claim.

[# 37-1 at \u00b6 28]. But it alleges no facts, taken as true, that allow the court to provide sufficient notice to Defendant as to what subset of \"confidential\" information constitutes the \"trade secrets,\" or whether all the information is both \"confidential\" and \"trade secret.\" Nor does Plaintiff aver facts to allow the court to conclude that the alleged \"trade secrets\" meet the statutory definition. For instance, Quicken Loans generally avers that it \"took measures to prevent [the information] from becoming available to persons other than those [whom Plaintiff] selected,\" [# 37-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72], but that allegation merely mirrors the statutory language. Quicken Loans does not allege facts that lead the court to that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   [# 37-1]. Plaintiff does not allege that it required its own employees with access to the trade secrets to enter non-disclosure agreements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It does not allege that it separated its trade secrets from other confidential information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Plaintiff does not allege that it subjected the separated trade secrets to heightened protection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Quicken Loans fails to aver facts to support the conclusion that it allowed authorized individuals to access its \"trade secrets\" only for \"a limited purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Quicken Loans Inc. v.

These additional allegations address some of Judge Wang's findings by describing two alleged trade secrets with more particularity. First, Quicken Loans has alleged that it disclosed its \"unique technology that could identify any lead generated by a RE/MAX agent or the remax.com website[,] how that lead could be directed from the RE/MAX agent or the remax.com website to Quicken Loans[,] and how to secure customized information about that homebuyer's location and needs.\" Docket No. 56 at 21-22, \u00b6 31. Second, Quicken Loans has alleged that it disclosed \"how its automation and business processes could enable Quicken Loans to resurrect 'cold' leads from RE/MAX agents and return potential homebuyers to RE/MAX agents while also prequalifying them for mortgage loans, thus making their home buying process quicker and more efficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n    at 22, \u00b6 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Quicken Loans also added allegations related to the security precautions it uses to protect its alleged trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n    at 23-24, \u00b6 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Movants argue that Quicken Loans' allegations are insufficient because \"Quicken Loans failed to even identify what information it believes RE/MAX misappropriated, as opposed to simply describing all the allegedly trade secret information to which RE/MAX had access.\" Docket No. 61 at 11. The Court rejects this argument. The Court finds that Quicken Loans' allegations plausibly allege that trade secret information was passed to RE/MAX. Moreover, Quicken Loans' additional allegations are sufficient to identify the nature of the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SBM Site Servs., LLC v. Garrett\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-00385-WJM-BNB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20628619\">\n    2012 WL 628619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D. Colo. Feb. 27, 2012) (explaining that there is no heightened pleading standard for trade secret claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Movants argue that Quicken Loans fails to plausibly allege that RE/MAX and Motto obtained trade secrets by improper means through misrepresentations. Docket No. 61 at 11-12. In particular, movants argue the counterclaims contain no allegations about when Quicken Loans disclosed trade secrets and therefore\n   there is no basis to infer that trade secrets were disclosed as a result of misrepresentations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20628619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Quicken Loans does not respond to this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 71 at 8-10. The Court agrees with movants that Quicken Loans' failure to allege that it disclosed trade secrets after RE/MAX made misrepresentations is fatal to its claim with respect to RE/MAX. Given that the NDA and Agreement provide a valid basis for RE/MAX to possess Quicken Loans' trade secrets, unless the trade secrets were disclosed after the alleged misrepresentations were made, RE/MAX would have had no reason to know that the trade secrets were acquired by improper means, an essential element of the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513702\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/823/#p847\">\n    9 F.3d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Quicken Loans' seventh counterclaim against RE/MAX for failing to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With respect to Motto, movants argue that Motto's employment of individuals who had access to Quicken Loans' trade secret information is not enough to state a claim. Docket No. 61 at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ciena Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Further, as with the breach of NDA claim discussed above, movants argue that Quicken Loans' allegations that its trade secrets were misappropriated and used are conclusory. Docket No. 61 at 10-11. Quicken Loans argues that this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Ciena\n   </em>\n   because the \"same employees who were working with Quicken Loans' trade secret information...were set up as the senior executives in a brand new competitor, with timing so close that they would have had to be working on the two projects simultaneously.\" Docket No. 71 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Quicken Loans further argues that it has alleged the difficulties that movants would have faced starting a mortgage business without using its trade secret information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203489915\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ciena,\n   </em>\n   a defendant hired the plaintiff's former employee who had access to trade secrets related to the plaintiff's business strategies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203489915\">\n    2010 WL 3489915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The Court found that the defendant's employment of plaintiff's former employee was not enough to show misappropriation because it did not show that the employer misappropriated the trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203489915\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court rejected the proposition that Colorado's Uniform Trade Secrets Act \"impos[es] strict liability on a corporation that hires a person possessing others' trade secrets\" and found that, without \"specific factual averments\" of disclosure or use, the Court could not impute the employee's acquisition of trade secrets to his new employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203489915\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As movants argue, Quicken Loans' counterclaims lack any specific factual allegations of disclosure of trade secrets to Motto by RE/MAX's former employees and also lack any specific factual allegations of how such employees used Quicken Loans' trade secrets at Motto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Quicken\n   Loans simply alleges in conclusory fashion that Motto \"used Quicken Loans' confidential information (including its trade secrets) to launch its operations.\" Docket No. 56 at 27, \u00b6 50. Moreover, as the Court found in the context of Quicken Loans' breach of NDA claim, Quicken Loans' allegations that Motto would have had a reason to use its trade secret information is insufficient to state a claim that it actually did so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203489915\">\n    2010 WL 3489915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding that allegations that the defendant would benefit from \"using and exploiting\" trade secrets were conclusory and insufficient). Therefore, the Court will also dismiss Quicken Loans' ninth counterclaim for misappropriation of trade secrets against Motto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Tortious Interference with a Contract Against Motto\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In order to state a claim against Motto for tortious interference with a contract, Quicken must allege facts showing: (1) a contract existed, (2) Motto knew of the contract, (3) Motto induced RE/MAX to breach the contract, and (4) Quicken Loans was injured as a result of the breach.\n   <em>\n    Nobody in Particular Presents, Inc. v.

Plaintiff alleges only that Mr. Morrison and Mr. Scoville, who are not named Defendants to this litigation, had the opportunity to misappropriate and/or interfere. See [# 37-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32].

R. Civ. P. 8. Docket No. 71 at 8. The Court disagrees. As Judge Wang found, plaintiff does not allege any facts from which a factfinder could infer that Motto itself knew of the Agreement before it was breached or intentionally interfered with the Agreement, both of which are required elements of a claim for tortious interference with a contract.\n   <em>\n    Nobody in Particular Presents, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254619\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/311/1048/#p1115\">\n    311 F.Supp.2d at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
