In addition, iBestBargains moves to strike two affidavits appended to Plaintiffs' opposition to iBestBargains' motion. For the reasons that follow, iBestBargains' motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is one front in a multi-theater war by major textbook publishing companies against textbook counterfeiters in this District. The following facts are gleaned from the Complaint and are presumed true for the purposes of this motion. Plaintiffs are publishers and distributors of physical and digital textbooks and own copyrights in certain textbooks at issue in this action. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.) These textbooks also bear certain trademarks and service marks that Plaintiffs registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. (Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The crux of the Complaint is that Defendants infringed Plaintiffs' copyrights and trademarks by engineering an international scheme to reproduce, import, distribute, and sell counterfeit versions of Plaintiffs' textbooks beginning in 2015 and continuing to this day. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 27.) Defendants-such as Mehul Mathrani in the United States and Ankush Sharma and Anshoo Sharma in India-allegedly perpetrated the scheme by creating a profusion of online accounts with wholesalers to whom they then sold counterfeit textbooks using automated \"buyback\" tools on the wholesalers' websites. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 31-35, 39-41.) To ship the books to the wholesalers, the Indian operators of the online accounts sometimes provided the textbooks to shipping companies known as \"freight forwarders\" for delivery into the United States. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) Once the books arrived in the United States, they were delivered to the wholesalers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 36.) Other times, the Indian operators of the online accounts shipped the counterfeit textbooks from India with the help of international logistics companies. (Compl. \u00b6 40.) In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants-such as Mehul Mathrani and iBestBargains-received bulk shipments of textbooks from India by seaborne freight, which they re-sold to wholesalers and individual consumers through online marketplaces, such as Amazon. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 42-45.) Relevant to the issues raised in iBestBargains' motions, the Complaint alleges that iBestBargains purchased counterfeit textbooks from Radhika International, a known provider of counterfeit textbooks, for resale in the United States, and that the Sharma Defendants directed\n   counterfeit textbooks to iBestBargains for resale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Personal Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On a Rule 12(b)(2) motion, a plaintiff bears the burden of showing jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Metro.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45, 47.) Plaintiffs attach a declaration describing their investigator's \"test\" purchases from third-party online sellers of textbooks distributed by iBestBargains, including the two examples enumerated in paragraph 45 of the Complaint. (Declaration of Michael Candore, ECF No. 83 (\"Candore Decl.\").) These test purchases, which Plaintiffs determined to be counterfeit, were shipped from Texas addresses associated with\n   iBestBargains to an investigator's address in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Another declaration submitted by Plaintiffs describes three categories of New York contacts. First, between January 1, 2015 and September 17, 2017, iBestBargains made 1,124 sales of books to New York consumers on three online marketplaces, representing 7.09% of iBestBargains' total sales on those marketplaces. (Declaration of Kerry M. Mustico, ECF No. 82 (\"Mustico Decl.\") \u00b6 6.) iBestBargains derived $21,741.44 in revenue from these New York sales, which constitutes 6.23% of its total revenue on these marketplaces. (Mustico Decl., Ex. 2.) Although iBestBargains made sales through other online marketplaces, it has not produced the corresponding sales information. (Mustico Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Second, the declaration avers that iBestBargains operates a website at www.acadymix.com through which it sells Plaintiffs' textbooks and advertises shipment anywhere in the United States. (Mustico Decl. \u00b6 10.) Third, Plaintiffs allege that iBestBargains granted a power of attorney authorizing Priority Airfreight NY, Ltd., a New York entity, to act on behalf of iBestBargains with respect to \"all shipments of books imported, exported, or transported to or by\" iBestBargains. (Mustico Decl. \u00b6 11.) In the four-and-a-half months after executing the power of attorney, iBestBargains received 39 shipments of books totaling 27,712 pounds from Radhika International.

CPLR \u00a7 302(a) provides that for \"a cause of action arising from any of the acts\" enumerated below, New York courts may exercise jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary who in person or through an agent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. transacts any business within the state or contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the state; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3. commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state, ... if he\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   i. regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in the state, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ii. expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(1) &amp; (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court need look no further than \u00a7 302(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish personal jurisdiction\n   under that provision, two requirements must be satisfied: (1) the \"defendant must have transacted business within the state\"; and (2) \"the claim asserted must arise from that business activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Licci ex rel.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 94.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In its reply, iBestBargains contends that because Plaintiffs represented at the pre-motion conference that personal jurisdiction was supported by CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(3), their arguments for personal jurisdiction under CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(1) should be stricken. Of course, Plaintiffs made that representation\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    this Court granted limited jurisdictional discovery, and in any event, the complaint alleges that personal jurisdiction is permitted by CPLR \u00a7 302 based on Defendants' transaction of business within New York-an argument that sounds in CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(1). (Compl. \u00b6 7.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    While personal jurisdiction cannot be premised on Plaintiffs' investigators' test purchases because those textbooks were shipped into Maryland, those test purchases-which were made through another online marketplace-suggest that at least some of the 1,124 New York sales may be of counterfeit copies of Plaintiffs' textbooks.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    For instance, iBestBargains' first affidavit states that iBestBargains \"has not and currently does not, target any business activities towards residents of the State of New York\" and that it \"does not derive substantial (if any) revenue from goods used or consumed in the State of New York,\" statements which are plainly belied by their jurisdictional discovery. (Affidavit of Chanana Deepali, ECF No. 80-1.) As another example, iBestBargains' second affidavit states that iBestBargains \"is not transacting business in New York through Priority Airfreight,\" despite the power of attorney produced by Priority Airfreight NY's affiliate, Aramex. (Supplemental Affidavit of Chanana Deepali, ECF No. 91-1, \u00b6 5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    iBestBargains argues for the first time in its reply and at oral argument that Plaintiffs' copyright claims fail because they do not allege when the infringement occurred or identify every allegedly infringed work. Its reply also advances the argument that Plaintiffs' failure to allege a use in commerce is fatal to their trademark infringement claims. This Court need not consider arguments made for the first time in a reply brief or at oral argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Standard Gen. L.P. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Conn.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267332\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/502/#p511\">\n     261 F.Supp.3d 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 511-12 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (oral argument)\n    <em>\n     In re Jumei Int'l Holding Ltd.

Jan. 10, 2017) (reply). Even if it did, however, this Court would reach the same conclusions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
