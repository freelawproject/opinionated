Payne, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on HANKOOK TIRE COMPANY LIMITED'S AND HANKOOK TIRE AMERICA COMPANY'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF No. 62). The Court previously denied Defendants' motion in its ORDER (ECF No. 221) dated November 27, 2017. The following Memorandum Opinion sets out the reasoning for having done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this products liability action, Robert Benedict sues Hankook Tire Company Limited (\"HTCL\") and Hankook Tire America Corporation (\"HTAC\") for the production and distribution of an allegedly defective tire. Defendants seek summary judgment as to Benedict's active claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Undisputed Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 14, 2014, Robert Benedict was driving a cement mixer truck for his employer, Essex Concrete (\"Essex\"). While travelling along Route 288 in Chesterfield County, Virginia, Benedict's front-right\n   tire (the \"subject tire\") suffered a tread separation, and his truck veered off the right-hand side of the road, struck an embankment, and rolled over. Benedict was injured in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The subject tire was a Hankook Aurora TH08 Radial 425/65 R22.5. It was manufactured by HTCL in 2005 and then shipped to HTAC for distribution in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Essex did not purchase the subject tire new or directly from HTAC. Rather, the subject tire was one of three Hankook Aurora TH08 425/65 R22.5 tires sold by Hankook tire dealer Old Dominion Tire (\"Old Dominion\") to Metro Ready Mix (\"Metro\") between January 31, 2006 and June 29, 2007. Essex then purchased the truck at issue from Metro with the subject tire installed in May 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Essex had no knowledge about the subject tire's history prior to its acquisition. However, Essex performed an inspection of the truck when it was purchased, conducted follow-up inspections every 300 hours, and required daily pre-trip inspections by drivers. A state inspection was also completed in October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two cuts extending to the belts have been found on the subject tire. Federal regulations require removing tires from service if they suffer cuts of a specified level of severity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A 2006 Hankook Aurora tire catalogue included a limited warranty, which purported to operate in lieu of other warranties. The limited warranty covered tires for six years from the date of manufacture or five years from the date of purchase, and, therefore, if it applied to the subject tire it expired well before the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defect Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A detailed description of Benedict's theory of the subject tire's defects appears in the Court's Opinion addressing Defendants' motion to exclude the testimony of David Southwell. (ECF No. 342). In short, Benedict alleges that the subject tire was defective and hence failed because its components were improperly bonded and had degraded from oxidization due to an inner liner that was too thin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. 14-15; Pl.'s Opp'n 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Benedict initially asserted three claims: (1) products liability negligence (including manufacturing defect, design defect, and failure to warn); (2) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; and (3) breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. First Am. Compl. 5-11. He is now pursuing only his negligent manufacturing and implied warranty of merchantability claims. Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants raised several affirmative defenses in response, including contributory negligence and exclusion of implied warranties. HTCL's Answer to First Am. Compl. 9-10; HTAC's Answer to First Am. Compl. 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both sides then moved for summary judgment. Benedict sought summary judgment as to Defendants' contributory negligence defense. Defendants sought summary judgment as to Benedict's active claims. Related to their motion, Defendants also asked this Court to exclude the testimony of Benedict's tire expert, David Southwell. The Court ruled on these three motions during a hearing held on November 20, 2017, Nov. 20, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 152, and issued an ORDER (ECF No. 221) on November 27, 2017 formalizing its decision. This Opinion is thus one of three detailing the Court's reasoning in this matter. (ECF Nos. 341-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thus, if this Court were to have granted Defendants' motion to exclude Southwell's testimony, Benedict's claims should fail as a matter of law. Defs.' Br. 13.

Defendants assert that Benedict must establish a distinct \"standard of care\" against which Defendants' conduct can be measured. Defs.' Br. 13-22; Defs.' Reply Br. 2-5. Benedict counters that no particularized standard of care need be shown and that the inquiry instead should \"focus on the dangerous nature of the product.\" Pl.'s Opp'n 4-9, 16-17. Benedict is largely correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It is Defendants' view that\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to require proof of a standard of care would essentially transform negligent manufacturing claims into breach of warranty or strict liability claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply Br. 2-5. Viewed as theory, that position is not an erroneous one. However, Virginia largely has abandoned the distinctions between negligence and non-negligence causes of action in products liability actions.

In\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Supreme Court of Virginia observed that \"[e]xistence of duty,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the law imposes a duty at all, \"is an issue that is separate and distinct from its breach.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645811\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/790/447/#p455\">\n    790 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   455 n.14. It then noted that \"to establish a breach of duty in a product liability action,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a violation of the standard of care in the negligence context, a plaintiff must satisfy the basic products liability inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12645811\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/790/447/#p455\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Dameron\n   </em>\n   , a Virginia Circuit Court offered a detailed description of the duty of care applicable to manufacturers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   It is a fundamental principle that the manufacturer of a product is held to a standard of reasonable care. The duty of reasonable care is that care, skill, and diligence in and about the process of manufacturing and preparing for market that a reasonably skillful and diligent person or a reasonably prudent person would use under the same or similar circumstances. Thus, a manufacturer of an article has the duty of exercising reasonable care at least to see that there is no risk of injury from negligent manufacture where the article is used in the ordinary manner for which it is intended. The manufacturer has the duty to see that the article is free of any potentially dangerous defect or defect that might be expected to produce personal injuries or property damage. In addition, the manufacturer has the duty of making the product reasonably safe for any anticipated emergency and he must\n   provide proper safety devices where required under the circumstances and under the duty of reasonable care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Dameron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985%20WL%20306781\">\n    1985 WL 306781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). It then stated, however:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   In a negligence action against a manufacturer in Virginia the plaintiff must show: (1) that the goods were unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which they would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonabley [sic] foreseeable purpose, and (2) that the unreasonably dangerous condition existed when the goods left the defendant's hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (citations omitted). In short, as in\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that a breach of the manufacturer's duty of ordinary care is determined by applying the basic products liability test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , the court recognized that even if the use of a product were foreseeable, \"[industry] custom or usage may be conclusive\" as to whether \"\n   <em>\n    due care\n   </em>\n   was exercised\" where \"there is no evidence to show that it was not reasonably safe.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20S.E.2d%20863\">\n    217 S.E.2d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Industry custom is a standard captured by the basic products liability framework, and\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   's language has been interpreted as relating to that framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alevromagiros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513810\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/417/#p420\">\n    993 F.2d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Fourth, federal opinions likewise define the breach of duty or standard of care issue with reference to the basic products liability inquiry.

Instruction 34.075, titled Breach of Warranty (Negligence) By Seller or Manufacturer, contains alternative entries for breach of warranty and negligence that precisely mirror each other:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The defendant (seller, manufacturer) has breached the implied warranty that the product is fit for the purposes for which it is ordinarily used if the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the product was unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which it would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonably foreseeable purpose, and that the unreasonably dangerous condition existed when the product left the defendant's (seller's, manufacturer's) hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [The defendant is negligent if the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the product was unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which it would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonably foreseeable purpose, and that the reasonably [sic] dangerous condition existed when the product left the defendant's (seller's, manufacturer's) hands.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Va. Model Jury Instructions-Civil, Instruction No. 34.075.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, the Instructions treat the basic products liability inquiry as defining \"negligence\" and consider satisfaction of this test as equivalent to a breach of the standard of care. Instruction 34.140 advises that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A manufacturer has a duty to use ordinary care to design [manufacture; construct] a product that will be reasonably safe for its intended purpose and for any other reasonably foreseeable purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    If a manufacturer fails to perform this duty, then it is negligent\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Va. Model Jury Instructions-Civil, Instruction No. 34.140 (emphasis added). Instruction 34.075 then states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    The defendant is negligent\n   </em>\n   if the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the product was unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which it would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonably foreseeable purpose, and that the reasonably [sic] dangerous condition existed when the product left the defendant's (seller's, manufacturer's) hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Va. Model Jury Instructions-Civil, Instruction No. 34.075 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In short, Virginia law adheres to the \"bound up\" principle. That is, it uses the\n   <em>\n    language\n   </em>\n   of negligence, but it defines the elements of negligence and the standard of care inquiry in defective product cases, including those involving negligent manufacture claims, by reference to the basic products liability framework. Accordingly, Virginia law requires no\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   evidence of a standard of care beyond that called for by this framework.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court acknowledges that some authorities appear to contradict the foregoing analysis, at least at first blush.

The first of Southwell's challenged opinions, that Defendants' testing regime was insufficient based on his review of their testing information, is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an effort to establish a\n   <em>\n    standard of care\n   </em>\n   based on Defendants' own quality standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.

A 29-36. Thus, it is not problematic under Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   There is an aspect of the first challenged opinion that is somewhat troubling, however. Southwell's report includes a brief section stating that Defendants' own specifications reveal that they were aware of, and intended to control for, certain \"safety-critical parameters.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. A 30. Evidence of internal rules to demonstrate such awareness\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

To the extent Southwell proposes to testify that one of the reasons the inner liner was defective was\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   it did not comply with Defendants' internal specifications,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. A 22, that testimony is unacceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This entire analysis is largely academic at this stage, however, because, even without these statements, summary judgment is improper. Southwell's testimony still offers evidence, based on literature, experience, testing, knowledge, and a detailed product inspection, that unreasonably dangerous defects caused the subject tire to fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Ex.

Br. 19-21. The Court has excluded such opinions. (ECF No. 342). None of these exclusions, however, render summary judgment appropriate because Southwell's testimony otherwise constitutes an analytically rigorous explanation of how the subject tire was unreasonably dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Third, Defendants assert that Southwell cannot testify to industry standards related to tire testing requirements based on the practices of the \"two manufacturers\" for which Southwell has worked.

The second, likewise, merely observes that Old Dominion received the tire catalogues from its wholesaler, that \"[a]s part of its regular practice of selling and marketing tires, Old Dominion provided customers, including Metro Ready Mix, product literature and warranty information for the tires that Old Dominion sold,\" and that \"[t]he Tire Catalogue is a document that Old Dominion\n   <em>\n    would have\n   </em>\n   provided to its customers.\" Defs.'

Defs.' Br. 23-25.

These include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   (A) a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   (B) language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201(b) (10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Court observes that these examples are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   safe harbors. Rather, what is required is a holistic assessment of whether a reasonable person \"ought to have noticed\" the term at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201(b) (10). There are four reasons for this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   First, the official comments to Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201 make clear that a holistic approach is warranted and that the statutory\n   examples are not dispositive. Official comment 10 states that, \"[a]lthough these paragraphs indicate some of the methods for making a term attention-calling,\n   <em>\n    the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it\n   </em>\n   .\" Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201 cmt. 10 (emphasis added). It further asserts that \"[\n   <em>\n    t]he statutory language should not be construed to permit a result that is inconsistent with that test\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202998768\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Second, the history of Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201 underscores the conclusion that the conspicuity inquiry necessitates a holistic approach. In 2003, Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201(b) (10) replaced a predecessor statute, Va. Code \u00a7 8.1-201(10). It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   A term or clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it.\n   <em>\n    A printed heading in capitals (as: NONNEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) is conspicuous. Language in the body of a form is \"conspicuous\" if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color.\n   </em>\n   But in a telegram any stated term is \"conspicuous.\" Whether a term or clause is \"conspicuous\" or not is for decision by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Va. Code \u00a7 8.1-201 (10) (emphasis added) (repealed 2003). This previous version enumerated several types of terms that were, by definition, conspicuous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202998768\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The present version, in contrast, suggests that the listed examples are true\n   <em>\n    examples\n   </em>\n   by employing the softer phrase: \"Conspicuous terms\n   <em>\n    include\n   </em>\n   the following.\" Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201(b) (10) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Additionally, the 2003 change altered the official comments. Comment 10 of the previous version stated simply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   [The statutory examples of conspicuous terms are] intended to indicate some of the methods of making a term attention-calling. But the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Va. Code \u00a7 8.1-201 cmt. 10. As shown above, the contemporary official comment 10 uses much stronger language, such as \"[t]he statutory language should not be construed to permit a result that is inconsistent with\" the \"ought to have noticed\" test. Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201 cmt. 10. This language, then, seems to reflect a legislative intent that courts focus on \"whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to\" a term rather than obstinately adhering to the listed examples in every case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202998768\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Third, decisions interpreting the present statute bolster the conclusion that a holistic assessment is warranted. In\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks North America, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the court observed the following: \"[ Va. Code \u00a7 8.1A-201 (b) (10) ] lists some examples of conspicuousness, but Comment 10 to the UCC section makes clear that\n   'the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it.

It then performed a holistic assessment and found the disclaimer clause at issue inconspicuous notwithstanding that: (1) the heading was bolded and underlined and therefore arguably \"in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size\"; and (2) the disclaimer language was capitalized and therefore arguably \"in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222780\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/347/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 355-56 ; Virginia Buyers Order-NA at 2,\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

BaySys Technologies, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a disclaimer was inconspicuous even though the heading for the warranty section, where the disclaimer appeared, was bolded and hence \"in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodrich Corp. v.

Navistar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court observed that the fact that a disclaimer was capitalized and had a bolded heading \"weigh[ed] in favor\" of a conspicuity finding, but it evaluated \"the totality of the factors\" before actually concluding that the disclaimer was effective.\n   <em>\n    Brosville Cmty. Fire Dep't, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Murray v. New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit offered the following well-reasoned explanation for why this is so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Cingular found \u00a7 1-201(b) (10) (A) and concluded that capitalizing the word \"DISCLOSURE\" brought the paragraph within the definition, because the immediately preceding paragraph also was in 6-point type. But the main part of \u00a7 1-201(b) (10), which defines \"conspicuous\" as something that the person affected \"ought to have noticed\", implies that some type can be so small that a capitalized heading \"equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text\" will not be enough.\n   <em>\n    It is of course possible to read (A) and (B) as safe harbors, working even if the affected person assuredly would not have noticed the statement; then 1-point type in light grey would do, even though it would be invisible to normal readers, provided only that it followed a throwaway paragraph in 1-point light-grey type.

Code \u00a7 8.1A-201(b) (10), have offered insights into the contours of conspicuousness. They have found a disclaimer inconspicuous, for example, where \"the language of disclaimer [wa]s in print of the same size, style, and color as that used in most of the other\n   provisions of the contract\" and it was \"immersed in the body of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Lacks v.

And a disclaimer on the back of a signed, two-page \"Buyer's Order\" was deemed insufficient where \"[t]he heading of the disclaimer clause [wa]s of the same font type and size as those for the other paragraphs,\" \"the disclaimer clause [wa]s not set off from the other paragraphs ... in any distinctive way,\" the font size and color of the clause was the same as others, and \"[a]lthough the disclaimer clause [wa]s in capital letters, two other paragraphs on the back page [were] also in capital letters.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222780\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/347/\">\n    940 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   356 ; Virginia Buyers Order-NA at 1-2,\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

It is contained in a catalogue that does not, on its own, invite or require a purchaser to review its terms. It is not, for example, within a contract or other form that requires the purchaser to\n   <em>\n    sign\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, the disclaimer appears on the penultimate page, page 26, of a lengthy tire catalogue. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K 26. And, moreover, although the table of contents contains an entry for the \"limited warranty,\" this entry: (1) is not stylistically distinct from the other table of contents entries; (2) does not indicate that the limited warranty includes a disclaimer of any kind; and (3) as suggested above, does not require the purchaser to sign nearby or otherwise become aware that his legal rights could be affected by the catalogue's final pages. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K Table of Contents. Finally, the page header and footer of the warranty page\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   say \"Limited Warranty\" in large, red, capital letters, but every single page of the catalogue contains a similar header and footer describing that page's contents; and the warranty header and footer do not imply that any disclaimers exist. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K 1-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Second, the disclaimer itself establishes that it is not conspicuous. As an initial matter, it is true that the disclaimer clause\n   heading is in bolded and capitalized type that is larger than the text of the clause itself (and other non-heading text within the document). Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K 26. However, this heading is styled no differently than\n   <em>\n    every other heading\n   </em>\n   in the warranty, including the four surrounding headings on the page containing the disclaimer;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it is styled in a\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   distinctive way than the headings for the adjacent \"important safety warning\" section, which are introduced by a checkmark. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K 22-26. The language of the disclaimer clause, moreover, is neither styled nor sized in any way that distinguishes it from the other text in the document. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K 26. Indeed, HTAC's contact information, which appears on the same page,\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   bolded and thus more noticeable than the other text. Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. K 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants' attempted disclaimer is inconspicuous and therefore ineffective. Consequently, summary judgment as to Benedict's breach of warranty claim is inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Causation Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Defendants additionally seek summary judgment on the ground that Benedict cannot establish causation as to any of his claims. Specifically, they assert that Benedict was negligent per se because he was required by regulations to remove any tires with cuts extending to the belts and the subject tire had two such cuts prior to the accident. Defs.' Br. 27-28. They claim that this negligence was a superseding act that broke the chain of causation between the alleged defects in the subject tire and the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Defendants incorporated by reference these arguments into their opposition to Benedict's motion for summary judgment as to Defendants' contributory negligence defense. Accordingly, the Court addressed Defendants' contentions in its Opinion resolving that motion, and it incorporates that analysis here. (ECF No. 341). Specifically, the Court determined that Defendants could not establish either the \"negligence\" or \"causation\" elements of negligence per se.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halterman v.
