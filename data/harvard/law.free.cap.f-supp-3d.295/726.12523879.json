Plaintiffs Christopher Hooper, Donnie Cox-Powell, Diane Pimpton, James Farmer, Donnell Wiggins and Gregory Braggs, Sr. have responded in opposition to the motion.

Following a May 2017 demand on them by OSA to repay nearly $80,000 in salaries allegedly overpaid to the Town's part-time police officers in violation of state law, plaintiffs filed the present action in the Circuit Court of Hinds County, Mississippi, seeking to enjoin OSA from collecting these monies from them. In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that the police officers' salaries were properly paid in compliance with, and as mandated by federal law, and specifically, the minimum wage provision\n   of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   They further allege that the state statute on which OSA bases its demand for payment, Mississippi Code Annotated \u00a7 45-6-3(d), as interpreted and/or applied by the State, is unenforceable, invalid and void as it conflicts with, or is preempted by the FLSA.

Apparently at some point in 2016, this came to the attention of OSA, which began an investigation of a claim that the Town's part-time police officers were overpaid, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-3(d). Around the same time, the Town's mayor and attorney evidently began looking into the matter as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so doing, they determined that BLEOST has taken the position that while \u00a7 45-6-3(d) strictly limits compensation of part-time officers to $250 per week/$1,075 per month, there is no limit to the number of hours they can work; but, if they work any hours beyond the statutory salary cap, they must do so without compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In May 2017, OSA, having concluded that plaintiffs had in fact authorized payments in excess of $250 per week/$1,075 per month to certified part-time officers, sent each of the plaintiffs a demand for payment, for the use and benefit of the Town of Tutwiler, of the salary overpayments to part-time officers for the time period covering March 2013 through February 2017 totaling $79,253.30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   OSA contemporaneously submitted proofs of loss to\n   Travelers Insurance, the surety on plaintiffs' public officials bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 11, 2017, plaintiffs filed the present action against OSA in state court seeking to enjoin enforcement of \u00a7 45-6-3(d), as interpreted by the State (i.e., BLEOST), so as to foreclose OSA from collecting on its demand to recover the alleged salary overpayments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their complaint, plaintiffs do not deny that they paid a number of police officers more than $250 per week/$1,075 per month, notwithstanding that those officers were only certified as part-time officers. Plaintiffs contend that in so doing, they acted in conformity with federal law and also with state law, as written. Their reasoning, as the court understands it, is as follows: The Town of Tutwiler has a statutory duty to provide sufficient police protection\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; plaintiffs have scheduled the Town's officers, including part-time officers, to work the number of hours reasonably required to fulfill that duty; the Town of Tutwiler's personnel policy defines a part-time employee as one who works less than 40 hours per week; state law imposes no limit on the number of hours a part-time officer may work; under the FLSA, the Town is required to pay officers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for every hour worked\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and therefore, plaintiffs violated\n   neither federal nor state law in scheduling part-time officers to work 39 hours a week and compensating them for these hours at the federal minimum wage, with the result that the officers were paid more than $250 per week/$1,075 per month. Plaintiffs assert, though, that the State, through BLEOST, has issued a \"directive\" that plaintiffs not compensate the Town's part-time officers more than $250 per week/$1,075 per month, regardless of the number of hours they work; and they claim that this directive is based on an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 45-6-3(d) which conflicts with the requirements of the FLSA\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and which is thus preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

However, state law does not require this. It is true that \u00a7 45-6-3 does not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   limit the number of hours a part-time police officer can work. It does, however, strictly limit the amount of pay an officer may receive and still be classified as part-time. And, since the FLSA requires that officers be paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, then \u00a7 45-6-3, in conjunction with the FLSA, does\n   <em>\n    effectively\n   </em>\n   limit the number of hours an officer can work and still be considered part-time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court acknowledges that BLEOST appears to have interpreted state law to\n   <em>\n    permit\n   </em>\n   part-time officers to work without compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Obviously, plaintiffs, as\n   they correctly point out, \"cannot both work the part-time officers without compensation ... and, at the same time, pay the part-time officers the required minimum wage under federal law.\" However, state law, even as interpreted by BLEOST, merely\n   <em>\n    permits\n   </em>\n   , and does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   , that officers work without compensation or for less than the federal minimum wage. What the FLSA requires is that covered employees be paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. And what state law requires-and\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   that it requires-is that part-time officers not be paid more than $250 per week or $1,075 per month. State law does not require plaintiffs to schedule part-time officers to work more hours than would result in their being paid over $250 a week or $1,075 a month when compensated at the rate of $7.25 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs deny that they can simultaneously comply with the FLSA and \u00a7 45-6-3(d) and fulfill their statutory duty to provide sufficient police protection. They complain that the state statute at issue \"places and placed a severe and undue burden\" on them because they \"cannot place ... officers on duty after $1,075.00 unless [they place] said officers on duty without compensation in violation of [the FLSA].\" That simply is not true. Even assuming plaintiffs are obligated to provide a certain minimum level of police protection, there is no requirement that they satisfy that obligation by over-scheduling certified part-time officers. They have other options available to them which do not involve a violation of either the FLSA or state law. They can hire more officers, part-time or full-time; or, if that is not feasible,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   they can take the necessary steps to have the part-time officers timely attain the required certification as full-time officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs may find it difficult to comply simultaneously with state and federal law, but that does not mean that it is \"physically impossible\" to do so or that there is any conflict between the two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For these reasons, the court concludes that plaintiffs' claim that the FLSA preempts state law fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, it is ordered that defendant's motion for summary judgement is granted and plaintiffs' complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A separate judgment will be entered in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   SO ORDERED this 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   day of November, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Plaintiffs' complaint is styled \"Petition for Preliminary and/or Permanent Injunction,\" but it is unclear precisely what relief they seek.

They also argue that defendant's actions are a \"political scam\" or \"political scandal\" because the mayor was equally responsible for the challenged payments to the officers and yet defendant has made no demand for payment by the mayor or claim on her bond.
