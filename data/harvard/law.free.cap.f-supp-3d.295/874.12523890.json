Plaintiff Abdullah Abriq is a foreign national who immigrated to the United States under an F-1 student visa. Plaintiff resided in Davidson County and attended Tennessee State University. Plaintiff alleges that he has never been arrested for or convicted of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, on April 6, 2017, ICE officials took custody of him,\n   pending civil removal proceedings. Plaintiffs contends that, also on April 6, 2017, ICE officials transferred custody of him to the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (\"Metro\") at the Davidson County Jail, where he was held until April 11, 2017. Plaintiff alleges that ICE had no warrant or probable cause to arrest him. Plaintiff also alleges that Metro had no warrant or probable cause to believe Plaintiff had committed a criminal offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to take custody of him, and that Metro had no lawful authority to hold him as an immigration detainee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , ICE may enter into written agreements with state, local or private entities (\"\u00a7 287 agreements\") that authorize non-federal officials to perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the \"investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Plaintiff avers that Metro entered into a \u00a7 287 agreement with ICE, under which Metro assumed physical custody of immigration detainees while ICE had legal custody. Metro does not dispute that its \u00a7 287 agreement with ICE began in 2007 and expired in 2012. Plaintiff asserts that the Metro Council did not authorize Sheriff Hall to renew the \u00a7 287(g) agreement with ICE or to enter into any further agreement with ICE, and that Sheriff Hall publicly announced, in October 2012, that Metro would not renew the \u00a7 287(g) agreement with ICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff contends that, despite the agreement's expiration and having no new \u00a7 287 agreement, Metro, through an ongoing custom, policy and practice and at the direction of Sheriff Hall, has continued to \"seize\" and hold administrative detainees for ICE, including Plaintiff, with no lawful authority to do so. Plaintiff asserts causes of action against Metro for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Count I-violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Count II-violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count III-false imprisonment under Tennessee law\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count IV-unjust enrichment under Tennessee law\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Count V-declaratory judgment for\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   actions\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Docket No. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MOTIONS TO DISMISS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For purposes of a motion to dismiss, the Court must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Charter Township of Comstock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5685127\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/718/#p722\">\n    592 F.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722 (6th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Metro first argues that, to the extent Plaintiff is claiming that Metro's detention of him is illegal because it was done without a valid contract, in violation of the Metro Charter and Tennessee law about immigration, there is no private right of action to enforce either the Charter or that Tennessee statute. Plaintiff, however, is not suing to enforce the Metro Charter or a Tennessee statute. Plaintiff alleges that Metro did not have a \u00a7 287 agreement with ICE when Plaintiff was detained. Plaintiff's claims are based on Metro's alleged lack of authority to detain him without probable cause, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and state tort law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's claims against Metro arise under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides a right of action against state actors who violate the U.S. Constitution, and under Tennessee state law, not under the Metro Charter or a Tennessee statute. Plaintiff has a private right of action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and under Tennessee common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that he was detained in violation of his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures because Metro had no authority to detain him. Plaintiff further asserts that both Metro and the federal government lacked authority to hold him, contractual or otherwise. Deciding whether Metro had authority to detain Plaintiff involves more than the Metro Charter and a state statute. Whether Metro had authority to detain him involves federal law and regulations concerning the interplay between ICE and local law enforcement. Moreover, whether Metro falsely imprisoned Plaintiff or was unjustly enriched at his expense are causes of action under state common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff's private right of action is available under both federal and state law, and Metro's motion on this basis is denied. Therefore, the Court need not address Plaintiff's argument about taxpayer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides a private right of action against anyone who subjects any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights or privileges secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n   <em>\n    Rehberg v.

April 11, 2014), Metro points out that this case is different from the cases Plaintiff cites, because Plaintiff was not already in the custody of Metro, so his detention was not a \"continued detention.\" Metro still detained Plaintiff, however, and Plaintiff alleges that Metro's detention of him exceeded the scope of its lawful authority, constituted a seizure, and must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment. The court in\n   <em>\n    Miranda-Olivares\n   </em>\n   held that it was not reasonable for the county to believe it had probable cause to detain the plaintiff based on the ICE detainer.
