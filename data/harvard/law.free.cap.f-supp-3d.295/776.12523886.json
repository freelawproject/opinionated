Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in this action are the owners of residential lots in Medina County, Ohio (\"Landowners\"). Defendant Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC (\"Columbia\") is a wholesale producer and distributor of natural gas which established a 10,000 acre underground natural gas storage facility in the Clinton sandstone formation in Medina County (the \"Medina Storage Field\"). Columbia was authorized-and required-to construct and operate the Medina Storage Field by the former Federal Power Commission in 1958, and it has stored natural gas in that facility since 1959. Federal law authorizes natural gas facility operators to take property by eminent domain to accomplish the purposes set forth in certificates of public convenience and necessity under the Natural Gas Act. Despite receiving a certificate in 1958 and operating the Medina Storage Field since 1959, Columbia did not seek to acquire underground gas storage easements under the Landowners' properties until 2014. The Landowners sued for trespass and unjust enrichment damages. Columbia has moved for summary judgment on the Landowners claims. ECF Doc. 89. The Landowners have also moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a liability determination that Columbia has trespassed on each of the Landowners' properties since 1959 and a declaration that the trespass was malicious. EFC Doc. 86. Because the Landowners have no evidence that Columbia's conduct has caused actual damage to Landowners' properties or has in any way interfered with Landowners' use or anticipated use of their properties, and because Columbia's construction and operation of the Medina Storage Field was mandated by federal agency action, Columbia cannot be liable to the Landowners for trespass. In addition, because Landowners will receive just compensation for Columbia's taking in a companion action, Columbia's only potential liability on an unjust enrichment claim is for interest on the just compensation amount it is required to pay. The court will direct the parties to submit an agreed calculation of the prejudgment\n   interest amount. As a result, Columbia's motion for summary judgment will be GRANTED in PART and DEFERRED in PART and Landowners' motion for partial summary judgment will be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background and Claims Asserted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Landowners instituted this action on March 5, 2014. Doc. 1. They asserted claims similar to those alleged in an earlier-filed putative class action case in the Southern District of Ohio,\n   <em>\n    Wilson et al v. Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:12cv01203 (S.D. Ohio 2012). None of the plaintiffs in this case was an original party in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ; but Columbia is the defendant in both cases. On April 22, 2014, Columbia filed an amended counterclaim in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   joining the Medina Landowners as counterclaim defendants. The next day, Columbia moved to dismiss the instant case, asserting that\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the first filed case, had priority. On March 5, 2015, Judge Wells granted Columbia's motion to dismiss. ECF Doc. Nos. 18, 19. On February 24, 2016, the Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded the case. ECF Doc. No. 22. Taking a suggestion by the court of appeals, Columbia moved to stay this case. ECF Doc. No. 27. On May 4, 2016, Judge Gwin\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied defendant's motion to stay due, in part, to delays in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and the appropriateness of venue in the Northern District of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 26, 2016, Columbia and the Medina Landowners jointly requested that their claims in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   be severed and transferred to the Northern District of Ohio. That request was granted, and on June 10, 2016, the case was transferred to the Northern District of Ohio and recaptioned\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas Transmission\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , LLC v. Booth, et a.\n   </em>\n   , 1:16cv01418 (\"\n   <em>\n    Booth.\n   </em>\n   \") Shortly thereafter, Columbia filed an Amended Complaint in condemnation against the Landowners in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 27, 2016, one day after the parties' joint request to sever and transfer their claims in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , Columbia moved to dismiss the instant case, arguing that its assertion of a condemnation claim in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   mooted certain claims in this case. ECF Doc. Nos. 32, 33. Columbia contended that all of the Landowners' other claims were preempted by the NGA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 22, 2016, the court granted, in part, Columbia's motion to dismiss. ECF No. 58. Plaintiffs' claims for mandamus/inverse condemnation (Count Three), declaratory judgment (Count Four), and permanent injunction (Count Five) were dismissed. The court declined to dismiss the claims for trespass (Count One) and unjust enrichment (Count Two).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Landowners premise their trespass and unjust enrichment claims on the contention that Columbia had no right to store natural gas beneath their properties prior to the acquisition of property rights by eminent domain. In Count One, the Landowners claim that Columbia maliciously trespassed and should be liable for nominal, compensatory, and punitive damages and for attorney fees. Count Two asserts that Columbia has been unjustly enriched by being able to store natural gas beneath their properties without cost since 1959. The Landowners claim Columbia should be required to disgorge what it would have\n   paid for such gas storage, or the net profit it earned from storing natural gas beneath their properties. They also impliedly claim Columbia was unjustly enriched by retaining the money it would have paid as just compensation for its taking of their properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Factual and Regulatory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following facts are undisputed and/or established by the Rule 56 evidence. Columbia is an interstate natural gas company as defined by Section 2(a) of the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\"). ECF Docs. 46, 66. Columbia operates an extensive interstate natural gas transportation and storage system that includes one of North America's largest underground natural gas storage systems (37 storage fields in four states with nearly 600 billion cubic feet in total capacity). Id. The Medina Storage Field is one of those facilities. Id. The Medina Storage Field exists within the Clinton sandstone formation located approximately 3,000 feet beneath the surface of the land. Id. Columbia injects natural gas into these storage fields during the summer months when gas demand is low and withdraws the storage gas during the winter months when demand is high, in order to stabilize the supply and, as a result, the price of natural gas.

(ECF Doc. 93-1, Page ID# 3116.)

Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Landowners trespass and unjust enrichment claims are premised on the belief that Columbia's\n   <em>\n    right to store\n   </em>\n   natural gas in the Medina Storage Field was conditioned upon its acquisition of property rights-gas storage easements-from the Landowners. ECF Doc. 100, Page ID#3471-3472 (\"Columbia is now seeking to condemn the properties for their use through the\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   case despite having the authority\n   <em>\n    and obligation\n   </em>\n   to do so at the earliest since 1958.\" (Emphasis added) ). The 1958 and 1987 Certificates and the applicable statute and regulations indicate otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The 1958 Certificate authorized the construction and operation of the Medina Storage Field \"upon the terms and conditions of this order.\" ECF Doc. 55-1, Page ID# 833. The terms and conditions included the obligation to comply with specified subsections of \"Section 157.20 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the requirements of that regulation mandated the completion of the eminent domain process established in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h), and none of the express conditions of the 1958 Certificate did either. Moreover, the 1958 Certificate expressly acknowledged that the Federal Power Commission had granted Columbia temporary authority to construct and operate the facilities that had been proposed as of May 27, 2958, two months before the 1958 Certificate was issued. ECF Doc. 55-1, Page ID# 832. Thus, Columbia was authorized to store gas in the Clinton sandstone formation constituting the Medina Storage Field before obtaining gas storage easements from the surface land owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The 1987 Certificate similarly imposed a requirement that Columbia comply with \"all applicable Commission Regulations under the Natural Gas Act and particularly the general terms and conditions set forth in...Section 157.20 of such Regulations.\" ECF Doc. 55-3, Page ID#907-908. None of those regulations mandated the immediate completion of eminent domain actions. Nothing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20717\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq. conditions the validity of a certificate of public convenience and necessity upon the completion of eminent domain easement acquisitions. Indeed, \u00a7 717f(h) expressly indicates that eminent domain\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be used to acquire rights of way \"or other property, in addition to right-of-way\" needed to construct and operate the natural gas facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To say it another way, the Landowners have cited no law-and the court has found none-standing for the proposition that a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the underground storage of natural gas is automatically invalidated because a certificate holder fails to pursue eminent domain acquisition of gas storage easements at or about the time it begins to store natural gas. The necessary conclusion from this analysis is that Columbia, while it undoubtedly should have completed the acquisition of storage easements, had the right-and indeed was obligated-to store natural gas in the Medina Storage Field not later than three years after the\n   1958 Certificate was issued. ECF Doc. 55-1, Page ID# 833, \u00b6 (C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The question this case presents is whether Columbia's storage of natural gas in the Medina Storage Field without having condemned gas storage easements by eminent domain constitutes trespass.

The Court began its analysis of the plaintiff's trespass claim by defining their property rights. The Court rejected the ancient maxim that a property owner owns everything above and below the land to an indefinite extent, finding it incompatible with a modern understanding of land use and property ownership.

This court concludes that such a distinction does not exist. Trespass is, by definition, an unapproved entry upon the land of another. And the Ohio Supreme Court has made it\n   clear that subsurface trespasses are not actionable unless the invaded landowner can prove actual damage to the property or actual interference with the actual or foreseeable use of the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In recognition of their lack of actual damage evidence, the Landowners invoke\n   <em>\n    Pearl v.

The hope is that nominal damages would provide a foothold for a jury's consideration of punitive damages. However, in\n   <em>\n    Pearl\n   </em>\n   nominal damages were presumed and awarded against a defendant who stored trucks and trailers on plaintiff's property without permission and despite plaintiff's demands. The presumption of nominal damages for a\n   <em>\n    surface\n   </em>\n   trespass is not the issue presented in this case. And, as the Sixth Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

As a result, nominal damages cannot be presumed here. Further, this court cannot find that the appeals court decision in\n   <em>\n    Pearl\n   </em>\n   -which predated\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   by thirty years-somehow takes precedence over\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Pearl\n   </em>\n   , decided long before a cause of action for subsurface had been recognized in Ohio, is simply not pertinent here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Landowners also rely on\n   <em>\n    Bowman v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   provides little guidance on the validity of the Landowners' trespass claim.

Finally,\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   can also be distinguished because the Bowmans proved that Columbia's storage of gas interfered with their intended use of their land; they had contracted with a third party for the drilling of a well on their property. In contrast, the undisputed Rule 56 evidence in this case demonstrates that none of the Landowners had ever attempted or intended to use the subsurface areas of their property where Columbia stored gas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Docs. 91 &amp; 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In short, the court concludes that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Chance v.

See ECF Docs. 46, Page ID# 749 and 58. The unjust enrichment claim appears to rest on two theories: (1) that it was unjust for Columbia to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   the Clinton sandstone formation beneath the Landowners' properties without having first obtained gas storage easements from those who owned the surface lots above; and (2) that Columbia has been unjustly enriched by being able to keep money it would have paid as just compensation after acquiring easements by eminent domain. Under the first theory, the Landowners reason that Columbia should be required to disgorge the profits earned on the gas it stored before it had the right to do so. Alternatively, they argue Columbia should be required to pay the Landowners what Columbia would have paid in storage fees from 1959 to the date it pays just compensation. ECF Doc. 100, Page ID# 3486. The second theory involves the implicit contention that Columbia should be required to provide restitution for the unpaid just compensation amounts plus interest from\n   the time the property was first taken by physical occupation in 1959.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties do not agree on when Columbia's \"taking\" of the Clinton sandstone formation for the Medina Storage Field occurred.

ECF Doc. 100, Page ID# 3485-3486. Columbia disagrees for two reasons. First, it contends that damages on an unjust enrichment claim are limited by the six year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2305.07. Columbia argues that the Landowners' damages are limited to the recovery of any benefits the Landowners conferred and Columbia unjustly retained during the six-year period prior to the filing of this action on March 5, 2014. And Columbia argues that the filing of the condemnation claim in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   cuts off any claim for unjust enrichment damages allegedly accruing after that date, April 22, 2014. Second, Columbia argues that the award of just compensation in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   will represent \"the actual market value of the storage right\" ECF Doc. 90, Page ID#2434, n.9; ECF Doc. 105, Page ID# 3547, n.7. Columbia contends that, at most, the Landowners could have a right to make an unjust enrichment claim for interest on the funds Columbia held rather than paying to the Landowners as just compensation for storage easements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=465%20N.E.2d%201298\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons already expressed, the Landowners have no claim to recover gas storage fees for periods before the Landowners acquired their properties. Any benefit conferred upon Columbia for gas storage during those years did not belong to the Landowners, and the Landowners have not cited any authority holding otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the court concludes that the Landowners' claim is governed by the six-year statute of limitations in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.07. At most, the Landowners can seek unjust enrichment damages for the period from March 5, 2008 through the date of the judgment rendered herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The court agrees with Columbia that when the Landowners receive just compensation as a result of\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   , they will have been compensated for the storage rights Columbia has utilized since the Landowners acquired their properties. In addition, the just compensation award will compensate them for the transfer of legal title to the gas storage easements Columbia is taking by eminent domain pursuant to the NGA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The court also notes that the\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   Commission has recommended that Columbia pay $250 per lot or $450 per double lot for permanent easements on the Landowners' properties. The Landowners have not filed any objection to the commission chairman's report. The just compensation for these permanent easements necessarily encompasses all rental fee obligations Columbia arguably could have owed the Landowners on an unjust enrichment basis. However, nothing in the Commission's recommendation has captured the time value of these funds dating back to March\n   5, 2008, the date six years prior to the filing of the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because the court does not believe there will be any genuine dispute of material facts concerning the time value of the per-lot just compensation payments, the court will order the Landowners and Columbia to confer and submit an agreed calculation of interest due on said payments. For reference, the parties should review and consider the potential application of the interest calculation model adopted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Hardy Storage Company, LLC v. Property Interests Necessary to Conduct Gas Storage Operations, etc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07CV5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20689054\">\n    2009 WL 689054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. WV, March 9, 2009). Upon submission of an agreed interest calculation, the court will entertain a motion to: (i) either apply said interest to the judgment to be rendered in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   (which would necessarily mean that there were no further damages to be awarded on the Landowners' unjust enrichment claim in this action, resulting in summary judgment for Columbia on said claim) or (ii) to render summary judgment in favor of the Landowners on their unjust enrichment claim in this action for the amount of interest due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In summary, the court concludes that the Landowners have no standing to obtain unjust enrichment damages for benefits allegedly retained by Columbia during times before the Landowners acquired their properties. The court further concludes that the payment of just compensation in\n   <em>\n    Booth\n   </em>\n   will fully compensate the Landowners for any unjust enrichment they may have conferred upon Columbia. And the court will direct the parties to agree on an amount of prejudgment interest that Columbia should be required to pay on the just compensation amount for the period March 5, 2008 through the date just compensation is paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Columbia contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on the Landowners' demand for punitive damages. Columbia argues that punitive damages are only available with tort claims and that there is no evidence of actual malice in this case. The Landowners argue that punitive damages are permitted if even nominal damages are awarded on a trespass claim. ECF 100, Page ID# 3488. The Landowners also cite\n   <em>\n    Bowman,\n   </em>\n   in which the Sixth Circuit affirmed an award of punitive damages associated with a trespass similar to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under Ohio law, the general rule is that punitive damages may only be recovered in actions involving intentional torts.

Accordingly, because the Landowners' only remaining claim is for unjust enrichment, they are not be entitled to punitive damages. See\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   1st Dist. No. C-850841, 1986 Ohio App. LEXIS 8207,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%209782\">\n    1986 WL 9782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (Sept. 10, 1986). \"[I]t is well-settled that claims for unjust enrichment sound in contract rather than tort.\" See\n   <em>\n    Dodson v.

As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   was decided before\n   <em>\n    Chance.\n   </em>\n   The Sixth Circuit did not consider whether plaintiffs had asserted a valid claim for trespass under Ohio law because that issue had not been preserved for appeal.\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988%20WL%2068890\">\n    1988 WL 68890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS at *4. Moreover, application of\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because it involved evidence that the storage of gas actually interfered with the use of plaintiff's land. Here, plaintiffs have shown no such interference. And finally, the district judge who presided over\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   later determined that he had erred in that decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. Exclusive Natural Gas Storage Easement, etc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7382471\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/747/401/#p404\">\n    747 F.Supp. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (N.D. Oh. 1990). Consequently, because the Landowners have not asserted a valid tort claim, punitive damages are unavailable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, the court declines Columbia's invitation to revisit its ruling on the issue of preemption. The question of preemption was fully considered and addressed in this court's order on Columbia's motion to dismiss. ECF Doc. 58. Columbia has not identified any conflict between the NGA and Ohio law that makes it impossible for Columbia to comply with both under the facts of this case. It is not necessary to reconsider preemption at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The court makes the following orders:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   1. Columbia's motion for summary judgment on Count One of plaintiffs' second amended complaint is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   2.
