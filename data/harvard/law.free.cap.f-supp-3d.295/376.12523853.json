Mingo Lamar (\"Mingo Lamar\") to the victims of his crime, namely, Bank of America (\"BOA\") and J.P. Morgan Chase (\"Chase\"), and the fine to be imposed on Mingo Lamar. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court finds that restitution in the amount of $709 should be paid by Mingo Lamar to BOA and $290 should be paid to Chase, pursuant to the terms of an Amended Judgment that will be entered in this case, but no fine should be imposed due to Mingo Lamar's financial condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 10, 2017, Mingo Lamar was charged by Complaint (ECF No. 1). On February 9, 2018, the Government filed a Misdemeanor Information charging him with one count of bank larceny in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Misdemeanor Information, ECF No. 11, \u00b6 1.) The information alleges that Mingo Lamar \"did knowingly take and carry away, with intent to steal or purloin, property and money not exceeding $1,000 in value belonging to, and in the care, custody, control, management and possession of, a bank ....\" (Misdemeanor Information, \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 22, 2018, Mingo Lamar pleaded guilty to the single count contained in the Misdemeanor Information. (2/22/18 Tr., ECF No. 24, at 16.) In his allocution at the time of the plea, Mingo Lamar stated that he had deposited checks into his bank account with knowledge that the checks did not belong to him and with the intention of keeping \"some of\" the proceeds from the checks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    at 14-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In his plea agreement, Mingo Lamar agreed to pay restitution in an amount ordered by the Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its submission made prior to sentencing, the Government requested that restitution be paid to the following victims: (1) BOA, in the amount of $13,365.27; (2) Chase, in the amount of $12,636.65; and (3) TD Bank, in the amount of $77,360. (2/22/18 Gov't Ltr. to Court, ECF No. 15, at 2.) In his sentencing submission, Mingo Lamar argued for various alternatives: that no restitution be imposed (2/22/18 Def. Ltr. to Court, ECF No. 16, at 3); that the amount of restitution be set in the amount of $1,000 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); that the restitution be capped at $9,500 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4); or that the Court \"allow additional briefing on the restitution issue\" following sentencing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mingo Lamar was sentenced by the Court on February 23, 2018 to time served with a period of two years of supervised release. (Judgment, ECF No. 19, at 2-3.) However, the Court reserved decision on the amount of restitution and any fine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Court ordered the parties to make additional submissions related to the restitution and fine issues. (2/23/18 Order, ECF No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 9, 2018, the Government submitted an affidavit from a postal inspector reflecting that Mingo Lamar caused losses to BOA in the amount of $13,365.27 and Chase in the amount of $5,554.21. (3/9/18 Ltr., ECF No. 21, at 3-4.) The Government indicated that TD Bank \"declined to respond to the Government's request for additional restitution information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Also on March 9, 2018, Mingo Lamar submitted a declaration, through counsel, stating that Mingo Lamar \"is indigent and is unable to pay a fine or restitution.\" (Marcus Amelkin Decl., ECF. No. 20, \u00b6 9.) On March 15, 2018, Mingo Lamar made an additional submission arguing that the Court should not impose a fine due to the fact that he is indigent, and that restitution should be imposed in the amount of $999. (3/15/18 Def. Ltr., ECF No. 23, at 2-4.) Mingo Lamar argued that restitution could only be imposed \"for losses 'directly caused by the conduct composing the offense of conviction.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (citation omitted).) According to Mingo Lamar, since the offense of conviction was based upon stealing an amount not exceeding $1,000, restitution should not exceed $1,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 28, 2018 (and as required by a March 22, 2018 Order of the Court), the Government responded to Mingo Lamar's March 15, 2018 submission. (3/28/18 Gov't Ltr., ECF No. 27.) The Government acknowledged that restitution is limited by statute to the harm caused by the \"offense of conviction,\" but argued that \"restitution is not limited to the harm caused by the elements of the crime of conviction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) The Government also argued that the scope of restitution was determined by the time period set forth in the Information, which in this case was over a span of months. As such, the Government contends that \"restitution is not limited to $999.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Restitution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\"MVRA\") requires the Court to order a defendant convicted of certain offenses to\n   \"make restitution to the victim of the offense ....\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1). Offenses against property defined in Title 18 are included in those offenses for which restitution is mandated in circumstances where \"an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a ... pecuniary loss.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(1)(B).

Here, Mingo Lamar was initially charged in the Complaint filed against him with one count of bank fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Complaint, ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1.) A violation of that statute carried with it a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or imprisonment of not more than 30 days, or both.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the charging instrument to which Mingo Lamar pled guilty (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Misdemeanor Information, ECF No. 11) charges Mingo Lamar with one count of bank fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]he defendant did knowingly take and carry away, with intent to steal or purloin, property and money not exceeding $1,000 in value belonging to, and in the care, custody, control, management and possession of, a bank, to wit, [defendant] deposited checks payable to others in bank accounts controlled by [defendant] at financial institutions, without the knowledge or consent of the checks' payees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Misdemeanor Information, \u00b6 1.) Section 2113(b) provides that, if the stolen money does not exceed $1,000 in value, a violation will result in imprisonment of not more than one year.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is one year or less, the offense to which Mingo Lamar was charged was classified as a misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203159\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The fact that Mingo Lamar's offense of conviction is a misdemeanor, and not a felony, is significant. The Court finds persuasive the analysis of the court in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Payne\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-MJ-517,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205062099\">\n    2009 WL 5062099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

That statute (regarding the theft of government property), like the statute at issue in this case (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ) also had both a misdemeanor and a felony version, with the misdemeanor version relating to a loss of less than $1,000. The\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [T]he offense of conviction will, by all parties' agreement, be the misdemeanor version of the offense described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20641\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By definition, that offense cannot involve a theft of government property in an amount in excess of $1,000. It would be hard to conclude that restitution in any amount greater than $1,000 would be compensating the government for losses caused by the misdemeanor offense described in the Information. The logical inconsistency between an offense which cannot involve a loss greater than $1,000, and a restitution order for losses that exceed that amount, is simply to[o] difficult for the Court to overcome.... [N]o matter how the parties may attempt, in a plea agreement or plea colloquy, to enlarge the scope of the \"offense of conviction\" here, that offense remains a misdemeanor and is statutorily limited to conduct that deprived the United States of property with a value of less than $1,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205062099\">\n    2009 WL 5062099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. So too, in the present case, the Court cannot find that Mingo Lamar should pay restitution in an amount greater than the amount as to which he was criminally charged,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not greater than $999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Both the Government and Mingo Lamar cite to the decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.
