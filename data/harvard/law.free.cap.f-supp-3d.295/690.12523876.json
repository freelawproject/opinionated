Specifically, the statement of facts noted that from January 2013 through February 2014, in the Eastern District of Virginia, Wallis and her husband, the defendant here who was unindicted at the time, engaged in a conspiracy to obtain money through false statements and misleading representations from three different victim organizations, including SkyLink Air and Logistic Support, Inc.

Significantly, however, Wallis was a signatory on the $600,000 note held by Dan Caplan (\"Caplan note\") and secured by the Virginia Property in 2007. The March 18 Forfeiture Order specified that both the Virginia and the Delaware properties were to be forfeited as \"property that is traceable to, derived from, fungible with or a substitute for property that constitutes the illegal proceeds of the conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 18, 2016, defendant, who was at the time still unindicted and unrepresented, filed a Motion for Relief, requesting removal of a\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   filed against the Virginia Property, and also moved for an ancillary hearing pursuant to Rule 32.2(c)(1), Fed.

With respect to defendant's Motion for Relief, a hearing was held on May 6, 2016. Following the hearing, an Order issued ordering the transfer of the net proceeds owed to defendant from the sale of the Virginia Property to the United States Marshal Service (\"USMS\") upon closing of the sale of that property on May 11, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The parties subsequently filed four sets of briefs, and three hearings were held on December 16, 2016, March 24, 2017, and June 9, 2017. During the ancillary proceedings, the Government presented documentary evidence and testimony from Stacy Young, an FBI forensic accounting expert. Specifically, Young testified that she had traced $338,140.60 in proceeds from Wallis and defendant's fraud to the Virginia property\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and $58,818.35 in criminal proceeds to the Delaware Property. To conduct her tracing analysis, Young testified that she reviewed bank records from the Capital Bank and PNC bank accounts under Wallis and defendant's control. Young then traced funds originating with the various victim organizations to payments associated with the Virginia and Delaware properties. In particular, Young traced funds embezzled from SkyLink, CCAID, and the Saslaw for Senate campaign, to payments made to Daniel Caplan, the holder of the Caplan note secured by the Virginia Property. And, with respect to the Delaware property, Young traced fraud funds to payments to Herl's Bath and Tile, Lansing Building Products, and CLM General Contracting LLC. The parties stipulated that Herl's Bath and Tile, Lansing Building\n   Products, and CLM General Contracting LLC provided services and improvements to the Delaware Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 20, 2017, defendant was indicted by a Eastern District of Virginia grand jury on one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), three counts of mail fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1342, three counts of wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1342, and two counts of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(1) and 1028A(a)(2). Indictment (Doc. 1) at 1. With respect to the money laundering count, the grand jury found probable cause to believe that defendant and Wallis transferred and laundered funds through multiple financial accounts or bogus entities. The Indictment charges that defendant and Wallis then used a portion of these laundered proceeds to fund purchases for the Virginia and Delaware properties. For example, the Indictment alleges that on August 3, 2012, Wallis instructed Capital Bank to transfer funds from CCAID to her personal account before making a payment to Dan Caplan for the Virginia Property and before making a payment to Herl's Bath and Tile for improvements to the Delaware property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    \u00b6 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Shortly thereafter, the Indictment alleges that on August 23, 2012, Wallis directed Capital Bank to route funds from CCAID through multiple bank accounts before making payments on the Virginia Property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    \u00b6 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And on February 26, 2013, the Indictment alleges that Wallis instructed Capital Bank to transfer $10,000 from the FLA account to Wallis and defendant's personal account to cover a check for the Delaware Property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    \u00b6 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the grand jury found probable cause to believe that the Delaware Property and the net proceeds from the sale of the Virginia Property were subject to forfeiture as properties involved in a money laundering offense and traceable to both money laundering and the underlying fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following the grand jury's Indictment, the Government filed a new\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the Delaware Property and on the proceeds from the sale of the Virginia Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, on January 3, 2018, defendant filed the Motion for Release of Funds at issue here. Defendant's arguments in support of this motion are essentially similar to the arguments he advanced in the ancillary proceedings in Wallis's case, namely that the funds from the Virginia and Delaware properties are not traceable to proceeds from the charged criminal offenses and thus are not tainted and cannot be seized pre-trial. Along with his motion, defendant also attached an affidavit, averring that he had no unexhausted assets, apart from the seized assets, with which to fund his legal defense in this case. The Government disputes defendant's arguments with respect to the properties, contending both (i) that the properties were involved money laundering and (ii) that the properties are traceable to laundered money and the underlying fraud proceeds. As a result, the Government contends that the assets were properly seized pending trial. The Government also contests the validity and the credibility of defendant's affidavit, arguing that there is no credible or reliable evidence that defendant has no other assets with which to fund his legal defense in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two hearings were held on this Motion for Release of Funds on February 16, 2018 and February 22, 2018. In the course of these hearings, the Government presented additional testimony from Young, the FBI forensic accounting expert. Young adopted her testimony from the\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   hearings with respect to tracing and testified that,\n   through additional analysis, she was able to identify nine additional transactions involving the Virginia Property and to trace a total of $315,317.10 to the Virginia Property, excluding appreciation. Feb. 16 Hearing Tr. (Doc. 40) 40:24-41:6, 53:23-54:2. These additional transactions included transfers used to pay property taxes on the Virginia Property and to install fixtures in the home. Young also described how several of the transactions identified in the money laundering count of defendant's Indictment demonstrated that the Virginia and Delaware properties were involved in money laundering. For example, with respect to the August 3, 2012 transaction, Young testified that she was able to trace funds embezzled from CCAID to a $8,500 payment on the Caplan note for the Virginia Property and a $10,000 payment for improvements to the Delaware Property. Young read into the record emails from Wallis describing each of these transactions. Specifically, on August 3, 2012, Wallis emailed a Capital Bank employee, asking him to transfer $8,500 to Dan Caplan and $10,000 to Herl's Bath and Tile.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    at 62:16-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Capital Bank employee responded to Wallis, informing her that CCAID was the only account with sufficient funds to process the request and asking her whether he should \"do everything from there or transfer enough funds to your personal and do them from there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    at 63:10-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Young testified at the February 16 hearing that in her opinion, the fact that Wallis deliberately transferred funds through her personal account before making payments suggested she intended to conceal ownership and origin of the fraud funds from both the government and the recipients of the funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    at 61:8-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Young also testified that the Virginia and Delaware properties facilitated the money laundering conspiracy.

Accordingly, the properties are forfeitable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 982(a)(1) and 981(a)(1)(C) and are properly subject to pretrial restraint. Defendant's Motion for Release of Funds must therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To begin with, the Indictment and the evidence in this case make clear that the Virginia and Delaware properties were seized with probable cause to believe the properties were \"involved in\" a money laundering conspiracy, and as such, defendant is not entitled to release of these properties, even if he intends to use the funds therefrom to pay for his legal defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, the grand jury found there was probable cause to believe both the Virginia and the Delaware properties were involved in defendant and Wallis's money laundering conspiracy based on a series of transactions identified explicitly in the Indictment. Specifically, the grand jury found that funds, derived from defendant's and Wallis's fraud, were laundered through several bank accounts, and then used to make payments on the properties, including (i) interest payments on the Caplan note for the Virginia Property, (ii) payments for property taxes on the Virginia Property, (iii) payments to install fixtures in the Virginia Property, and (iv) payments for improvements to the Delaware Property. Based on these transactions, the grand jury found there was probable cause to believe that the Virginia and Delaware properties are forfeitable as property involved in the money laundering conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The evidence presented by the Government over the course of the two hearings on this question supports the grand jury's probable cause finding that both the Virginia and the Delaware properties were involved in a conspiracy to commit money laundering offenses in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1956 and 1957. Specifically, with respect to the \u00a7 1956 offense alleged in the Indictment, the Government introduced evidence via the FBI forensic accounting expert of the financial transactions underlying each of the payments into the Virginia and the Delaware properties. Specifically, the evidence from Wallis's emails and bank records discloses that Wallis embezzled funds from the SkyLink, CCAID, and Saslaw accounts and then moved some fraud funds\n   through the FLA bank account, deliberately transferred other funds via various personal accounts, and made numerous other unusual financial moves before making payments related to the Virginia and Delaware properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feb. 16 Hearing Gov't Exs. 1-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FBI forensic accounting expert testified that the structure of these transactions involving the Virginia and Delaware properties indicates, as required to establish a \u00a7 1956 offense, that Wallis intended to conceal the origin or source of the fraud funds in each of her transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feb. 16 Hearing Tr. 61:8-18. This evidence is thus sufficient to support the grand jury's probable cause determination that the Virginia and Delaware properties were \"involved in\" a conspiracy to launder money in violation of \u00a7 1956.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   And with respect to the \u00a7 1957 offense alleged in the Indictment, the FBI forensic accounting expert testified that she identified several transactions of more than $10,000 where fraud proceeds were transferred into personal bank accounts and then transferred to the Delaware and Virginia properties. For example, the documentary evidence presented at the February 16 hearing reveals that on June 6, 2012, Wallis transferred $22,500 from the CCAID bank account to Herl's Bath and Tile to fund improvements to the Delaware property. Feb. 16 Hearing Gov't Ex. 1. Moreover, the FBI forensic accounting expert testified that on August 23, 2012, Wallis instructed Capital Bank to transfer $23,000 from CCAID to FLA and then $25,000 from FLA to the Caplan note. Feb. 16 Hearing Tr. 71:1-72:4. These transactions of more than $10,000 of criminally derived proceeds establish probable cause to believe the Virginia and Delaware properties were \"involved in\" a conspiracy to launder money, in violation of \u00a7 1957.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Government also adduced evidence that both properties were \"involved in\" a money laundering conspiracy insofar as defendant and Wallis used the properties to facilitate both the underlying fraud and the money laundering offenses. In this regard, the FBI forensic accounting expert testified that defendant and Wallis accessed four different fake email accounts more than 100 times and sent at least 50 fraudulent emails in support of their fraud from the Virginia Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67:12-24. Moreover, the testimony disclosed that Wallis sent instructions to various bank representatives to move funds between various personal accounts while located in the Delaware Property, thereby facilitating the money laundering offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72:5-15. These properties are therefore also forfeitable based on the fact that Wallis and defendant used the properties to facilitate both the money laundering conspiracy and the underlying fraud.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152226\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/42/#p60\">\n    761 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that vehicle in which defendant planned the money laundering offense was forfeitable as facilitating property because defendant met there, rather than in his law office, to be free from \"prying eyes and ears\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, there is sufficient evidence to support the grand jury's probable cause finding that the Virginia and Delaware properties were \"involved in\" a conspiracy to commit launder money in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1956 and 1957. Accordingly, defendant's Motion for Release of Funds must be denied on this ground alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant attempts to undermine this probable cause finding in three ways, but, for the reasons that follow, none of these attempts is successful. To begin with, defendant argues that the properties were not involved in money laundering because neither of the properties were purchased with tainted funds. Although this is a true statement, defendant's reliance on this fact to prevent pretrial seizure misstates and misunderstands the law. To be sure, if a money laundering offense is committed through a purchase or sale of property, the property is \"involved in\" the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    One 1987 Mercedes Benz 300E\n   </em>\n   , 820 F.Supp. at 252 (holding that car was forfeitable where payments made to purchase the car were transactions in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1956 and 1957 ). But property is \"involved in\" a money laundering offense even when it is not purchased through that offense. Courts in this circuit and elsewhere have consistently found that where, as here, laundered money is used to fund improvements to a property or to make other payments associated with a property like payment of property taxes or payments on a real estate loan, that property is \"involved in\" the money laundering offense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319323\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/826/#p831\">\n    21 F.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (8th Cir. 1994) (finding that real property was \"involved in\" money laundering and subject to forfeiture pursuant to \u00a7 982(a)(1) when the laundered money was spent toward improvements on the property and payments on real estate contract).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does the Government need to trace the investments to increased equity in the property for the property to be forfeitable as property involved in a money laundering offense; it is sufficient for the payments to go toward improvements to the property, taxes on the property, or loans secured by the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   To conclude otherwise would essentially amount to an invitation to would-be money launderers to immunize their fraud proceeds by taking out loans and making interest only payments. Accordingly, defendant's arguments in this respect must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's next argument is two-fold; defendant argues (i) that there is no evidence that defendant's purpose in making the payments described in the Indictment was to conceal the origin of the fraudulent funds; and (ii) that the transactions identified in the Indictment were simply fraudulent transfers, not money laundering transactions. As a result, defendant contends that these transactions cannot support a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering offenses in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1956 and 1957.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But these arguments\n   are inappropriate at this stage. In\n   <em>\n    Kaley v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that pretrial seizure of assets requires two probable cause findings: (1) that \"the defendant has committed an offense permitting forfeiture;\" and (2) that \"the property at issue has the requisite connection to that crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaley\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1103. The\n   <em>\n    Kaley\n   </em>\n   Court held that where, as here, a defendant indicted by a grand jury challenges pretrial seizure of assets, the defendant can challenge only the latter of these probable cause determinations, not the former. In other words, as the Supreme Court has noted, defendants indicted by a grand jury \"cannot challenge the grand jury's conclusion that probable cause supports the charges against them\" because \"[t]he grand jury gets to say-without any review, oversight, or second-guessing-whether probable cause exists to think that a person committed a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1098, 1105. In distinguishing between these probable cause determinations, the\n   <em>\n    Kaley\n   </em>\n   Court recognized that a determination that assets are sufficiently connected to an offense is \"a technical matter far removed from the grand jury's core competence and traditional function,\" and as such, \"a judge's finding that assets are not traceable to the crime charged in no way casts doubt on the prosecution itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1099 n.9. By contrast, to permit a defendant to challenge the grand jury's determination that there is probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offense would significantly \"undermine the grand jury [and] create internal contradictions within the criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, defendant argues that there is no evidence showing defendant intended to conceal the origin of fraud funds through the transactions identified in the Indictment and no evidence that the transactions were money laundering offenses, and not simply fraudulent transfers. In effect, defendant is contending that there is insufficient evidence to support the grand jury's determination that there is probable cause to believe defendant committed a money laundering offense through the transactions identified in the Indictment, precisely the type of argument the\n   <em>\n    Kaley\n   </em>\n   Court prohibited. Because this argument amounts to an impermissible challenge to the grand jury's determination that defendant committed the underlying money laundering offense, it is inappropriate at this stage and does not bar pretrial seizure of tainted property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , defendant's argument were proper at this stage, it would nonetheless fail. Courts have noted that different types of evidence can support an inference that a defendant engaged in a transaction with an intent to conceal the source, origin, or ownership of funds, including \"depositing illegal profits in the bank account of a legitimate business,\" \"structuring the transaction in a way to avoid attention,\" \"a series of unusual financial moves cumulating [sic] in the transaction,\" or \"expert testimony on the practices of criminals.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garcia-Emanuel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534687\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1469/#p1476\">\n    14 F.3d 1469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1476 (10th Cir. 1994) (footnotes omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, evidence adduced at the February 16 and February 22 hearings reveals that Wallis, in some instances (i) moved fraud funds through the FLA bank account before transferring to her personal bank account, (ii) deliberately transferred funds via various personal accounts, and (iii) made other unusual financial moves before making payments related to the Virginia and Delaware properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feb. 16 Hearing Gov't Ex. 3,5. Moreover, the FBI forensic\n   accounting expert also testified that the structure of the transactions involving the payments to the Virginia and Delaware properties indicated that Wallis intended to conceal the origin or source of the fraud funds through the various transactions. Feb. 16 Hearing Tr. 61:8-18. Thus, this evidence is sufficient to support the grand jury's probable cause determination that the Virginia and Delaware properties were \"involved in\" money laundering in violation of \u00a7 1956.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant's final argument is that the fact that Wallis used her computer at home both to orchestrate the money laundering conspiracy and to commit the underlying fraud transactions does not mean the properties themselves facilitated the money laundering. In support of this argument, defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    United States v. One 1989 Jaguar XJ6\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20157630\">\n    1993 WL 157630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. 1993). In that case, the defendant drove his Jaguar to the airport to perpetrate a money laundering offense using stolen credit cards and altered drivers' licenses. The district court there rejected the government's attempt to forfeit the Jaguar, finding that an asset must be \"used more extensively in the underlying illegal conduct than merely as a means of commuting to and from the scene of illegal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. But importantly, the court noted that \"if the police had found the laminating machine used to alter the driver's license in the Jaguar, a different result would undoubtedly follow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 n.2. Precisely this occurred here; in contrast to the facts in\n   <em>\n    One Jaguar\n   </em>\n   , the evidence here reveals that defendant actually engaged in both the underlying fraud and the money laundering conspiracy from the confines of the Virginia and Delaware properties, rather than simply using the homes to get to another location. As such, this case fits the exception noted in\n   <em>\n    One Jaguar\n   </em>\n   because the crime actually occurred inside of the seized asset-that is, the laminating machine was actually found in the Jaguar. As such,\n   <em>\n    One Jaguar\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the facts here, and indeed, supports the Government's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Two Tracts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509371\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/204/\">\n    998 F.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1993). To the extent this case is relevant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   it supports the Government's position here. The Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Two Tracts\n   </em>\n   concluded that a parcel of land between the site of a drug trafficking operation and a public road was not forfeitable, distinguishing prior Fourth Circuit precedent in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schifferli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537219\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/987/\">\n    895 F.2d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1990).\n   <em>\n    Two Tracts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509371\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/204/\">\n    998 F.2d at 211-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this case is on all fours with\n   <em>\n    Schifferli\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    Two Tracts\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Schifferli\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit found that a dentist's office was forfeitable because the dentist used the office more than forty times during a four-month period to write illegal prescriptions.\n   <em>\n    Schifferli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537219\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/987/\">\n    895 F.2d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence here, as in\n   <em>\n    Schifferli\n   </em>\n   , discloses multiple occasions during which the defendant used the premises in question to perpetrate the underlying criminal offense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Feb. 16 Hearing Tr. 67:12-24. Thus, the result here should be the same as\n   <em>\n    Schifferli\n   </em>\n   ; because the premises were used to commit the fraud, they are subject to forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In conclusion, the cases defendant cites do not alter the result reached here and in fact support the grand jury's determination that probable cause exists to believe the Virginia and Delaware properties facilitated both money laundering and the underlying fraud and thus were \"involved in\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   the money laundering conspiracy charged in the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In sum, the Government has provided sufficient evidence to show there is probable cause to believe the Virginia Property and the Delaware Property will ultimately be subject to forfeiture as properties \"involved in\" a money laundering conspiracy and defendant has failed to adduce any evidence that the Government seized untainted assets without probable cause. Accordingly, plaintiff's Motion for Release of Funds must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the Virginia and Delaware properties are not \"involved in\" a money laundering conspiracy, there is also probable cause to believe $315,317.10 of the Virginia Property and $58.818.35 of the Delaware Property are traceable to the money laundering conspiracy and to the underlying fraud. As such, these amounts are forfeitable, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20982\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 981(a)(1)(C), as property \"traceable to\" an offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Where, as here, legitimate funds are commingled with fraud proceeds in a bank account, tracing rules allow courts to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate funds and to track or trace the movement of illegitimate funds.

Based on these principles and application of the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule, the Fourth Circuit found that the $78,000 transfer was traceable to the original deposit of $78,266.64 in disputed funds in the checking account, despite the influx of $250,000 before the transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n    at 138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   These principles, applied here, compel the conclusion that the Government's forensic accountant in this case appropriately traced fraud proceeds and laundered property to payments made on the Virginia and Delaware properties. The Government's forensic accountant testified that she applied the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule in her tracing analysis, and a careful review of her analysis suggests that her results are consistent with the principles described in\n   <em>\n    Sony\n   </em>\n   . To begin with, consistent with the principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Sony\n   </em>\n   , the forensic accountant traced fraud proceeds transferred between defendant's personal accounts and used to fund payments on the loan secured by the Virginia Property and improvements to the Delaware Property. At the same time, the FBI forensic accounting expert remained faithful to the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule by abating the amount of identifiable criminal proceeds whenever the balance of the account dipped below the amount of the fraud proceeds. Consistent with the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule, the FBI forensic accounting expert did not increase the amount of fraud proceeds if legitimate funds were later deposited in the account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, the FBI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   forensic accounting expert correctly applied the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule, and as such, adequately traced criminal proceeds both to the Virginia and to the Delaware properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Transaction 16 in the FBI forensic accounting expert's tracing analysis is emblematic of the accountant's application of these principles. In Transaction 16, the forensic accountant traces $4,860.03 in fraud proceeds to the Virginia Property. The tracing occurs as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 6/27/2012-$10,000 of fraud proceeds are transferred from the CCAID account to the defendant's Capital Bank account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 6/28/2012-balance of defendant's Capital Bank account dips to $4,8603.03;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 6/29/2012-$70,000 of legitimate funds are deposited into defendant's Capital Bank account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 7/2/2012-$70,000 is transferred from the defendant's Capital Bank account to the FLA account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 7/3/2012-$8,500 is transferred from the FLA account to the Caplan note.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The forensic account concluded that only $4,860.03, and not the full $8,500 payment to the note holder, is traceable to fraud proceeds because the balance of the defendant's Capital Bank account dipped to $4,860.03 on June 28, 2012. Thus, the forensic accountant applied the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule by accounting for the fact that some of the fraud funds dissipated. She then traced the $4,860.03 of remaining fraud funds to the $70,000 transfer to the FLA account and the subsequent investment in the note secured by the Virginia Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant argues that the FBI forensic accounting expert failed to apply the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule consistently because she traced fraud proceeds out of accounts when the rule presumes that legitimate funds always leave the account first.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this construction of the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule is inconsistent with the Fourth Circuit's application of the rule in\n   <em>\n    Sony\n   </em>\n   . In reaching its conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Sony\n   </em>\n   court made clear that the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule, quite apart from being a rigid rule requiring that fraud funds are always the last to leave an account, aims to \"preserve[ ] the proceeds to the greatest extent possible as the account is depleted.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n    85 F.3d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this regard, \"funds that are not spent but transferred to other accounts or used to purchase investments are identifiable as proceeds of the [criminal activity],\" even when there are also legitimate funds in the account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n    at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying these principles, the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Sony\n   </em>\n   considered precisely the circumstances defendant describes, namely a disputed deposit was followed by a larger, undisputed and untainted deposit, and then a transfer out of the account. Based on these facts, the Fourth Circuit determined that a court could trace the disputed deposit from one account to the other, even though sufficient legitimate funds remained in the original account to cover the whole transfer.\n   <em>\n    Sony Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n    85 F.3d at 138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant's argument is thus inconsistent with\n   the Fourth Circuit's application of the Lowest Intermediate Balance Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, even assuming the FBI forensic accounting expert did apply several different tracing rules, defendant points to no authority which requires the application of one, and only one, rule through an entire tracing procedure. To the contrary, courts have routinely recognized the need for flexibility in the application of tracing rules and the importance of applying tracing rules that reflect the reality of any transaction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Banco Cafetero Panama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615114\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/797/1154/#p1160\">\n    797 F.2d at 1160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[w]hich [tracing] approach reflects reality in any particular case will depend on the precise circumstances\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in outlining the different types of rules, the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Banco Cafetero\n   </em>\n   recognized that once fraudulent proceeds enter a bank account,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   there will be probable cause to believe that the bank account contains [those funds] (if the balance has not fallen below the amount of the deposit)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   probable cause to believe that a withdrawal contains such [funds] (if the withdrawal exceeds the deposit).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Banco Cafetero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615114\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/797/1154/#p1160\">\n    797 F.2d at 1160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that probable cause exists to believe that fraud funds exist both in the account and in the transfer, withdrawal or purchase, the Government is entitled, and indeed required, to apply the approach that better accords with the reality of the transaction and that \"preserves the proceeds to the greatest extent possible as the account is depleted.\"\n   <em>\n    Sony Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571906\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/131/#p138\">\n    85 F.3d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, much like his argument with respect to property involved in money laundering, defendant argues that the properties were not traceable to property involved in a money laundering transaction or fraud proceeds because defendant did not purchase either of the properties with tainted funds. But again this argument mischaracterizes the law. For property to be \"traceable to\" property involved in a money laundering offense, the criminal proceeds need not be used to purchase the property or to increase equity in the property. Rather, portions of a property are traceable to proceeds where the proceeds are used to make payments associated with the property, including payments on loans, property taxes, and payments for improvements to the property.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Beltramea,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329986\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/160/1119/#p1127\">\n    160 F.Supp.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1127 (N.D.

As such, there is probable cause to believe the funds identified are traceable to the money laundering and wire fraud offenses charged in the Indictment. And this result makes sense-defendant would not have had the improvements to the Delaware property absent the embezzled and laundered funds. And even though defendant paid only interest on the Virginia property loan, and did not pay down the principal of his mortgage on the Virginia Property, the fraud proceeds nonetheless enabled defendant to retain title to, and keep, his home. Had defendant not used the fraud proceeds to pay the interest on the Caplan note, defendant would have lost his home under the terms of the note.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Both parties expressly incorporate their briefing, argument and the facts developed in the\n    <em>\n     Wallis\n    </em>\n    ancillary proceedings in their arguments in\n    <em>\n     Miller.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Although the statement of facts Wallis signed describes the crimes against all three of the victim organizations,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Specifically, Wallis emailed a Capital Bank employee on August 23, 2012, asking that employee to transfer $23,000 from the CCAID account to the FLA account and then to transfer $25,000 from the FLA account to the Caplan note. From her review of the record, Young testified that she was able to trace these corresponding transactions through Wallis and defendant's accounts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Young also testified concerning her comparison of defendant's bank records to defendant's affidavit filed in support of his Motion for Release of Funds. Based on her review, Young determined that many of the statements in defendant's initial affidavit were false. For example, defendant stated that he earned $1,000 per month in social security, but his bank records revealed that in reality, defendant collected more than $4,000 per month in social security checks. And although defendant averred that he spends $3,000 per month on childcare, his accounts do not contain any transactions reflecting these payments. Moreover, defendant averred that he did not have any unexhausted assets with which to fund his legal defense, but Young identified several undisclosed sources of funds. For example, the Government revealed that defendant received a $352,000 credit to his USAA account in 2016 and a $182,000 credit in the first half of 2017. The Government also identified an undisclosed mutual fund containing more than $50,000. Finally, defendant's USAA Account Summary Schedule also revealed that between September, 1, 2015 and July 31, 2017, defendant received $71,597.39 in deposits from rentals of the Delaware Property with a net profit of approximately $32,000 in 2016 alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Although this testimony certainly casts doubt on defendant's affidavit, in the end, it is unnecessary to decide whether defendant has established that he needs the seized funds to hire legal counsel because the Fourth Circuit has held that pretrial restraint of untainted assets is illegal, regardless of whether the assets are necessary for a legal defense.\n    <em>\n     United States v.
