Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises from a dispute over flood-insurance payments for damage from a Houston, Texas storm in May 2015. Ali Ekhlassi held two insurance policies: a Texas Homeowners Deluxe Policy issued by the Auto Club Indemnity Company; and a flood-insurance policy with National Lloyds Insurance Company, underwritten by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Docket Entry Nos. 16-2, 16-3). The court previously granted Auto Club's motion for partial summary judgment. (Docket Entry No. 17). National Lloyds now moves for summary judgment on the basis that the statute of limitations bars Ekhlassi's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on the motion, the record evidence, and the applicable law, National Lloyds' motion for summary judgment is granted and Ekhlassi's claims are dismissed, with prejudice. The reasons are stated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. Between May 23 to 25, 2015, a severe storm caused heavy flooding in Houston. Ekhlassi suffered significant damage to his home when five to six feet of floodwater filled his unfinished basement garage for two days. Ekhlassi alleges a loss amount of $274,940.05 for the flood damage. (Docket Entry No. 19 at 2). Ekhlassi had coverage under both the Homeowners policy from Auto Club and the flood policy from National Lloyds, before and during the storm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The National Lloyds policy was part of the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2015, just after the flood, Ekhlassi reported his losses to National Lloyds. A few days later, National Lloyds sent insurance adjuster Jim Nemechek to inspect Ekhlassi's property. Nemechek estimated losses totaling $3,768.15 for \"flood loss clean-up and other covered damages,\" but found that all other damages were excluded under Ekhlassi's policy. (Docket Entry No. 18 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 6, 2015, National Lloyds sent Ekhlassi a letter stating that he had not yet submitted a proof of loss form for his claim and that it could not process his claim payment for $3,768.25 until it received his proof of loss. (Docket Entry No. 18, Ex. C). The letter informed Ekhlassi that he had 240 days from the date of loss to provide the signed and sworn proof of loss and that National Lloyds was denying payment for \"any building and contents items not subject to direct physical loss by or from flood\" and \"all non-covered items located below the lowest elevated floor of your post-FIRM elevated building.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 28, 2015, Ekhlassi provided the sworn proof of loss to National Lloyds, stating an amount of $276,190.05 less the deductible, for a total of $274,940.05. On January 11, 2016, National Lloyds sent Ekhlassi a second letter rejecting the proof of loss, confirming that it would pay only the previously determined amount of $3,768.25, and referring Ekhlassi to the October 6, 2015 denial letter for the reasons. (Docket Entry No. 18, Ex. E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One year later, on January 11, 2017, Ekhlassi sued National Lloyds and Auto Club, alleging breach of contract, violations of Chapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 541.060, 542.055 -60; TEX. BUS. COM. CODE \u00a7 17.46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   National Lloyds moved for summary judgment, (Docket Entry No. 18), and Ekhlassi responded, (Docket Entry No. 19). The summary judgment record evidence includes a copy of Ekhlassi's Standard Flood Insurance Policy, Number 1547431881, a copy of the loss report, the October 6, 2015 letter from National Lloyds to Ekhlassi, Ekhlassi's original petition, a copy of the January 11, 2016 letter from National Lloyds to Ekhlassi, an affidavit from National Lloyds' records custodian, and FEMA memorandum W-15022 granting a 180-day extension for policy holders to submit proof of loss. This record is analyzed under the applicable legal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

If, as National Lloyds argues, the October 6 letter was the notice of denial, then the suit is untimely and barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The October 6 letter made clear that it was a denial of Ekhlassi's claim. The letter stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Independent Adjuster's final report indicates there were no visible signs of covered flood damage to the subfloor and flooring of the first elevated floor. We are denying payment for any building and contents items not subject to direct physical loss by or from flood, pursuant to the Standard Flood Insurance Policy ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In accordance with the Standard Flood Insurance Policy, we are denying payment for all non-covered items located below the lowest elevated floor of your post-FIRM elevated building ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 18, Ex. C). The letter also stated that \"[i]f you do not agree with our decision to deny your claim, in whole or in part, Federal law allows you to appeal that decision within 60 days of the date of this denial letter.\" The October 6 letter instructed Ekhlassi that National Lloyds had determined that it would cover his losses in the amount of $3,768.25, but it could not process his payment unless and until he submitted his sworn proof of loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In contrast, the January 11 letter states that the amount of the claim was previously determined in the prior letter: \"Please be advised the below referenced flood claim payment(s) were previously sent out under separate cover....\" The letter rejected Ekhlassi's attempt to increase his payment by submitting a proof of loss for the full amount, and confirmed that National Lloyds would only pay the previously determined amount. In fact, the January letter referenced the October letter directly, stating: \"Please refer to the denial letter dated October 6, 2015 for what Federal law allows under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy and for the reasons of denial for damages that have been claimed.\" (Docket Entry No. 18, Ex. E). The letter makes clear that National Lloyds had already denied the claim in October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This result is consistent with the case law. In\n   <em>\n    Cole v. N.H.

LEXIS 17761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (emphasis in original). The court explained that the difference in the two letters was \"self-evident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2017761\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The first letter repeatedly used \"conditional language\" to signify \"a possible or likely future determination\"; the second letter \"definitively states\" the outcome of the claims and refers explicitly to the letter itself as a \"denial letter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2017761\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second letter was the denial of the insurance claim at issue and the point at which the statute of limitations began to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The same is true here. The October 6 letter makes clear that National Lloyds was denying the majority of Ekhlassi's claim at that time. The letter refers to itself as a denial letter. The statute of limitations began to run at that point. Because Ekhlassi waited more than one year to file suit, his claim is barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ekhlassi cites two cases in support of his argument that the January 2016 letter gave him notice, not the earlier letter. Both cases are distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Qader v. FEMA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767023\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/558/\">\n    543 F.Supp.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. La. 2008), the court addressed the same issue, but noted that after Hurricane Katrina, FEMA substantially modified the the National Flood Insurance Program to expedite claims, in part by partially waiving the proof of loss requirement. With this waiver, a policyholder who agreed with an adjuster's estimate could settle a that claim without any proof of loss. By contrast, the limited waiver in this case granted an extension of the time to file a proof of loss from 60 days to 240 days from the flood date. (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 1). However, FEMA also made clear that \"[b]y granting this limited waiver and extension of the time period to send a proof of loss, FEMA does not hereby waive any other provisions of the [Policy], and all other terms and conditions of the [Policy] remain in effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The one-year deadline to file suit remained. The second case,\n   <em>\n    Kroll v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-2496,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204626009\">\n    2014 WL 4626009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20128597\">\n    2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Sept. 15, 2014), applied the reasoning from\n   <em>\n    Qadar\n   </em>\n   to an identical extension FEMA granted for Hurricane Sandy. Unlike those cases, Ekhlassi's proof of loss did not appeal FEMA's decision, but was a prerequisite to payment. In this case, FEMA denied Ekhlassi's claim in October 2015 and simply required submission of the sworn proof of loss before it could pay on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons stated above, National Lloyds' motion for summary judgment, (Docket Entry No. 18), is granted. This case is dismissed, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
