The marketing materials advertised a three-year rental guarantee, completed construction within six months, and \"clear title\" to the property. Defendant Angela Reiter (\"Reiter\") directed and facilitated the transaction, and plaintiffs signed a property management agreement (\"First Property\n   Management Agreement\") with defendant Phillip Ryan, LLC (\"Phillip Ryan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2016 the Van Rooyens executed a Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"Real Estate Agreement\") to purchase a piece of property referred to as the \"Bumelia property,\" and wired a deposit to Phillip Ryan (the designated escrow agent). Greystone provided a deposit receipt to the Van Rooyens, however, that identified a different property (the Devilwood property) than was the subject of the Real Estate Agreement. Reiter represented to the Van Rooyens that the Bumelia property had been purchased by another investor, and that the Devilwood property had been substituted. Weaver then offered the Van Rooyens the option to purchase a third property (the Shortleaf property) because the Devilwood property had also already been sold. The Van Rooyens allege that the Bumelia and Devilwood properties do not actually exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2016, per defendants' advice, the Van Rooyens created an entity called Jasmine Green, LLC (\"JGL\") and opened a bank account in the United States to facilitate the transaction for the Shortleaf property. The Van Rooyens paid Phillip Ryan and Greystone, respectively, the relevant fees for creating JGL and the bank account. Phillip Ryan Texas, LLC (\"Ryan Texas\") was designated as JGL's registered agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2016 Reiter sent the Van Rooyens photographs depicting a residence under construction. Reiter then convinced the Van Rooyens to sign JGL's initial operating agreement, which transferred operational control of JGL to Ryan Texas. Defendant David Clemons (\"Clemons\") assured the Van Rooyens that construction would close around July 19, 2016. Over the next several months, Clemons requested and received several addenda to the Real Estate Agreement reflecting later closing dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2016 the Van Rooyens executed another property management agreement (\"Second Property Management Agreement\") naming Clemons, a manager of Ryan Texas, as the property manager. Later, defendant Sean Tissue (\"Tissue\") sent the Van Rooyens a lease guarantee promising three years of lease payments. In October 2016 Clemons sent the Van Rooyens photographs of a nearly completed residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2016 Greystone sent the Van Rooyens an email canceling the Real Estate Agreement. Further investigations revealed that Greystone never owned the Shortleaf property. Phillip Ryan, on behalf of Greystone, executed a promissory note (\"Note\") under which Greystone promised to pay back the deposit amount with interest. Suspecting that defendants were engaged in a fraudulent scheme, the Van Rooyens paid a fee to remove Ryan Texas as the registered agent of JGL. Defendants have failed to return any money or make any payments on the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2017 the Van Rooyens brought this lawsuit against Greystone, Phillip Ryan, Ryan Texas, Sycamore Homes, LLC, Sean Ryan, Clemons, Tissue,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Justin McRae, and Reiter, alleging a civil RICO\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   claim and claims for statutory fraud, common\n   law fraud, money had and received, breach of contract, declaratory judgment for a constructive trust, piercing the corporate veil, and conspiracy. All defendants except Reiter now move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, or under Rule 12(b)(3) for improper venue, or, alternatively, to transfer venue under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.

Tex. 2005) ). The Van Rooyens contend that, because Greystone breached the Real Estate Agreement related to a Texas property, the actions giving rise to this lawsuit occurred in Texas. Defendants maintain that the only action surviving the execution of the Note is for breach of that Note, which would have occurred in Michigan. The Note refers, however, to Greystone's unilateral cancellation of the Real Estate Agreement. Moreover, defendants do not dispute that the property subject to the Real Estate Agreement is located in the Northern District of Texas, and defendants' brief describes the execution of the Note as an attempt to resolve the breach of the Real Estate Agreement for a property in Texas. The events giving rise to this lawsuit pertain to a real estate transaction in Texas and an attempted resolution for that transaction's failure. This factor weighs in favor of retaining the case in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The third factor considers the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern\n   the case. The Note contains a choice-of-law clause that provides that Michigan law governs.
