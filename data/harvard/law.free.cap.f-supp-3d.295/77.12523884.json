Although Mr. Klopfer recognized that he \"may\" have mentioned the word \"altercation\" when relaying the conversation to Mr. Kline, Mr. Klopfer also testified that, during the meeting between Mr. Klopfer and Mr. Siuzdak, Mr. Siuzdak did not \"swear at\" or \"belittle\" Mr. Klopfer or \"act unprofessionally.\" Klopfer Tr. at 15:23-16:2. Instead, Mr. Klopfer described the conversation as: \"[Mr. Siuzdak] is a taller, bigger guy. He was sitting down and, you know, I was sitting down behind my desk. You know, it just was two grown men.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16: 2-5. For his part, Mr. Siuzdak says that \"there was no altercation,\" and that he asked Mr. Klopfer about the draft PAR, Siuzdak Tr. at 105: 1-2, which was given to him by the Operational Support Technician,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9. A reasonable juror could infer that Ms. Ferrick took out of context the conversation between Mr. Siuzdak and Mr. Klopfer, about which she had no direct knowledge, as a pretext to retaliate against Mr. Siuzdak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Mr. Siuzdak also argues as specious Ms. Ferrick's remaining reasons for not recommending Mr. Siuzdak for promotions. Mr. Siuzdak claims he was in the hospital when Ms. Ferrick called him and his voicemail was full, but he had directed his wife to call Mr. Klopfer. Siuzdak Tr. at 68:8-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ferrick Tr. at 42:18-19 (\"When I called him, [Mr. Siuzdak] was in the hospital.\"). Finally, while Mr. Siuzdak would \"sometimes\" answer his voicemail,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:11, he maintains: \"[N]o one's ever referred to the voicemail that I've had other than in the context of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6. Furthermore, Mr. Siuzdak is usually available by \"Internet and with texts.\" Siuzdak Tr. at 68:23-24. Mr. Siuzdak also maintains that he turned in his medical readiness form before the deadline, not after. Siuzdak Aff. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Defendant also maintains that \"PAR ratings do not directly correlate to the decision whether or not to recommend a candidate for a position.\" Def.'s Reply Br. at 7. To support the proposition, Defendant states that allegations of poor performance were not the express reason for Ms. Ferrick's non-recommendations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Ferrick's stated reasons for not recommending Mr. Siuzdak were expressed in terms\n   of \"four competencies\": (1) leadership; (2) interpersonal ability; (3) organization and planning; and (4) communication.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Nov. 13, 2014, FD 955 Form. By comparison, PAR evaluations are measured by three analogous \"critical elements\"; (1) relating with others and providing professional services; (2) organizing, planning, and coordinating; and (3) communicating orally and in writing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dec. 29, 2014, PAR. Although the two measures of skill are not the same, Defendant has offered no evidence to suggest that one does not inform the other for purposes of evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As for Ms. Ferrick's May 2015 non-recommendation, there is evidence in the record that would fairly support an inference of retaliatory motive. On April 29, 2015, Mr. Siuzdak submitted an EEO complaint about Ms. Ferrick's earlier non-recommendations, all of which contained the same narrative evaluation verbatim. On May 15, 2015, Ms. Ferrick non-recommended Mr. Siuzdak for a fourth GS-14 position (No. 20150772). But this time, while remaining substantively similar to is predecessors, Ms. Ferrick changed the narrative text. Now, among other criticisms, Ms. Ferrick cites him for lacking organizational skills, submitting forms late, and taking the full ninety days to complete Guardian leads. Mr. Siuzdak has testified that he never took the full ninety days to complete an assignment, instead maintaining that, on average, he took forty-three days to complete an assignment; he had never been counseled about his case files being disorderly; and that he had not turned later paperwork during the relevant evaluation period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   A juror could reasonably infer that Ms. Ferrick, for the first time, changed the narrative in the May 2015 FD 955 Form after Mr. Siuzdak had complained about continually being non-recommended for promotions, in an effort to shore up the legitimacy of the evaluation that otherwise was meant to retaliate against Mr. Siuzdak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Defendant argues that Mr. Siuzdak's past PARs are \"meaningless\" in establishing retaliation, because \"[i]t is not as though Ferrick repeatedly recommended [Mr. Siuzdak] for promotions until he filed an EEO complaint, and then suddenly started non-recommending him.\" Def.'s Reply at 7. Again, Defendant ignores the significance of Mr. Siuzdak's October 20, 2014, lawsuit; nor has Defendant made clear why Mr. Siuzdak must make this suggested showing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibok v.

Before that, the most recent allegation of retaliation was Mr. Kline's involvement in the May 2014 LCB for the New Haven GS-14 position (No. 201405400), for which Mr. Kline was a non-voting member.

The Court notes that more discerning precision is required when recounting the applicability of equitable estoppel. The distinction Mr. Siuzdak draws between the evidentiary standards of but-for and sole-cause causation is an inquiry fundamental to the question of whether a party should be issue precluded, not judicially estopped.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cent.
