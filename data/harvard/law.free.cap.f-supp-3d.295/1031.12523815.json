COUSINS, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the summer of 2016 it was common to see children and adults walking while craning their necks down to their phones in an effort to catch Pok\u00e9mon or reach Pok\u00e9stops. This patent infringement suit goes to the core of the mapping technology used in Pok\u00e9mon GO. Plaintiff Location Based Services, LLC (LBS) asserts 44 separate claims spread out over four map-related patents that are allegedly infringed at apparently every instant a user is playing Pok\u00e9mon GO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Niantic, Inc. is the developer of Pok\u00e9mon GO, and Niantic moves to dismiss LBS's complaint for patent infringement under the two-part test developed in\n   <em>\n    Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int'l\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    189 L.Ed. 2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The two-part test considers first whether a patent is directed to an abstract idea, and if so, whether it discloses an inventive concept. If a patent is directed to an abstract idea and does not disclose an inventive concept, the patent is deemed invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Niantic's argument is that the four patents are directed to the abstract idea of collecting, analyzing, and displaying information on a map. Niantic further argues that the patents disclose no inventive concept sufficient to save the patents. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that all four of the patents are directed to an abstract idea, and do not disclose an inventive concept. Thus, the asserted patents are invalid\n   under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Court GRANTS Niantic's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dkt. No. 30 at 3-5. All of the patents are entitled \"Map Display System and Method\" and have the same inventors listed. Because the four patents share the same abstract, detailed description and figures, the Court will refer to the earliest-filed '996 Patent, unless otherwise noted. The '114 Patent is a continuation of the '648 Patent. '114 Patent at 1. The '648 Patent, in turn, is a continuation of the '996 Patent, which was the earliest-filed patent. '648 Patent at 1.

Dkt. No. 30. Given the number of claims at issue in this case, the Court concentrates on the asserted independent claims in its discussion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claim 1 of the '996 Patent provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A method for providing map-related data, the method comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   receiving a request for a map display illustrating information relative to one or more locations in a predetermined area;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   determining a status associated with at least one of the locations on the map display, the status being a function of one or more location interaction rules associated with at least one of the locations on the map display; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   generating a signal to indicating on the map display the status regarding a permitted traverse or visit that is allowed under an applicable location interaction rule associated with the at least one of the locations on the map display.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   '996 Patent at col. 17:14-28.

Lastly, LBS asserts independent systems claims of the '610 Patent. Independent claim 7 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A system for receiving a map through a predefined area at a display device, the system comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   circuitry for transmitting a request for the map including one or more locations, the request including an identifier associated with a user of the display device;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   circuitry for receiving the map including one or more locations, at least one location of the one or more locations associated with one or more location interaction rules verifiable via one or more monitoring devices; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   circuitry for interacting with the one or more monitoring devices to alter the map on the display device as a function of the one or more location interaction rules as modified by one or more user interaction rules associated with the user of the display device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   '610 Patent at col. 19:17-30. LBS also asserts independent claim 8, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A system for receiving a map through a predefined area at a display device, the system comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   circuitry for transmitting a request for the map including one or more locations, the request including an identifier associated with a user of the display device;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   circuitry for receiving the map including one or more locations, at least one location of the one or more locations associated with one or more location interaction rules verifiable via one or more monitoring devices; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   circuitry for interacting with the one or more monitoring devices to alter the map on the display device as a function of the one or more location interaction rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at col. 19:31-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A number of terms used in the abstract and claims are not defined in the Detailed Description. For instance, the patents give illustrations of \"location interaction rules,\" such as the amount of time a user is allowed at a location, or the number of visits a user is permitted for a location, but no definition. '996 Patent col. 8:35-36, 8:63-65. In its opposition to Niantic's motion, LBS defines \"location interaction rule\" as follows: \"rules that can be correlated with data in a map display module.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 20 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court accepts this construction of \" location interaction rule,\" as the Court must construe the term in light most favorable to the non-movant.\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction &amp; Transmission LLC v.

Similarly, there are only illustrations of \" user interaction rules,\" such as \"the amount of time a user has for all locations, or provide carte blanche for a user to expand on location interaction rules.\" '996 Patent at col. 8:65-67. LBS proffers a construction for \"user interaction rule\": \"user specific rules stored in a data store that applies to a user and not a location.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 20 n.5. LBS requests \" display\" be construed as \"electronic/ electronically display,\" and \" determining a status\" be construed as \"using the location interaction rules in combination with the data stored in the map display module to determine a status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Lastly, LBS requests that the phrase \" interacting with the one or more monitoring devices\" be construed as \"periodically updating the status associated with the at least one or more locations when data is received from monitoring devices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21 n.6.

In contrast, nowhere in the '996 Patent\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is there a discussion of the prior art or the patent's improvement thereof. LBS argues in the opposition that the '996 Patent is directed to improving the existing technological process of \"how electronic maps display information related to a permitted traverse or visit through the use of location interaction rules and/or user interaction rules associated with locations on a map.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 20. This language is meaningless. Merely reciting claim language does not create an improvement to a technological process. As drafted, claim 1 encompasses any processing and displaying of desired mapping information based on location-based or user-based data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, the Court is persuaded that claim 1 is abstract. The claim is best described as a method for: (1) receiving a request for a specific map, (2) determining information about the requested locations based on rules associated with the location, and (3) communicating on the map whether a person may or may not enter the location based on those rules. The Court agrees with Niantic's assessment that the \"rules\" in practice are nothing more information that can be analyzed by a generic computer, or by the human brain. This claim is thus directed to the receipt, processing, and display of data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At step 1 of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the Court determines what the claim is directed to, and need not take into account LBS's jargon-filled proposed constructions of \"location interaction rules\" and \"statuses.\" LBS artfully seeks to tie the patents to hardware, such as display devices and monitoring devices to make them more \"concrete.\" But mechanically applying those alleged limitations at step 1 is not proper, because at step 1 of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the Court's duty is to consider the claims' \"focus,\" or \"their character as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1335 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re TLI Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n    823 F.3d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While claim 17 requires concrete, tangible components such as 'a telephone unit' and a 'server,' the specification makes clear that the recited physical components merely provide a generic environment in which to carry out the abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in an organized manner.\").

Claim 19 is also directed to an abstract idea because it applies generic computer components to claim 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying an abstract\n   concept to a computer, without more, is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Before going on, the Court briefly addresses the Amended Complaint, in which \"location interaction rules\" include the number of players required for gym or raid battle, raid presence and/or raid timer, gym affiliation, and allowed user interaction. Dkt. No. 30 at 24. These examples of \"location interaction rules,\" which LBS defines as \"rules that can be correlated with data,\" make evident how abstract and all-encompassing LBS's proffered definition is. A location interaction rule encompasses any data about a location. Likewise, the Court points to LBS's use of the undefined term \"status,\" which indicates on the map \"rules such as number of players required for a single or multi-person gym or raid battle, raid presence and/or raid timer, the gym affiliation, and allowed user interaction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These allegations do not comport with LBS's narrower construction of what location interaction rules do.

Dkt. No. 46-1 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Niantic clarified its analogy, stating the concierge would take into account location information. Dkt. No. 47 at 10. Moreover, the Court is unconvinced that the location decides whether a user may enter a location; rather, by the plain language of the claim, the permitted visit is determined\n   through data about the location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '996 Patent Claim 1 (\"generating a signal to indicate on the map display the status regarding a permitted traverse or visit that is allowed under an applicable location interaction rule associated with the at least one of the locations on the map display.\"). The language suggests that something\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the location determines whether a user may enter. In any event, this clause demonstrates the problem that runs rampant with respect to each of the asserted patents: the claim language is so vague as to include or exclude anything. As to claim 19, even assuming that an interaction between user and location interaction rules were required in the penultimate clause, all this means is that there must be some \"correlation\" between user and location \"rules.\" For example, a user interaction rule could be data about a man (user) who travels in a wheelchair, and a \"correlated\" location interaction rule could be data of all of the wheelchair-accessible sushi restaurants in the area. Niantic's modified analogy of claim 1 is suitable, and adequately encompasses both claim 1 and 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The '648 Patent is Abstract.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Claim 1 describes a \"method\" for a display device to receive a map. The method consists of: (1) transmitting a request for a map, with the request identifying the device's user, (2) receiving the map at the display device, the map containing \"rules\" about the location that are \"verifiable via one or more monitoring devices\", and (3) interacting with monitoring devices to alter the map on the device based on \"rules\" regarding the location or locations.

Construction of Terms &amp; Comparison to Prior Case Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Niantic argues the asserted claims are abstract. The difference between claim 1 of the '996 Patent and claim 1 of the '648 Patent is that claim 1 of the '648 Patent deals with\n   <em>\n    receiving\n   </em>\n   a map, whereas claim 1 of the '996 Patent\n   <em>\n    provides\n   </em>\n   the map. Also, claim 1 of the '648 Patent refers to receiving a map at a display device that is \"verifiable via one or more monitoring devices.\" '648 Patent at col. 17:22-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Per Niantic, a \"monitoring device\" is any device that can provide information about locations or users, so LBS's invocation of a \"monitoring device\" is insufficient at step 1, as collecting information for analysis is an abstract idea. Dkt. No. 35 at 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.

In addition, asserts Niantic, that \"location interaction rules are 'verifiable' via one or more monitoring devices\" does not render the claim non-abstract because verification is undefined. Dkt. No. 35 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   LBS argues that claim 1 improves on an existing technological process. According to LBS, [t]he claimed monitoring devices do not simply collect information for analysis, but rather they interact with the display device to achieve the concrete purpose of the invention. That is to say, through the interaction with monitoring devices, the display device can display conditions that are verifiable by the monitoring devices to achieve the goal of the claimed invention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But LBS's reasoning is circular. In LBS's own words, the '648 Patent is \"directed to improving an existing technological process, specifically\n   how electronic maps display information through the use of location interaction rules that are verifiable by monitoring devices and through interaction with the monitoring devices to alter a map on a display device.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In essence, the concrete purpose of the invention is improving on the invention it is claiming. That makes no sense, because a claim cannot improve on the technological process of the same claim. In contrast, the claim could possibly be deemed non-abstract if it improved on an existing technological process. That is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   LBS also argues claim 1 is not abstract because the monitoring devices must be capable of interacting with the display device. Dkt. No. 46-1 at 21. But all these interactions entail is collecting data from the monitoring device. Dkt. No. 47 at 11. By LBS's own admission, the monitoring device merely issues information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 46-1 at 21 n.6 (defining interacting with a monitoring device as \"periodically updating the status associated with the at least one of the one or more locations when data is received from the monitoring device\"). It is the display device that \"updates\" so-called \"statuses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   LBS likewise argues \"verification\" makes the claim concrete. Dkt. No. 46-1 at 21. Rather than define \"verification,\" LBS provides an example.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In reviewing that example, the Court finds it irrelevant with respect to the '648 Patent because neither claim 1 nor claim 9 mentions user interaction rules. The example deals with correlating user and location interaction rules to determine if a user interaction rule may nullify a violation to a location interaction rule. '648 Patent at col. 8:39-52. Indeed, there is no verification requirement in the claim at all-only that the location interaction rule be\n   <em>\n    verifiable.\n   </em>\n   Even if verification\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   required, claim 1 would still be abstract because verifying information falls into the abstract idea category.\n   <em>\n    CyberSource Corp. v.

The Court does not consider the references to generic monitoring devices and displays to be central to claim 1. Thus, claim 1 is directed to (1) transmitting a request for a map of certain locations, (2) receiving the map containing those locations and associated rules, and (3) interacting with other data sources to alter the map based on rules. \"Rules\" are information that can be analyzed by a computer or the human brain.

No. 35 at 20. Though Niantic's analogy does not precisely encompass claim 1, the Court can construct a brick-and-mortar analogy exemplifying claim 1: (1) a method for a concierge to provide mapping information to hotel customers, (2) a customer asks a concierge for a map showing parks that are within walking distance, (3) the concierge provides a map detailing information about specific parks within walking distance and telling the customer that she may ask passers-by if the concierge's information is still correct, and (4) the customer asks the passers-by if the information is still correct, and if it is not, the customer changes the information on the map. Based on the Detailed Description of\n   the '648 Patent, it does not appear that the map changes itself; rather, the map \"can\n   <em>\n    be\n   </em>\n   altered\" based on information received from monitoring devices. '648 Patent at col. 12:38-61, 13:43-44, 13:47-49. Who or what alters the map is unclear, and the specification does not provide clarity. This lack of clarity requires that the Court not hinge its abstractness finding on a brick-and-mortar analogy as to the '648 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The '114 Patent is Abstract.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Claim 1 describes a \"method\" for a display device to receive a map. This method consists of (1) transmitting a request for a specific location, with the request identifying the user of the device, (2) receiving the map at the display device, with the map containing \"rules\" about the location or locations, and (3) interacting with monitoring devices to alter the map on the device based on \"rules\" regarding the locations, as modified by information regarding the user of the device.

Based on those discussions, the Court concludes that if one of those patents is abstract, so too is the other. The Court finds this treatment is appropriate, as the language in claim 1 of both patents is nearly identical. The following table is instructive:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-110\"><strong>`114 Patent Claim 1</strong> <strong>`648 Patent Claim 1</strong> A method for a display device to receive a A method for a display device to receive a map through a predefined area, the method map through a predefined area, the method comprising: comprising: transmitting a request including one or transmitting a request including one or more locations, the request including an more locations, the request including an identifier associated with a user of the identifier associated with a user of the display device; display device; receiving the map including one or more receiving the map <em>at the display device,</em> the locations; at least one location of the one map including one or more locations, at or more locations associated with one or least one location of the one or more more location interaction rules verifiable locations associated with one or more via one or more monitoring devices; and location interaction rules verifiable via one or more monitoring devices; and interacting with one or more monitoring devices to alter the map on the display interacting with one or more monitoring device as a function of the one or more devices to alter the map on the display location interaction rules <em>as modified by</em> device as a function of the one or more <em>one or more user interaction rules</em> location interaction rules. <em>associated with the user of the display</em> <em>device.</em></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   '114 Patent at col. 17:42-55, '648 Patent at col. 17:17-29 (differences emphasized).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The claim language in the last clause includes interactions with monitoring devices that are functions of location interaction rules modified by user interaction rules specific to a user. All this means is that the interaction with monitoring devices to alter the map not only takes into account rules about locations, but also rules about the person requesting the map. The processing of additional information does not save claim 1. Claim 1 is directed to (1) transmitting a request for a map of\n   certain locations, (2) receiving the map containing those locations and associated rules, and (3) interacting with other data sources to alter the map based on those rules about locations, while taking into consideration rules about the user.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though this claim requires more information to be considered in the altering of the map, this difference does not render claim 1 non-abstract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The '610 Patent is Abstract.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Independent claim 7 describes a \"system for receiving a map through a predefined area on a device\" consisting of: (1) circuitry for transmitting a request for a map that includes an identifier for the device's user, (2) circuitry for receiving the map where at least one of the locations is associated with data that may be verified by a monitoring device, and (3) circuitry for interacting with monitoring devices that alter the map as a function of the data regarding locations, as modified by data about the user of the device. '610 Patent at col. 19:17-29. Independent claim 8 is identical to claim 7 except that at step (3), the interaction with the monitoring devices altering the map as a function of the data regarding locations is not modified by information about the user.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at col. 19:30-42. LBS alleges Niantic infringes claims 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, and 26. It is unclear why LBS asserts claim 5, which depends on claim 1, but does not assert claim 1. Indeed, in its opposition, LBS asserts claim 1, though an opposition brief is not the place to bring up new facts.\n   <em>\n    Schneider v.

Claim 1 is abstract because it is a generic means to build a generic computer capable of receiving a request for a map described in claim 1 of the '648 and '114 Patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 35 at 20-22. The Court found claim 1 of both patents abstract, and does not find a claim applying an abstract idea to generic computer parts to be any less so. Claim 1 of the '610 Patent is patent-ineligible at step 2 of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   for the same reason.\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

The thrust of Niantic's abstract idea argument as to this patent is\n   that the asserted claims are merely systems claims for implementing the method claims of the '648 and '114 Patents. Dkt. No. 35 at 20-22. LBS does not dispute this fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. no. 46-1 at 23, and the Court agrees with Niantic's assessment. Thus, because the method claims in the '648 and '114 Patents have been found to be abstract, so too must systems claims 7 and 8 of the '610 Patent, which merely tack on circuitry to the method claims in the earlier-filed patents.

Claim 1 has three functions: (1) receiving a request, (2) determining a status based on rules about locations, and (3) generating a signal. '996 Patent at col. 17:15-28. Thus, these three elements involve the analysis of information and signaling of the results of that analysis.

The receiver of the generated signal is a \"map display.\" A map display receiving a map merely performs its routine and generic function. The nail in the coffin to claim 1 is the fact that by LBS's own proposed construction of \"display\"-\"electronic/electronically display\"-it is clear that the only thing distinguishable about a map display is that it is electronic. Dkt. No. 46-1 at 20 n.5. The Court also considers LBS definition of \"location interaction rule\": \"rules that can be correlated with data in a map display module.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But again, all \"rules\" are is information that can be analyzed by a computer, and so the only thing that is notable about LBS's construction of \"location interaction rule\" is that it \"can be correlated with data\" on a map display.

A patent does not disclose an inventive concept merely by claiming it is so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   If LBS's purported improvement is to \"the functionality of an electronic map\" through the use of location and user specific rules, the Court is highly skeptical of the four asserted patents. Essentially, the user interaction rules provide specific rules about what a user is allowed to do, and the location interaction rules provide rules, or data about the locations on the map. This does not go past the abstract idea category because there is nothing that limits the patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The independent claims of the '996, '648, and '114 Patents are directed to data collection and processing, or interacting with generic monitoring devices, and do not place limitations on the patents, or describe a specific improvement in the functionality of an electronic map.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Federal Circuit's discussion of ends sought and the means of achieving them in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   is germane here. There, the court agreed with the lower court's finding that the patent holder sought to \"patent the abstract idea of a solution to the problem in general,\" rather than \"patenting a particular concrete solution to a problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec. Power Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n    830 F.3d at 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Claim 1 of the '996 Patent seeks to patent the solution of displaying on electronic maps whether a person can visit a location based on data about that location. Similarly, claim 7 of the '996 Patent comprises receiving an identifier associated with a user that reveals whether the user is permitted to visit locations on the map. '996 Patent at col. 17:61-67. But how is the issue of whether a user is permitted a traverse determined under a location interaction rule? How is the identifier generated or received? The same is true of claim 2, which periodically updates the status associated with a map location.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at col. 17:29-35. How is this updating done? How would an inventor who wanted to update information about a location on a map\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   run afoul claim 2? That is the problem with the '996 Patent.\n   <em>\n    Elec. Power Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n    830 F.3d at 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whereas patenting a particular solution would incentivize further innovation in the form of alternative methods for achieving the same result ... allowing claims like Electric Power Group's claims here would inhibit innovation by prohibiting other inventors from developing their own solutions to the problem without first licensing the abstract idea.\" (citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). LBS seeks to patent the abstract solution to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   LBS gives short shrift to the rest of the patents at step 2. There is no argument that the ordered combination of the claims disclose an inventive concept. As to the '648 Patent, LBS argues that the claims limitations \"illuminate\" the inventive concept of the patent, but does not explain why. LBS reiterates the asserted dependent claims and tacks on the word \"inventive.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 27-28. But as the Court already discussed in its analysis of the individual claim elements, above, claim 1 of the '648 is impermissibly vague on how a map is altered or information verified, such that the combination of those non-specific elements discloses no inventive concept. As to the '114 Patent, LBS argues the dependent claim limitations \"further illuminate\" that invention is \"directed [to] receiving a map altered based on an identifier of the display device, user interaction rules, and information received from monitoring devices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. \"But\n   merely selecting information, by content or source, for collection, analysis, and display does nothing significant to differentiate a process from ordinary mental processes, whose implicit exclusion from \u00a7 101 undergirds the information-based category of abstract ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

As in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the claims in the '114 Patent do not require a \"new source or type of information, or new techniques for analyzing [the information],\" or some inventive programming, such that the abstract idea of information collection and analysis is transformed into an inventive concept.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n    at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Lastly, as to the '610 Patent, LBS argues that an inventive concept is disclosed by the patent's \"computer systems for altering a map display based on location interaction rules and/or user interaction rules in combination with data received from monitoring devices and/or other user display devices.\" Dkt. No. 46-1 at 29. Yet all the '610 Patent adds to this case is generic \"circuitry\" performing data transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Because the Court finds that each of the asserted patents is directed to an abstract idea and discloses no inventive concept, the Court GRANTS Niantic's motion to dismiss. The asserted patents are not patent-eligible. Because this is not a deficiency that may be cured by amendment, the Court DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE LBS's amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Open Text S.A. v.

Cal. 2017) (when parties do not designate representative claims, a court may itself do so even if the parties object). Second, the parties dedicate 90% of their briefs to the patents' independent claims, so this motion is really about the independent claims. Likewise, the Court need not consider the independent apparatus claims that merely implement the method or systems claims if the method or systems claims are not patent-eligible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

However, the Court will discuss the independent apparatus claims below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Neither party pays much attention to the dependent claims of the '996 Patent in the papers.

No. 46-1 at 27. Thus, in determining whether the patents are directed to an abstract idea, the Court will only consider the asserted independent claims of the four patents. At step 2 of\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    , the Court will consider whether the dependent claims of each patent disclose an inventive concept.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    LBS's sur-reply still does not address any of Niantic's proffered cases on abstractness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    No discussion of improving existing technological processes or the prior art appears in the '648, '114, or '610 Patents either.
