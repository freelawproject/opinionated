During this meeting, she allegedly reported the details of the incidents that occurred during the course of her employment, including the complaints that were filed with Kaczynski and Sygman and their responses to her complaints. The Plaintiff brought recordings of unspecified conversations that were allegedly representative of these incidents and played them for Wheaton and Gubelli.

The letter also informed the Plaintiff that if she required continued medical leave, she needed\n   to provide documentation from her healthcare provider. The Plaintiff responded to the letter and informed the Defendants that her doctor was unsure when she would be able to return to work, and that she had scheduled an appointment with her physician for late August. The Defendants asked the Plaintiff to forward any information she received at that appointment to the Defendants.

Sygman, as Kaczynski's supervisor, was allegedly informed about the discrimination over a period of several months but took no remedial action. The Plaintiff has clearly stated a claim of individual liability against both Kaczynski and Sygman under \u00a7 1981. Further, although there are no allegations in the complaint that the individual defendants Gubelli and Wheaton participated in any of the discriminatory conduct directed at Amaya during her time at the Property, it is much too early to conclude that there was no knowledge of the situation, corporate culture that condones discrimination and harassment, or negligence in managing subordinates.

Accordingly, the Defendants' motion to dismiss as it pertains to the Plaintiff's wrongful termination theory under the Plaintiff's sixth cause of action is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

In Section II.C.3, the Court ruled that the Plaintiff failed to successfully plead either theory under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3. Accordingly, the Court holds that, for the same reasons, the Plaintiff has failed to successfully plead either retaliatory or constructive discharge claims under \u00a7 1981. This reasoning is applicable to both the Corporate Defendants and the Individual Defendants. The Defendants' motion to dismiss as it pertains to the Plaintiff's \u00a7 1981 retaliatory and constructive discharge theories under the Plaintiff's sixth cause of action is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The Court, \"mindful that this is a motion to dismiss and not one for summary judgment following discovery\" also finds that the Plaintiff has successfully alleged a hostile work environment claim based on gender and national origin discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Delisi v.

First, the Defendants allege that the retaliation NYSHRL claim premised on a retaliatory discharge theory fails against the Individual Defendants. As previously detailed in Section II.E.1, Amaya fails to successfully plead a retaliatory discharge claim premised on NYSHRL against the Corporate Defendants.
