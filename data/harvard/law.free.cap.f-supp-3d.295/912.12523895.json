During trial, Boedigheimer maintained his innocence and testified at length of his version of the underlying facts. In response to the first question posed by his attorney, \"what are you feeling at the moment?,\" Boedigheimer responded, \"Like I'm in a surreal situation, little nervous, certainly scared, but I guess accepting that this is what I've got to do to prove my innocence.\" Trial Tr. 1462:11-14. When Boedigheimer was asked at trial why he did not discourage Lusk from attending the first proffer session when he knew that the money Lusk provided him was drug money, Boedigheimer responded, \"Because I didn't commit a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1600:17-19.

Boedigheimer contends that the cumulative effect of the statements constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. During his closing argument, his counsel described Boedigheimer's financial arrangement with Lusk as \"poor judgment,\" \"stupid,\" and \"improper bookkeeping,\" and told the jury that he was unable to say\n   what the proper verdict should be in this case.

Statements that his financial arrangement with Lusk was ill-advised was consistent with Boedigheimer's own testimony and was a candid admission of the suspicious, but explainable, nature of their agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The jury heard testimony that on multiple occasions Lusk gave Boedigheimer large amounts of cash and that Boedigheimer would later repay Lusk with a check. This arrangement is suspicious on its face, and the acknowledgment in argument of its questionable nature legitimizes counsel's argument that his client is guilty of bad judgment but not a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Friedberg's obvious misstatement or \"slip of the tongue\" that Boedigheimer needs to be found guilty on all three counts, ignores the context of the entire argument. Sentencing Tr. 13:22. Immediately prior to this statement, counsel had described witness Lusk as a serial liar, and that his dishonesty was designed to benefit him and his father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel explained that Lusk's deception rendered his entire testimony completely unbelievable and, once it was discarded, the remaining evidence inculpating Boedigheimer was merely circumstantial. Trial Tr. 1866:10-1868:4. Friedberg then told the jury an anecdote about how relying exclusively on circumstantial evidence may lead to an erroneous result, and that the circumstantial evidence in this case permitted two reasonable conclusions, one of guilt and one of innocence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1866:10-1868:11. The argument concluded by admonishing the jury \"you are bound to accept the [conclusion] of innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1868:10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   With this context in mind, it is clearly evident that Friedberg misspoke by unintentionally leaving out the word \"not\" when he asked for a guilty verdict. Boedigheimer was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Evidentiary Issue in Motion for New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   During trial, Lusk was cross-examined about his father's knowledge of his\n   drug distributing business, and how he used cash to renovate a bar the two of them bought together. Counsel inquired, \"Now, you know your father's not going to be prosecuted, right?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1041:25-1042:1. This elicited a hearsay objection, which the Court sustained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1042:2-3. In his 2255 Motion, Boedigheimer claims this testimony showed that Lusk's father was laundering drug money but was not charged, and the Court's ruling on the objection eliminated proof that Lusk was motivated to lie in exchange for leniency and his father's immunity. 2255 Mot. 16, 17. Boedigheimer claims that this testimony \"was the crown jewel\" of his defense, and his trial counsels' failure to challenge the evidentiary ruling in the motion for a new trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Contrary to Boedigheimer's assertion, the Court's sustaining of the objection did not prevent his attorney from extracting testimony that Lusk was motivated to lie to protect his father. Immediately after the objection was sustained, counsel rephrased his question. In response, Lusk testified that: 1) the government knew that he and his father had purchased property together, 2) Lusk had contributed a large amount of cash towards purchasing and renovating the building, 3) his father knew that he was trafficking marijuana, and 4) his father had not been charged. Trial Tr. 1042:19-1043:4. Other witnesses also highlighted Lusk's desire to protect his father. Lusk's sister, Boedigheimer's wife, testified that Lusk \"would do anything to protect his 70-year-old father because he did not want to see him go to prison.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1407:9-11. Agent Schad testified that Lusk's father knew Lusk's source of money was from trafficking marijuana, and that Lusk was aware that his father could be prosecuted for money laundering.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   747:18-748:8. Finally, in closing argument, counsel implored the jury to completely discard Lusk's testimony as untruthful. Therefore, there was nothing deficient about electing not to pursue this evidentiary ruling in the motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Even if it was found to be unreasonable to omit this issue in the motion for a new trial, the argument still fails because Boedigheimer did not suffer any prejudice. The jury found him guilty despite hearing evidence from multiple witnesses suggesting that Lusk would lie to protect his father. There is no reason to believe that additional evidence on this point would have altered the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Appellate Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Boedigheimer's appellate counsel filed a direct appeal raising issues that: 1) the Court abused its discretion by denying the motion for mistrial premised on the questions concerning McCloud's prosecution, and 2) the Court abused its discretion in sentencing the defendant to 60 months' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boedigheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055547\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/954/\">\n    831 F.3d at 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Boedigheimer now argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective because he: 1) failed to appeal the Court's calculation of the total amount of illicit money laundered, which supported the base offense level; 2) failed to challenge a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice; and 3) failed to appeal the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal. \"Ineffectiveness of appellate counsel is measured under the standard set out in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.

PSR \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This loss amount resulted in an eight-point increase and yielded a base offense level of 16.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543298\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/706/#p709\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Boedigheimer withdrew this challenge at sentencing, and the Court adopted the PSR and sentenced Boedigheimer with a total offense level of 28, which included the eight-point increase for the loss amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Boedigheimer now revives his previously abandoned argument and contends that the trial evidence failed to show that he laundered more that $70,000. Boedigheimer argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue this issue on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Boedigheimer's appellate counsel's decision not to raise this argument on appeal was not objectively unreasonable. The jury heard substantial testimony about the cash loans and payroll advances that Lusk provided to Boedigheimer and his law firm. While Boedigheimer's trial counsel attempted to discredit Lusk and convince the jury that Boedigheimer was an unwitting money launderer, the jury's verdict demonstrates Boedigheimer's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the enhancement for the amount of laundered funds needs only to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, pressing this issue on appeal would not have been successful.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Washburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322017\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1007/#p1014\">\n    444 F.3d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1014 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In his 2255 Motion, Boedigheimer contends the loss amount proven at trial was, at most, $50,000. The Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing called for a six-point increase for laundering more than $30,000 but less than $70,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b). With a six, rather than eight, point increase, Boedigheimer's total adjusted offense level would have been 26. An offense level of 26 with a criminal history category II yields a Guideline sentence range of 70-87 months' imprisonment, which is higher than the 60-month sentence Boedigheimer received. As a result, Boedigheimer cannot demonstrate that his sentence would have been lower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Obstruction Enhancement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The PSR included a two-point sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 25, 30. The pre-sentence pleadings initially objected to this enhancement, but the objection was withdrawn at sentencing. Boedigheimer now contends that his appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to challenge the obstruction enhancement on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Boedigheimer's attorney reasonably decided not to challenge the obstruction enhancement on direct appeal. Contrary to Boedigheimer's assertions, the evidence introduced at trial provided strong evidentiary support for the two-point obstruction charge. The jury heard testimony that Boedigheimer urged Lusk to refrain from telling law enforcement about their financial arrangement, deleted particularly incriminating text messages from his cellular telephone, and obfuscated the truth about Lusk's employment with his law firm. The\n   jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. The conviction on Count 3 established that the Government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Boedigheimer made a material false statement to an IRS agent concerning Lusk's \"employment\" at his law firm. This false statement materially impaired the Government's investigation into the money laundering offense conduct. These facts need only to have been supported by a preponderance of the evidence to make the two-point obstruction enhancement appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Whiting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761401\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/845/#p850\">\n    522 F.3d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (8th Cir. 2008) (\"The government bears the burden of proving the facts to support [an obstruction of justice enhancement] by a preponderance of the evidence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Boedigheimer continues to dispute the facts accepted by the jury supporting his guilt. He argues, for example, that he never told Lusk that it would \"ruin\" him if law enforcement learned about their financial arrangement. 2255 Mot. 19. Boedigheimer attempts to support this by arguing that he was essential to securing Lusk's attendance at the first proffer with law enforcement, and that if he was truly concerned about Lusk disclosing their financial arrangement, he would have advised Lusk not to speak with law enforcement altogether. Similarly, Boedigheimer disputes that he deleted text messages, arguing that if he was going to delete incriminating messages he would have deleted more than the five messages discussed at trial. These arguments were rejected by the jury. Accordingly, it was objectively reasonable to not appeal this meritless argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thai v. Mapes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8971485\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/970/#p978\">\n    412 F.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 978 (8th Cir. 2005) (\"In our view, [Boedigheimer's] claim fails because [he] cannot show that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to raise a meritless argument.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, eliminating the two-point obstruction enhancement yields a guideline range of 70-87 months, which remains above the 60 month sentence imposed. Thus, Boedigheimer cannot demonstrate the prejudice needed to prevail on this claim.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207033757\">\n    2016 WL 7033757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    Guzman-Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205038004\">\n    2015 WL 5038004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal or for a New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, Boedigheimer contends that his appellate counsel should have appealed the denial of the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal or Motion for a New Trial. Boedigheimer argues that: 1) the evidence supports his assertion that he was unaware that Lusk was a drug dealer, 2) he believed the source of Lusk's money was legitimate, and 3) he hired Lusk as a lawful employee of his law firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The essence of Boedigheimer's argument is that Lusk is not credible. But an appellate court does not generally disturb the credibility determinations of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sturdivant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165503\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/795/#p800\">\n    513 F.3d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800 (8th Cir. 2008) (\"This court is obligated to defer to the jury's determination of the credibility of the witnesses, and will not second-guess the jury's credibility determination of the Government's witnesses.\") (quotations omitted) ). Viewing the evidence in light of the jury's verdict, the inescapable conclusion is that the jury credited Lusk and the other witnesses' testimony over Boedigheimer's. These are the very types of determinations that will not be overturned by an appellate court. Accordingly, Boedigheimer's appellate counsel did not provide deficient representation by not appealing the denial of the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal or Motion for a New Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Boedigheimer continues to argue that his objections to Government Exhibits 266 and 269 were erroneously overruled.

Exhibit 269 is a summary of Lusk and Boedigheimer's cash payroll agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1175:3-6.
