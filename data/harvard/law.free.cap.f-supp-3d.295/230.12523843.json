Defendant now moves for summary judgment with respect to the Title VII, NYSHRL and EPA claims alleged in plaintiff's amended complaint.

Plaintiff is an African-American woman who was born in March 1978. (Declaration of Saul D. Zabell in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Zabell Declaration\"), Ex. 15; Declaration of Kevin P. McCaffrey in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"McCaffrey Declaration\"), Ex. II.) In May 2000, at age 23, she was hired by the LIRR as an Assistant Conductor. (Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement (\"Def. 56.1\"), \u00b6 1; Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Counterstatement (\"Pl. 56.1\"), \u00b6 1.) In late 2001, she became an Assistant Stationmaster (\"ASM\") trainee. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 2; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 2.) She remained an ASM trainee until August 2002, when she \"became a qualified ASM.\" (Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ASMs are unionized and represented by the Transportation Communications Union (the \"TCU\"). (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 4; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 4.) Their duties include supervising ushers, ensuring proper crewing on trains, ensuring trains leave on schedule, ensuring customer and employee safety, and making announcements. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 3; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 3.) According to an organizational chart provided by plaintiff, there are approximately 20 ASMs, all of whom report to the General Stationmaster (the \"GSM\"). (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 4.) The GSM, in turn, reports to the General Superintendent-Terminal Operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 4, 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When plaintiff became an ASM, the GSM was a man named James Burns. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 5; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 5.) Burns retired three or four years later, in June 2005. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 6; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 6.) According to plaintiff, she was approached by Kenneth Walther, then the Superintendent of Penn Station, and asked if she would consider applying for Burns' position. (Transcript of Plaintiff's Oct. 25, 2013, Deposition (\"Pl. Dep. I\") (attached to the McCaffrey Declaration as Exhibit A), pp. 24-25.) Plaintiff, who was newly married, nine-months pregnant and unfamiliar with the GSM's duties, declined to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Burns was replaced by another man, Lachlan Cameron, who became GSM in late July 2005. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Walther appointed plaintiff as his assistant. (Pl. Dep. I, p. 30.) Among the tasks which she performed in that capacity was management of the \"ASM Board\"-essentially, the work schedule for all the ASMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 31-32, 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Even though each ASM bid on and \"owned a job,\" the GSM had authority to reassign the ASMs as needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 34-35.) Cameron \"would utilize seniority ... the best he could\" in making assignments, but he would not assign an ASM to a job that he or she could not handle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 35.) Although this did not happen frequently, plaintiff recalled an instance in 2007 or 2008 which an ASM Barrett was removed from the \"extra list\" and placed on a \"relief job\" because Cameron thought that Barrett was \"having a hard time managing his schedule ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 36-37.) Plaintiff also recalled that Barrett, who \"owned\" the position on the extra list and who had not requested the transfer, called Cameron to express displeasure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 36, 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cameron retired effective December 1, 2008 (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 25; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 25), and plaintiff became Acting GSM. (Pl. Dep. I, p. 48.) In that capacity, she attended a meeting with Vincent Campasano, who was soon to become General Superintendent-Terminal\n   Operations. Prior to the meeting, she and others made jokes which offended Campasano. (Pl. Dep. I, pp. 56-57.) After the meeting, Campasano telephoned plaintiff, complained that she \"didn't show him any respect\" and \"semi-implied\" that she would not be considered for the GSM position because her husband, another LIRR employee, had a disciplinary record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   Although plaintiff did not know if Campasano called other attendees as well, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 69,) she testified that she was subsequently told by Williams Gibbons, then the General Superintendent of Penn Station and the head of her department, not to joke with Campasano until after she was awarded the GSM position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 56-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 1, 2009, the MTA's Office of the Inspector General (the \"IG\") received an anonymous complaint regarding the manner in which plaintiff was scheduling the ASMs. The complaint, a copy of which is included in Exhibit T to the McCaffrey Declaration, alleged that plaintiff was \"racially targeting and providing Overtime for some of her closest friends/employees,\" rather than following the \"union work rule\" of awarding overtime based on seniority. The complaint further alleged that the ASM Board was never filled out until \"Friday after everyone has done the assigned shifts or is [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to[o] late to change anything.\" (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. T.) Copies of the complaint were sent to Campasano, Gibbons and Rod Brooks, the Chief Transportation Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 11, 2009, Helen E. Williams, the President of the LIRR, referred the complaint to Brooks; S.M. Drayzen, the Vice President of Labor Relations; and others for a response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That same day, plaintiff was promoted to GSM. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 30; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 30.) That promotion, however, ended up costing her almost $30,000 per year. (Transcript of plaintiff's Jan. 2, 2014, Deposition (\"Pl. Dep. II\") (attached to the McCaffrey Declaration as Exhibit B), p. 164.) Prior to the promotion, plaintiff's base salary was $78,927.68 (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 29; Pl. 56.1, \u00b6 29), but she was also paid four overtime hours each day to compensate for her work as Acting GSM. (Pl. Dep. I, p. 48.) As a result, she was actually earning over $118,000 per year. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 2; Affidavit of Charmaine Fraser in Opposition to defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Plaintiff's Affidavit\"), \u00b6 1.) When she was promoted, her salary increased to $93,000, but the position was \"Non-Represented\" and, accordingly, she was no longer eligible for overtime. (Zabell Declaration, Exs. 2 &amp; 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff was aware that Cameron's salary upon his retirement had been $95,982, and requested that she receive the same salary. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 1, p. 9.) According to a memorandum which plaintiff sent to Raymond P. Kenny, LIRR's Senior Vice President of Operations, on April 21, 2010, and which is attached to the Zabell Declaration as Exhibit 1 (hereafter, the \"April 2010 Memorandum\"), she met with Campasano, who represented that Cameron's last paycheck included compensation for unused vacation days, that increasing plaintiff's salary would necessitate increasing other salaries, and that Brooks did not approve the increase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff claims that she subsequently spoke with Cameron and Brooks, who contradicted two of Campasano's three stated reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following her promotion, plaintiff, who was only 30, received some \"push back\" from ASMs and unsuccessful applicants for the GSM position. For example, an engineer told plaintiff that he overheard Liam Clampett-a Transportation Manager who unsuccessfully applied for the GSM position-complain\n   that plaintiff \"only got the job because of who she is and what she is.\" (Pl. Dep. I, pp. 51-52.) One of the ASMs, a Mr. Teresky, left the department after plaintiff denied his application for an additional meal period, stating that \"no little black girl was going to tell him what to do.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 127-28.) Teresky further stated that plaintiff had been promoted only because another woman, Judith Issan, did not want the job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 128.) Plaintiff never complained about Teresky's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the months following plaintiff's promotion, the Transportation Department conducted an investigation into the anonymous complaint against plaintiff. That investigation, which was described in a memorandum prepared by Drayzen in May 2010 (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex, U), ultimately determined that plaintiff had not engaged in any wrongdoing. However, the investigation determined that there was no set procedure for selecting which employees received overtime assignments and \"weaknesses ... in general administrative record keeping\" relating to these assignments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Transfer of the ASM Board\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 23, 2010, plaintiff had a meeting with Brooks, in which the Chief Transportation Officer proposed transferring the ASM Board to the Crew Dispatcher (also called the Crew Management Office or Manpower Office), who handled the scheduling of most other LIRR employees. According to plaintiff's April 2010 Memorandum, Brooks thought that the computer system used by the Crew Dispatcher would \"remove the human factor\" in scheduling the ASMs. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 1, p. 11.) He told plaintiff to do \"due diligence\" with Labor Relations on whether or not the computerized system would work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff told Brooks that she \"already had things in order\" and was concerned that \"the Manpower office would not be able to provide the same amount of oversight\" as plaintiff gave to the scheduling of ASMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's April 2010 Memorandum details some of the steps she took after her meeting with Brooks. Among other things, plaintiff had a meeting with her direct supervisor, Campasano, and Barry Kaufman, the person investigating the anonymous complaint, in which Campasano allegedly became \"agitated\" with plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 12.) Plaintiff then spoke with a person in the Information Technology (\"IT\") department who was familiar with the Crew Dispatcher's computer system and who told her that the system could be loaded onto her computer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also spoke with a person in Labor Relations, who told her that the Crew Dispatcher did not consider the operation of the computer system to be \"owned work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the week of March 8, 2010, plaintiff had a conversation with Gibbons, who asked her if she had asked \"IT\" about the computer system and whether it could be loaded onto her computer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When plaintiff responded in the affirmative, Gibbons informed her that Campasano had learned of these developments upon his return from vacation and demanded to know who had given plaintiff the authority to do that. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 13.) Plaintiff then \"expressed [her] displeasure ... with such statements coming from ... Campasano,\" saying that she was \"tasked with finding efficient ways to run\" her department and asking, \"If using this program can do it, what is the issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 21, 2010, plaintiff sent Brooks a document in which she recounted her discussions with IT and the Labor Department and proposed that she retain the responsibility for scheduling the ASMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 13.) She also recounted a March 10, 2010, conversation with the Manpower Office,\n   which allegedly told plaintiff that the office was \"not equipped or able to handle the ASM [B]oard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, in an email dated March 22, 2010, Brooks rejected her proposal, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I've already committed to both the IG and the President's office that this work would be transferred to the Crew Dispatcher. I understand the proposal, but I still feel strongly that this is the way to go. The organization is under significant pressure to be transparent without raising costs; this gives clerical work to clerical people and frees the manager up to manage. Again, I understand your passion, but I've given my word and still feel that it is better off being handled by the crew dispatcher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. S.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Notwithstanding this email, plaintiff continued to press her case to retain control over the ASM Board. On April 21, 2010, she sent the April 2010 Memorandum, some of the contents of which have been discussed above. In that memorandum, entitled \"My reasons for concern,\" plaintiff discussed Campasano's telephone call to her regarding her joke, her unsuccessful request to start at Cameron's ending salary, the slighting comments made about her by Clampett and other employees, and the anonymous, discredited complaint that she had engaged in favoritism. However, more than half of the memorandum related to the decision to transfer the ASM Board. Plaintiff claimed that this transfer created the perception, which she shared \"a little,\" that she was \"being pushed out or prepared for abolishment.\" (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 1, p. 16.) Although she did not specifically allege that the transfer of the ASM Board was due to her gender, she noted that she was the first woman to hold the GSM position and claimed that, in her dealings with Campasano, she perceived that he had \"an issue when it comes to females.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 12, 2010, plaintiff had another meeting with Brooks, in which he agreed to \"take another look\" at the decision to transfer the ASM Board. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. V.) In an email which plaintiff sent to Brooks following the meeting, plaintiff tacitly acknowledged that she had bypassed her immediate supervisor by stating: \"I do believe in the chain of command, however in this case I felt that I would not be heard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In his response to her email, Brooks did not criticize plaintiff for bypassing her supervisor, but complimented her, stating: \"[Y]our tenacity is amazing and you definitely are passionate about your work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By late January 2011, however, Brooks was beginning to lose patience with plaintiff. On January 24, 2011, plaintiff sent Brooks an email noting that the transfer of the ASM Board to the Crew Dispatcher would not accomplish his goal of ensuring that the ASMs assignments would not be determined by any one individual. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. QQ, p. 2.) In his response, Brooks did not specifically address this argument, stating, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I am not willing to re-litigate this issue; we have studied and worked on this issue for nearly a year or more. I've heard the arguments, both pro and con, and have made the decision to move the dispatching of ASMs to the Crew Management Office based upon ... a consideration of the benefits and risks. I expect that, now that the decision is made, every manager will do everything in their power to ensure its success.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At some point, plaintiff became aware that she had been excluded from meetings relating to the transfer of the ASM Board. At first, plaintiff testified that she knew\n   \"for sure\" of only two such meetings, both of which had been organized by Campasano, who was then the General Superintendent in Jamaica, Queens, and responsible for the Crew Dispatcher's Office. (Pl. Dep. II, pp. 51-52.) However, plaintiff was not sure when the meetings occurred or who attended them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 51.) She thought that the first meeting involved the union, which approached Campasano directly, and several represented \"stationmasters\"-presumably, ASMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 51-53.) Plaintiff believed that Campasano should have notified her because the ASMs were in her department, and theorized that Campasano had deliberately failed to do so because of her gender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff conceded that Campasano never mentioned her gender, but noted that Cameron had been alerted to similar meetings in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff knew little about the second meeting, except that Sprio Papanikolatos, then the General Superintendent-Terminal Operations, had been invited to attend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 51.) When he became unavailable, he asked a lead manager to appear in his stead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The lead manager then called plaintiff to ask what to discuss at the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff knew nothing about the meeting or what was discussed at it, although she claimed to know that it had \"to do with the [B]oard and the crew dispatcher's office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 56-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Later, plaintiff recalled two other meetings which she did not attend. One was held on April 7, 2011, \"to discuss [that] station ops dispatchers will dispatch ASMs by April 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and no later.\" (Pl. Dep. II, p. 59.) According to plaintiff, that meeting was organized by Campasano and attended by three of his subordinates: Barry Kaufman, who did \"budgetary stuff and numbers,\" and two persons who were in charge of the Crew Management Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 59-60.) Plaintiff conceded that no one else from her department was invited to that meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The other meeting was between ASM Teresky and Michael Catok, who was employed in the Crew Management Office as a Superintendent Advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 62.) According to plaintiff, the two discussed \"[h]ow the [B]oard works\" and \"what do they do in different instances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 62.) Plaintiff implied that she would not have attended the meeting even if she had been invited, saying, \"It was a meeting that shouldn't have taken place.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although plaintiff testified that unnamed individuals informed her of other meetings to which she was not invited (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 61), plaintiff did not offer any specific information relating to those meetings. Indeed, she could not even recall the dates on which the alleged meetings occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 62.) In contrast, plaintiff admitted that she was invited to at least five meetings relating to the transfer of the ASM Board: a January 10, 2011, meeting to \"discuss any CBA related issues\" arising by virtue of the transfer; a January 24, 2011, meeting to outline how the Crew Management Office would dispatch the ASMs; a February 3, 2011, meeting to discuss dispatching ASMs; a February 17, 2011, meeting to discuss rules for dispatching ASMs and a March 24, 2011, meeting to \"discuss ASM crew board finalization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 58-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff testified that she complained to Brooks, Gibbons, Kenney and Michael Gellormino-a Vice President of Transportation Services-about her exclusion from meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 81-82.) When news of her complaint reached Campasano, he became \"very irritated,\" reportedly sending Gibbons an email in which he stated that he did not work for plaintiff and would not answer to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 104.) Plaintiff herself attributed Campasano's reaction to the fact that he did not like his decisions questioned, and did not like subordinates to \"go\n   around him\" or to \"say anything without his permission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Labor%20Law%20%C2%A7%20194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although plaintiff did not recall telling either Brooks or Kenny that she had been excluded because of her gender, she claimed that she made this assertion to Gelamino. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 81-82.) However, she did not meet with Gelamino until January 2012-more than six months after Campasano announced the new system for dispatching ASMs in a memo dated May 6, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 82; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. X.) Moreover, plaintiff's two meetings with Gelamino were not exclusively, or even primarily, about her exclusion from meetings. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 83.) Rather, the meetings principally addressed issues relating to the appointment of ASM Barrett as Assistant General Stationmaster. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Appointment of ASM Barrett as Plaintiff's Assistant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When plaintiff first became GSM, the Assistant GSM was classified as a \"special assignment\" and was selected by the GSM, without regard to seniority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 90.) Plaintiff first appointed Steven Barry and, later, Joanne Sloane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 92.) Sometime thereafter, the union raised an issue about plaintiff assigning a represented ASM to substitute for her at management meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 96.) The TCU apparently insisted that Sloane be compensated for her out-of-classification work or that the GSM's assistant be reclassified in a way which would have resulted in the assistant being placed at the bottom of the seniority list for purposes of overtime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 93-97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The LIRR ultimately determined that it was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement for Sloane to attend management meetings and Gibbons told plaintiff to discontinue the longstanding practice of having the assistant substitute if the GSM was unavailable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 98-99.) At her deposition, plaintiff opined that the LIRR may not have fought the union on this point because of plaintiff's gender, but also conceded: \"Maybe there was nothing to fight on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At some point, the union argued that the Assistant GSM position should be eliminated as unnecessary. In a heated exchange, William DeCarlo-a low-level LIRR employee who was attending the meeting in his capacity as a union representative-accused plaintiff and her assistant of doing nothing but \"painting each other's toenails.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 101-02.) Plaintiff was rendered speechless \"that a union representative ... would say that to [her] as a female, as a manager\" and expected one of the management attendees, which included her supervisor, to stop him or correct him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 102.) No one did anything. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although the Assistant GSM position was not eliminated, the LIRR ultimately agreed to have the position filled by the Crew Management Office, based on seniority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 92.) As a result, when Sloane retired in 2011, plaintiff could not pick her successor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, the position was awarded to the applicant with the most seniority: ASM Zekeisha Barrett. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff had a history of conflicts with Barrett, whom plaintiff had accused of physically threatening her in July 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 86.) Those allegations had been investigated, but were determined to be unsubstantiated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 87.) Plaintiff was unhappy about Barrett's appointment and met with Gelamino twice to express her concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 83.) Gelamino, who did not take any notes during the meetings, did not take any action to address plaintiff's concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 83-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Incidents in December 2011 and January 2012\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On December 21, 2011-about one month after assuming the post of Assistant\n   GSM-Barrett called Alphonse Legene, a Transportation Manager at Penn Station, and complained that plaintiff had yelled at her, then hung up on her, during a telephone conversation earlier that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 109; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. CC.) Barrett also claimed that a third-party, Suzanne Clark, had overheard the exchange, and that plaintiff was subjecting her to a hostile work environment. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. CC, p. 2.) Campasano, the General Superintendent of Terminal Operations, directed Barrett to appear at the Trial Office to give a statement regarding the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On December 29, 2011, Barrett appeared in the Trial Office and gave a statement before a Trial Officer Joe Mutone and a union officer. She claimed that the incident began after the acting Superintendent of Penn Station, Joe Navarro, directed her to supervise the cleaning of the Stationmaster's Office, a task which plaintiff had earlier assigned to another ASM, Daryle Ware, who was the Assistant GSM during an earlier shift. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. DD, p. 335.) Later that day, plaintiff telephoned Barrett and yelled at her for following Navarro's directions, rather than plaintiff's orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 337.) Plaintiff instructed Barrett to speak to Ware, determine what he wanted cleaned, and to ensure that the cleaning was done. According to Barrett, plaintiff told her \"to make sure that every dust bunny is outside that office, [even] if you have to get on your knees ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When Barrett complained that plaintiff was \"talking ... in a very aggressive way,\" plaintiff allegedly responded that she did not care about Barrett's feelings and hung up on her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Clark, a Secretarial Clerk employed by Campasano, had testified before the same Trial Officer on December 27, 2011, and corroborated most of Barrett's testimony. She testified that she heard plaintiff screaming at Barrett about not following her assignments, and Barrett calmly complaining about plaintiff yelling at her. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. EE, p. 321.) Barrett remained calm as plaintiff screamed at her about checking for \"dust bunnies\" but, after three minutes, began \"getting a little upset ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 322.) Barrett then accused plaintiff of creating a \"hostile work environment,\" prompting plaintiff to hang up on her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   During her testimony before the Trial Office, plaintiff claimed that the conversation had become loud only after Barrett began yelling at her, and that the conversation was never \"hostile.\" (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. GG, p. 82.) Plaintiff denied having asked Barrett to check for dust bunnies, asserting that she had said that Ware knew where every dust bunny was because he worked in the Stationmaster's office every day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On January 5, 2012, about two weeks after the incident with Barrett, Arthur Maratea, National Vice President of the TCU, wrote Brooks a letter alleging that other ASMs were also feeling threatened by plaintiff. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. HH.) Without specifying any of the ASMs by name, Maratea asserted that ASMs had \"been spoken to in a very unprofessional manner in the past as well as in the present,\" and had contacted the union for assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also alleged that plaintiff had \"blatantly violated\" some agreements that the union had reached with management, such as \"the vacation understanding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Maratea requested a meeting \"to rectify this situation so [union] members may do their job and not feel threatened in a hostile work environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On January 11, 2012, there was another incident. Plaintiff, who was taking classes during the day to qualify as a conductor, had interviewed ASM applicants, chosen two candidates, and requested that Human\n   Resources contact them with offers. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 122.) One candidate subsequently called plaintiff to say that he was starting the next day and to ask what books and other things he needed to bring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff expected that she would have been alerted by Human Resources if there were any problems with either candidate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 124), and therefore assumed that an offer had also been extended to the other candidate: Paul Lieui. Although plaintiff denied that she told Lieui he had been awarded the job (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 123), she admitted calling him with information regarding when and where to report, not knowing that the LIRR office in which he then worked had decided to hold him until March. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 125.) At her deposition, plaintiff acknowledged that Human Resources was responsible for extending offers on behalf of LIRR, but noted that her violation of this rule was unintentional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 123.) In support of its motion, defendant has submitted a Declaration from the LIRR's Senior Director of Human Resources, who states that \"[p]laintiff's interference\" in the hiring process \"was a serious breach of LIRR policies that created confusion and discord.\" (Meilick Declaration at p. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Charge of Discrimination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On January 27, 2012, plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination (the \"Charge\") with the New York State Division of Human Rights (the \"SDHR\"), alleging that she had been discriminated against by Barrett, Campasano, Brooks and the General Superintendent of Transportation, Spiro Papanikolatos. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 15, p. 3; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. II, p. 3.) The Charge consisted of a completed form (the \"Form\") and a four-page narrative (hereafter, the \"Narrative\"). The first page of the Narrative stated that plaintiff was attaching a copy of the April 2010 Memorandum, which is discussed on pages 9-10,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Narrative principally complained about the transfer of the ASM Board and the elimination of her \"right to choose [her] assistant.\" However, the Narrative also touched on other incidents in which plaintiff felt that her authority had been undercut. Plaintiff alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that her ability to approve or deny compensatory time for ASMs had been taken away and that her attempts to discipline a subordinate-an usher and union representative named Edward Baum-were frustrated by Papanikolatos because he was afraid of alienating the union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Narrative also implied that Campasano had subjected her to a hostile work environment. She principally asserted that Campasano told her that she \"didn't have a choice\" but to accept Barrett as her assistant, and failed to support her when Barrett disregarded plaintiff's instructions. Instead, Campasano relieved her of her duties, and sent her to the Trial Office to give a statement of facts. (Narrative, pp. 2-3.) In addition, the Narrative alleged that Campasano and others did nothing to prevent 41/2 days of plaintiff's comp time from expiring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 2.) Plaintiff's Narrative also recounted an incident in which Papanikolatos's son allegedly told plaintiff's 12-year-old daughter that his father \"tortures\" plaintiff at work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff expressed the belief that forcing her to work with Barrett constituted the \"torture.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Narrative did not, however, allege facts to suggest that the \"torture\" was attributable to gender-based animus. To the contrary, the Narrative stated that Campasano refused to support her in her effort to replace Barrett because she \"refused to set a poor picture of a previous ASM ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 3.) In addition, the Narrative alleged that Gibbons told her\n   that she was \"probably the first General Stationmaster to hold the [ASMs] accountable and they didn't like it,\" and that Brooks told her that \"things are difficult for people when they are 'change agents.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 3-4.) Indeed, at her deposition, plaintiff admitted that she had never heard Campasano or Gibbons say anything indicative of gender bias. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To be sure, the Charge asserts discrimination based on protected characteristics. However, the Charge also makes it clear that plaintiff did not know which of her characteristics occasioned the discrimination. The Form contains a page which lists various types for discrimination and asks the complainant to check boxes to indicate the type of discrimination alleged. Plaintiff checked boxes to indicate discrimination based on age, race, sex and \"familial status,\" based on the allegation that Papanikolatos's son \"harassed\" plaintiff's daughter at school. In addition, the Narrative notes that plaintiff is the first woman and the second African-American to hold the GSM position, and that she performed many of the GSM's tasks in her role as assistant to Cameron. (Narrative, p. 3.) Plaintiff asserts that \"it is because of [her] gender and [her] race that all of a sudden, the work that [she] did under the cloak of Mr. Cameron was some how now not right.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Reassignment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On April 24, 2012-about three months after plaintiff filed her Charge-Brooks sent plaintiff a letter informing her that she was being reassigned to the position of \"Manager Hours of Service\" in the Transportation Services Department. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. KK.) Plaintiff retained the same annual salary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, according to organizational charts attached to the Zabell Declaration as Exhibit 4, plaintiff no longer had any subordinates and no longer reported directly to a General Superintendent. Rather, she reported to the Senior Manager-Transportation Services Support, who reported to the General Superintendent-Transportation Services Support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Brooks' letter asserted that plaintiff's \"performance, behavior and leadership skills\" had been \"less than acceptable\" for the GSM position and provided five \"examples of the problems\" experienced during her tenure. First, he stated that plaintiff had \"violated corporate policy and confidentiality\" by contacting Lieui on January 11, 2012. Second, referencing Maratea's January 5, 2012, letter, he noted that the TCU had complained to upper management about plaintiff speaking to subordinates in an unprofessional manner. Third, Brooks accused plaintiff of violating \"LIRR's core values\" by yelling at Barrett and telling her to disregard another manager's directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The fourth and fifth examples both related to plaintiff's behavior regarding the transfer of the ASM Board. Brooks charged that she had resisted the transfer even though more senior managers requested that she stop, thereby making the transition more difficult for all concerned. He also charged that in mid-July 2011, plaintiff had involved herself in the dispatching of ASMs, even after being told by senior managers to desist, and had complained about the decision to transfer the ASM Board at meetings and in public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Brooks not only transferred plaintiff, but placed her on a \"Performance Improvement Plan\" (\"PIP\"). Under the PIP, plaintiff was to be given specific goals, with her performance to be monitored and assessed in six months. She was directed to report to the Senior Manager-Transportation Services Support on April 25, 2012, to begin her new assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Events after Reassignment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When plaintiff reported to the Jamaica Control Center on April 25, 2012, she was assigned a cubicle because there were no offices available. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 139.) However, one of the offices was assigned to a Joseph Grippaldi, whose position had fewer \"Hay Points\" than plaintiff's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 140.) Aware that offices were to be assigned based on Hay Point level, she spoke to her supervisor, Ed Indelicati, about the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 140-41.) He said that he would look into it, but that Papanikolatos would make the decision regarding what to do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 141.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A month or so later, Indelicati revisited the issue. He agreed that plaintiff was entitled to Grippaldi's office, but told plaintiff that Grippaldi had been rejected for a promotion and that management did not \"really want to hurt his feelings\" by forcing him to move. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 142.) At her deposition, plaintiff herself stated that she did not know whether the refusal to move Grippaldi was due to gender discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 143.) She also implied that the refusal constituted retaliation, stating that her lawsuit was \"already well-known.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, this lawsuit was not commenced until late November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At some point thereafter, plaintiff was assigned an office in the Hillside Support Facility in Jamaica. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 146.) According to plaintiff, the office was \"filthy,\" with \"dust and papers and dead plants and all types of things all over the office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's supervisor offered to help clean it, but plaintiff \"objected to cleaning an office in that state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After plaintiff rejected the first office, she was \"given another space and told to order things for that room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, that space was to be created by cutting a larger room in half. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the time of her January 2, 2014, deposition, plaintiff was still waiting for the construction to be completed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, by that time, there was an open office in the Jamaica Control Center which had been vacant for at least six or seven months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Following her reassignment, plaintiff applied for positions as a Superintendent, a Lead Transportation Manager, and a Manager of Terminal Operations and Customer Service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 161.) The record does not contain evidence of when plaintiff applied for the Superintendent position or why she was rejected. However, there is documentary evidence that plaintiff was informed that she was ineligible for the Lead Transportation Manager position because she applied within a year of her reassignment and was still on a PIP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 161-62; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. OO.) Plaintiff also was not hired as the Manager of Customer Service and Terminal Operations, a job which resembled the GSM position in that it included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , supervision of ASMs. (Pl. Dep. II, pp. 152-53.) Plaintiff may have made inquiries about returning to work as an ASM, but she never actually applied for an open position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At her January 2, 2014, deposition, plaintiff implied that she should have received a raise after April 24, 2012-the day she qualified as a conductor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 143, 160.) However, plaintiff did not know of anyone else who had been given a raise in similar circumstances, since transportation managers are generally already qualified as conductors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Instant Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On November 21, 2012, plaintiff commenced this action against the LIRR, alleging\n   discrimination on the basis of gender and retaliation. The original complaint (the \"Complaint\") alleged six causes of action. The first three causes of action alleged gender discrimination in violation of Title VII, the NYSHRL, and the NYCHRL, respectively. The next three causes of action alleged retaliation in violation of Title VII, the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL, respectively. The Complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages, along with injunctive relief prohibiting defendant from \"engaging in the illegal and unlawful customs, policies, and practices described\" in the Complaint. (Complaint, p. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The three causes of action alleging gender discrimination all specifically alleged that \"defendant engaged in a course of conduct\" which included \"wrongfully transferring plaintiff because of her gender.\" (Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 42, 47.) The first cause of action, alleging a Title VII violation, alleged that the \"course of conduct\" also \"included treating plaintiff differently than non-female employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37.) That cause of action did not allude to specific instances of disparate treatment. However, the \"Facts\" section of the Complaint alleged that plaintiff was \"regularly excluded from meetings and conversations concerning her oversight of the schedule for [ASMs]\" that Papanikolatos overruled plaintiff's decision to deny compensatory time to certain unnamed workers, and that \"plaintiff's male predecessors were not excluded from meetings or overruled on vacation time decisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Although the first three causes of action did not allege hostile work environment, the \"Facts\" section specifically alleged that \"plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment,\" and identified six discriminatory acts which contributed to that environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19.) In addition to alleging that plaintiff (1) was excluded from meetings and (2) had her decisions regarding compensatory time overruled, the Complaint alleged that she (3) was stripped of responsibility for the ASM Board, (4) had her signature forged by other employees; (5) was reassigned to Manager Hours of Service and placed on a performance improvement plan; and (6) sent to Jamaica and placed in a cubicle, rather than an office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-24, 26-27, 29-34.) The Complaint specifically noted that these events were \"an illustrative and not exhaustive list of defendant's discriminatory acts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 3, n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The three causes of action alleging retaliation specifically alleged that plaintiff \"was retaliated against by defendant on the basis of her lawful complaints\" to the EEOC and/or SDHR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 52, 56, 60.) However, the \"Facts\" section specifically alleged that the ASM Board was transferred in retaliation for plaintiff's complaining about her exclusion from meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On January 3, 2013, before a responsive pleading was filed, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. This pleading added two new causes of action: one alleging a violation of the Equal Pay Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and another alleging a violation of New York Labor Law \u00a7 194. These causes of action track the language of the statutes, alleging that the LIRR paid plaintiff \"at rates less than the rates at which it pays wages to male employees in the same establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72.) However, the \"Facts\" section of the Amended Complaint contains a paragraph alleging that plaintiff was paid \"at a lower rate than the male employees who had held the [GSM] position prior to her,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18), and a paragraph alleging that\n   Cameron \"was compensated at a higher rate than plaintiff, despite plaintiff being equally qualified and experienced.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19.) This action was transferred to the undersigned judge on February 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant now moves for summary judgment with respect to most of the causes of action alleged in the Amended Complaint. Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defendant's Memo\") raises five points. The first point seeks summary judgment with respect to the seventh and eight causes of action, arguing that the difference between Cameron's salary upon retirement from the GSM position and plaintiff's starting salary was attributable to differences in seniority and merit pay. Relying principally on a Declaration of Kathleen M. Meilick, the LIRR's Senior Director of Human Resources, defendant argues that Cameron's salary reflected \"three years in the position and a 3% merit raise,\" and that plaintiff received more, not less, than she should have received under the LIRR's gender neutral Salary Administration policy. (Defendant's Memo, p. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The four remaining points seek summary judgment with respect to plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims under Title VII and the NYSHRL. The first of these-Point II-relates solely to plaintiff's discrimination claims arising from the transfer of responsibility for the ASM Board from plaintiff to the Crew Dispatcher. Defendant argues that this claim is time-barred because more than 300 days elapsed between March 22, 2010, when Brooks informed plaintiff that he had committed to the IG and LIRR's President to transfer the ASM Board, and January 27, 2012, when plaintiff filed her Charge with the SDHR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The second of these four arguments-Point III-alleges that plaintiff has failed to establish gender discrimination. Defendant identifies and addresses five discrete acts of discrimination: \"(1) being stripped of her responsibility over ASM assignments; (2) having her authority to approve or deny compensatory time for ASMs circumvented; (3) being denied the opportunity to pick an assistant; (4) being excluded from meetings; [and] (5) being reassigned from her GSM position to Manager Hours of Service.\" (Defendant's Memo, p. 12.) Defendant then argues that plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the first step of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   analysis because (1) the first four of the five discrete acts do not constitute \"adverse employment actions\" and (2) none of the five acts occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. Finally, defendant argues that the record establishes legitimate reasons for the discrete acts and argues that plaintiff cannot establish that these reasons are pretexts for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Point IV seeks summary judgment with respect to plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. Defendant argues the actions alleged by plaintiff are not sufficiently severe and pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of plaintiff's employment. In addition, defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot show that the actions are attributable to plaintiff's gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Point V relates to plaintiff's Title VII and NYSHRL retaliation claims. Defendant's analysis focuses on four adverse employment actions: (1) the transfer of the ASM Board; (2) plaintiff's reassignment to Manager Hours of Service; (3) plaintiff's reassignment to a cubicle; and (4) the rejection of plaintiff's applications for other jobs. Defendant's Memo raises specific arguments with respect to each of these four\n   actions, which are discussed below.

However, defendant suggests that the difference between plaintiff's starting salary and Cameron's ending salary was almost entirely due to the fact that Cameron had been in the position of GSM for three years and had received a 3% merit raise. In addition, defendant notes that plaintiff was paid more than she was due under the LIRR's gender neutral policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In support of these arguments, defendant has provided a Declaration of Kathleen M. Meilick, the LIRR's Senior Director of Human Resources, which details Cameron's earnings history. The Meilick Declaration states that Cameron received a salary of $81,217.76 when he was first promoted to GSM in July 2005. (Meilick Declaration, \u00b6 10; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. E.) He received a 3% general increase at the start of 2006; a 3% merit increase in September 2006; and another 3% general increase at the start of 2007. (Meilick Declaration, \u00b6\u00b6 11-16.) As a result, Cameron's annual salary was $88,749.44 as of January 1, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16.) In April 2007, the LIRR reassessed the value of the GSM position, which resulted in an increase in Cameron's salary to $93,186.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) Cameron received another 3% general increase at the start of 2008, which increased his annual salary to $95,981.60. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) He was still earning that salary when he retired effective December 1, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   When she was promoted to GSM in February 2009, plaintiff was offered a starting salary of $93,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32.) That was almost $12,000 more than Cameron earned when he was promoted to GSM in 2005, but $3,000 less than Cameron was making when he retired after three years in the GSM position. However, by the court's calculation, it was only about $186 less than the $93,186.37 that Cameron would have been earning at his retirement if he had not been awarded the 3% merit increase in September 2006. That minuscule $186 difference in salary-about 2/10ths of one percent-was more than justified by the disparity in seniority and experience between Cameron and plaintiff. Cameron was retiring with over three years of experience in the GSM position, while plaintiff was only 30 years old, with a few months of experience as Acting GSM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff has offered no evidence to show that the differential between plaintiff's starting salary and Cameron's salary upon retirement was not justified by merit and seniority. Rather, plaintiff points out that defendant did not strictly adhere to its \"Salary Administration Program for Non-Represented Employees,\" which is attached to the McCaffrey Declaration at Exhibit G, and that plaintiff had been making over $118,000 prior to her promotion. While plaintiff may be correct, neither of these facts support her contention that she was subjected to discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   First, plaintiff's starting salary was over $5,000 more than she would have received if the LIRR had followed its \"Salary Administration Program.\" Under that Program, a promoted individual generally receives either a 10 percent increase in base salary or 112% of the \"midpoint salary\" for the new position-a figure determined by assessing the value of the position to the organization. (Meilick Declaration, \u00b6 31; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. G, pp. 4-5 of 12.) However, if that amount is less than 88% of the \"midpoint salary,\" a department head can request that the salary be increased to 88% of the midpoint. (Meilick Declaration, \u00b6 31; McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. G, p. 5 of 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   At the time plaintiff applied for Cameron's job, she was an ASM with a base salary of $78,927.68. (Meilick Declaration,\n   \u00b6 28.) If her base salary were increased 10%, plaintiff would have received only $86,820. However, the midpoint salary for the GSM position was $99,889 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Zabell Declaration, Ex. 5), and 88% of the midpoint salary was $87,902.32. Therefore, her department head could have requested that her base salary be increased to that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Although Meilick claims that her department \"determined plaintiff's salary based on LIRR policy,\" (Meilick Declaration, \u00b6 30), plaintiff's starting salary was clearly not determined based solely on the Salary Administration Program. Plaintiff was offered $93,000-almost $5,100 more than the $87,902.32 to which she was entitled. Though it is unclear how the LIRR reached this determination, the fact that the LIRR paid plaintiff more, not less, than she was entitled to under the Salary Administration Program undercuts an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The fact that the $93,000 was over $25,000 less than plaintiff earned the year prior to her promotion is also not evidence of discrimination. As Plaintiff's Memo acknowledges, plaintiff made much more than her $78,927.68 base salary because she was earning overtime for serving as Cameron's assistant. During the period that she served as Acting GSM, plaintiff was earning four overtime hours each day. (Pl. Dep. I, pp. 48-49.) However, when she became GSM-a non-represented, or management, position-she was not eligible for overtime. This, not discrimination, accounted for the precipitous drop in plaintiff's earnings after she became GSM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

Second, defendant argues that plaintiff's discrimination claims relating to pay disparity were not administratively exhausted because they were not raised in the Charge.

Defendant does not argue that plaintiff's reassignment to Manager Hours of Service was not an adverse employment action, but argues that this and the other alleged adverse employment actions did not occur under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. In addition, defendant argues that it\n   has established legitimate reasons for taking the discrete acts identified by plaintiff, and that plaintiff has not established that any of these reasons were merely pretexts for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Plaintiff initially testified that she knew \"for sure\" of only two such meetings, but was not aware of exactly when the meetings occurred or who attended them. (Pl. Dep. II, pp. 51-52.) Plaintiff thought that the first meeting involved the union, which approached Campasano directly, and several represented \"stationmasters\"-presumably, ASMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 52-53.) Plaintiff believed that Campasano should have invited her because the ASMs were in her department, but has offered no evidence that her exclusion from this union meeting affected the performance of her duties. To be sure, plaintiff's testimony suggests that she felt slighted by Campasano's snub, but \"petty slights\" and \" 'personality conflicts ... that generate ... snubbing' do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Betterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196280\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/572/#p587\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff learned of the second meeting when a lead manager, who had been asked by Papanikolatos to appear in his stead, called plaintiff to ask what to discuss at the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 51.) Plaintiff knew nothing about the meeting or what was discussed at it, although she claimed to know it had \"to do with the [B]oard and the crew dispatcher's office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 56-57.) Again, plaintiff offers no evidence that her exclusion from this union meeting affected the performance of her duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Later in her January 2, 2014, deposition, plaintiff recalled two other meetings. One, held on April 7, 2011, was organized by Campasano, who then headed the Crew Management Office, and was attended by three people who reported directly to him. (Pl. Dep. II, pp. 59-60.) Plaintiff conceded that no one else from her department was invited to that meeting (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 60), and offered no explanation or evidence as to why she should have been invited to a meeting between Campasano and his subordinates, and why her exclusion was based on her gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The other meeting was between ASM Teresky and Michael Catok, who was employed in the Crew Management Office as a Superintendent Advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 62.) According to plaintiff, the two discussed \"[h]ow the [B]oard works\" and \"what do they do in different instances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 62.) There is no evidence that plaintiff should have been invited to this meeting and that she was excluded because of her gender. Plaintiff implied that she would not have attended the meeting even if she had been invited, saying, \"It was a meeting that shouldn't have taken place.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Although defendant concedes that plaintiff was \"inadvertently excluded from a single meeting,\" (Defendant's Memo, p. 4), neither party has adduced evidence explaining who attended this meeting and what was discussed. Thus, there is no evidence that exclusion from this meeting prevented plaintiff from performing her duties or affected the terms or conditions of plaintiff's employment. Accordingly, plaintiff has not introduced evidence that her exclusion from meetings rose to the level of an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Even if plaintiff's exclusion from these meetings constituted adverse employment action. Plaintiff has not introduced any evidence to support an inference of discrimination. Plaintiff asserts that she was \"systematically excluded, with no basis, giving rise to an inference of gender discrimination.\" (Plaintiff's Memo, p, 13.) However, as noted above, plaintiff herself maintains that she was excluded from only four meetings, and offers no proof regarding the nature of the meeting or why she was excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Plaintiff knew little about the first two meetings aside from the fact that both were organized by Campasano and that one involved the union and some ASMs,\n   who were supervised by plaintiff. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 51.) Although plaintiff testified that Cameron was always included in meetings involving the union (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 52), she offered no evidence to suggest that she was excluded from this meeting because of her gender. Indeed, plaintiff testified that she never heard Campasano say anything indicating gender bias. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 103.) Moreover, plaintiff herself knew that Campasano had taken offense to a joke she told while she was an Acting GSM (Pl. Dep. I, p. 67), had complained about her talking to IT without authority (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 60), and had implied that she acted as if he reported to her, not vice versa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.) These facts suggest that even if Campasano's exclusion of plaintiff was deliberate, it was attributable to a personality conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Transfer of the ASM Board\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In arguing that the decision to strip plaintiff of her responsibility for assigning ASMs was not an adverse employment action, defendant characterizes the transfer of the ASM Board as \"simply an alteration of job responsibilities.\" (Defendant's Memo, p. 14.) In support of that contention, defendant cites to a portion of the Declaration of J.

However, plaintiff has not adduced evidence that transfer of the ASM Board significantly diminished her responsibilities. To the contrary, statements and documents provided by plaintiff support Brooks' claim that the task of assigning ASMs was just one of the GSM's many responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   First, plaintiff has introduced a copy of the \"Position Posting\" for the GSM job, issued in late 2008. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 5.) This document lists the \"Responsibilities\" of the GSM under eight bullet points, many of which list several tasks. For example, the third bullet point states that the GSM will not only \"Manage all section administrative activities with respect to assignments, prioritization of work, SAFERS,\" but also \"Manage the training of new ASMs and Ushers.\" At her October 25, 2013, Deposition, plaintiff conceded: \"There are a number of responsibilities listed on that document for the [GSM].\" (Pl. Dep. I, p. 71.) When asked to list the GSM's responsibilities, her answer to that question consumed over a page of transcript. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 119-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Although plaintiff asserted that a GSM could not successfully perform other responsibilities without \"control of the crew board,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 71), she implied that prior GSMs had delegated that job to their assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 72.) Indeed, she testified that she became responsible for the ASM Board as soon as she became Cameron's assistant (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 33), and \"managed the ASM board\" thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 46.) She also testified that this job was not particularly\n   time consuming, stating that it took \"maybe an hour, depending [on] how many jobs needed to be filled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 72.) In light of this evidence, no reasonable finder of fact could find that the decision to transfer the responsibility for assigning ASMs from the GSM to the Crew Management Office \"significantly diminished\" plaintiff's \"material responsibilities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Even assuming that the transfer of the ASM Board significantly diminished plaintiff's material responsibilities, the fact that the transfer occurred during her tenure did not create an inference of gender discrimination. Plaintiff's theory is that because she was the first woman to hold the GSM position, every change in the GSM's responsibilities constitutes disparate treatment and creates an inference of gender discrimination. However, to establish disparate treatment, plaintiff would have to establish that the situation remained the same in all material respects from the time Cameron left the office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094439\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/34/#p39\">\n    230 F.3d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Here, the undisputed facts establish the contrary. Plaintiff admits that the MTA was \"doing a lot of budget cuts\" at the time the transfer of the ASM Board was proposed, and that the ASMs had the \"highest rate of overtime above their base pay.\" (Pl. Dep. I, p. 93.) Although the excessive overtime was not necessarily a result of the manner in which ASMs were assigned, plaintiff's department was coincidentally one of the only departments in which a single individual still had the authority to make assignments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 94.) Moreover, this assignment process was vulnerable to charges of favoritism, such as the charge leveled against plaintiff in February 2010. Even though that charge proved unsubstantiated, the court notes that Brooks broached the subject of changing the manner in which ASMs were assigned at a meeting on February 23, 2010. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 1, p.11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   While plaintiff did not like Brooks' proposal to transfer the ASM Board and repeatedly sought to change his mind, she admitted that other people could disagree with that opinion. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 45.) Plaintiff herself never heard Brooks say anything indicating that his decision to transfer the ASM Board was made because of her gender, or even heard that he had made such statements. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 46.) Indeed, when asked to explain her basis for alleging that the decision was based on gender discrimination, plaintiff claimed that other personnel had complained to him that they did not like the fact that plaintiff held her subordinates responsible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Even assuming that plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to establish an inference of discrimination, there is no evidence to establish that Brooks' stated reasons for transferring the ASM Board were pretextual. In an email dated March 22, 2010, Brooks told plaintiff that he had already \"committed to both the IG and the President's office that this work would be transferred to the Crew Dispatcher,\" and explained his reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   The organization is under significant pressure to be transparent without raising costs; this gives clerical work to clerical people and frees the manager up to manage.... I've given my word and still feel that it is better off being handled by the crew dispatcher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. S.) While plaintiff has provided evidence to suggest that this decision was mistaken, \"evidence that the decision was objectively incorrect, does not necessarily demonstrate, by itself, that the employer's proffered reasons are a pretext for termination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

The pleading further alleges that the GSM had the responsibility for approving or denying compensatory time, that Papanikolatos's action made her appear \"ineffective,\" and that Papanikolatos ignored and/or rejected plaintiff's \"suggestion\" of meditation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant has denied these allegations. (Answer to Amended Complaint, \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In his deposition testimony, however, Papanikolatos admitted that he did \"circumvent\" plaintiff's authority as GSM. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. Z (\"Papanikolatos Dep.\"), p. 74.) He remembered only one specific instance, however: an incident in which plaintiff denied time off to an employee named Jennifer Powell.

Plaintiffs' argument amounts to nothing more than an allegation that, because they do not like Dr. Adesanya, plaintiffs will not seek out his counsel, and thus they essentially do not have \"access\" to a chaplain of their faith.

The change which plaintiff alleges to be an \"adverse employment action\" did not deprive plaintiff of an assistant. Rather, due to the vagaries of the seniority system, the changes resulted in the appointment of Barrett, an ASM with whom plaintiff had a pre-existing personality conflict. Plaintiff's feelings about Barrett may have made her reluctant to rely on her new assistant and undoubtedly resulted in events-most notably, the December 21, 2011, yelling incident-which may have contributed to Brooks' decision to remove plaintiff from her GSM position. However, plaintiff's subjective feelings regarding the changes in the manner in which the Assistant GSM position was filled did not render those changes \"adverse employment actions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Even if the change in the manner in which the GSM's Assistant was selected constituted an adverse employment action, there was no evidence that this change occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. Plaintiff's theory is that because this change was instituted during her tenure, it must have been on account of her gender. However, this theory ignores the events which prompted defendant to make the change in policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   By all accounts, the transformation in the Assistant GSM position began after the union objected to Sloane's attending management meetings in plaintiff's stead. Specifically, the TCU objected to having Sloane, an ASM and represented employee, assigned to out-of-classification, management responsibilities without being compensated accordingly. (Declaration of William DeCarlo dated Aug. 4, 2014 (\"DeCarlo Declaration\"), \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Pl. Dep. II, p. 96.) The LIRR determined that it was indeed a violation of the collective bargaining agreement for Sloane to attend management meetings, prompting Gibbons to tell plaintiff to discontinue the practice of sending the GSM Assistant to such meetings. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The LIRR and the union eventually agreed to create a new position-called the \"N1 position\"-that would assist the GSM directly. (DeCarlo Declaration, \u00b6 36; Pl. Dep. II, p. 92.) However, the union insisted that the position be treated like any other ASM position, which meant that the position would be filled based on seniority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   (DeCarlo Declaration, \u00b6 37; Pl. Dep. II, p. 92.) Although Barrett had a conflict with plaintiff in the past, she nonetheless bid for the job because the schedule suited her. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. DD, p. 337; Pl. Dep. II, p. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   It is clear from the foregoing that the change in the manner in which the GSM's assistant was selected was largely a result of the TCU's objections. Although the practice of sending the GSM's Assistant to management meetings pre-dated plaintiff's promotion to the GSM position, there is no evidence that the union had previously voiced any objections to this practice. Accordingly, there is also no evidence that the LIRR would have reacted differently if these objections had been raised during the tenure of one of plaintiff's male predecessors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiff suggested during her January 2, 2014, deposition that the LIRR may have elected not to fight the union on this issue because of her gender. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 100.) However, she not only adduced no proof to support this speculation, but candidly admitted that she did not know if there was any basis for contesting the union's position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, there is no evidence that fighting with the union would have resulted in better results from plaintiff's perspective. The only other method suggested in the record that would have permitted plaintiff's chosen assistant to continue to attend management meetings would have resulted in the assistant being moved to the bottom of the seniority list for overtime assignments, making it difficult to attract a talented assistant. (DeCarlo Declaration, \u00b6 33; Pl. Dep. II, p. 94.) Accordingly, the court cannot find any basis for inferring that the change in the manner in which the GSM's Assistant was selected was attributable to gender discrimination by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Reassignment to Manager Hours of Service\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Defendant does not argue that plaintiff's reassignment from GSM to Manager Hours of Service was not an adverse employment action. Rather, defendant argues that plaintiff has not adduced any evidence that this adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. Defendant primarily argues that \"[t]here is no evidence that ... Brooks, the official who made the decision to transfer plaintiff, made any statement indicative of gender bias\" and that there is no evidence of disparate treatment. (Defendant's Memo, p. 17.) Defendant also argues that \"any inference of discrimination with respect to plaintiff's transfer to Manager Hours of Service is further diminished by the fact that the same person who approved her promotion to GSM ... is the same person who decided to transfer her ....\" (Defendant's Memo, p. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In her opposition papers, plaintiff addresses only the second of these two arguments. Plaintiff cites to\n   <em>\n    Copeland v. Rosen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11622900\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/38/298/\">\n    38 F.Supp.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 1999), for the proposition that \"[t]he 'same actor' inference is not a necessary inference, it is only a plausible one, and decisions in this Circuit addressing it have warned that its use is not to become a substitute for a fact-intensive inquiry into the particular circumstances of the case at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11622900\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/38/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 305 (citing\n   <em>\n    Grady v.

However, plaintiff does not then engage in the \"fact-intensive inquiry\" envisioned by\n   <em>\n    Copeland\n   </em>\n   . Rather, plaintiff simply distinguishes the facts of her case from those in\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that plaintiff has established that the \"same actor inference\" is inapplicable to this case, plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence establishing an inference of gender discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   As defendant correctly notes, plaintiff has adduced no evidence that Brooks ever said anything indicative of gender bias. Moreover, there is no proof that plaintiff was treated differently than her male predecessor, who did not create the problems which gave rise to plaintiff's transfer. Accordingly, regardless of whether the \"same actor inference\" applies, plaintiff has not met her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that her transfer from the GSM position occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Even if plaintiff had met this burden, she did not show that the reasons Brooks gave for her reassignment were pretexts for discrimination. In his letter dated April 24, 2012, Brooks provided five \"examples of the problems\" that resulted in plaintiff's reassignment. First, he stated that plaintiff had \"violated corporate policy and confidentiality\" by contacting Lieui on January 11, 2011. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. KK.) Second, referencing Maratea's January 5, 2011, letter, Brooks noted that the TCU had complained to upper management about plaintiff speaking to subordinates in an unprofessional manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Third, Brooks accused plaintiff of violating \"LIRR's core values\" by yelling at Barrett and telling her to disregard another manager's directions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fourth, Brooks charged that plaintiff had resisted the transfer of the ASM Board even though more senior managers requested that she cease resisting, thereby making the transition more difficult for all concerned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   Finally, he charged that plaintiff was still involving herself in the dispatching of ASMs in mid-July 2011, even after being told by senior managers to desist, and had complained about the decision to transfer the ASM Board at meetings and in public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence that these were not legitimate reasons for her transfer or that these were pretexts for discrimination. First, although plaintiff denied that she told Lieui he had been awarded the job (Pl. Dep. II, p. 123), she admitted giving him information regarding when and where to report, not knowing that the office in which he worked had decided to retain him until March. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 125.) At her deposition, plaintiff acknowledged that Human Resources was responsible for extending offers on behalf of LIRR, but noted that her violation of this rule was unintentional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 123.) She did not argue that gender discrimination played a part in this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Second, plaintiff does not contest the authenticity of Exhibit HH to the McCaffrey Declaration, which purports to be a letter from Arthur Maratea, Vice President of the TCU, complaining that plaintiff subjected the ASMs to a hostile work environment. Although plaintiff may question the veracity of Maratae's claims, it is beyond dispute that the union was unhappy with plaintiff. Even assuming that this unhappiness was due to plaintiff's gender-and there is no evidence that it was-the union's animus cannot be attributed to the LIRR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Third, there is no question that Barrett accused plaintiff of yelling at her on December 21, 2011. The record includes a transcript of a statement that Barrett gave before Trial Officer Joe Mutone on December 29, 2011, attesting to the incident. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. DD.) Although plaintiff questions the accuracy of Barrett's statement, the record contains a transcript of a statement that a witness, Suzanne Clark, gave to Mutone, which largely corroborates Barrett's testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. EE.) Even if plaintiff could establish that Barrett and Clark fabricated their accounts, there is no evidence that these\n   women's actions were motivated by gender animus, rather than a longstanding personality conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Fourth, the record contains emails which provide documentary evidence to support Brooks' charge that plaintiff persisted for at least eight months in resisting the transfer of the ASM Board long after Brooks informed plaintiff of his intention to authorize the transfer. In an email dated March 22, 2010, Brooks informed plaintiff that he had already committed to both the Inspector General and the President's Office to transfer the ASM Board to the Crew Dispatcher. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. S.) Nonetheless, plaintiff continued to press her case for retaining control over the ASM Board, prompting Brooks to agree to \"take another look\" at the decision to transfer the Board. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. V.) In response to an email which plaintiff sent to Brooks following a July 12, 2010, meeting, in which plaintiff tacitly acknowledged bypassing her immediate supervisor, Brooks complemented plaintiff's tenacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, by late January 2011, Brooks was beginning to lose patience, telling plaintiff that he was \"not willing to re-litigate this issue\" and expected \"every manager\" to \"do everything in their power to ensure its success.\" (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. QQ, p. 1.) There is no evidence that Brooks' annoyance with plaintiff was not genuine or that it was in any way related to her gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Fifth, the record contains an email chain from mid-July 2011, which evinces plaintiff's dissatisfaction with having the Crew Office decide the ASM's requests for compensatory, vacation and personal days. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. W.) In that chain, plaintiff noted that she complained about the change in a meeting on July 11, 2011, and admitted that she did not communicate the change to the ASMs even though she had been told to do so by Papanikolatos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although plaintiff professed to be confused regarding whether she was supposed to send an email announcing the change, Papanikolatos did not credit her explanation, stating: \"I thought I was clear when I asked you to send the email and I also believe you wrote it down in you[r] notes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This email exchange provides support for Brooks' claim that plaintiff was clinging to some responsibilities relating to the ASMs despite directions not to do so. There is no proof that Brooks' displeasure with plaintiff's obstinance was not genuine or that it was in any way motivated by gender-based animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6. Pay Disparity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Defendant's Memo does not argue that the LIRR's decision to pay plaintiff less than Cameron was earning at the time of his retirement was not an adverse employment action or that this action did not occur under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. However, Defendant's Memo does argue that the LIRR has established legitimate reasons for taking the actions that it did and that plaintiff has not established that these reasons were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As the court has already noted in discussing plaintiff's Equal Pay Act Claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   pp. 252-55,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , defendant offered evidence to show that the differential between Cameron's salary upon retirement and plaintiff starting salary was due to merit and seniority. First, the differential was almost entirely due to the fact that Cameron had received a 3% merit raise in September 2006, without which the pay differential would have been 2/10th of 1 percent. Second, that minuscule difference in salary was more than justified by the disparity in seniority and experience between Cameron, who was retiring with over three years of experience in the GSM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   position, and plaintiff, a 30-year-old who had served as Cameron's assistant for three years and served as Acting GSM for only a few months thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Plaintiff has not introduced any evidence to suggest that these reasons were mere pretexts for gender discrimination. Plaintiff's Memo asserts that plaintiff was given various accounts of who in the LIRR organization had the authority to grant her a raise and that this created some inference of discrimination. (Plaintiff's Memo, pp. 16-17.) Assuming this is correct, the inference of discrimination would only serve to establish a prima facie case, not to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

Accordingly, none of these acts can be considered in analyzing plaintiff's hostile\n   work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pucino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776391\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/112/\">\n    618 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   117 ;\n   <em>\n    Alfano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9409449\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/365/#p377\">\n    294 F.3d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The only other two acts identified in plaintiff's Amended Complaint as contributing to the hostile work environment were the \"forgery\" of plaintiff's signature and her placement in a cubicle. The forgery allegation is not discussed in any detail in plaintiff's Memo, but apparently had something to do with the Trial Department's signing plaintiff's name to paperwork charging plaintiff's subordinates with infractions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. II, p. 70, 78.) Defendant has adduced evidence that it was the Trial Department's \"practice ... to execute the name of the employee's immediate supervisor on trial notices,\" and that this \"practice was followed without regard to a supervisor's gender.\" (Declaration of Scott Petraglia dated Dec. 7, 2014, \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff has introduced no evidence to dispute Petraglia's statements. Indeed, at her deposition, plaintiff testified that she had no knowledge regarding whether male supervisor's names were also signed by the Trial Office. (Pl. Dep. II, p. 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Similarly, plaintiff has adduced no evidence that her placement in a cubicle was an act of discrimination. By plaintiff's own account, there were no offices available when she arrived at the Jamaica Control Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 139.) Plaintiff inquired about bumping a lower-ranking manager from his office, but was informed the manager had been rejected for a promotion and that management did not \"really want to hurt his feelings\" by forcing him to move. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 142.) Plaintiff offered no evidence to establish that this reason was merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation. To the contrary, she herself testified that she did not know whether the refusal to move the manager was due to gender discrimination or constituted retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   In addition to the acts specifically alleged in the Amended Complaint, plaintiff argues that defendant \"forced\" plaintiff to take Barrett as her assistant and took no \"corrective and/or remedial measure[s]\" to protect plaintiff. Plaintiff's Memo implies that these acts alone may be the basis for a meritorious hostile work environment claim, noting that \"a single act can create a hostile work environment if it in fact work[s] a transformation of the plaintiff's workplace.\" (Plaintiff's Memo, p. 31 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Feingold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254549\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/138/#p149\">\n    366 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   150 ).) However, plaintiff's allegations that defendant \"forced\" plaintiff to take Barrett and took no corrective measures are unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   First, there is no question that Barrett and plaintiff had an acrimonious relationship which pre-dated Barrett's tenure as plaintiff's assistant. According to a document provided by plaintiff, Barrett, an ASM, became unhappy with the assignments which plaintiff gave her, and Barrett \"made disparaging comments about, and veiled threats against\" plaintiff sometime in 2010. (Zabell Declaration, Ex. 14, p. 1.) Upon learning of Barrett's comments and threats in July 2010, plaintiff filed an internal complaint with the LIRR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 2.) Although Barrett responded by filing a charge of discrimination against plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), there is no evidence that Barrett's actions against plaintiff were based on sex. Moreover, while plaintiff's complaint against Barrett was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated, there is no evidence that this result was attributable to gender discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Although the LIRR was doubtless aware of the history between plaintiff and Barrett, it did not \"force\" Barrett upon plaintiff. As discussed on pages 264-65,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , the system for appointing the GSM's assistant was changed after the TCU objected to having plaintiff's assistant, Sloane, appear for plaintiff in management meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The union's objection was eventually resolved through the creation of a new \"N1\" position-a represented position which could be \"bid\" for by union members and would be filled based on seniority. Barrett used her seniority to successfully bid the job. There is no evidence that the LIRR anticipated or encouraged this result, or that it had the power to deny Barrett the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   There is also no evidence that plaintiff requested \"corrective and/or remedial measure[s]\" at any time after Barrett was awarded the N1 Position. To the contrary, the only claims of misconduct arising from plaintiff's interaction with her new assistant came from Barrett, not plaintiff. Although plaintiff asserts that Barrett's claims were false and implies that Clark corroborated them solely because \"plaintiff's past decisions negatively impacted\" Clark (Plaintiff's Memo, p. 33), plaintiff has not shown that the LIRR engaged in gender discrimination by crediting their accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E.

Transfer of the ASM Board\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   In arguing that the transfer of the ASM Board was not retaliation, defendant principally argues that plaintiff did not engage in protected activity before the decision to transfer the ASM Board was made. Defendant notes that Brooks told plaintiff in his March 22, 2010, email that he had already committed to transfer the ASM Board to the Crew Dispatcher. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. S.) Defendant asserts that plaintiff did not formally complain about gender discrimination until sometime after that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In response, plaintiff relies on her own testimony concerning a conversation that she had with Williams Gibbons, the General Superintendent of Penn Station. Plaintiff could only vaguely recall when this conversation took place, initially claiming that she could not recall whether it occurred prior to March 22, 2010, (Pl. Dep. II, p. 21), but later asserting that it occurred before she received Brooks' March 22, 2010, email. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 22.) In addition, she could only vaguely describe the substance of the conversation, although she remembered complaining that \"everything\" was \"shifting and changing,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 21), and that the changes were occurring because she was a woman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Although plaintiff's complaints may have been vague, the court cannot find as a matter of law that Gibbons could not \"reasonably have understood [ ] that the plaintiff's\n   complaint was directed at conduct prohibited by Title VII.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowen-Hooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220201\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/13/179/#p222\">\n    13 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   222 ;\n   <em>\n    Rojas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843068\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/98/#p108\">\n    660 F.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, because it is unclear precisely when Brooks decided to transfer the ASM Board, the court cannot find that the Brooks' decision preceded plaintiff's conversation with Gibbons. Accordingly, the court cannot find that plaintiff did not engage in protected activity before the decision to transfer the ASM Board was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Defendant also argues, however, that the LIRR has articulated legitimate reasons for transferring the ASM Board and that plaintiff has not established that these reasons were pretextual. (Defendant's Memo, p. 30.) The court agrees. As the court has already noted in the course of granting summary judgment on plaintiff's Title VII and NYSHRL discrimination claims, Brooks articulated several reasons for switching the responsibility for assigning the ASMs from the GSM to the Crew Dispatcher, noting that the switch would improve transparency without increasing costs, give clerical work to clerical employees, and free the manager to manage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   p. 262,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   (quoting McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. S).) In his declaration, Brooks also noted that \"ASMs were the last ... non-management represented employees[ ] ... w[h]ere assignments were not handled by the Crew Management Office.\" (Brooks Declaration at pp. 4-6.) Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to establish that these reasons were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Reassignment to Manager Hours of Service\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Similarly, defendant argues that Brooks articulated legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for reassigning plaintiff in his April 24, 2012, letter, which is attached to the McCaffrey Declaration as Exhibit KK. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   defendant's Memo, p. 29.) Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to establish that these reasons were pretextual. Rather, plaintiff merely asserts that the allegations of misconduct listed in Brooks' letter \"are each materially false.\" (Plaintiff's Memo, p. 25.) Plaintiff offers no evidence to support this assertion, but argues that \"it is only logical to conclude\" that plaintiff would have been terminated, and not merely transferred, if all of the allegations were true. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The record contains ample evidence to substantiate Brooks' reasons for reassigning plaintiff. First, plaintiff herself admitted contacting Lieui and giving him information regarding when and where to report, although she claimed any usurpation of Human Resources' role was unintentional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 123.) Second, the record contains a copy of a January 5, 2012, letter to Brooks from the National Vice President of the TCU, complaining about plaintiff's behavior. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. HH.) Brooks stated that this letter was \"the first time in [his] tenure as CTO that [he] received a letter from a union complaining that its members felt threatened by a supervisor.\" (Brooks Declaration, p. 12.) Third, the record contains transcripts of statements made by Barrett and Clark, which substantiate Brooks' claim that plaintiff behaved inappropriately during the December 21, 2011, incident. (McCaffrey Declaration, Exs. DD &amp; EE.) Finally, the record also contains e-mails substantiating Brooks' claims that plaintiff resisted the transfer of the ASM Board long after Brooks announced his decision to do so, (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. QQ), and disregarded Papanikolatos's direction that she inform the ASMs that the Crew Management Office would decide their requests for compensatory, vacation and personal days. (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. V.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   To be sure, the record contains proof contradicting some of the evidence on\n   which Brooks relied. For example, plaintiff herself provided a statement and testimony rebutting Barrett's and Clark's accounts of the December 21, 2011, incident, (McCaffrey Declaration, Ex. GG), and provided an affidavit noting that the TCU was the only union to issue a complaint about her. (Affidavit of Charmaine Fraser dated Feb. 5, 2015, \u00b6 19.) However, Brooks apparently credited Barrett, Clark and the TCU. The fact that he did so, and chose to reassign plaintiff rather than terminate her, does not establish that the reasons listed in his April 24, 2012, were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Reassignment to a Cubicle\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Defendant advances two arguments in opposition to plaintiff's claim that her reassignment to a cubicle was an act of retaliation. First, relying on\n   <em>\n    Roncallo v. Sikorsky Aircraft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=447%20Fed.%20Appx.%20243\">\n    447 Fed.Appx. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2011) (summary order), defendant argues that \"[a] temporary move from an office to a cubicle does not constitute a materially adverse employment action.\" (Defendant's Memo, p. 29.) Second, defendant argues that, even if it did, the LIRR articulated a legitimate reason for assigning plaintiff to a cubicle, and that plaintiff has not established that this reason was a pretext for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The court is not persuaded by the first of these arguments.\n   <em>\n    Roncallo\n   </em>\n   did not categorically hold that a temporary reassignment to a cubicle can never be a materially adverse employment action. Rather, it held that Roncallo's \"temporary move from an office to a cubicle, consistent with Sikorsky's office allocation ... does not constitute a materially adverse employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Roncallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=447%20Fed.%20Appx.%20243\">\n    447 Fed.Appx. at 245-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, in contrast, there is evidence that LIRR's policy entitled plaintiff to Grippaldi's office because her position had more Hay Points than his. (Pl. Dep. II, pp. 140-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The court is persuaded, however, by defendant's second argument. In her own deposition testimony, plaintiff discussed the LIRR's reason for not giving her Grippaldi's office. As noted on page 269,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's supervisor told plaintiff that Grippaldi had been rejected for a promotion and that management did not \"really want to hurt his feelings\" by forcing him to move. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 142.) Plaintiff not only offered no evidence to establish that this reason was merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation, but testified that she herself did not know whether the refusal to move Grippaldi was due to gender discrimination or constituted retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. The NYEPL and NYCHRL Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   A district court \"may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim ...
