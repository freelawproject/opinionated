Mather Memorial Hospital (the \"Hospital\"). First, plaintiff asserts that Computer Credit violated the FDCPA because the letter did not indicate that, under the agreement between plaintiff and the Hospital, the \"Amount Due\" could increase due to reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, if there is a default in payment and the Hospital retains an attorney to prosecute a claim for unpaid balances. Second, plaintiff asserts that Computer Credit violated the FDCPA because the letter did not disclose that the Hospital could seek pre-judgment interest under the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\"N.Y. C.P.L.R.\") \u00a7 5001 (\" Section 5001\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Computer Credit moves to dismiss these claims, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that the letter is not false, misleading, or deceptive, nor does the letter misrepresent the amount of the debt. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Computer Credit's motion to dismiss in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10-12.) Plaintiff received a letter from Computer Credit, dated December 11, 2015, seeking to collect a financial obligation plaintiff incurred primarily for personal, family, or household purposes-a \"debt\" as defined by the FDCPA. (Compl. \u00b6 8.) The letter, which lists an address of 17 Edna Lane, Selden, NY 11784-1529 in the upper-left corner, reads, in relevant part:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Provider Detail\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   John T.

The Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that, because of two specific omissions, this letter violates 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e (\" Section 1692e\") and 1692g (\"Section 1692g\"). In particular, plaintiff contends that Computer Credit failed to notify him that:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , the \"Amount Due\" may increase due to \"reasonable attorney's fees and court costs,\" and,\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , the \"Amount Due\" may increase due to interest pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 21-22, 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With regard to the first purported omission, plaintiff notes that the agreement between Derosa and the Hospital allows the Hospital to charge Derosa, \"in addition to the 'Amount Due' of $174.15, 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' 'if there is a default in payment of any sums due' and John T. Mather Memorial Hospital 'retains an attorney to prosecute a claim for unpaid balances.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 16.) Plaintiff further contends that Computer Credit, as an assignee or successor-in-interest, would have a right to charge Derosa the additional sum, and violated Sections 1692e and 1692g by failing to notify Derosa of this\n   potential increase in debt. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's second claim, as noted above, is premised on his argument that his debt could increase due to pre-judgment interest, as afforded by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no allegation (nor does plaintiff argue) that, at the time defendant sent the debt collection letter, plaintiff's debt had been reduced to a judgment. Section 5001(a) states that \"[i]nterest shall be recovered upon a sum awarded because of a breach of performance of a contract.\" (Compl. \u00b6 24 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ).) Plaintiff asserts that this statute allows for interest to begin to accrue on the \"earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed.\" (Compl. \u00b6 27 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ).) Plaintiff claims that interest, therefore, began accruing on or before the date Computer Credit sent the collection letter. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-32.) Relying on his argument that this pre-judgment interest would be recoverable, plaintiff claims Computer Credit violated the FDCPA by failing to notify Derosa of this potential increase in debt. (Compl. \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Suffolk, on May 15, 2017. Defendant removed the case to this Court on May 19, 2017. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on July 31, 2017. Plaintiff filed his memorandum in opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss on September 7, 2017. Plaintiff replied on September 21, 2017. The Court held oral argument on October 17, 2017, and reserved decision. On November 20, 2017 and November 30, 2017, defendant submitted notices of supplemental authority, bringing to the Court's attention decisions relating to the pending motion that had been issued after oral argument.

Plaintiff claims that, as a matter of law, Computer Credit was required to disclose in its collection notice that his debt may increase in the future due to Section 5001 interest or future legal fees and costs under the agreement. There is no allegation that the debt was accruing interest, late charges, or other fees under the agreement between plaintiff and the Hospital. Under such circumstances, where there are no factual disputes based upon the pleadings for which discovery is required, it is simply a question of law as to whether the letter violates the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sperber v.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss, arguing that plaintiff does not state a claim for relief under the FDCPA because there was nothing false, misleading, or deceptive about the letter it sent plaintiff in an attempt to collect his past due debt. Defendant's main argument is that the FDCPA does not require debt collectors to disclose that additional interest or fees may accrue when an account is not actually accruing interest or fees. This argument addresses plaintiff's remaining claims, which allege that defendant violated the FDCPA by failing to notify defendant of the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   that he might in the future incur additional charges in the form of (1) attorney's fees and court costs under the agreement (incurred to collect the unpaid balance), or (2) pre-judgment interest under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that, as a matter of law, defendant's collection notice was not false, deceptive, or misleading in omitting information about these potential charges that would be contingent upon the occurrence of future litigation events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court, therefore, finds that plaintiff failed to state a claim that defendant violated the FDCPA, and grants defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.

June 7, 2011) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 1692g(a) sets forth the required disclosures for a debt collector's initial communication to a consumer. Specifically, the debt collector must include (1) the amount of the debt; (2) the name of the\n   creditor to whom the debt is owed; (3) a statement that the consumer may dispute the validity of the debt within thirty days after receipt of the initial communication, lest the debt be assumed valid by the debt collector; (4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector that the consumer is disputing the debt, the debt collector must provide verification of the debt; and (5) a statement that, if the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor in writing within thirty days of receiving the initial communication, the debt collector must provide it. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). Computer Credit's letter included the above-referenced specific disclosures. For the same reasons that plaintiff alleges a violation of Section 1692e, plaintiff asserts that the collection letter did not accurately set forth the amount of the debt as required under 1692g.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B. The FDCPA Claim Based on Future Attorney's Fees and Costs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff claims that the collection notice violated the FDCPA because it failed to disclose that the amount of the debt may increase in the future if attorney's fees and court costs are incurred in connection with litigation to recover the unpaid balance. As set forth below, that claim fails as a matter of law under Sections 1692e and 1692g(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As noted above, the agreement between Derosa and the Hospital allows the Hospital to charge Derosa, \"in addition to the 'Amount Due' of $174.15, 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' 'if there is a default in payment of any sums due' and John T. Mather Memorial Hospital 'retains an attorney to prosecute a claim for unpaid balances.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 16.) Thus, this attorney's fees-shifting provision would only be triggered if the following conditions were met: (1) the Hospital retained an attorney; (2) a lawsuit was commenced; (3) attorney's fees and costs were incurred; and (4) a court determined those fees and costs were reasonable. In the instant case, there are no allegations suggesting that the attorney's fees-shifting provision had been triggered at the time the collection letter was received. In other words, plaintiff does not allege that such attorney's fees and costs had been incurred, or that an attorney had even been retained. Thus, at the time the letter was received, there could be no conceivable argument that the amount of the debt had increased. The amount of the debt under the FDCPA does not include unaccrued attorney's fees and costs that are contingent upon future events. In short, this Court holds that the FDCPA is not violated, under the least sophisticated consumer standard, by the failure to disclose that the amount of the debt may increase in the future if attorney's fees and court costs are incurred in connection with litigation to recover the unpaid balance. In fact, any mention of the possibility of incurring these fees and costs would be so speculative that it could render the disclosure itself misleading under the FDCPA to the least sophisticated consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court's decision is consistent with the analysis by the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Veach v.

The FDCPA defines \"debt\" as \"any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction ..., whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\" The Seventh Circuit has expressed doubt that \"debt\" includes unaccrued court costs or attorney fees. But the Payoff Statement does not specify what the \"estimated fees, costs, [and] additional payments\" are, and thus we cannot say whether those amounts are properly part of the amount of the debt. If Davidson Fink improperly included fees and costs that it was not entitled to under the note (absent a judgment), the Payoff Statement would plainly be insufficient under \u00a7 1692g.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277161\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/207/#p216\">\n    852 F.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (2d Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Notwithstanding the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Carlin\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff contends that his claim is supported by the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Avila v.

This Court, however, disagrees. Although\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   held that \" Section 1692e requires debt collectors, when they notify consumers of their account balance, to disclose that the balance\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   increase due to interest and fees,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n    at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added), the\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   holding does not apply to the circumstances in this case. Instead, as discussed below, the holding and rationale of\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   is confined to cases where a balance is actually increasing, or where the possibility that it may increase is not contingent upon a future event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   , the debt collector informed the debtors of their \"current balance[s],\" but not that those amounts were increasing over time, or could increase if not paid by a certain date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Derosa, on the other hand, asks this Court to extend\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   to apply in\n   cases where the amount of the debt is not actually increasing, and any increase in the amount owed in the future would be contingent upon the occurrence of a separate future event.

Other decisions have focused on the\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   requirement that debt collectors disclose when debt is\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   increasing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dick v.

In\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found that the omitted information rendered the collection letter inadequate notice to the consumer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n    817 F.3d at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs successfully argued that the \"least sophisticated consumer\" (or even a reasonable consumer) might not expect the \"current balance\" on a debt collection notice to increase with the mere passage of time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Second Circuit accepted the plaintiffs' argument that the collection notice misled them to believe that the \"current balance\" was a \"static\" amount, and that payment at any time would satisfy the debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808318\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/72/\">\n    at 74, 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This rationale does not apply in Derosa's case, as the least sophisticated consumer would have been correct in believing that the \"Amount Due\" was not increasing at the time of the collection letter and, thus, was a static amount. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   , Derosa's\n   debt was not increasing simply due to the mere passage of time; rather, any increase required a contingent future event-namely, the retention of an attorney to prosecute a default in payment of sums due, and reasonable attorney's fees and costs being incurred as a result. In other words, if Derosa paid the debt at the time of the collection letter, he would have satisfied the debt because the attorney's fees-shifting provision had not been triggered. Thus, because the debt was static at the time the letter was received, this Court concludes that the collection notice Derosa received would not have misled the least sophisticated consumer to incorrectly believe that he had satisfied his debt through payment, and thus does not run afoul of the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court concludes not only that the disclosures plaintiff argues were required in this case by the FDCPA are not compelled by\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   , but also that such mandated disclosures would potentially do more harm than good. Warnings about unaccrued interest and/or fees contingent upon future events (such as litigation) could easily confuse debtors as to the sum they owe, or might owe in the future.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castro v.

In addition to the plain language of the statute, the commentary clarifies that this provision precludes the award of such pre-judgment interest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Arcade Pub., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183541\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/455/373/#p379\">\n    455 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   379 (citing Weinstein, Korn &amp; Miller, NEW YORK CIVIL PRACTICE \u00b6 5001.00 (2d ed. 2005) (explaining that this provision was intended to compensate a \"successful plaintiff\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Given this legal framework under New York law, this Court holds that statutory interest under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y.

This is not a situation where the obligation to pay exists prior to that obligation later being reduced to a judgment and, thus, is part of the debt,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5) ; the obligation to pay the interest does not exist at all under New York law until that judgment is awarded by a court. Thus, pre-judgment interest under Section 5001 is not part of the debt under the FDCPA until such an award is made by a court. Here, there is no allegation of such an award and, therefore, the amount of the debt was static at the time the letter was received. Accordingly, the Court holds that the failure to include any disclosure in the letter about the possibility of pre-judgment interest being awarded in the future does not violate Section 1692e or Section 1692g(a) under the least sophisticated consumer standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this holding is not contrary to the Second Circuit's holding (or reasoning) in\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   , where the debt at issue was accruing on a daily basis at a rate of 500% per annum, the debt here is not accruing any interest under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y.

Likewise, although plaintiff also cites\n   <em>\n    Sperber\n   </em>\n   , that case is also distinguishable because the debt at issue had already been reduced to a judgment and New York law provides for automatic 9% statutory interest on judgments.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201737702\">\n    2017 WL 1737702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Other case authority plaintiff provides in support of his argument demonstrates only that pre-judgment interest can be recovered\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a judgment has been awarded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Joseph E.
