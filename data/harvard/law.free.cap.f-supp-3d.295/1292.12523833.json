BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As more fully recounted in the court's previous Order (Doc. # 64) on Defendants' motions to dismiss, Justice Tom Parker was investigated by the Judicial Inquiry Commission for comments he gave on a radio talk show on October 6, 2015, as part of his reelection campaign for the Alabama Supreme Court. The topic of discussion was the relationship between federal and state courts, especially as it pertained to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v. Hodges\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). That decision, which struck down as unconstitutional state laws that excluded homosexual relationships from recognition of marriage, was issued on June 26, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the same period the U.S. Supreme Court was grappling with questions of marriage, so, too, was the Alabama Supreme Court, on which Justice Parker served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte State ex rel.

Indeed, three months before\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   came down, the Alabama Supreme Court issued a writ of mandamus enjoining Alabama probate judges from issuing marriage licenses to homosexual couples.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/495/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/495/\">\n    at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   changed the landscape, the Alabama Supreme Court invited the\n   <em>\n    API\n   </em>\n   parties to submit briefing addressing the effect of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the court's injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Apr. 19, 2017) (outlining complex procedural history of\n   <em>\n    API\n   </em>\n   ). Nine months later, on March 4, 2016, the Alabama Supreme Court issued its final order in the\n   <em>\n    API\n   </em>\n   case, dismissing all pending motions and petitions.\n   <em>\n    API\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/495/\">\n    200 So.3d at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It was during this additional briefing period-after\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   but before the Alabama Supreme Court's final order in\n   <em>\n    API\n   </em>\n   -that Justice Parker took to the airwaves. As Justice Parker explained on the radio, \"[W]e're [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Alabama Supreme Court] faced with the question [of] what is the continued effectiveness of that March\n   decision from the Alabama Supreme Court\" in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Obergefell.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 1-1, at 13.) He continued: \"[W]e have right now, before the Alabama Supreme Court, a further petition by those probate judges who were before the court earlier asking that their religious liberty rights be defended. Let's see if our court will rise up and do that.\" (Doc. # 1-1, at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Justice Parker then argued that unpopular judicial decrees like\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   were a result of unelected judges not being accountable to the people, and explained that the answer to this problem was judicial elections, which \"keep judges in line.\" (Doc. # 1-1, at 15.) This prompted a broader dialogue about federalism, the role of the Tenth Amendment in modern jurisprudence, and the ability of states to serve as \"a check on the federal government.\" (Doc. # 1-1, at 17.) According to Justice Parker, one check could be a state's refusal to accept the legitimacy of\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   , in the same way that Wisconsin refused to accept the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dred Scott v. Sandford\n   </em>\n   back in 1857. (Doc. # 1-1, at 11.) Thus, \"resisting [the\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   ] decision could maybe sta[rt] a revival of what we need in this country to return to our original founding principles.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 1-1, at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 12, 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a complaint with the JIC about Justice Parker's comments. (Doc. # 1-1, 1-2.) The JIC notified Justice Parker that it was opening a judicial conduct investigation based on the complaint, and had decided to investigate the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

Hodge[s]\n   </em>\n   , e.g., suggesting that the Alabama Supreme Court should defy and refuse to give effect to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. # 1-3, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Commission's investigation was still ongoing when Justice Parker filed\n   this suit on June 15, 2016, challenging Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics 1, 2A, and 3A(6) as unconstitutional. (Doc. # 1.) After this court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss on\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention grounds and the case was on appeal, the JIC dropped its investigation, and the Eleventh Circuit kicked the case back to this court for a determination of whether dropping the investigation made the whole thing moot. It did not. (Doc. # 64, at 19-23.) The case was (and is) not moot because Justice Parker is still subject to the canons of judicial ethics he challenges, and the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception applies because \"it is alleged that JIC is willing to initiate investigations that chill protected speech of judges\"-hence capable of repetition-and the JIC voluntarily ceased its investigation-hence evading review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roe v. Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957048\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/113/#p125\">\n    410 U.S. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957048\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/113/#p125\">\n    93 S.Ct. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957048\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/113/#p125\">\n    35 L.Ed.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). (Doc. # 64, at 20-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This sets the stage for Justice Parker's present motion: that the court prevent the whole escapade from happening again by issuing a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants \"from enforcing or applying Canon 3A(6) of the Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics to Justice Parker's protected speech and conduct under the First Amendment.\" (Doc. # 82, at 1.) Such an injunction is required, Justice Parker contends, because he is currently campaigning for the position of Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court (election date: November 6, 2018), and he \"would like to be able to engage in the discussion of the important matters\" related to his candidacy. (Doc. # 83-1, at 3.) \"However, because of the recent investigation by the JIC into [his] protected speech and complaints raised by various groups opposed to [his] position on certain matters, [he] ha[s] been chilled, and continue[s] to be chilled in [his] expression, and [he] [is] forced to self-censor.\" (Doc. # 83-1, at 3.) He does not seek injunctive relief under any other Canon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Canon of Judicial Ethics 3A(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For Justice Parker to prevail, he bears the burden of demonstrating that (1) he has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered until the injunction issues; (3) the threatened harm to him outweighs any damage the injunction might cause the JIC and the Alabama Attorney General; and (4) the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Siegel v.

Whose Speech?

This is where agreement ends. While Justice Parker sees Canon 3A(6) as an overbroad, content-based restriction on his political speech that should be struck down under strict scrutiny, the Commission contends that any speech curtailed by Canon 3A(6) is not protected speech to begin with. This is because any speech by Justice Parker about a pending or impending case is in fact government speech, and the \"Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private speech; it does not regulate government speech.\" (Doc. # 92, at 17 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Grove City v. Summum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (citations and emphasis omitted) ).) Moreover, says the Commission, even if Justice Parker's speech were his own, it would still be proscribable because it falls within the \"well-defined and narrowly limited class[ ] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which ha[s] never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.\" (Doc. # 92, at 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chaplinsky v.

While the Commission admits that \"it may seem odd to equate a judge's speech about a pending or impending case with other traditional categories of unprotected speech,\" it is nevertheless \"self-evident\" that the same factors would apply to make the comparison work.

That seems reason enough not to proclaim Justice Parker's campaign speech generally (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , speech related to issues of interest to voters but unrelated to a specific pending case or party to a case) as falling outside the orbit of First Amendment protection.

Moreover, the prohibition is not limited to the merits of a proceeding\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to issues that are determinative of a proceeding. Finally, and most pertinent to this case, the prohibition reaches political speech given during a campaign, but it covers much more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Such was the interpretation given the language by the ABA's Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility when it voted to revise the 1972 Model Code of Judicial Ethics-whence comes Alabama's version-to change the canon to prohibit only judges' comments that \"might affect the outcome or fairness of a trial or hearing.\" Lisa L. Milord,\n   <em>\n    The Development of the ABA Judicial Code\n   </em>\n   21 (1992). As that Committee explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The language of the 1972 Code's provision prohibiting any public comment about a pending or impending proceeding was believed by the Committee to be overbroad and unenforceable. For example, judges in their extra-judicial teaching and writing often refer to pending or impending cases in other jurisdictions without diminishing the fairness of those cases or the appearance of judicial impartiality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"817300\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/146/501/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though it matters not whether the Committee thought the language enforceable-nor that many, though not all,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   states have since followed the model version and tightened the text-the revision does highlight the broad nature of the Canon's ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Yet while certainly geographically unconstrained, the reach of the provision is not as bottomless as Justice Parker intimates. Justice Parker notes that in his radio interview, he discussed \"political, judicial and constitutional theory, structures of government and its different branches, key public issues such as the role of the judiciary, constitutional interpretation, and marriage, and important legal history.\" (Doc. # 83, at 8.) While \"he would like to be able to discuss [these issues] freely without fear of reprisal,\" he is now \"forced to self-censor on such issues\" due to Canon 3A(6).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"817300\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/146/501/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But Justice Parker\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   discuss those issues-at least, it is not the ordinary meaning of Canon 3A(6) that prevents him from doing so. As written, the Canon precludes discussing them only as part of a conversation about a pending or impending proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 1670 (\"[I]n reality, [Florida's canon] leaves judicial candidates free to discuss any issue with any person at any time.... [But] [t]hey cannot say, 'Please give me money.' \"). As noted earlier,\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee\n   </em>\n   did not concern \"issues\" speech at all; it concerned speech in a political campaign that implicated purely ethical concerns,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a judicial candidate seeking favors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Having construed the Canon, the next question is whether the Canon is narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest. And here, it must be said that the lack of geographic restriction does not necessarily doom the Canon. As Justice Scalia complained in\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee\n   </em>\n   , the canon at issue there \"applie[d] even when the person asked for a financial contribution has no chance of ever appearing in the candidate's court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1677 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Even so, the imperfect tailoring and slight broadness in the shoulders did not change the majority's conclusion that the canon did not need to be returned to the tailor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But Alabama's Canon 3A(6) is not the same as Florida's ban of in-person solicitation, and the fit appears even looser. True, the compelling state interest in\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee\n   </em>\n   was likewise judicial integrity-which \"does not easily reduce to precise definition,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1667 (majority opinion)-but it was judicial integrity of a specific kind: to counter the fear \"that the public may lack confidence in a judge's ability to administer justice without fear or favor if he comes to office by asking for favors,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1666. The link between the problem (asking for money) and the solution (restricting judicial candidates from personally engaging in \"money speech\") was clear, and the slice of speech cut from the pie was narrow. Moreover, the state also provided an alternative to the right it restricted: While judicial candidates could no longer directly ask contributors for money, their campaign committees could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In contrast, in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , Minnesota's interest was broadly labeled \"judicial integrity,\" but it was of no specific kind or flavor; the problem it sought to counter was amorphous (\"Respondents are rather vague ... about what they mean by 'impartiality,' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    536 U.S. at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and the slice of speech carved out was a sloppy double portion. This was true even though Minnesota's announce clause had been construed by the lower court to reach \"only disputed issues that are likely to come before the candidate if he is elected judge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, it was precisely\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   the speech ban reached those disputed\n   <em>\n    issues\n   </em>\n   that it was\n   so problematic. As the Supreme Court explained, \"philosophical generalities[ ] ha[ve] little meaningful content for the electorate unless [they are] exemplified by application to a particular\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   of construction likely to come before a court-for example, whether a particular statute runs afoul of any provision of the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Not mentioned but nevertheless obvious, Minnesota's rule also allowed candidates to hide behind it to avoid voters learning of the candidates' positions on matters of great public interest. The rule thus served as an official mechanism for intellectual fleecing of the voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   That is the rub here. Canon 3A(6) removes from the orbit of protected speech any discussion of ongoing or impending court\n   <em>\n    proceedings\n   </em>\n   , but as in all other iterations\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   says nothing about speech restrictions on\n   <em>\n    issues.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 92-1, at 2-3.) Some speech concerning some proceedings is worth curtailing in some circumstances-when a case is pending before the court on which the candidate sits (or seeks to sit), for instance, or when a case could conceivably get there. As the Commission points out, it could be that allowing judges to speak about those kind of proceedings \"would undermine the appearance of judicial open-mindedness and impartiality that is central to our court system, and it would undermine the public's confidence in receiving a fair proceeding.\" (Doc. # 92, at 46.) And a state has a compelling interest in preventing a judge from \"improperly forecasting on how he or she will rule\" in a specific decision. (Doc. # 92, at 49.) The integrity of the court system depends generally on enforcement of that ethical notion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But even assuming these compelling interests, it is not clear how Defendants' reasoning extends to the full reach of the Canon's proscription. Why would the public's confidence be undermined by a judge speaking about an ongoing proceeding in Arizona or Angola? When it comes to preserving the judicial integrity of Alabama state judges, is speaking about a case pending before the Alabama Supreme Court really the same as discussing the merits of an appeal before the Supreme Court of Seychelles?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   More generally, what is the state interest in outlawing speech that cannot be seen as affecting the outcome or impairing the fairness of a proceeding? While the geographic examples well illustrate how such instances can arise, by no means are they the only way. For instance, how would speaking about a case that has no chance of coming before the Alabama court on which a judge sits (speech that is not currently allowed) be different from speaking about past cases (speech which is allowed)? And what is Alabama's interest in preventing a judge from responding publicly to allegations made by litigants in order to obtain the judge's recusal? If the judge recuses, then any subsequent speech would fall afoul of Canon 3A(6) because it would not be made in the course of the judge's official duties and would concern a pending proceeding in another court. Yet the Fifth Circuit has expressly held that a state's interests in \"preserving the public's faith in the judiciary and litigants' rights to a fair hearing\" are not advanced by \"shutting down completely such speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenevein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511408\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/551/#p560\">\n    493 F.3d at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   All these examples reveal that Alabama currently treats \"proceedings\" and \"issues\" alike, and therein lies the conceptual\n   problem. Nor is it just an Alabama problem. All iterations of this canon across the country address only \"proceedings\" or \"matters\" without express consideration of \"issues.\" Whereas a \"proceeding\" refers to a particular legal action involving particular questions and parties, an \"issue\" is a more general category-even though issues obviously arise in the context of proceedings. A judicial candidate's discussion of\n   <em>\n    issues\n   </em>\n   is protected by the First Amendment. The problem arises when the issue relates directly to a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This tension, though difficult to reconcile in some settings, may be illuminated by the example of the death penalty. At the trial on this case, the court would be interested to know if any party seriously contends that a judicial candidate in Alabama or elsewhere is precluded from publicly giving his or her opinion on the death penalty generally, even though doing so necessarily implies giving an opinion as to the constitutionality of the procedure.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ala.

And a judicial candidate's view of\n   <em>\n    issues\n   </em>\n   , especially local and domestic ones, is of immense interest to an electorate choosing which judicial candidate to support.

Perhaps there are compelling answers why Alabama's Judicial Ethics Canon needs to be this broad. But if so, it is Defendants' burden to provide them, and this they have not yet done. As all parties are aware (and spend much of their briefing debating), Alabama is one of about six states without a geographic or other restriction concerning what counts as a pending or impending proceeding about which the judge should not publicly comment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 92-1, at 2-3 (comparing versions of Canon 3A(6) in all fifty states and the District of Columbia).) Most other states limit the restriction to either (1) cases pending or impending in a court in that state, or (2) statements that might reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of a proceeding. (Doc. # 92-1, at 2-3.)

Rather, in the First Amendment world, the chill to speech is\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   the harm, and that harm, \"because of [its] intangible nature, c[an]not be compensated for by monetary damages,\" and therefore must be enjoined from occurring.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536243\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/888/969/#p973\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The question, then, is whether Canon 3A(6) chills speech. On the one hand, Justice Parker is rather vague in his affidavit about what kind of speech he would like to give but thinks Canon 3A(6) proscribes. He notes only that he \"frequently discuss[es] matters of public concern in public meetings, speeches, and media interviews, and [he] would like to be able to engage in the discussion of the important matters related to these issues.\" (Doc. # 83-1, at 3.) And, as detailed above, the examples his briefing does give-\"political, judicial and constitutional theory, structures of government and its different branches, key public issues such as the role of the judiciary, constitutional interpretation, and marriage, and important legal history\" (Doc. # 83, at 8)-have little or nothing to do with the actual proscription of the Canon. Nor, as the JIC points out, did many of the allegations brought in the previous investigation, and those that did-concerning Justice Parker's comments about the\n   <em>\n    API\n   </em>\n   case then pending before the Alabama Supreme Court-may fall on the constitutional side of the Canon anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   But these particularities do not negate the fact that (1) Canon 3A(6) likely violates the First Amendment, (2) Justice Parker and all other judges and judicial candidates in Alabama are subject to a canon that is overbroad and appears to unlawfully proscribe certain categories of speech, and (3) this application necessarily chills, or threatens to chill, rights protected by the First Amendment. At a minimum, it gives the regulator indeterminate ammunition to attack a judicial candidate over speech on\n   <em>\n    issues\n   </em>\n   (as opposed to speech purely concerning\n   <em>\n    proceedings\n   </em>\n   ).

It is overbroad because Justice Parker has not shown (and is therefore unlikely to succeed on a claim) that Canon 3A(6) is unconstitutional in every application. Rather, he has shown a likelihood that Canon 3A(6) is overbroad when it touches speech about\n   <em>\n    issues\n   </em>\n   , particularly when such speech concerns pending or impending proceedings outside the Alabama system, or where the comments could have no impact on the outcome or fairness of a proceeding. Though a slimmer version of the Canon will remain once the fat is trimmed, the Commission is entirely right that a broad injunction enjoining the total enforcement of Canon 3A(6) would not serve the state's compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its judicial system. (Doc. # 92, at 58 (\"With the broad injunction sought here by Justice Parker, one which would eliminate any enforcement mechanism to deter judges or judicial candidates from speaking about pending or impending matters, Alabama's judges or judicial candidates would technically be free to comment publicly about any case, including how they would rule on its merits-during an election season.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The proposed relief is underinclusive because it seeks to enjoin Defendants from applying Canon 3A(6) only to Justice Parker. But if the Canon is so problematic because of its overreach, then it is infringing not just on Justice Parker's speech but also on that of his colleagues and other judicial candidates. Indeed, such a recognition of third-party harm is implicit in any overbreadth challenge, where \"the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech\n   <em>\n    of others\n   </em>\n   may be muted.\"\n   <em>\n    Broadrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11342234\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/601/#p613\">\n    413 U.S. 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 612,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11342234\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/601/#p613\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11342234\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/601/#p613\">\n    37 L.Ed.2d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid L. v.
