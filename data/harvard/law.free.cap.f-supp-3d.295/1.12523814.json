Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 42, 56. He alleges that Presidential Policy Directive 19 (\"PPD-19\" or the \"Directive\"), issued by President Obama in October 2012, requires that the CIA Inspector General (\"IG\") conduct an investigation into his complaint, and that the office's failure to do so can be rectified through the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 51-56.

Upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, and related legal memoranda in opposition and in support,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I find that the complaint fails to allege that a private right of action is established, either by statute or the Directive, to sustain judicial review of the merits of this action. Accordingly, the Defendant's motion will be granted, and the complaint will be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Pars is a 16-year veteran of the CIA. Compl. \u00b6 3. In December 2014, he began a one-year assignment as the Deputy Chief of Base, a management position, at a base located in a conflict zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. In this position, he allegedly observed certain \"unusual and inappropriate\" behaviors of the Chief of Base (\"COB\") which he feared \"negatively impacted the Base's ability to meet its mission of assisting Intelligence Community (IC) and US military partners, and endangered the lives of personnel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. For example, the COB allegedly often spent time cooking, baking, socializing, entertaining, exercising, and shopping, and insisted on traveling in areas of indirect fire attack to perform certain of these activities, putting herself and other military personnel in danger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. In one instance, the COB and her personnel allegedly traveled through an area that was hit by a rocket ten minutes later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. In another instance, the COB allegedly missed a meeting with a senior U.S. military official in order to cook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. The COB also allegedly told Mr. Pars that she was \"horribly depressed\" and missed her family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. According to Mr. Pars, she selected certain individuals to become her \"adopted sons,\" and gave preferential treatment to those individuals, entertaining them and permitting them to shirk their work responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In or around January 2015, upon advice from the base's Psychological Officer, Mr. Pars disclosed his concerns to the \"Chief,\" the next person in the chain of command.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. The Chief allegedly relayed Mr. Pars' disclosure to the COB, who allegedly retaliated against Mr. Pars by excluding him from key meetings, micromanaging his work, and exhibiting \"belligerent and threatening behavior\" towards him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27. In March 2015, while on previously scheduled leave for rest and recuperation, Mr. Pars was told that he would not be returning to the base.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. He alleges that the COB sent a \"short of tour cable\" stating that she had lost confidence in Mr. Pars' leadership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Mr. Pars alleges that the sole reason he was \"sent home short of tour was because he complained about the COB's behavior and mismanagement of personnel and resources,\" and that this very negative\n   career event that has severely impacted his career at the CIA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2015, Mr. Pars submitted a complaint to the CIA IG, alleging improper retaliation due to his protected disclosures about the COB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Between April and December 2015, Mr. Pars met twice with the CIA IG's office about his complaint, and submitted evidentiary and witness information to the IG.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-45. Since then, however, Mr. Pars alleges that the IG has not taken any action on his complaint, including interviewing main witnesses and issuing a final written disposition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-48. Mr. Pars challenges this inaction as a violation of PPD-19 and seeks that I order the Agency to conclude its investigation and issue a written disposition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In the Directive, President Obama ordered that intelligence agencies such as the CIA establish a process for employees to seek review of any personnel action allegedly made as a reprisal for a protected disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 6. The Directive requires the agency's Inspector General to investigate and determine whether a personnel action complained of violated the Directive and, if so, to recommend appropriate corrective action including but not limited to reinstatement, reassignment, and the award of back pay, related benefits, expenses, and/or costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Employees who have exhausted this process can seek further external review by a three-member Inspector General panel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Mr. Pars alleges that the CIA IG's failure to investigate and issue a final written disposition regarding his complaint constitutes \"agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,\" and that this inaction prevents him from being able to seek external review.

Cir. 1980).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The complaint does not sufficiently allege that the CIA IG's action is legally required such that it can be compelled by the judiciary. Significantly, the complaint fails to identify any statute that makes PPD-19 have the force and effect of law-in other words, that the President issued PPD-19 pursuant to an authorization by Congress. Furthermore, the Plaintiff admits that \"PPD-19 does not provide whistleblowers with a private right of action to enforce their rights.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 2. These shortcomings require that the complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the Plaintiff argues that PPD-19 was later entirely codified in the Section 601 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2014, the statute does not authorize a private right of action by which I can adjudicate Mr. Pars' claim,\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1287763,3506819\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/627/1346/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203234\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c). The statute only codifies the prohibition on reprisals for disclosing information regarding mismanagement and abuses of authority to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the inspector general for the employee's agency, and requires that the \"President shall provide for the enforcement of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203234\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c). The statute is silent as to how the President should enforce the prohibition, and says nothing to permit or otherwise provide for judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203234\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even assuming that PPD-19, which pre-dated Section 601, is a directive detailing the President's enforcement of Section 601, the Plaintiff's own admission that PPD-19 does not create a private right of action precludes judicial review of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer v. Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875099,3810742\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/1288/\">\n    981 F.2d 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1296 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (\"An Executive Order... which does not create any private rights-is not, for instance, subject to judicial review.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Plaintiff's fatal admission that PPD-19 does not create a private right of action echoes PPD-19 itself, which includes a clear disclaimer: \"This directive is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments,\n   agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\" Similar language has been found to not create any private right of action. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Meyer v. Bush\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit described an Executive Order issued by President Reagan stating that it was \"not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States\" as one that \"created no private rights.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875099,3810742\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/1288/\">\n    981 F.2d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1296 n.8. Thus, a private right of action is neither created through the Directive nor Section 601, and Mr. Pars' claim, no matter how meritorious, cannot proceed under the circumstances as alleged. \"Without [a private remedy derived from Congressional authority], a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    532 U.S. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 286-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
