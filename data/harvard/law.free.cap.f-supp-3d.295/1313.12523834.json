Willingham's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 153; Motion), filed on June 27, 2017. On July 11, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition to Defendant Erika M.

Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action arises from Plaintiffs' as-yet unsuccessful efforts to collect on a Consent Judgment entered against Defendant Erika Willingham's husband, Ben Willingham, in 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (Doc. No. 103; TAC) \u00b6 1. Erika Willingham is a dual citizen of Switzerland and the United States currently residing in Jacksonville, Florida.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; Defendant Erika M. Willingham's Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 152; Answer) \u00b6 3. She has been married to Ben Willingham, who is not a party to this action, for approximately thirty-five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 15; Answer \u00b6 3. Plaintiff Abdullah M. Al-Rayes (Al-Rayes) is a citizen of Saudi Arabia currently residing in Switzerland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 9. Al-Rayes brings this action together with various corporate entities under his control (collectively, Creditors).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 1994 to 1999, Creditors purchased nine properties through Ben Willingham and several of his corporate entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 5. In 2005, an officer of the Plaintiff corporations, Mario M. Kranjac, uncovered what he believed to be a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by Ben Willingham and his companies in connection with these transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9. As a result, on April 20, 2006, Creditors filed a lawsuit against Ben Willingham and others, asserting various fraud-based claims related to the purchases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Rayes v.

Apr. 20, 2006) (complaint). The parties resolved this 2006 lawsuit on March 15, 2007, via the entry of a consent judgment whereby, without admitting liability, Ben Willingham agreed to pay Creditors the amount of $25,707,605.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 33, Ex. 13: Consent Judgment (Doc. No. 158-13; Consent Judgment). However, since that time, Creditors have been able to collect only $39,943.81 from Ben Willingham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156. As a result of their stymied collection efforts, Creditors bring the instant lawsuit in which they contend that Erika Willingham has assisted her husband in orchestrating and carrying out a different fraudulent scheme, this one designed \"to conceal [Ben Willingham's] assets in order to hinder, delay, or impede Plaintiffs' ability\" to collect on the amount due under the Consent Judgment. TAC \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 9, 2008, Creditors deposed Ben Willingham for the purpose of obtaining information about his assets in furtherance of their efforts to collect on the Consent Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 35, Ex. 14: January 9, 2008 Deposition of Ben H. Willingham, Jr. (Doc. No. 158-14; 2008 BW Dep.). During this deposition, Ben Willingham disclosed the existence of three USAA Federal Savings Bank accounts (USAA Accounts) which he jointly owned with Erika Willingham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2008 BW Dep. at 21:22-22:17. He further testified\n   that: (1) he did not have any accounts or assets in Switzerland, where Erika Willingham is from and where the Couple previously resided; (2) Erika Willingham possessed at least one Swiss bank account over which she had sole control; and (3) Erika Willingham made regular wire transfers from that account to the USAA Accounts to help pay for the Couple's living expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:23-48:1; 60:21-61:16; 68:8-69:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that year, on May 29, 2008, Creditors deposed Erika Willingham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 39, Ex. 15: May 29, 2008 Deposition of Erika Willingham (Doc. No. 158-15; 2008 EW Dep.). During this deposition, Erika Willingham testified that she was unaware of any accounts aside from the USAA Accounts, and that she did not have any other bank accounts in her individual name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2008 EW Dep. at 17:24-18:1; 33:16-19. At the same time, she noted that her husband was primarily responsible for managing the Couple's finances and paying the bills, including mortgage payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:6-12; 21:3-14. As part of this discussion, Creditors' counsel inquired as to whether Erika Willingham owned the Couple's then-current home (the Fair Lane Drive Property), as well as whether the mortgage on the Fair Lane Drive Property was in her name alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:15-24; 7:21-8:5. She responded that, although the house was in her name alone, she could only \"guess\" that the mortgage was as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 27, 2010, Creditors deposed Ben Willingham for the second time as part of their efforts to collect on the Consent Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 47, Ex. 19: October 27, 2010 Deposition of Ben Hill Willingham (Doc. No. 158-19; 2010 BW Dep.). During this deposition, consistent with his prior testimony, Ben Willingham testified that he did not have any accounts in his name alone, and that his wife did not have any undisclosed checking or savings accounts, save for a trust account created for her by her parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2010 BW Dep. at 15:9-17:22; 25:6-16; 26:17-21. He also testified that, although he was certain his wife was on the mortgage for the Fair Lane Drive Property, he did not know if he countersigned it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:24-49:2. However, a review of the mortgage agreement for the Fair Lane Drive property reflects that on May 3, 1999, eight years before entry of the Consent Judgment, both Ben and Erika Willingham signed the document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 110, Ex. 45: Mortgage Agreement (Doc. No. 158-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 17, 2011, Ben Willingham filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy action (Bankruptcy Action) in the United States Bankruptcy Court in and for the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division (Bankruptcy Court).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. In another attempt to collect on the Consent Judgment, Creditors initiated an adversary proceeding (Adversary Proceeding) in the Bankruptcy Action on May 23, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. On December 8, 2011, Creditors deposed Erika Willingham in connection with the Adversary Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51, Ex. 20: December 8, 2011 Deposition of Erika Willingham (Doc. No. 158-20; 2011 EW Dep.). During her deposition, Erika Willingham testified that she did not have any funds in Switzerland, and that the only transfers made from Switzerland to the USAA Accounts were her and her husband's Swiss-equivalent Social Security payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 EW Dep. at 18:1-20:2. When confronted with records reflecting wire transfers to the USAA Account from an account in Switzerland, she testified that she was unaware of the account, and that she had given her husband complete control over the money she inherited from her parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:10-25:14 (\"Q: Did you even know that this account existed? // A: Which account? Q: That is transferring\n   money into USAA. // A. No.\" ...\"A: And he-I left everything to Ben because I trust him. // Q. So you gave him control over the account in Switzerland? // A. Yes. Always.\"). She also maintained that her husband managed the Couple's finances and that she did not actually know how many bank accounts she had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:5-26:8 (\"Q: Do you have any idea how many accounts you have? // A: No.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In conjunction with the Bankruptcy Action, on August 8, 2012, Ben Willingham submitted a breakdown of the Couple's assets and liabilities to the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl., Ex. 21: Summary of Schedules &amp; Schedules (Doc. No. 158-21; Schedules). Notably, Ben Willingham signed a declaration, under penalty of perjury, as to the accuracy of the Schedules, but the document is not signed by his wife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedules at 6. In the Schedules, Ben Willingham represented that the Couple had no significant assets and a combined average monthly income of $4,062.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 55; Schedules. However, one week later, on August 15, 2012, the Couple \"submitted an application to the Naval Continuing Care Retirement Foundation, Inc. (NCCRF) for a residence at a retirement community [located in Jacksonville, Florida,] named Fleet Landing[,]\" in which they represented that they owned real estate valued at $750,000, investments valued at $395,000, and had approximately $40,000 in cash, among other things.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, Ex. 22: Fleet Landing Confidential Data Application (Doc. No. 158-22; Application).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, on October 22, 2012, without informing the Bankruptcy Court, the Couple formally \"entered into a contract with NCCRF for a residence at Fleet Landing\" and \"agreed to pay an entrance fee of $254,962.50 for their residence[,]\" as well as monthly fees in the amount of $4,611.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-67, Ex. 27: Fleet Landing Residency Contract (Doc. No. 158-27; Residency Contract).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Ben and Erika Willingham signed the Application and the Residency Contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application at 4; Residency Contract at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meanwhile, on May 7, 2012, the trustee in the Bankruptcy Action (Bankruptcy Trustee) filed an application to employ a special attorney (Kranjac Decl., Ex. 29: Application for Authority to Employ Nina M. LeFleur as Special Attorney (Doc. No. 158-29; LeFleur Application) ), stating that he was in need of \"special counsel to prosecute avoidable fraudulent transfers,\" among other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 71-72 (citing LeFleur Application at 1). Soon after, on May 25, 2012, the Bankruptcy Trustee filed a motion seeking turnover of Erika Willingham's Swiss accounts, which based on her 2011 deposition testimony, the Bankruptcy Trustee contended were part of Ben Willingham's bankruptcy estate given that they were actually \"owned and controlled by [him].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74, Ex. 30: Trustee's Motion for Turnover of Property of the Estate (Doc. No. 158-30; First Turnover Motion) at 2. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, on February 15, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n   of Law on the First Turnover Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl., Ex. 31: Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Doc. No. 158-31; Findings on First Turnover Motion). In its Findings, the Bankruptcy Court determined that between December 13, 2007, and November 22, 2010, approximately 68 wire transfers were made from a Swiss bank account, titled solely in Erika Willingham's name, into a joint USAA checking account owned by the Couple.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings on First Turnover Motion at 2. Notably, the Bankruptcy Court observed that the Couple gave contradictory testimony with respect to these wire transfers with Ben Willingham testifying that Erika Willingham managed the accounts herself, would tell him what transfers to make, and has talked to the bank on the phone, and Erika Willingham denying all knowledge of the existence of the Swiss account or the wire transfers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court found that it was \"unable to determine whether the proceeds of the Swiss Account\" are property of Ben Willingham's bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. However, the Bankruptcy Court did find good cause to order Erika Willingham to produce records relating to \"the Swiss Account\" as relevant and indispensable to the Trustee's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Shortly thereafter, Creditors received account records from the Couple as well as directly from various Swiss banks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. The records revealed a large number of wire transfers of Ben Willingham's \"salary, social security, and health insurance payments,\" into Erika Willingham's Swiss Account (the PostFinance Account) between 2002 and 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-87, Ex. 32: 2002-2005 PostFinance Account Statements (Doc. No. 158-32) and Ex. 33: 2006-2016 PostFinance Account Statements (Doc. No. 158-33). The records also showed transfers into the PostFinance Account from other Swiss accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89, Exs. 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 24, 2014, during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Action, the Couple sold the Fair Lane Drive Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106, Ex. 41: General Warranty Deed (Doc. No. 158-41). The Couple received $334,295.53 in proceeds from the sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111, Ex. 47: Settlement Statement (Doc. No. 159-4). However, at no time did the Couple notify Creditors or the Bankruptcy Court that they had sold the Fair Lane Drive Property or that they had made a profit on the sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115. Later that year, between June and July of 2014, Creditors deposed Ben Willingham for a third time, this time regarding the newly-produced records of the Swiss accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116, Exs. 1, 43: June 18 and July 18, 2014 Deposition of Ben Hill Willingham (Doc. Nos. 158-1, 158-43; 2014 BW Dep.) ). During his deposition, Ben Willingham identified numerous deposits and transfers-via wire-of his social security payments and salary, as well as health insurance payments and tax refund payments of the Couple, into Erika Willingham's PostFinance account from 2002 onward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 BW Dep. at 165:20-22, 169:5-13 (discussing social security); 169:24-170:25, 172:12-19, 184:2-5, 251:15-18 (discussing salary); 203:21-204:13 (discussing health insurance); 211:5-212:1 (discussing income tax refunds). Ben Willingham acknowledged that some of the funds in the PostFinance Account were used to pay for the Couple's personal living expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 208:7-209:5, 236:11-238:9, 242:8-11, 246:23-247:4, 291:2-7. He also identified transfers in the PostFinance Account related to three investment accounts that he maintained were owned by his wife: an account at SwissQuote, an account at Bank Sarasin, and an account at Bank Leu, later named Clariden Leu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 213:22-217:25,\n   230:9-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that the funds in the investment accounts came from his wife's retirement money, cashed out life insurance policies on him and his wife, and his wife's inheritance from her parents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217:17-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Ben Willingham, his wife was generally aware that he was making these transfers, and in fact consented to him doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 248:1-249:1. Indeed, with respect to several transactions listed on the PostFinance bank records, Ben Willingham testified that he was unable to identify the transaction because it was initiated by his wife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 225:23-226:24, 230:3-7, 233:20-234:17. As a result of this testimony, on August 28, 2014, the Bankruptcy Trustee filed a renewed motion for turnover of the assets contained in the Swiss accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 120, Ex. 48: Trustee's Renewed Motion for Turnover of Property of the Estate (Doc. No. 159-5). Shortly thereafter, on September 11, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered a consent judgment (Kranjac Decl., Ex. 49: Consent Judgment as to Dischargeability of Debt (Doc. No. 159-6) ), ordering that Creditors' 2007 Consent Judgment would not be discharged under the Bankruptcy Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 31, 2014, Erika Willingham acquired a condominium in Jacksonville, Florida (the Ortega Boulevard Condo) for approximately $120,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123, Ex. 50: General Warranty Deed (Doc. No. 159-7) and Ex. 51: Settlement Statement (Doc. No. 159-8). Although the Ortega Boulevard Condo was purchased using funds from the Couple's jointly-owned USAA Accounts, title was placed in Erika Willingham's name alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124 (citations omitted). Additionally, the Couple did not disclose the purchase to Creditors or the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125. In mid-November of 2014, the Couple moved out of Fleet Landing and into the Ortega Boulevard Condo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126 (citation omitted). Subsequently, on December 19, 2014, the Couple received a partial refund of their entrance fee to Fleet Landing from NCCRF in the amount of $140,436.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127, Ex. 53: Check (Doc. No. 159-10; NCCRF Check). Notably, the check was made out to Ben Willingham, and not to Erika Willingham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCCRF Check. Again, the Couple failed to disclose this transaction to Creditors or the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kranjac Decl. \u00b6 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on these events, on January 20, 2015, Creditors filed their initial complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (Doc.

Under the facts of that case, evidence that a group of disparate individuals regularly came together to plan and execute bank thefts, over the span of several years, supported the inference that some form of organization existed.

Thus, in this case, the long-term association of these two individuals does not suggest the existence of an \"organization.\" Nonetheless, Creditors contend that Erika and Ben Willingham formed an \"association-in-fact\" enterprise based on their combined efforts and \"common purpose of concealing BW's assets\" from Creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 19.

However, this pattern of activities also fails to support the existence of a distinct \"enterprise.\" Under Creditors' version of the facts, Ben Willingham used his wife's financial accounts in Switzerland to deposit his income. The Couple would transfer these funds to their joint USAA account in the United States to pay their living expenses or, on occasion, purchase a residence. The Couple held the title of their jointly-purchased residence in Erika Willingham's name only, and when they subsequently moved into a condominium, they put the title to their new residence in the name of Erika Willingham, and later, her trust. When Creditors attempted to collect on their Judgment, and throughout Ben Willingham's bankruptcy proceedings, both Erika and Ben Willingham misrepresented their financial circumstances, and failed to disclose fully their assets and income.
