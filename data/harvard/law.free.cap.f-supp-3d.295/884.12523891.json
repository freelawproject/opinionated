For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Pay on Scan\" shall mean that Vendor shall retain title to the merchandise until Walgreen has sold such merchandise, and payment for such merchandise shall not be due and owing by Walgreen to Vendor until after such time, as is agreed upon by the parties.\n   <em>\n    In addition, Walgreen shall have the unrestricted right to rescind its purchase of the merchandise from Vendor both before and after acceptance of such merchandise by Walgreen\n   </em>\n   .....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Doc. 26-1 at 3 (emphasis added). Walgreen contends that the highlighted sentence that includes and follows the third \"In addition\"-which will be called the rescission provision-unambiguously allowed it to cancel its outstanding orders from LifeWorks, regardless of whether the goods had already been produced. Doc. 28 at 11-13. LifeWorks responds that the rescission provision applies only to \"Pay on Scan\" goods; if that is right, then the provision does not apply here, as it is undisputed that, pursuant to the BTA, the goods that LifeWorks contracted to sell to Walgreen were \"Guaranteed Sale\" goods, not \"Pay on Scan\" goods. Doc. 26-1 at 14; Doc. 28 at 3, 11; Doc. 35 at 4, 11-12; Doc. 36 at 3. LifeWorks adds that accepting Walgreen's reading of the rescission provision would improperly render superfluous both the first sentence of Section C(2)-which will be called the return provision-and the BTA. Doc. 35 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Walgreen's interpretation prevails, for understood in the context of the contracts as a whole, the rescission provision unambiguously contemplates a cancellation like the one Walgreen implemented here. Read most naturally, that provision-which, as noted, grants Walgreen an \"unrestricted right to rescind its purchase of the merchandise from Vendor\"-sets forth a standalone right to rescind, without prior notice, the purchase of any merchandise covered by the GTA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allergease, Inc. v. Walgreen Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2066819\">\n    2017 WL 66819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (N.D. Ill.

This is so for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section C(2) uses the phrase \"in addition\" three times. Each \"in addition\" introduces what is, in effect, a different subsection in Section C(2) designed to deal with a discrete scenario. The text preceding the first \"in addition\" establishes the first substantive right granted in Section C(2), permitting Walgreen to return defective, excess, or nonconforming goods at LifeWorks's expense. The text following the first \"in addition\" and preceding the second \"in addition\" concerns an entirely different situation: Walgreen's right to return merchandise at LifeWorks's expense \"where a claim is made that the use or resale of the merchandise by Walgreen infringes\" a non-party's intellectual property rights. The text following the second \"in addition\" and preceding the third \"in addition\"-which will be called the designated purchase order provision-addresses still a third scenario, stating that, for \"Guaranteed Sale,\" \"Pay on Scan,\" and four other categories of purchase orders, Walgreen \"shall not be obligated to pay\n   for any merchandise until after it is sold by Walgreen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The text following the third \"in addition\" is the rescission provision. Here, too, the phrase \"[i]n addition\" serves, much like a subheading, to set off the rescission provision from the text following the second \"in addition.\" Consequently, the third \"in addition,\" much like the term \"moreover\" would have done, indicates that what follows is a separate and independent right granted by the GTA-the absolute right to rescind a purchase order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    XPO Logistics Worldwide Gov't Servs., LLC v.

Doc. 35 at 11. Even putting aside its incompatibility with Section C(2)'s use of \"In addition\" to effectively create and set off different subsections, LifeWorks's argument cannot be reconciled with other aspects of Section C(2)'s text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section C(2) defines \"Pay on Scan\" to \"mean that Vendor [LifeWorks] shall retain title to the merchandise until Walgreen has sold such merchandise, and payment for such merchandise shall not be due and owing by Walgreen to Vendor [LifeWorks] until after such time, as is agreed upon by the parties.\" Given that definition, it would be odd, if not nonsensical, for the rescission provision to be limited to \"Pay on Scan\" goods. After all, if LifeWorks retained title to \"Pay on Scan\" merchandise until Walgreen sold it to a Walgreen's customer, rescission of Walgreen's purchase of that merchandise would be unnecessary, if not impossible, because there would be no purchase from LifeWorks to unwind until after a Walgreen's customer bought the merchandise, at which point rescission would involve taking that nonparty customer's property and declaring the purchase void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chi.

The sentence defining \"Pay on Scan\" goods states that \"the term 'Pay on Scan' shall mean that Vendor [LifeWorks] shall retain title to\n   <em>\n    the merchandise\n   </em>\n   until Walgreen has sold\n   <em>\n    such merchandise\n   </em>\n   , and payment for\n   <em>\n    such merchandise\n   </em>\n   shall not be due and owing by Walgreen to vendor until after such time, as is agreed by upon by the parties\" (emphasis added). Note that when the sentence first refers to the designated category (\"Pay on Scan\") of merchandise, it uses the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   merchandise,\" while subsequent references to that category are to \"\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   merchandise.\" Similarly, after establishing Walgreen's \"unrestricted right to rescind its purchase of\n   <em>\n    the merchandise\n   </em>\n   from Vendor,\" the rescission provision proceeds to say \"both before and after acceptance of\n   <em>\n    such merchandise\n   </em>\n   by Walgreen.\" If the rescission provision governed only \"Pay on Scan\" goods, it would have provided for the \"right to rescind [Walgreen's] purchase of\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   merchandise,\" thereby referring back to the \"Pay on Scan\" merchandise defined in the previous sentence. Instead, the rescission provision refers at the outset to \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   merchandise,\" thereby connoting that the provision is no longer referring, and is not limited, to \"Pay on Scan\" goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   LifeWorks also contends that Walgreen's reading of the rescission provision renders superfluous Section C(2)'s return provision-the text preceding the first \"In addition\"-which allows Walgreen to \"return\" or \"cancel\" excess, defective, or nonconforming merchandise \"at Vendor's expense.\" There is no superfluity. The return provision states that Walgreen may return merchandise if LifeWorks sends excess, defective, or nonconforming goods; under those circumstances, LifeWorks bears the expense of returning the merchandise. The rescission provision, by contrast, states that Walgreen may rescind the purchase of merchandise for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   reason, \"both before and after acceptance of such merchandise by Walgreen\"; under those circumstances, naturally, Walgreen bears the cost of returning the merchandise. Because they address different situations and allocate costs differently, the two provisions are not superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curia v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680822\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/824/#p829\">\n    587 F.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829 (7th Cir. 2009) (\"In construing contracts, to determine their intent, it is long established that a construction should be adopted, if possible ... which harmonizes all the various parts so that no provision is deemed conflicting with, or repugnant to, or neutralizing of any other.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Coney v.

Sept. 25, 2001) (holding that two contractual provisions were not superfluous because they had \"different purposes\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   LifeWorks next argues that Walgreen's interpretation of the rescission provision renders superfluous the BTA when read together with the Guaranteed Sale portion of the designated purchase order provision,\n   reasoning that \"Walgreens would not require a separate document [the BTA] to discuss guaranteed sales if the GTA provided for an absolute right of return.\" Doc. 35 at 11. LifeWorks's argument has some force. Because the parties agreed under the BTA that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   merchandise that LifeWorks produced for Walgreen would be sold on a \"Guaranteed Sale\" basis, it is not clear why Walgreen needed the additional benefit of the rescission provision. As noted, the designated purchase order provision states that if a \"purchase order is designated as a 'Guaranteed Sale' ... transaction, Walgreen shall not be obligated to pay for any merchandise until after it is sold by Walgreen in accordance with terms agreed upon by the parties.\" Thus, the argument goes, the designated purchase order provision already releases Walgreen from the obligation to pay LifeWorks for any goods that it did not sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Even if there may be overlap between the designated purchase order provision and the rescission provision, that overlap does not undermine Walgreen's reading of Section C(2) by creating a fatal redundancy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kazmierczak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512654,6123511\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1020/\">\n    24 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"[W]e are not of the school that believes, contrary to all experience, that documents-contractual, statutory, or other-never contain redundant or meaningless terms.\");\n   <em>\n    Raytheon Eng'rs &amp; Constructors, Inc. v.

Ill. Mar. 16, 2000) (\"Contracts frequently contain provisions that are not strictly necessary, either due to the draftsman's desire for completeness or simply his verbosity.\"). Rather, in context, the two provisions are most naturally read as regulating different aspects of the relationship between Walgreen and LifeWorks. The designated purchase order provision governs the timing of payment for LifeWorks's goods (all designated as \"Guaranteed Sale\") that have been sold at Walgreen's stores; under that provision, Walgreen is not obligated to pay LifeWorks for any goods until they are sold at retail to Walgreen's customers. By contrast, the rescission provision permits Walgreen not to order any more goods from LifeWorks or accept goods already ordered-that is, to cancel any existing or future purchase orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allergease\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2066819\">\n    2017 WL 66819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"The contract expressly provides Walgreens with the right to rescind purchase orders.\"). Accordingly, because they have different purposes, the two provisions are not superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iteld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202496552\">\n    2009 WL 2496552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Valinote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201135871\">\n    2001 WL 1135871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 n.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   LifeWorks also contends that Section 5(a) of Exhibit 1 of the GTA required Walgreen to give thirty days' notice of its decision to terminate its obligations under the GTA. Doc. 35 at 13; see Doc. 26-1 at 8 (\"This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by either party on thirty (30) days' prior written notice ....\"). But the operative complaint does not allege that Walgreen failed to provide such notice, Doc. 26, and so whether Walgreen complied with the thirty-day notice provision is not at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, LifeWorks contends that the parties' prior course of dealing is relevant to whether Walgreen's cancellation was contemplated by the rescission provision. Doc. 35 at 7-8. To support this argument, LifeWorks points to Section 4(c) of Exhibit 1 of the GTA, which provides that \"the conduct of the parties pursuant to this Agreement ... shall, for all legal purposes, evidence a course of dealing and a course of performance accepted by the parties in furtherance of this Agreement ....\" Doc. 26-1 at 8.
