SPF's Amended Opposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court addresses an issue with Defendant SPF's amended opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed its motion for summary judgment on April 6, 2017. SPF requested and received multiple extensions of time to respond, even though it failed to meet the initial response deadline. (Docket Nos. 55; 64; 66; 80; 83). When SPF moved to amend its opposition, it asked to do so specifically to withdraw its argument that it did not generate more than $500,000 in annual gross income (\"AGI\"). (Docket No. 94 at 2). The Court granted SPF's motion to amend and allowed SPF to file the amended motion in opposition to summary only with respect to SPF's withdrawal of their argument that they did not generate more than $500,000 in AGI. (Docket No. 109). SPF, however, chose to take the opportunity to add facts, arguments, and citations not included in their original opposition and not related to the issue of AGI. In addition, SPF added seven exhibits not originally included with their memorandum of support. (Docket Nos. 86; 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court granted SPF's request\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   to withdraw its argument as to AGI; this was not an opportunity for SPF to surreptitiously include facts, arguments, and citations it did not manage to include on its first try. Because the Court was unequivocal in its order as to the content to be amended-particularly in light of the many extensions SPF received-the Court disregards all alterations made by SPF in its amended opposition, with the exception of the withdrawal of SPF's argument that it did not generate more than $500,000 in AGI. Further, the Court will not consider any of the additional material presented in Docket Nos. 115-3-115-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Objections to Defendants' Statements of Uncontested Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Rivera and SPF failed to properly deny or controvert Plaintiff's statement of material facts and further, that they failed to properly support their own statements of material facts. (Docket Nos. 75 at 1-3; 101 at 1-4). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the summary judgment stage, parties must follow Local Rule 56. Section (c) states that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts.\" L. CV. R. 56(c). This statement \"shall admit, deny or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Each denial and qualification must be supported by a record citation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to allowing an opposing party to admit, deny, or qualify the moving party's facts, the opposing party may submit additional facts \"in a separate section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section (e) provides that the Court may \"disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material\" and notes that the Court has \"no independent duty to search or consider any part of the record not specifically referenced in the parties' separate statement of facts.\" L. CV. R. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   If a party improperly controverts the facts, Local Rule 56 allows the Court to treat the opposing party's facts as uncontroverted; the First Circuit has consistently held that litigants disregard Local Rule 56 at their own risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caban Hernandez v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n    486 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1st Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Defendant Rivera's Opposition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rivera, in his opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, fails to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\" L. CV. R. 56(c). Rivera's admissions, denials, and qualifications use a separate numbering system, with almost no reference to the numbered paragraphs in Plaintiff's statement of material facts. (Docket Nos. 55-3; 71-1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Litigants ignore Local Rule 56 \"at their peril.\"\n   <em>\n    Caban Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n    486 F.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This rule serves the enormously important purpose of \"focusing a district court's attention on what is-and what is not-genuinely controverted.\"\n   <em>\n    Calvi v. Knox County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5665030\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/422/#p427\">\n    470 F.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (1st Cir. 2006). The Court, in its discretion, finds that Rivera's failure to conform to this vital rule warrants deeming Plaintiff's statement of fact unopposed by Rivera, and accepting the stated facts as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The other additional facts submitted by Rivera in Docket No. 71-1-with the exception of paragraphs 49 and 50-are unsupported by record citations. Local Rule 56(e) allows the Court to \"disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material,\" and that is precisely what the Court will do here. L. Cv. R. 56(e). All paragraphs except 49 and 50 of Rivera's additional statement of facts are hereby disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendant SPF's Opposition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SPF, in its amended opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment,\n   also fails to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\" L. CV. R. 56(c). SPF's admissions, denials, and qualifications use a separate numbering system. (Docket Nos. 55-3; 115-1). The only paragraph that correctly references Plaintiff's statement of material facts is paragraph four-a paragraph which SPF does not dispute. (Docket Nos. 55-2 \u00b6 4; 115-1 \u00b6 4). The Court, in its discretion, finds that SPF's failure to conform to this vital rule warrants deeming of the rest of Plaintiff's statement of fact unopposed by SPF, and accepting its stated facts as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The additional facts submitted by SPF in Docket No. 115-1 require further discussion. As noted above, the Court will not entertain amendments-including the addition of citations-other than those related to SPF's withdrawal of its argument that it did not generate more than $500,000 in gross annual income. This being the case, the only un-amended paragraphs with proper record citations are paragraphs 53 and 54. (Docket Nos. 86-2 \u00b6\u00b6 54-55; 115-1 \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). Because Local Rule 56(e) allows the Court to \"disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material,\" all paragraphs other than paragraphs 53 and 54 of SPF's additional statement of facts are hereby disregarded. L. CV. R. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   These rules are critically important; they \"ease the district court's operose task and ... prevent parties from unfairly shifting the burdens of litigation to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Caban Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n    486 F.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel for Rivera and SPF are admonished to adhere to them in future or risk consequences similar to those imposed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff, Rivera, and SPF's statements of material uncontested facts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   credited only to the extent either admitted or properly supported by record citations in accordance with Local Rule 56 and viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovants, reveal the following undisputed material facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SPF is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with its principal office and place of business in Puerto Rico, where it engaged in the business of providing security services. (PSUMF \u00b6 1). Rivera resided in Puerto Rico during the period covered by the complaint. (PSUMF \u00b6 2). A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in Puerto Rico. (PSUMF \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   SPF regulated the employment of all persons employed by the corporation, and acted directly and indirectly in the corporation's interest in relation to the employees during the period covered by the Complaint. (PSUMF \u00b6 4; SSUMF \u00b6 4). SPF employed security guards who handled, sold, or otherwise worked on goods or materials that had been moved in or produced for commerce, such as firearms and vehicles. (PSUMF \u00b6 5). SPF's annual gross volume of sales made or business done was not less than $500,000 for the period covered by the complaint. (PSUMF \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sometime in 2007 or 2008, Rivera met Eric Resto, a licensed detective, who suggested they start a security guard company together. (PSUMF \u00b6 7). Rivera \"loved\" the idea and agreed to provide the financial backing. (PSUMF \u00b6 8). On January 7, 2009, Rivera signed and filed the paperwork incorporating SPF. (PSUMF \u00b6 9). The Certificate of Incorporation for SPF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   identifies Rivera as the resident agent in charge of the office. (PSUMF \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 27, 2012, Rivera signed a corporate resolution as president and treasurer of SPF certifying that he was the owner and sole shareholder of the corporation \"for all intents of relevant and legal purposes.\" (PSUMF \u00b6 13). Rivera signed written proposals that were given to prospective clients of SPF. (PSUMF \u00b6 15). He was the only individual authorized to sign checks for SPF, and all employee paychecks bore his electronic signature. (PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). Rivera would sometimes help total the hours worked by employees when the payroll was done. (PSUMF \u00b6 19). He also invested additional money into SPF whenever the company was having cash flow issues and the company would later reimburse him. (PSUMF \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In 2012, Rivera met with Jose Andujar and Jose Torres and decided to retain a week's wages from employees to help with SPF's cash flow deficits. (PSUMF \u00b6 21). Some employees had to wait between a year and a year and a half before their money was returned. (Docket No. 56-16 at 36 \u00b6 11). SPF's wage retention policy continued until July 2014. (PSUMF \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division (\"WHD\") began investigating SPF in late June 2014. Wage and Hour Investigator Myrta Negron-Quiles (\"WHI Negron\") determined that SPF violated the overtime requirements of the FLSA during the period of April 29, 2013 through December 1, 2014 by failing to pay its security guard employees overtime wages. (PSUMF \u00b6 35). Rivera represented SPF at the meetings held with the WHD on July 1, August 12, September 15, 19 and December 5, 2014. (PSUMF \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Employee Pay Rates and Records\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SPF admits it erroneously misclassified its security guard employees as independent contractors. (PSUMF \u00b6 50). SPF set employees' regular hourly rates (\"straight time\") ranging from $7.25 to $8.00 per hour. (PSUMF \u00b6 38). SPF kept track of hours worked by the security guards on sign-in sheets that were located at all of the client posts where the employees worked. (PSUMF \u00b6 39). Each workday, employees signed in when their shifts started and signed out when they left for the day. (PSUMF \u00b6 40). Freddy De Jesus, Jonathan Andujar, or another supervisor would pick up the sheets and bring them back to the office. (PSUMF \u00b6 41). De Jesus, Andujar, or Rivera would then add the hours on the sheets, writing the totals on pieces of paper that were given to the SPF accountant, Jos\u00e9 Torres. (PSUMF \u00b6 42-43). Mr. Torres would then enter the total hours worked in that pay period into a payroll spreadsheet on the computer, which he used to generate paychecks for employees. (PSUMF \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The sign-in sheets and payroll spreadsheets are the only time and pay records the SPF have for their security guard employees. (PSUMF \u00b6 46). The payroll spreadsheets contained: (1) employees' names listed in a column titled \"Contratista O Empleado\"; (2) workweek dates; (3) hourly rates of pay (\"RPH\"); (4) total hours worked each semi-monthly or bi-weekly pay period listed in a column titled \"Horas\"; (5) gross wages paid (\"Gross\"); (6) various deductions taken listed in columns titled \"SS,\" \"Others,\" \"Rentencion Sem,\" \"Disc.\" and \"ITW 7%\"; and (7) net wages paid (\"Net\"). (PSUMF \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   From April 29, 2013 to July 14, 2014, SPF paid employees on a semi-monthly basis. (PSUMF \u00b6 47). Employees were paid twice a month, on the 15th and on the last day of each month.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During that time period, SPF's payroll spreadsheets indicated only the total number of hours\n   worked and the total wages paid for the fifteen-day pay period. (PSUMF \u00b6 48). SPF did not maintain records of certain employees' updated addresses. (PSUMF \u00b6 58). In certain workweeks, some employees employed as security guards worked between forty and sixty hours in a workweek but were compensated at their regular rate of pay regardless of the hours worked in excess of forty hours in a workweek. (PSUMF \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On July 1, 2014, WHI Negron informed SPF that it was required to pay employees time-and-a-half for time worked in excess of forty hours in one week; SPF, however, continued to pay employees their straight time rate for overtime hours worked through December 1, 2014. (PSUMF \u00b6 51). After WHI Negron advised SPF it would make it easier to calculate overtime, on July 15, 2014, SPF did begin to pay its employees on a bi-weekly basis rather than a semi-monthly basis. (PSUMF \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Wage Retention\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   SPF's security guards were required to wear uniforms. (PSUMF \u00b6 53). SPF deducted money from their wages to cover the cost of the uniforms to ensure that they were returned if employees quit or were fired. (PSUMF \u00b6 54). SPF would return the money deducted if the employees returned the uniforms at the end of their employment. (PSUMF \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   One week's worth of wages retained by SPF was entered on the payroll spreadsheets under the column titled \"Retencion Sem.\" (PSUMF \u00b6 52). Taking such deductions from employees' wages to pay for uniforms caused certain employees' hourly wages to fall below the required minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. (PSUMF \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Security Police Force Corp.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Licensed detective Eric Resto passed away in August 2014, and Rivera took on the responsibility of overseeing all administrative personnel. (PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). In order for SPF to continue operations as a security guard company in Puerto Rico, it needed a licensed detective as a principal officer. (PSUMF \u00b6 64; RSUMF \u00b6 64). SPF began to lose clients and could not continue to operate without a licensed detective, so Rivera informed clients that SPF would cease operations on February 28, 2015. (PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 27-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Rivera started a new company, Security Police Force Corp. (\"Security\"), because SPF was unable to find a licensed detective who was willing to join SPF as an officer in light of the WHD investigation. (PSUMF \u00b6 65; RSUMF \u00b6 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On December 22, 2014, Rivera signed a Certificate of Incorporation for Security. (PSUMF \u00b6 60; RSUMF \u00b6 60). Security was registered as a corporation by Puerto Rico on January 15, 2015. (PSUMF \u00b6 61; RSUMF \u00b6 61). The Certificate of Incorporation states that Security will \"provide security services to homes, commerce and industry to protect life and property.\" (PSUMF \u00b6 62; RSUMF \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Security's office is located in the same building as SPF's offices. (PSUMF \u00b6 66; RSUMF \u00b6 66). Rivera is the sole owner. (PSUMF \u00b6 63; RSUMF \u00b6 63). Jonathan Andujar, former general manager for SPF, has been working for Security since SPF ceased operations. (PSUMF \u00b6 67). Freddy De Jesus, former supervisor for SPF, is the president of Security. (PSUMF \u00b6 68). Jos\u00e9 Torres, former accountant for SPF, is the treasurer of security. (PSUMF \u00b6 69). A number of SPF's employees went to work for Security after SPF ceased operations. (PSUMF \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

If the employee was paid at minimum wage, that is to say, $7.25 an hour, then any deduction would cause a drop below the minimum requirement and must be refunded. If the employee was paid over minimum wage, it is necessary to determine how many hours that employee worked in the workweek when the deduction occurred (using the system outlined above), multiply those hours by the employee's wage, subtract the uniform deduction, and then divide the result by the hours worked. That number is then subtracted from the minimum wage of $7.25 and multiplied by the hours worked. The result is the amount owed to the employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For example, assume an employee makes $9 an hour, worked 25 hours in the week in question, and had $50 deducted from that week's wages for a uniform. The calculation would look like this: $9 (the rate per hour) x 25 (hours worked) = $225. $225 (week's wages) - $50 (uniform deduction) = $175 (total paid). $175 (total paid) / 25 (hours worked) = $7 (rate per hour).

(Docket No. 115 \u00b6 91). In that case, the Court had fourteen letters and memoranda from the attorney advising the company to act in a particular way on which to base a finding of good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

No such evidence exists here. SPF's bare-bones contention that it \"relied\" on members of its staff to inform it about the FLSA, without more, is insufficient. (Docket No. 115 \u00b6 84). SPF \"alleges that [it] exercised good faith,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93), but presents absolutely no evidence to prove such a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   SPF has not \" 'show[n] to the satisfaction of the court' that it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for believing that its acts did not violate the FLSA,\" indeed, quite the opposite.\n   <em>\n    Chao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511058\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/26/#p33\">\n    493 F.3d at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20260\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In particular, the Court finds it salient that SPF continued to violate the overtime provisions of FLSA by paying straight time when an employee worked more than forty hours in one week, even after it was explicitly instructed to pay its employees overtime by WHI Negron. (PSUMF \u00b6 51; Docket No. 57 \u00b6 23). This indicates that SPF was aware that it was required by the FLSA to pay employee overtime and yet knowingly and willfully declined to do so. As \"it is the\n   <em>\n    employer's\n   </em>\n   burden to show good faith and objective reasonableness,\" and as SPF has not done so here, the Court, in its discretion, awards liquidated damages to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Chao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511058\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/26/#p33\">\n    493 F.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20260\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Injunction\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks a prospective injunction.

When deciding whether a prospective injunction is appropriate, the Court considers the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (1) the employer's prior and present conduct; (2) any pattern of repetitive violations; (3) an employer's intent to violate the FLSA; (4) the employer's good faith attempt to comply with the FLSA; (5) whether the employer complied once it became aware of the FLSA's requirements; (6) efforts to prevent recurrence; (7) the threat of violations in the future; and (8) absence of bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    Herman v.

While true that many of its managing members were involved in SPF, the Court will not enjoin a completely separate company against violations of which there is no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   To the extent that SPF may operate in the future, however, the Court finds that all the factors enumerated above weigh in favor of an injunction. SPF does not have any present conduct, but its prior conduct involved continued violation the FLSA, despite WHI Negron's explicit warning that it was not in compliance and her instructions to make changes to prevent further violations. The violations were ongoing from April 29, 2013 through December 1, 2014, just before SPF ceased operations. Particularly troubling are the violations between the time that WHI Negron informed SPF that it were noncompliant-July 1, 2014-and December 1, 2014. SPF's continued violation in the face of its knowledge that it was not in compliance indicate willfulness and bad faith. While true that SPF partially corrected the issue by changing from a semi-monthly to bi-weekly pay schedule, it continued to violate the FLSA overtime wage provisions. There is no indication that, had SPF continued to operate, it would have made a more serious effort to prevent a reoccurrence. Given SPF's blatant disregard of WHI Negron's advice, the threat violations in the future is high. Should SPF begin operations again, is hereby enjoined from future FLSA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment at Docket No. 55 is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's claims against Rivera,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's overtime and minimum wage claims against SPF, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's record keeping violations claims against SPF.
