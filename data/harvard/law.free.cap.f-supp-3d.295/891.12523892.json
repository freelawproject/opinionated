Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, 17, 29; Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, 17, 29. After arriving at the facility, Puhr called the PQ office to gain entry and proceeded through the gate. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30; Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30; Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6 22. Puhr backed his truck into the area designated for unloading caustic substances, which sloped downward. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 29. Because he noticed \"snow and so forth\" at the bottom of the slope, Puhr parked the truck higher up the slope than he ordinarily did. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Puhr donned his Univar-provided personal protective equipment (\"PPE\"), which did not include protective rubber boots. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30; Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30; Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 40-2. After a PQ employee reviewed his paperwork and tested a sample of the sodium hydroxide, Puhr connected his truck to PQ's intake valve with a hose. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30; Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30; Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. Having observed that the air necessary to push the sodium hydroxide through the line was not flowing, Puhr restarted the air compressor on his truck, opened and closed several valves, and, with area temperatures ranging from ten degrees Fahrenheit to as low as negative one, attempted to heat the line with a handheld propane torch. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30-31; Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30-31. Puhr's efforts to heat the line resulted in a slight crack to one of the valves, causing a small amount of sodium hydroxide to leak out. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 32; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 32. Puhr ultimately determined that he could not troubleshoot the air-flow problem himself, and called Univar's dispatcher for help. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 34; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 34. The dispatcher advised Puhr to return to Univar without completing the delivery. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point during his troubleshooting the line, while near the back of the truck, Puhr noticed that he was standing in several inches of liquid or \"slush.\" Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6 31. By the time Puhr called the Univar dispatcher, he felt burning in his left foot. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 35; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 35. The sensation worsened as Puhr disconnected and stored his equipment. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 37; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 37. Puhr ultimately suffered chemical burns on the tops of his feet attributable to walking through caustic liquid without protective rubber boots. Doc. 34-1 at \u00b6 40; Doc. 39 at \u00b6 40; Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; Doc. 40-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties agree that Illinois law governs this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski v.

Puhr's attempt to establish liability under this theory founders on the second requirement, as the summary judgment record would not permit a reasonable juror to find that it was more likely than not that PQ-as opposed to, say, either Puhr himself or a recent delivery from a non-party-created the accumulation of caustic liquid that injured him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Puhr contends that Tom Skala-the PQ employee who, on the day in question, was responsible for processing Puhr's paperwork, testing the sodium hydroxide sample, and unlocking PQ's intake valve, Doc. 39-1 at \u00b6 25-\"was never actually informed ... of PQ company policy to remove all standing water and material in the unloading area.\" Doc. 37 at 11.

But the fact that a PQ employee failed to clean up the spill in violation of PQ's policies does not make it more probable than not that a PQ employee was responsible for causing the spill in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138672\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1035/#p1038\">\n    842 F.3d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that because the plaintiff did not \"see the rocks [that injured her] fall, and neither she nor anyone else to whom she points knew how the rocks at issue ended up where they did,\" she could only speculate that an employee of the defendant \"could have caused the rocks to spill\");\n   <em>\n    Zuppardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266466\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/644/#p649\">\n    770 F.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Zuppardi does not come close to setting forth sufficient evidence, either direct or circumstantial, to create an inference that Wal-Mart caused the spill.

Puhr contends that Skala was \"physically inside the unloading area\" on the day in question. Doc. 37 at 8. But Puhr does not point to any evidence in the record that Skala actually knew about the spill. Rather, Puhr contends only that \"\n   <em>\n    it can reasonably be inferred\n   </em>\n   the 'snow and so forth' \" he described \"was equally visible to Skala considering [Skala] entered the unloading area near the back of Puhr's truck to unlock the valve.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825543\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/119/#p123\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

According to Seventh Circuit precedent, \"[c]onstructive\n   notice can be established in Illinois [1] by presenting evidence that the dangerous condition was present for a sufficient length of time such that in the exercise of ordinary care its presence should have been discovered, or [2] by showing that the dangerous condition was part of a pattern of conduct or a recurring incident.\"\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138672\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1035/#p1038\">\n    842 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1040 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zuppardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266466\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/644/#p649\">\n    770 F.3d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Culli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825543\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/119/#p123\">\n    862 F.2d at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same, citing Illinois cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As for the first method of proving constructive notice, there is no evidence that would permit a reasonable juror to determine how long the particular dangerous condition that injured Puhr existed before the injury.

Puhr points to testimony that it was PQ's \"policy to not allow any unloading to take place unless the caustic unloading dike was free of standing water ... and the [Univar] driver was wearing the appropriate PQ required PPE.\" Doc. 37 at 9 (alteration in original). But Puhr does not identify anything in the record that would suggest that PQ employees violated this policy at any time other than on the day in question. In fact, Puhr concedes that Gary Edmon, who was usually responsible for handling sodium hydroxide deliveries, and Stanley Slusser, the plant manager, testified that they were aware of company policy to clean the unloading area of caustic liquids.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825543\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/119/#p123\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Edmon even testified that he would have cleaned out the unloading area prior to Puhr's delivery had he been on site that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Moreover, Puhr acknowledges that Skala testified that the area \"usually has water in it and requires someone to go down and pump it out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Consequently, as in\n   <em>\n    Piotrowski\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence here of any other incident, let alone a pattern of other incidents, of the type even remotely resembling the incident that injured Puhr.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138672\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1035/#p1038\">\n    842 F.3d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (in holding that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment, explaining that there was \"no evidence of any other incident involving rocks in the parking lot\" or \"any evidence of recurring escape of river rock from the planter onto the parking lot pavement or of any prior complaint of loose rock in the parking lot\"). Likewise, in light of the evidence of PQ's consistent adherence to its cleanup policy, there is no evidence that spills of caustic liquids or other dangerous conditions were \"not attended to within a reasonable period of time,\" and thus no evidence that PQ's policy of monitoring the unloading area and frequently cleaning it prior to subsequent deliveries was inadequate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138672\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1035/#p1038\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasizing that the defendant had in place \"policies and procedures [that] required Menard employees to monitor the parking lot and to be on the lookout for unsafe conditions\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Culli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825543\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/119/#p123\">\n    862 F.2d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that evidence of the timing and frequency of spills \"made it unreasonable for the defendants to sweep the lot only at night and operate for most of the day with only one attendant who was primarily confined to the cash register\"). It follows that Puhr cannot prevail under the second method for demonstrating constructive notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The opinions of Puhr's retained expert-Dr. Edward Funk-do not lead to the opposite result. As to the first method of proving constructive notice, Dr. Funk does not opine that the record evidence sheds any light on how long the spill existed prior to Puhr's coming into contact with the sodium hydroxide that injured him. Doc. 34-11 at 12-13. As to the second method, although Dr. Funk opines that PQ employees on the day in question did not enforce PQ's rules regarding cleaning the unloading area before delivery and ensuring that delivery drivers wore chemical-resistant rubber boots, he does not opine that PQ's policies were unreasonable ones, nor does he suggest that the evidence shows a\n   <em>\n    pattern\n   </em>\n   of \"system failure,\" as opposed to a one-off incident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825543\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/119/#p123\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court acknowledges that Puhr advances a different version of the second method for proving constructive notice, one recently articulated in\n   <em>\n    Racky v.
