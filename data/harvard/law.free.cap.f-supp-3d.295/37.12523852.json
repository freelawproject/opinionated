KAMs sell medical product devices to distributors and dealers and manage those contractual relationships. They are paid commissions based on the percentage of growth of each account in their portfolio, and these \"[c]ommissions are a key component of a KAM's compensation package, [and] in some cases amount to half (or more) of a KAM's annual compensation.\" Docket # 285 \u00b6 52. \"If a KAM hits 100% of the quota for his or her portfolio, he or she will earn the 'target incentive' in commissions for that fiscal year ....\" Docket # 282 \u00b6 9. If a KAM exceeds 100% of the quota, she will receive a larger percentage of the target incentive. Lestage exceeded 100% of the quota in both FY 12/13 and FY 13/14, mainly due to her principal account, Byram Healthcare, Inc., one of the named defendants in the underlying qui tam action.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      In August 2014, the docket in this case was unsealed and on November 20, 2014, the Amended Complaint publicly filed. At that time plaintiff's identity as a relator was revealed. In the Amended Complaint, relators alleged that defendants, including Coloplast and Byram, engaged in an illegal kickback scheme regarding the sale of ostomy and/or continence care products reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid, and defrauded the federal government.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      On December 18, 2014, Byram's CEO sent a letter to Edmond Veome, Coloplast's president, requesting that Coloplast \"provide Byram Healthcare with a different account representative\" and stating that it \"no longer wish[ed] to work with Amy Lestage regarding [their] business together.\" Docket # 274-10 at 2. Byram directed Coloplast to its legal counsel regarding any questions it may have on the matter.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      On December 23, 2014, Coloplast informed Lestage by letter that it was placing her \"on an indefinite, paid administrative leave ... while [it] investigated [Byram's demand to remove her from its account].\" Docket # 283-10 at 2. The parties dispute whether Coloplast knew at that point that Lestage was a relator in the\n      <em>\n       qui\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       tam\n      </em>\n      action. They also disagree whether to characterize this event as a \"suspension\" or a \"paid administrative leave.\"\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      Whether termed a \"suspension\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      or \"paid administrative leave,\" it is undisputed that plaintiff was required to \"immediately cease performing any services on behalf of Coloplast.\" Docket # 283-10 at 2.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      Coloplast told plaintiff that \"while on leave, [her] salary will be paid on the regular, biweekly process and [her] commission will be paid out according to the monthly process. For any month where [she is] on paid administrative leave, Coloplast will guarantee a minimum commission payment of 100% of the eligible [target incentive] for that month ($6,666.67). [She] also remain[s] fully eligible for any benefits [she had] enrolled in.\" Docket # 283-11 at 2. Indeed, \"[f]or FY14/15 and FY15/16, Coloplast paid Plaintiff $80,000 in commission while on leave whereas the average KAM commission was less than $68,000 during this same period.\" Docket # 282 \u00b6 43. She also continued to use the company-issued vehicle and fuel card, accrue paid time off, receive contributions to her 401(k), maintain health, disability, and life insurance benefits, and she received a raise. She was, however, prohibited from \"performing any services on behalf of Coloplast\" or \"hav[ing] any contact with Coloplast customers or employees relating to [her] accounts ... or any Coloplast business.\" Docket # 283-11 at 2. On May 6, 2015, relators moved to file a Second Amended Complaint, in part to add Lestage's retaliation claim against Coloplast.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      Although Coloplast allowed Lestage to return to work on January 25, 2016, she had delivered a baby in November 2015 and elected to take twelve weeks of maternity leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") beginning in January 2016. On April 12, 2016, following the end of her FMLA leave, she resumed working and was allowed to accrue immediately four days of paid time off to take a vacation.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      Prior to her leave, plaintiff's portfolio of accounts included Byram, ABC Home Medical, Home Care Delivered, Buffalo Hospital Supply, Inc., and Claflin Medical Equipment Co. Upon her return in April 2016, she was taken off the Byram and ABC accounts. She did maintain the Home Care Delivered, Buffalo Hospital Supply, and Claflin accounts, and was also assigned four new accounts: AmeriSource Bergen, Blackburns Physician's Pharmacy, Concordance Healthcare Solutions, and Geriatric Medical. The parties dispute the growth potential of these four new accounts. It is undisputed, however, that plaintiff, through her counsel, wrote to Coloplast on December 28, 2015 that \"given her status as a relator against her key accounts, it would be impossible for Ms. Lestage to return to an account position where she would be handling clients, like Byram and Liberator, that she had handled prior to the qui tam action.\" Docket # 282 \u00b6 30.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      On June 20, 2016, Coloplast answered the Amended Complaint and asserted counterclaims against Lestage for breach of contract and breach of duty of loyalty. The counterclaims allege that, between 2010 and 2013, Lestage sent eleven emails outside the company; that the emails contained confidential Coloplast information; that her \"Employment Agreement prohibited Lestage from disclosing confidential information other than for the sole purpose of performing her employment duties\" and required her to \"take all reasonable\n     precautions to prevent the inadvertent disclosure\" of confidential information; and that, \"on information and belief, Lestage has shared the information forwarded to non-Coloplast email addresses with individuals outside of Coloplast.\" Docket # 144 at 56. Coloplast says it discovered the alleged violations inadvertently while conducting \"its investigation and responding to inquiries from the government in this lawsuit.\" Docket # 284 at 5.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      <strong>\n       II.

It emphasizes that a KAM's commissions are tied to account growth, not size, and it points to evidence that the new accounts have in fact shown growth for the 2016-17 year while part of her portfolio. It also argues that Byram and ABC were not returned to Lestage because those companies did not want to work with her. Lestage contends that there are material disputes of fact regarding whether or not Byram wanted to work with her. She also responds that the new accounts have significantly smaller growth prospects, and therefore smaller earning potential, as compared to Byram and ABC, and she disputes Coloplast's evidence regarding the new accounts' growth.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      First, the record is clear that Coloplast's decision to remove Lestage from the Byram and ABC accounts was not materially adverse. It is undisputed that Coloplast did not return ABC to Lestage due to the client's preference not to work with her and because ABC was undergoing an acquisition that would result in a new KAM located on the west coast. Moreover, as to Byram, plaintiff's counsel specifically informed Coloplost prior to her return that \"it would be impossible for [her] to return to an account position where she would be handling clients, like Byram and Liberator, that she had handled prior to the qui tam action. And [she] would not be comfortable returning to work alongside colleagues that she implicated in the qui tam complaint.\" Docket # 282 \u00b6 30.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-40\">\n      However, whether the assignment of new accounts was materially adverse is properly a question for the jury. Plaintiff has proffered evidence, albeit in the form of her own deposition testimony, contradicting Coloplast's account growth statistics. She states that the \"new accounts are far smaller in terms of revenue, do not fit the company profile, and have little growth potential\"; that \"she went from being the number one ranked KAM in 2014 to being the last ranked KAM today, in terms of performance\"; and that as a result of her new, low-growth accounts \"she will perform at 80-85% of her objective, leaving her with little to no commission dollars for her new accounts.\" Docket # 288 (citing Docket # 283-2).

Administrative Leave\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-49\">\n      As evidence of pretext, Lestage points to the close temporal proximity between Coloplast's knowledge of her status as a relator and her being placed on leave and she highlights evidence casting doubt on Coloplast's proffered justifications.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-50\">\n      Coloplast's president testified that the company decided Lestage should return to work in January 2016 because \"at that time the [whistleblower] case had been through the majority of its machinations and was moving toward resolution and there was an expectation that now was the time to bring [her] back to work because there was no longer going to be the pending investigation. There was an outcome that was being delivered and so it would be okay for her to return.\" Docket # 285 \u00b6 123. When asked whether Coloplast's settlement with the government and relators impacted Coloplast's decision to have Ms. Lestage return, Mr. Verome testified: \"Ultimately, yes, but previous to that I think we had had conversations that we were nearing a conclusion of the case and so there was an expectation that we could work towards bringing her back to the organization.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 125. A jury could find this evidence suggests that the leave was due to plaintiff's role in the\n      <em>\n       qui\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       tam\n      </em>\n      action, and not because Coloplast was conducting an investigation into Byram's stated objections to communicating with her. This evidence, especially when combined with the undisputed fact that Lestage was placed on leave close in time to Coloplast discovering she was a relator, raises triable issues as to whether Coloplast's proffered justification for the leave was \"a pretext calculated to mask retaliation.\"\n      <em>\n       Harrington\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718898\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/25/#p31\">\n       668 F.3d at 31\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-52\">\n      There is also sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Coloplast's proffered justification for assigning her new accounts was pretext for retaliation. While Coloplast contends the accounts were given because they had growth potential sufficient to replace her old accounts, Lestage counters that the \"new accounts are far smaller in terms of revenue, do not fit the company profile, and have little growth potential.\" Docket # 288. As an experienced Coloplast KAM, Lestage offers sworn testimony that two of the accounts are \"maintenance\" accounts with very little growth potential and one is a \"house\" account not previously serviced by a KAM. Docket # 283-3 at 4-5.\n      <footnotemark>\n       8\n      </footnotemark>\n      As above, this testimony is not mere allegation but rather speaks to facts within Lestage's knowledge that, if proven, could affect the outcome of the trial.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Velazquez-Garcia\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2539806\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/11/#p18\">\n       473 F.3d at 18\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .
