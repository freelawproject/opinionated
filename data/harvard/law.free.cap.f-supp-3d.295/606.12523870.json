(\"BST\"). BST opposes enforcement on multiple grounds including the underlying church tax inquiry (\"Inquiry\") and, by extension, church tax examination (\"Examination\"), were not properly initiated under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 7611\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary of Argument.\n   </strong>\n   BST's argument focuses on whether the IRS satisfied Section 7611 's requirement that an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official reasonably believes (on the basis of facts and circumstances recorded in writing)\" that one of several prerequisites exists before initiating an Inquiry (\" Section 7611 Determination\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). BST contends this requirement was not satisfied because the official who signed the Inquiry Notice, the Director, Exempt Organizations (\"DEO\"), holds too low a rank to qualify as an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7) (defining \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" as \"the Secretary of the Treasury or any delegate of the Secretary whose rank is no lower than that of a principal Internal Revenue officer for an internal revenue region.\"). BST also argues the Government may not rely on any participation in the Section 7611 Determination by the Commissioner, Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division (\"TE/GE Commissioner\") to cure this deficiency for two reasons: (1) the IRS did not disclose the TE/GE Commissioner's participation prior to filing the Petition; and (2) the TE/GE Commissioner holds too low a rank to qualify as an appropriate high-level Treasury official. Addressing a related issue raised by the court, BST argues authority to make the Section 7611 Determination was never properly delegated to either official even if one or both hold sufficient rank to satisfy Section 7611(h)(7). The Government, in contrast, argues authority to make the Section 7611 Determination was delegated to both the DEO and TE/GE Commissioner, both hold sufficient rank, and both made the Determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary of Ruling.\n   </strong>\n   Having fully considered the parties' arguments on these issues, the court holds as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) authority to make the Section 7611 Determination was delegated to the TE/GE Commissioner by Delegation Order 193 (Nov. 8, 2000) and such delegation was permitted by Section 7611(h)(7) (\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Discussion \u00a7 II);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) any purported redelegation of authority to make the Section 7611 Determination to the DEO was neither allowed by Delegation Order 193 nor effective because the DEO holds too low a rank to qualify as an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" (\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Discussion \u00a7 III); and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (3) there has not been substantial compliance with the notice requirements of subsections (a) or (b) of Section 7611, requiring this matter be stayed pursuant to Section 7611(e) until all practicable steps to correct the noncompliance have been taken (\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Discussion \u00a7 IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

BST notes the absence of support for any claim either the DEO or TE/GE Commissioner took the steps required to make the Section 7611 Determination.

This interpretation is reflected in IRM 4.76.7.4, which requires an Inquiry Notice include a \"Statement of Administrative and Constitutional Rights.\" IRM 4.76.7.4 (\"IRM 4.76 Statement of Rights\").

This IRM Section supersedes IRM 4.76.7 (discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Discussion \u00a7 I.A.4).

This was despite BST's repeated challenges to the DEO's authority to make the Section 7611 Determination.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Background \u00a7 II.A (summarizing communications filed as ECF Nos. 10-8 through 10-14). The IRS responded to these challenges either by arguing the DEO was the proper official or insisting on compliance without addressing the issue of the DEO's authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Most notably, in a letter dated August 4, 2016, the Mid-Atlantic Area Manager for Exempt Organizations Examinations responded to a letter from BST's CPA, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   In response to the Notice of Church Tax Inquiry Letter, your Power of Attorney, Donald E. Guinn, CPA, provided a letter which states, in part, that you will provide no further responses to the inquiry letter until it is clear who has authority to sign Notice of Church Tax Inquiry Letters. Mr. Guinn based this position on the court case\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     U.S, v. Living Word Christian Center.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   In response to Mr. Guinn's letter, it is necessary to elaborate on the court case that Mr. Guinn references. The ruling in that case was that the [DEOE] was not an appropriate high-level Treasury official for the purpose of making the required reasonable belief determination that an examination of a church's records can occur. The presiding judge determined that an official four levels removed from the Commissioner was insufficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   In the instant case, the Notice of Church Tax Inquiry Letter issued to your organization was signed by the [DEO]. The [DEO] is a high-level Treasury official that is one level up from the [DEOE], and is three levels below the Commissioner of the IRS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   As a point of reference, each case that involves a church, or a case where an organization asserts that they may be a church, is subject to many layers of review to ensure that section 7611 of the IRC is applied consistently and fairly. This process provides a sufficient review as required under section 7611 of the Code and allows for a fair and consistent determination of a reasonable belief to proceed with an inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   ECF No. 10-9. While this letter refers to \"many layers of review,\" it does not expressly claim participation by any official\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   the DEO and expressly argues the DEO serves at a sufficiently high level to satisfy Section 7611. No other written IRS communication expressly addresses these points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    Litigation Position (Petition).\n   </strong>\n   The Government first disclosed\n   <em>\n    any involvement\n   </em>\n   by the TE/GE Commissioner in its Petition. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 28. 29. This document alleges the TE/GE Commissioner \"signed\" the Approvals Cover Sheet and states \"approval of the notice of church tax inquiry of BST by [the DEO], acting with the concurrence of the TE/GE Commissioner, satisfies the reasonable belief requirement of [ Section 7611 ].\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29. This statement, for the first time, suggests reliance on IRM 25.5.8 's hybrid identification of the DEO \"who acts in concurrence with the TE/GE Commissioner\" as the \"designated official,\" though the language in the Petition varies from that in the IRM. It may also imply, though it does not expressly claim, the TE/GE Commissioner \"concurred\" with the determination by the DEO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    Litigation Position (Reply).\n   </strong>\n   Through its Reply, the Government advances a\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   position the DEO had authority to make the Section 7611 Determination and an\n   <em>\n    alternative\n   </em>\n   position the TE/GE Commissioner had authority to do so. Both arguments focus on whether these officials have sufficient rank. The Government offers evidentiary support in the form of Declarations of both the DEO and TE/GE Commissioner. ECF No. 15-1, 15-2. Each avers she reviewed specific materials, made a Section 7611 Determination, and evidenced that determination by signing the Approvals Cover Sheet. Neither the Declarations nor the Reply memorandum characterize the actions as a concurrence or mention any IRM provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Thus, while paragraph 29 of the Petition suggests possible reliance on the hybrid designation of the DEO \"who acts with the concurrence of the TE/GE Commissioner[,]\" the Government does not advance this position in its Reply in support of the Petition. Neither does it, in any memorandum, address the import of the concurrence requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    Litigation Position (Supplemental Briefing).\n   </strong>\n   After BST's Sur-Reply and the court's own legal research revealed the relatively recent hybrid \"Designated Official\" language in IRM 25.5.8 and IRM 4.75.39 and arguably conflicting designation language in IRM 4.76.7 (\"in effect\" until superseded by IRM 4.75.39 ), the court directed the parties to file supplemental memoranda addressing the threshold question whether and how delegation of authority was made to the DEO, the TE/GE Commissioner, or both. In its responsive memorandum, the Government argues authority was delegated to the TE/GE Commissioner by Delegation Order 193 and redelegated to the DEO through her job description and IRM description of the Exempt Organizations function. ECF No. 21. The Government cites IRM 25.5.8.3.2 on the last page of its responsive brief, describing it as \"an\n   <em>\n    additional delegation\n   </em>\n   of authority to the [DEO].\" ' ECF No. 21 at 7 (emphasis added) (characterizing IRM 25.5.8.3.2 as \"provid[ing] the [DEO]\n   <em>\n    acting with the concurrence of\n   </em>\n   the [TE/GE Commissioner],\" has authority to make the Section 7611 Determination and sign the Examination Notice (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Earlier in its memorandum, the Government appears to rely on IRM 25.5.8.3.2 as setting the required procedure by asserting \"[t]he IRS followed procedures set out in the Internal Revenue Manual which provide that the [DEO], makes the reasonable-belief determination with the concurrence of the [TE/GE Commissioner].\n   <em>\n    In accordance with these procedures, both officials made a reasonable-belief determination.\n   </em>\n   \" ECF No. 21 at 2 (emphasis added). This suggests that, at the time the BST Determination was made, the IRS understood the delegated authority to be set by or at least require compliance with IRM 25.5.8.3.2 and construed the concurrence language in that section to require that each listed official make her own Section 7611 Determination. The DEO's and TE/GE Commissioner's Declarations indicate actions consistent with this interpretation, though neither refers to the IRM provision or any concurrence requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Delegation to the TE/GE Commissioner\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Whether the TE/GE Commissioner had authority to make the Section 7611 Determination as to BST raises two subordinate questions: (1) whether a delegation (or attempted delegation) occurred; and (2) whether any such delegation is permissible under Section 7611(h)(7). The court answers both questions in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Source of Delegation to TE/GE Commissioner\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   For reasons addressed below, the court finds Delegation Order 193 is reasonably interpreted to make two distinct delegations of authority to the TE/GE Commissioner (through \u00b6\u00b6 (4)-(6) and (7)-(9)). Both of these delegations include authority to make the Section 7611 Determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    Breadth of Delegation Order 193.\n   </strong>\n   Delegation Order 193 is both extremely broad and, consequently, non-specific. This might, at first blush, appear to run afoul of the IRS's own guidance on delegation of authority because the breadth and lack of specificity require, at the least, consultation of additional sources to determine which duties are delegated to which officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IRM 1.11.4.3 (1) (October 10, 2008) (requiring delegations be in writing and\n   <em>\n    clearly express the intent of the delegating official\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)). It is, nonetheless, clear given the impetus for Delegation Order 193 (implementation of the IRS Reform Act) that it is intended to delegate essentially all authority held by officials listed in paragraphs (4) and (7) (including authority to make the Section 7611 Determination) to one or more officials listed in paragraphs (5) and (8). Moreover, while determining\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   official is the intended target of a specific delegation\n   of authority is no easy task, it can presumably be accomplished by examining sources defining \"the respective activities or functions administered\" by the officials listed in paragraph (5) and \"matters under [the] jurisdiction or cases under [the] responsibility of\" officials listed in paragraph (8). Any statutory limitations on delegation such as those found in Section 7611 would be considered in this process. Consideration of statutory limitations is particularly appropriate as to delegations under paragraphs (7)-(9) as paragraph (7) allows for delegation \"except where prohibited by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    Delegation of IRS Commissioner's Authority-Paragraphs (4)-(6).\n   </strong>\n   Paragraph (4) delegates \"functions the [IRS] Commissioner is authorized to perform.\" Delegation Order 193 \u00b6 (4) (quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Discussion \u00a7 I.A.3). In 1982, the Secretary of the Treasury delegated authority over all matters arising under the Internal Revenue Code to the IRS Commissioner. Treasury Order 150-10 (April 22, 1982) (filed as ECF No. 21-1). It is undisputed this delegation includes authority to make the Section 7611 Determination. Thus, authority to make the Section 7611 Determination is within the authority covered by paragraph (4) and delegated by paragraph (5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The delegates listed in paragraph (5) include but are not limited to \"Division Commissioners.\" It is undisputed the TE/GE Commissioner is a Division Commissioner. It is also evident that audit or oversight of church tax matters and the steps necessary to institute an Inquiry and Examination \"concern the respective activities or functions administered\" by the TE/GE Commissioner. Thus, paragraphs (4) and (5) of Delegation Order 193 are reasonably interpreted to delegate authority to make the Section 7611 Determination to the TE/GE Commissioner (subject to any legal limitation that might be imposed by Section 7611(h)(7) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    Delegation of Regional Commissioner's Authority-Paragraphs (7)-(9).\n   </strong>\n   Paragraph (7) delegates authority to take actions previously delegated to four categories of official (including Regional Commissioners) by three sources (including Treasury Regulations) for matters under the jurisdiction or cases under the responsibility of the four categories of officials listed in paragraph (8). This delegation is subject to certain limitations including \"where prohibited by law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 (7). The delegates in paragraph (8) include Division Commissioners and, consequently, include the TE/GE Commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Because Treasury Regulations delegated authority to make the Section 7611 Determination to Regional Commissioners, this authority is within the authority delegated by paragraph (7).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I.A.2 (Initial Regulation). Because audit and examination of churches is a matter under the jurisdiction or a case under the responsibility of the TE/GE Commissioner, it is reasonable to conclude the TE/GE Commissioner is the official to whom authority to make the Section 7611 Determination was delegated by paragraph (8), subject to any legal prohibition that might be imposed by Section 7611(h)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Effectiveness of Delegation to the TE/GE Commissioner\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As explained above, two subparts of Delegation Order 193 are reasonably interpreted to delegate authority to make the Section 7611 Determination to the TE/GE Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Discussion \u00a7 II.A. Such delegation is\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   only if the TE/GE Commissioner satisfies Section 7611(h)(7) 's definition of an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" as \"the Secretary of the Treasury or any delegate of the Secretary whose rank is no lower than that\n   of a principal Internal Revenue officer for an internal revenue region.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It is undisputed Section 7611(h)(7) 's reference to \"a principal Internal Revenue officer for an internal revenue region\" describes the now-abolished position of Regional Commissioner. Thus, whether delegation of authority to make the Section 7611 Determination to the TE/GE Commissioner is effective turns on whether the TE/GE Commissioner holds a rank equal to or higher than that of a former Regional Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15 at 6 (Government Reply characterizing issue as \"quite simply[,] ... in the current organizational structure of the IRS, who holds a 'rank ... no lower' than a regional commissioner held in the old structure\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    BST's Argument.\n   </strong>\n   BST argues the TE/GE Commissioner does not hold a rank comparable to that of a Regional Commissioner for two reasons. First, according to BST, Regional Commissioners stood one step closer to the IRS Commissioner in the chain-of-authority than does the TE/GE Commissioner. ECF No. 10 at 20 (citing Owens' First Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 17 (\"Regional Commissioners were one rank below the IRS Commissioner and reported directly to the IRS Commissioner\" while \"[t]he TE/GE Commissioner is two steps removed from the Commissioner of the IRS, reporting to the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement\")). Second, the positions themselves are not comparable because Regional Commissioners were responsible for all categories of taxpayer and all aspects of administration (within their geographic region), while the TE/GE Commissioner is responsible only for tax administration for specified categories of taxpayer. ECF No. 10 at 20-21 (citing Owens' First Decl. \u00b6 17). BST argues the TE/GE Commissioner's narrower responsibilities prevent her from having the broad view necessary to satisfy Section 7611(h)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    Government's Argument.\n   </strong>\n   The Government argues the focus should not be on counting steps but on the \"role and responsibilities\" of the officials \"in light of the expanded and more complex mission of the IRS in [the] present day as opposed to 1984\" when CAPA was adopted. ECF No. 15 at 7. The Government's argument as to the role and responsibilities of the TE/GE Commissioner builds on its corresponding \"primary\" argument the DEO (an official one step below the TE/GE Commissioner) holds \"a rank most similar to the regional commissioners in the pre-1998 structure.\" The Government explains this position as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The appropriate criteria for [determining which official satisfies Section 7611(h)(7),] are the official's expertise in and scope of authority\n   <em>\n    over tax-exempt organizations.\n   </em>\n   As described below, the [DEO], is the highest ranking Treasury official in the country\n   <em>\n    focused exclusively on exempt organizations\n   </em>\n   and occupies a position with responsibilities most similar to the former regional commissioners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   ECF No. 15 at 7, 8 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (arguing an analysis based on steps from the IRS Commissioner \"is absurd and impractical because of the comprehensive organizational changes implemented pursuant to the 1998 law and the\n   inherent complexity of managing a large organization.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Even if step-counting is accepted as the proper framework, the Government argues BST has not established Regional Commissioners were only one step removed from the IRS Commissioner in the chain-of-authority because the Declaration and organizational charts on which BST relies (1) do not address the IRS's organizational structure in 1984 when CAPA was adopted, and (2) are ambiguous as to the period that is covered (immediately prior to reorganization) because the relevant chart (ECF No. 10-16 at 10) includes two Deputy Commissioners inside the Commissioner box without explaining the impact of those Deputy Commissioners on the chain-of-authority. While the Government does not present evidence of the IRS's structure in 1984, it does present evidence from the 1998 legislative hearings on IRS restructuring that suggests there were, at least in practice, more steps between the Regional Commissioners and the IRS Commissioner than claimed by BST. ECF No. 15 at 10 (citing testimony from restructuring hearing that Regional Commissioners reported to the IRS Commissioner indirectly, through multiple layers of other officials).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Specifically as to the sufficiency of the TE/GE Commissioner's rank and responsibilities, the Government asserts the TE/GE Commissioner (1) \"supervises a national division whose customers include churches and other tax-exempt organizations\"; (2) oversees \"approximately 1,500 employees\"; (3) supervises the DEO; and (4) reports to the IRS Commissioner through the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement.

ECF No. 19-1 at 5. This chart indicates two relevant lines of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The line that includes Regional Commissioners runs from a box containing the IRS Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner directly to Regional Commissioners (of which there were seven). Below the Regional Commissioners are District Directors (of which there were 63) and Service Centers (of which there were 10). Below the District Directors are six divisions, each described by its function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two of the divisions are titled \"Examination\" and \"Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations.\" The Regional Commissioners and their subordinates are described as \"Field Offices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion.\n   </strong>\n   For reasons explained below, the court concludes the positions of TE/GE Commissioner and former Regional Commissioner are comparable (before and after IRS reorganization) in terms of\n   <em>\n    rank.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the TE/GE Commissioner holds a rank comparable to that of the official described in Section 7611(h)(7) as the lowest-ranking official to whom authority to make the Section 7611 Determination could be delegated. While the responsibilities of the TE/GE Commissioner are not the same as those of a Regional Commissioner, the scope of the TE/GE Commissioner's responsibilities are sufficiently broad to serve the purpose intended by Section 7611(h)(7) 's definition of appropriate high-level Treasury official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    Comparability between four geographic regions and four taxpayer-type divisions.\n   </strong>\n   The most persuasive evidence of comparable rank is found in the level of responsibility of the two positions based on the structure of the IRS before and after reorganization. As noted in\n   <em>\n    Living Word, R &amp; R\n   </em>\n   ,\"[j]ust like the four regions in the old structure, each of the four taxpayer-type divisions ... has its own Commissioner who reports up the chain to the Deputy Commissioner, Services and Enforcement, who in turn reports to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    Living Word, R&amp;R\n   </em>\n   at *11. (ultimately characterizing the TE/GE Commissioner, who was two levels above the DEOE, as \"the logical counterpart to the Regional Commissioner\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Living Word, Order\n   </em>\n   at *3 (explaining Magistrate Judge \"did not state that the [TE/GE Commissioner] had same broad array of duties as the Regional Commissioner\" but did find the responsibilities of the Regional Commissioners were \"more closely aligned\" with those of the TE/GE Commissioner than those of the DEOE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   This court agrees the change in structure from four geographic regions to four taxpayer-type divisions suggests the pre-reorganization Regional Commissioners and post-reorganization Division Commissioners (including the TE/GE Commissioner) stand at a comparable level and hold comparable rank. To the extent the change from seven Regional Commissioners in\n   1984 (when CAPA was enacted) to four Regional Commissioners in 1998 (when the IRS Reform Act was enacted) has any impact on the analysis, it supports a finding the TE/GE Commissioner's rank is\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   as high as that of a Regional Commissioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    Chain-of-Authority (steps from Commissioner).\n   </strong>\n   It is undisputed the TE/GE Commissioner reports to the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement who reports to the IRS Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 10-16 \u00b6 17 (Owens' First Decl.); ECF No. 15-2 \u00b6 5 (TE/GE Commissioner's Decl.). This chain-of-authority is consistent with organizational charts submitted by BST.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 10-16 at 17 (October 1, 2000 chart reflecting line from TE/GE Division to box containing Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner); ECF No. 10-16 at 19 (2015 chart reflecting separate boxes for Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners and demonstrating the TE/GE Commissioner reported directly to a Deputy Commissioner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The evidence of the chain-of-authority for Regional Commissioners is less clear. Relying on Owens' First Declaration, BST asserts Regional Commissioners reported \"directly\" to the Commissioner. Owens' First Decl. \u00b6 6 (\"Regional Commissioners were one rank below the IRS Commissioner and reported directly to the Commissioner.\"). Owens' characterization of the reporting structure appears to be based on his interpretation of an attached organizational chart from 1998, which reflects a direct line from a box containing the IRS Commissioner and two Deputy Commissioners to the Regional Commissioners. ECF No 10-16 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   An organizational chart from 1984 attached to Owens' Second Declaration is similar, reflecting a line from a box containing the Commissioner and a single Deputy Commissioner to Regional Commissioners. ECF No. 19-1 at 5. Owens avers to the same \"direct\" reporting structure in 1984.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The organizational charts attached to Owens' Declarations do not reveal the reporting structure within the box containing\n   the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner(s) (one in 1984, two in 1998). The Government questions the accuracy of BST's (and Owens') characterization of the Regional Commissioners' chain-of-authority, citing evidence that, in practice (at least by 1998), Regional Commissioners reported to the IRS Commissioner through multiple layers including deputy commissioners and assistant deputy commissioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15 at 10 (citing testimony from IRS restructuring hearing).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   On this record the court cannot determine whether the Regional Commissioners, in fact, reported directly to the IRS Commissioner, or through one or more intermediate officials. More critically, the court cannot determine whether the legislative decision (in 1984) to make Regional Commissioners the lowest level official to whom the Section 7611 Determination could be delegated was dependent on such a direct reporting relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   It appears at least equally likely the legislative decision was based on the reporting structure reflected on the organizational chart in effect in 1984. That chart places Regional Commissioners (like the TE/GE Commissioner today) on the first step outside the box containing the IRS Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner(s). This analysis, which is all that is possible on the present record, suggests the TE/GE Commissioner's level or rank is comparable to that of a Regional Commissioner and that both held a \"rank\" immediately below that of a Deputy Commissioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The rank of the TE/GE Commissioner and Regional Commissioners relative to that of a Deputy Commissioner is of particular significance because BST's argument on rank suggests the lowest level official who may now make the Section 7611 Determination is the Deputy Commissioner of Services and Enforcement. BST's argument proves too much because it would effectively replace the statutory clause \"principal Internal Revenue officer for an internal revenue region,\" a clause the parties agree refers to the former Regional Commissioners, with \"Deputy Commissioner.\" Had Congress intended to make the Deputy Commissioner the lowest official to whom authority to make the Section 7611 Determination could be delegated, it could easily have done so as such a position existed in 1984. That Congress did not do so weighs against any argument that would produce such a result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    Distance From Conduct of Examinations.\n   </strong>\n   The court reaches a similar conclusion if it counts steps up from the examination function rather than down from the IRS Commissioner. The 1984 organizational chart attached to Owens' Second Declaration reflects two steps between the examination function and Regional Commissioners. Specifically, Examinations appears below District Directors who appear below Regional Commissioners. Though the structure differed, there were also two steps between the examination function and Regional Commissioners immediately prior to reorganization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Currently, the DEOE, who is responsible for Examinations, reports to the DEO, who reports to the TE/GE Commissioner. Thus, the TE/GE Commissioner, like Regional Commissioners in 1984 (and 1998), is two steps removed from the examination process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    Nature of Duties.\n   </strong>\n   As BST argues and\n   <em>\n    Living Word\n   </em>\n   acknowledged, the requirement an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" make the Section 7611 Determination was intended to ensure the Determination is made by an official with sufficiently broad perspective to balance the interests of proper enforcement of tax laws against the special First Amendment concerns applicable to churches.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Living Word, R &amp; R\n   </em>\n   at *11 (\"The broad responsibilities and experience of an official with such a high-profile position [as required by Section 7611(h)(7) ] would make it likely that she has a heightened political and policy sensitivity for balancing the need for vigorous enforcement of our tax laws and the avoidance of excessive government intrusion into a church's exercise of religious freedom.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    at *12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding delegation of watchdog responsibilities intended to \"halt over-zealous examination\" to the official responsible for conducting those examinations, the DEOE, did not satisfy statutory purpose).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    Scope of Responsibilities.\n   </strong>\n   Because of the change in focus from geographic region to subject matter responsibility, there is no perfect comparison between the duties of Regional Commissioners and the TE/GE Commissioner. Most critically, as BST argues, Regional Commissioners were responsible for administration of the tax laws as to all categories of taxpayer within their region, but only within their region. In contrast, the TE/GE Commissioner is responsible only for three categories of taxpayer, Employee Plans, Exempt Organizations, and Government Entities and Shared Services, but that responsibility is nationwide. Further, while the precise division of responsibility is unclear, it appears Regional Commissioners' responsibilities for taxpayers within their regions was limited given the division between \"field\" and \"national\" offices in the pre-reorganization structure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19-1 at 5 (1984 organizational chart with one \"Field Offices\" line leading to Regional Commissioners and three \"National Office\" lines headed by Associate Commissioners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, the TE/GE Commissioner's\n   responsibilities for taxpayers under her authority appear to be complete, encompassing both functions previously assigned to \"Field\" and \"National\" offices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TE/GE Decl. \u00b6 3 (explaining she is responsible for \"all matters relating to the development and execution of the TE/GE Division's long-term strategy\" including \"rulings and agreements, examinations, education and communication, and coordination with other IRS divisions and oversight entities\"). In sum, the positions of former Regional Commissioner and current TE/GE Commissioner are each broader in some respects than the other, though both clearly have broad responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion as to Delegation to TE/GE Commissioner.\n   </strong>\n   Based on the language of the statute, the court finds the TE/GE Commissioner's \"level\" or \"rank\" the most significant consideration. Whether viewed from the perspective of closeness to the IRS Commissioner or removal from the examination function, the TE/GE Commissioner's rank is comparable to that of a former Regional Commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The only position suggested by BST as an alternative \"lowest\" official to whom authority to make the Section 7611 Determination might be delegated is a Deputy Commissioner. The IRS's organizational structure prior to reorganization (both as reflected in the 1984 and 1998 organization charts) placed Deputy Commissioners above Regional Commissioners. This supports finding the TE/GE Commissioner's rank to be comparable to that of Regional Commissioner because both appear on the organizational charts immediately outside the box containing the IRS Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners. Finally, while reorganization of the IRS makes it difficult to compare the responsibilities of Regional Commissioner and TE/GE Commissioner, the court finds the TE/GE Commissioner's scope of responsibilities is sufficiently broad to serve the legislative purpose behind Section 7611(h)(7) 's minimum-rank requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The court, therefore, finds the TE/GE Commissioner holds a sufficiently high rank to satisfy Section 7611(h)(7) 's definition of appropriate high-level Treasury official. In light of this determination and the conclusion Delegation Order 193 is reasonably interpreted to delegate authority for the Section 7611 Determination to the TE/GE Commissioner, the court finds the TE/GE Commissioner is an official to whom authority to make the Section 7611 Determination may be and has been delegated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Redelegation to the DEO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Government maintains authority to make the Section 7611 Determination was redelegated by the TE/GE Commissioner to the DEO. For reasons explained below, the court finds (1) the only evidence of \"delegation\" is the hybrid identification of a Designated Official in IRM 25.5.8.3.2 ; and (2) to the extent intended as a delegation of authority, IRM 25.5.8.3.2 is ineffective because the DEO lacks sufficient rank to satisfy Section 7611(h)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Source of Delegation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Government asserts Delegation Order 193 \u00b6 \u00b6 (7)-(9) allow redelegation and the TE/GE Commissioner relied on those paragraphs to redelegate authority to make the Section 7611 Determination to the DEO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government identifies the following as demonstrating redelegation: (1) the IRM's description of the Exempt Organizations functions; (2) the DEO's job description; and (3) the IRM's identification of the DEO \"who acts in concurrence with the TE/GE Commissioner\" as the \"[D]esignated [O]fficial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21 at 6, 7 (citing IRM 1.1.23.5 (3) (describing Exempt Organizations function), ECF No. 21-3 (job description), and IRM 25.5.8.3.2 ). The Government relies primarily on the first two sources and characterizes the IRM's identification of a hybrid Designated Official as \"an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   delegation of authority to the [DEO].\" ECF No. 21 at 7 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The first two sources contain only general references to the DEO's duties or functions over which she has responsibility. The Government points to no language within these sources specific to the Section 7611 Determination. Neither does the Government provide any context for the creation of the DEO's job description or IRM's description of Exempt Organizations functions that would suggest an intent to include authority to make the Section 7611 Determination within the DEO's duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the first two sources on which the Government relies do not support a finding of redelegation to the DEO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The third source ( IRM 25.5.8.3.2 ), in contrast, specifically refers to the Section 7611 Determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   This IRM provision explains the Section 7611 Determination must be made by \"the Designated Official\" and, in a \"Note,\" states \"[t]he [D]esignated [O]fficial is the [DEO] who acts in concurrence with the TE/GE Commissioner.\" IRM 25.5.8.3.2 (1). While the precise meaning of this hybrid designation is debatable,\n   it clearly does not purport to authorize the DEO to make the Section 7611 Determination independently of the TE/GE Commissioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this is both the most recent and most specific indication of the IRS's intent to as which officials may make the Section 7611 Determination, it controls over any general intent that might be gleaned from the two sources discussed above (DEO job description and IRM list of Exempt Organization functions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   IRM 25.5.8.3.2 's identification of two officials, one acting \"in concurrence with\" the other, as the \"Designated Official\" is problematic due to its ambiguity. If it requires a de novo determination by the TE/GE Commissioner, any determination by the DEO is an\n   <em>\n    added requirement\n   </em>\n   rather than a delegation of authority. If it requires less than a de novo determination by the TE/GE Commissioner, the validity of the Determination turns on whether the DEO satisfies Section 7611(h)(7). For reasons explained below, the court concludes the DEO lacks sufficient rank to satisfy Section 7611(h)(7). Thus, to the extent IRM 25.5.8.3.2 may be read as a delegation of authority (as opposed to an additional requirement), it is ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Effectiveness of Redelegation to the DEO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    DEO \"Rank.\"\n   </strong>\n   In Discussion \u00a7 II.B. above, the court finds the TE/GE Commissioner satisfies the Section 7611(h)(7) requirement because her rank under the current IRS structure is comparable to that of a Regional Commissioner under the former IRS structure. While perhaps not dispositive, the analysis as to the TE/GE Commissioner's rank largely predicts the outcome as to the DEO. This is because the DEO holds a rank one step below the TE/GE Commissioner (to whom the DEO reports).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DEO Decl. \u00b6 5. Further, unlike the TE/GE Commissioner and Regional Commissioners, who appear immediately \"outside the box\" containing the IRS Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners), the DEO is one step further removed. This suggests the DEO holds a rank below that of former Regional Commissioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    DEO Responsibilities.\n   </strong>\n   The DEO has \"nationwide responsibility for all matters relating to [o]rganizations exempt from income tax under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including charities, private foundations and other types of exempt organizations\" as well as \"[p]olitical organizations described in 26 U.S.C \u00a7 527.\" ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6 3 (DEO Decl.). The DEO supervises approximately 700 employees \"organized into three offices, EO Examinations, EO Rulings &amp; Agreements, and the EO Program Management Office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the DEO has nationwide responsibility but over a relatively narrow category of taxpayers. Contrary to the Government's arguments, the DEO's exclusive focus on exempt (and political) organizations weighs against, rather than in favor, of finding her position satisfies Section 7611(h)(7), because it deprives her of the broad perspective of former Regional Commissioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15 at 8 (arguing the proper focus is \"the official's expertise in and scope of authority over tax-exempt organizations\" and asserting the DEO satisfies the relevant requirements because she \"is the highest-ranking Treasury official in the country\n   <em>\n    focused exclusively on exempt organizations\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   This conclusion is consistent with the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Living Word, R &amp; R\n   </em>\n   , which noted assigning responsibility to \"halt over-zealous examination of churches\" to an official closely connected to the office\n   that conducts the examinations would not have the intended effect. While the DEO is one step above the DEOE, her connection is still too close to the examination process and her areas of responsibility too narrowly focused to serve the purpose of ensuring review by an official with a broad perspective and at some remove from the examination process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   That the IRS was unable to gain approval of a regulation that would have vested authority to make the Section 7611 Determination in the DEO also weighs against finding the DEO satisfies Section 7611(h)(7). As explained in Martin, 29 Akron Tax J. at 16-18, \"the clear majority of comments\" relating to this proposed regulation \"expressed concern over giving the [DEO] this responsibility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In sum, there is, at most, evidence of an intent to delegate shared authority for the Section 7611 Determination to the DEO and TE/GE Commissioner. To the extent any delegation (whole or partial) is intended, it fails because the DEO lacks sufficient rank to satisfy Section 7611(h)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural Defects Preclude Enforcement of Summons\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For reasons explained above, the TE/GE Commissioner has authority to make the Section 7611 Determination but the DEO does not. Because the Government has made a prima facie showing the TE/GE Commissioner made the Determination, it has made the necessary showing this statutory requirement was satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728581\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/48/#p57\">\n    379 U.S. at 57-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728581\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/48/#p57\">\n    85 S.Ct. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring Government make prima facie showing of four factors including \"the administrative steps required by the Internal Revenue Code have been followed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   This does not end the inquiry because Section 7611 also imposes notice requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), (a)(3), a(2). Section 7611(a)(3) addresses the Inquiry Notice requirements, stating they \"are met with respect to any church tax inquiry if, before beginning such inquiry, the Secretary provides written notice to the church of the beginning of such inquiry\" and includes specified information. Similarly, Section 7611(b)(2) states the Examination Notice requirements are met if \"the Secretary provides the notice\" described in that section. Neither Section expressly states the Secretary (or delegate satisfying Section 7611(h)(7) ) must \"sign\" the Notices, though this is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language and one the IRS appears to have applied through its IRM provisions requiring the \"Designated Official\" (the official with authority to make the Section 7611 Determination) sign the Inquiry Notice and Examination Notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In this case, the TE/GE Commissioner did not sign the Inquiry Notice and the IRS did not otherwise disclose her Determination to BST at any point between when the Inquiry Notice was signed (June 15, 2016) and when the Government filed its Reply in support of the Petition (November 23, 2017). The Petition (filed September 8, 2017) only hinted at this possibility by disclosing the TE/GE Commissioner signed the Approvals Cover Sheet and stating \"approval of the [Inquiry Notice] by [the DEO], acting with the concurrence of the TE/GE Commissioner\" satisfies Section 7611. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Not unreasonably, given the information available to it, BST challenged the DEO's authority to make the Section 7611 Determination and sign the Inquiry Notice and made related challenges to the Examination Notice and Summons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   These challenges provided the IRS multiple opportunities to disclose the TE/GE Commissioner's Determination. Rather than doing so, the IRS argued the DEO was authorized to make the Section 7611 Determination and sign the Inquiry Notice in one letter (ECF No. 10-9), implicitly took the same position by having the DEO sign the Examination Notice (ECF No. 10-11), and insisted on compliance through other communications without addressing BST's repeatedly-raised challenge to the DEO's authority to initiate the Inquiry or approve the Examination (ECF Nos.10-12 through 10-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The IRS's failure to disclose the TE/GE Commissioner's Section 7611 Determination, whether through the original Notices or by clarifying communication, was not harmless. This is because BST declined (or lost) the opportunity to address the IRS's concerns by less formal means while it (correctly) maintained the DEO lacked authority to institute an Inquiry or Examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   These less formal means of resolution comprise part of the protections afforded churches under CAPA and might have limited or eliminated the need for continuation of the Inquiry, an Examination, or issuance of the Summons. Thus, BST was prejudiced by the IRS's failure to disclose the TE/GE Commissioner's Determination, whether through the Notices themselves or through subsequent clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Under these circumstances, the court finds \"there has not been substantial compliance with ... the notice requirements of [ Section 7611 ] (a) or (b).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207611\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 7611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).

Multiple lines run from this box, including three lines to \"National Office[s]\" and one line to the seven Regional Commissioners and their subordinates, described collectively as \"Field Offices.\" While the relative rank of the various officials in the different (\"National\" vs \"Field\") lines may be debatable, all (including Regional Commissioners) would presumably fall below the rank of the single Deputy Commissioner. The structure was essentially the same in 1998, though there were then two Deputy Commissioners and four Regional Commissioners. ECF No. 10-16 at 10.

The Exempt Organizations Technical Division was later renamed the Exempt Organizations Division and is the office in which Owens served. Owens' Second Decl. \u00b6 2; Owens' First Decl. \u00b6 1. Owens explains he was previously employed by the \"Exempt Organizations Division, formerly known as the Exempt Organizations Technical Division, from 1975 to 2000\" and served as Director of this division from 1990 to 2000. Owens' Second Decl. \u00b6 2. Thus, Owens' position was in the \"National Office\" line where he served in a position three steps removed from the box containing the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner.
