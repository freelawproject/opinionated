McFadden, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , are two prisoners incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas. They have filed a complaint against members of the United States Sentencing Commission in their individual and official capacities and have moved to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   (\"IFP\"). The IFP motion will be granted, and this case will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (requiring dismissal of a prisoner's case upon a determination that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are serving federal sentences for \"possession or sale\" of crack cocaine. Compl. \u00b6 1. In this action, \"each plaintiff complains of violations of his federal Constitutional rights, secured under the Eighth Amendment, to protections from cruel and unusual punishment manifested through both disparity and excessiveness of federal prisoner sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Plaintiffs fault the defendants for promulgating the federal sentencing guidelines, which \"were used to sentence each plaintiff to prison for a lengthy term.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Plaintiffs were sentenced under the guidelines that were in effect before enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\"FSA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They assert that the FSA's enactment has \"resulted in [their] grossly excessive and disparate sentences.\" Compl. \u00b6 3, and \"but for the date of sentencing, they would have been subject to far more lenient guideline ranges,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Plaintiffs posit that \"the policies, practices and customs of the individual defendants\" are racially motivated because they are black and \"are part of a large pool of racial minority inmates experiencing the same constitutional deprivations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs state: \"Nothing in this suit is intended to be or should be construed as a collateral attack or other attack upon the convictions of any plaintiff.\" Compl. \u00b6 1. While that may be true in a literal sense, plaintiffs are clearly challenging the constitutionality of their sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is established that \"the sole remedy for a federal prisoner challenging the legality of his conviction\n   <em>\n    or sentence\n   </em>\n   \" is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Day v.

Plaintiffs do not identify their courts of conviction but neither appears to have been convicted in this court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment with regard to retroactivity and injunctive relief, including \"in the form of directed changes to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual wherein all cases and in all prior and future amendments an explicit \u00a7 994(u) statement is added directing\" retroactive application of the FSA \"when any new sentencing guideline results in a computation of sentence that is lower than previous sentences for like situated offenders with similar offenses[.]\" Compl. \u00b6 19. But \"the Supreme Court already has explained the degree to which the FSA is retroactive.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
