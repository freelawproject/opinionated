SMITH, JUDGE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court upon the Motion of Defendants Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Nationwide Insurance Company of America for Summary Judgment (\"Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment\") (Doc. 79). The motion is fully briefed and ripe for disposition. For the following reasons, Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. McGrath works for various Nationwide agents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2005, Plaintiff Debra McGrath was hired by Anthony Colosimo, a Nationwide agent, as an associate in his agency in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 14-15, 18). Shortly after McGrath began working for him, Colosimo was diagnosed with cancer. McGrath operated Colosimo's agency in his absence, and\n   Colosimo passed away in February 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17). McGrath continued to operate the Colosimo agency and was also asked by Nationwide to service policies that had previously been serviced by another agency, until Nationwide transitioned both books of policies to two other agents, Scott Diemert and Richard Marnic, in May 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20, 31-32). McGrath expressed interest in buying the servicing rights for one of the books, and Nationwide's Sales Manager for the Western Pennsylvania territory, Jim Montelone, told her that she would be offered the servicing rights to one of the two books if either Diemert or Marnic declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, both accepted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One of these agents, Marnic, hired McGrath as an associate at his agency in Beaver, Pennsylvania in June 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, 36-37). About this time, McGrath alleges that Montelone promised her that she would receive the servicing rights to the next available book of policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). However, Montelone did not make any representations regarding the location of the book or how large it would be. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In February 2007, McGrath learned that the servicing rights to a book of policies that had been serviced by an agency in Chippewa, Pennsylvania had been sold to another agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39). McGrath contacted Darryl Hohlbaugh, who had taken over as Sales Manager from Jim Montelone, to express her interest in obtaining the servicing rights for those policies. McGrath alleges that Hohlbaugh told her the servicing rights had already been sold, but that McGrath would receive the next available book of policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40). In the meantime, McGrath continued to work for Marnic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the spring of 2007, Emmett Santillo, another Sales Manager for Nationwide, approached McGrath to discuss her possible participation in Nationwide's Agency Capital Builder Program (\"ACB Program\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44). Nationwide describes this program as \"a 24-month agent training program that allowed individuals like McGrath a pathway toward potentially owning and operating a Nationwide agency.\" (Doc. 79, Mot. for Summ. J. at 6). Participants in the ACB Program \"worked as a Nationwide employee in an existing Nationwide agency, acquiring additional skills and training\" needed for Nationwide's other agent programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Once an agent met the requirements of the ACB Program, the agent could then become eligible to participate in one of Nationwide's Successor Programs. This is the next step for agents desiring to transition toward becoming a non-program 'career agent.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   McGrath says that during this meeting with Santillo, she noted Montelone's and Hohlbaugh's promises that she would receive the servicing rights to the next available book of policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Santillo allegedly told McGrath that she was not required to participate in the ACB Program before purchasing a book of servicing rights because she already had experience working with Nationwide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2007, McGrath learned that another book of policies had become available, and although she was in frequent contact with Hohlbaugh about her desire to purchase the servicing rights to this book, the rights were ultimately sold to another agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. McGrath enters and successfully completes the ACB Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In late 2007 or early 2008, Santillo visited McGrath and told her that she would now be required to participate in the ACB program before she would be permitted to purchase the servicing rights to a book of policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50). McGrath interviewed\n   for the ACB Program with Santillo and Carol Miller, then a Nationwide Assistant Vice President of Sales in Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50). During this interview, McGrath alleges that Miller expressed \"that she didn't think [McGrath] was a good candidate for the ACB Program because it was a very difficult and stringent program, and it took a lot-it was going to take a lot of energy and stamina was the word she used, and she was concerned because of [McGrath's] age.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52). Nationwide denies these remarks were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McGrath was accepted into the ACB Program in July 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53, 64). On July 25, 2008, McGrath and Nationwide entered into an Agency Capital Builder Agreement (\"ACB Agreement\") (Doc. 79-1 at PAGEID # 1513-29). The ACB Agreement set forth various production goals that McGrath was required to achieve within the 24-month term of the Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit B). Three other provisions of the ACB agreement are pertinent here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Section 4, stating that \"Except as provided in Section 16, [McGrath] agrees and understands that Nationwide has exclusive use and control of all expirations and therefore has the right and obligation to service Nationwide customers at any and all times, even to the exclusion of [McGrath].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Section 16, stating that \"In the event [McGrath] satisfies [certain production goals], applies to participate in a Successor Program, and is approved by Nationwide, [McGrath] shall also, at Nationwide's discretion, earn the right to service either: (1) the book of business [McGrath] has developed while working as a Nationwide employee, or (2) a book of business with an equivalent value in a different location.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Section 34, stating that \"The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement supersede all prior oral or written understandings between [McGrath] and Nationwide and constitute the entire agreement between them concerning the subject matter of [the ACB Agreement].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the ACB Program, Santillo allegedly referred to McGrath as \"Mother Hen,\" because she \"had three years of Nationwide experience and nobody else did in the office, as far as the program and underwriting and all that kind of stuff, he would always tell them to go ask [McGrath].\" (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 103). Other agents also allegedly referred to her as \"Yoda,\" whom they explained to her was \"this little old guy, but he was really smart.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   McGrath successfully completed the requirements of the ACB Program in 19 months, allowing her to complete the ACB Program early, and for which she received a $40,000 bonus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72). McGrath admits that no adverse employment actions were taken against her during the ACB Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. McGrath enters Nationwide's Agency Executive (AE) Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following completion of the ACB Program, agents may become eligible to participate in one of Nationwide's Successor Programs. Two such Successor Programs are the Agency Executive Program (\"AE Program\") and the Replacement Agency Executive Program (\"RAE Program\"). (Doc. 79, Mot. for Summ. J. at 8). In the AE Program, agents open a scratch agency (that is, they \"start from scratch\" with no or few policies), while agents in the RAE Program purchase the servicing rights to a Nationwide-owned book of policies, which they begin servicing right away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June 2010, Nationwide invited McGrath to participate in the AE Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   McGrath accepted, and on June 29, 2010, McGrath and Nationwide entered into an Agency Executive Program Performance Agreement (the \"AE Agreement\"). (Doc. 83-6). McGrath's understanding was that, since there were no available books of policies at that time, her only option to \"avoid ending her career as a Nationwide agent\" was to enter into the AE Agreement. (Doc. 83, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 7; Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The AE Agreement provided that McGrath was an independent contractor, responsible for paying all business expenses and federal, state, and local income and self-employment taxes, and having \"independent judgment as to time, place, and manner of soliciting insurance [and] servicing policyholders.\" (Doc. 83-1, AE Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 2-3). The AE Agreement also reserves to Nationwide \"exclusive use and control of all policies and policy expirations and [Nationwide] therefore has the right to service Nationwide customers at any time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   McGrath was also subject to a Minimum Production Plan, performance under which was \"calculated on a 12 month moving basis,\" and Nationwide \"reserve[d] the right to change the Minimum Production Plan during the term of [the AE Agreement].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7-8). Finally, the AE Agreement also contained an integration clause, stating, \"[t]he terms and conditions contained in this Agreement supersede all prior oral or written understandings between [McGrath] and Nationwide and constitute the entire agreement between them concerning the subject matter of [the AE Agreement].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   McGrath alleges that she was concerned \"at the very beginning\" with the production requirements for the second year of the AE program, as it entailed a substantial increase from the production requirements in the first year. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 140). However, Santillo allegedly told her she \"didn't have to worry about that because by that time, [she] would be offered an agency to purchase.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During her first year in the AE Program (July 2010 to July 2011), McGrath learned that at least four other agents had been given the opportunity to purchase the servicing rights to existing books of policies. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 172). McGrath contacted Hohlbaugh several times to express that she was \"troubled that [she was] not getting the opportunity that [she saw] everybody else getting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173). McGrath viewed Nationwide's inability or refusal to sell her the servicing rights to an existing book of policies as \"a breach of a promise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. McGrath and Nationwide enter into an Amendment to the AE Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On February 24, 2012, Hohlbaugh emailed McGrath to say that he would be visiting her agency to have her sign \"an addendum related to a possible tax liability[,] not a big deal\" and that \"all program agents have the same addendum change.\" (Doc. 83-10, Emails, at PAGEID # 2322-23). On March 1, 2012, Hohlbaugh visited McGrath's agency, presented her with an Amendment to Agency Executive Program Performance Agreement (\"AE Amendment,\" Doc. 83-10 at PAGEID # 2324-26), and asked her to sign it. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 189). Hohlbaugh again stated that the amendment related to tax liability and wasn't a big deal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   McGrath requested time to study the AE Amendment, but she alleges that Hohlbaugh refused, telling McGrath that he needed to leave her office with the signed amendment that day, and that if she did not sign it immediately, she would\n   be terminated from the AE Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189-91). McGrath then executed the AE Amendment without having read it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The AE Amendment includes provisions related to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. One of these provisions altered the calculation for any early termination payment that might be due to McGrath in the event of cancellation of the AE Agreement before the end of its otherwise four-year term. (Doc. 83-10, AE Amendment \u00a7 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Nationwide cancels its AE Agreement with McGrath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nationwide amended McGrath's production goals at various points during the term of the AE Agreement. The amounts McGrath was required to meet fluctuated, but they never exceeded the production requirements in the original schedule. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 163-64; Doc. 79-1, AE Minimum Production Schedules, PAGEID # 1567-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   McGrath was able to meet her monthly production requirements during the first year of the AE Agreement term, in part because she was credited with the approximately $343,000 in premium she had achieved during the ACB Program. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 137-38; Doc. 79-1, PAGEID # 1587-1613, Program Agent Performance Reports). But starting in July 2011, McGrath failed to meet her monthly production requirements and was never able to get back on track. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On September 1, 2011, McGrath signed a production shortfall program coaching plan stating that \"failure to show progress above minimal requirements after one month on the coaching plan will result in your being moved to a formal Administrative (Performance) Action Plan.\" (Doc. 79-1, PAGEID # 1576-78, Production Shortfall Program-Coaching Plan, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   McGrath's inability to meet her production goals continued, and on October 27, 2011, she signed an Administrative Action Plan, which stated, \"Please remember that failure to meet the minimum production requirements by the end of this Administrative (Performance) Action Plan period may result in cancellation of your Agent's Agreement with Nationwide.\" (Doc. 79-1, PAGEID # 1579-80, Production Shortfall Program-Administrative Action Plan, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a result of McGrath's further inability to meet her production requirements into 2012, Nationwide terminated McGrath's AE Agreement on July 23, 2012. (Doc. 79-1, PAGEID # 1586, Letter from Darryl Hohlbaugh dated July 23, 2012). Nationwide then hired McGrath as an employee (paid at an hourly rate, rather than on commission) to continue servicing her agency's policies until the servicing rights to that book of policies was sold to another agent in December 2012. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 203-04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   McGrath filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) on February 7, 2013, alleging that Nationwide discriminated against her on the basis of her age and sex. (Doc. 1-1, PAGEID # 90, PHRC Right to Sue Letter). The PHRC issued a right to sue letter to McGrath on April 9, 2013, finding that her allegations failed to state a cause of action under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On April 15, 2014, McGrath filed a praecipe for a Writ of Summons from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and filed her Complaint in the same court on January 27, 2015. The Complaint contains nine counts: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing; (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   fraud in the inducement; (4) intentional misrepresentation/fraud; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) discrimination on the basis of age and sex under the PHRA; (7) wrongful discharge in violation of the PHRA and of public policy; (8) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (9) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Doc. 1-1, Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nationwide timely removed the action on the basis of diversity of citizenship to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on February 27, 2015. (Doc. 1, Notice of Removal). Subsequently, the Western District of Pennsylvania granted Nationwide's motion to transfer the action to the Southern District of Ohio pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and a forum selection clause in the AE Agreement designating Franklin County, Ohio as the proper forum for \"any action or proceeding arising from a dispute concerning the AE Program.\" (Doc. 59, Transfer Order; Doc. 83-6, AE Agreement \u00a7 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Nationwide filed the present Motion for Summary Judgment, seeking judgment in its favor on all nine counts in Plaintiff's Complaint. (Doc. 79). On July 12, 2017, McGrath filed a brief in opposition (Doc. 83) in which she relied heavily on the Ohio appellate decision\n   <em>\n    Lucarell v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-5286\">\n    2015-Ohio-5286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20N.E.3d%20319\">\n    44 N.E.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Dist.) in arguing against summary judgment on her contract claims. Nationwide filed a reply brief on August 9, 2017 (Doc. 86). On January 9, 2018, Nationwide filed a notice of supplemental authority noting that the Seventh District Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Lucarell\n   </em>\n   had been overturned by the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. 89). The Court has considered all of these filings in reaching its decision on Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nationwide has moved for summary judgment on all nine of McGrath's claims. The Court will discuss each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Breach of contract and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing (Counts I and II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   McGrath claims that Nationwide breached both the express terms of the ACB and AE Agreements and the duty of good faith and fair dealing that is implied in every contract. (Doc. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-61). Nationwide argues that even accepting McGrath's version of the facts, there is no evidence that Nationwide breached any of its express or implied contractual obligations. (Doc. 79, Mot. for Summ. J. at 14-22). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Breach of the ACB Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   McGrath alleged in her Complaint that Nationwide breached the ACB agreement \"by refusing to allow Ms. McGrath to either 1) acquire the book of business she built in the ACB Program, or 2) acquire a similar book of business in a different location pursuant to the ACB Agreement.\" (Doc. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6 57). Nationwide responds that the ACB agreement contains no promises to do either of these things, and even if it did, McGrath admitted at her deposition that she did, in fact, receive the servicing rights to the book of policies she built during the ACB Program when she entered the AE Program. (Doc. 79, Mot. for Summ. J. at 14-15; Doc. 79-1, ACB Agreement, PAGEID # 1513-29; Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 81, 137-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   McGrath does not address her claim for breach of the ACB agreement in her opposition brief and appears to have abandoned it. Upon review of the ACB agreement and McGrath's testimony confirming Nationwide's factual assertions, Nationwide is entitled to summary judgment on the claim for breach of the ACB agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Breach of the AE Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   McGrath alleges that Nationwide breached the AE Agreement in the following ways (Doc. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-60):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Failing to make correct payments for bonuses and commissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   McGrath alleges that Nationwide failed to make correct bonus and commission payments to her. But McGrath admitted at her deposition that she does not know whether or to what extent commissions were not paid, because she has not undertaken any calculations of what she claims was due her. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 155-56). Accordingly, Nationwide argues this claim should fail for lack of evidentiary support. (Doc. 79, Mot. for Summ. J. at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Failing to adhere to the production plan and goals as set forth in the AE agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   McGrath alleges that Nationwide unilaterally changed both the amounts of her production requirements during the AE Program and the way they were measured-i.e., from a cumulative to a rolling 12-month basis. However, as Nationwide points out, the AE Agreement expressly permitted Nationwide to make unilateral changes to McGrath's production requirements. (Doc. 83-6, AE Agreement, \u00a7 8). Further, when the production requirements were changed, they were lower than original production schedule, thus making it easier for McGrath to achieve the production goals. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 163-64; Doc. 79-1, AE Minimum Production Schedules, PAGEID # 1567-75). Finally, the AE Agreement also expressly states that McGrath's production requirements would be \"calculated on a 12 month moving basis.\" (Doc. 83-6, AE Agreement, \u00a7 7). McGrath confirmed she was aware her production would be measured on a rolling basis during the ACB Program before she signed the AE Agreement. (Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 94-101). Accordingly, Nationwide argues that these allegations of breach are not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Failing to credit or pay McGrath in full under the agreements for policies procured while enrolled in the ACB program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   McGrath's Complaint alleges that Nationwide breached the AE Agreement by \"not crediting nor paying McGrath in full under the agreements for policies procured while enrolled in the ACB Program.\" (Doc. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6 60). Nationwide responds that nothing in the AE Agreement requires this, and that McGrath\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   receive credit for the amount of premium she generated during the ACB program. (McGrath Dep. at 125, 137-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In response to all of these arguments by Nationwide concerning lack of breach of the AE Agreement, McGrath does not identify any disputed facts. Instead, she relies solely on the Ohio appellate decision in\n   <em>\n    Lucarell v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-5286\">\n    2015-Ohio-5286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20N.E.3d%20319\">\n    44 N.E.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Dist.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lucarell\n   </em>\n   , another agent who participated in Nationwide's AE Program sued Nationwide, alleging it had breached a similar AE Agreement \"by (i) unilaterally imposing an unrealistic business plan on her, (ii) forcing her to sign an amendment to her AE Agreement which, among other things imposed a payment to Nationwide of $5,000, and (iii) misleading her through false promises and information to entice her into contributing to the AE Program.\" (Doc. 83, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 14). The Seventh District upheld a jury verdict in favor of Lucarell on her breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claims.\n   <em>\n    Lucarell\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. McGrath argues that if facts similar to hers were sufficient to support a jury verdict in the agent's favor, then her facts must be sufficient to prevent summary judgment in Nationwide's favor. (Doc. 83, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There are two problems with McGrath's approach to her breach of contract claim. First, she has the obligation to identify specific facts that are in dispute that would preclude summary judgment in\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Fed. R. Civ.

She cannot discharge this obligation simply by making a general analogy to another case with non-identical (albeit similar) facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, the appellate\n   <em>\n    Lucarell\n   </em>\n   decision has since been overturned by the Ohio Supreme Court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553231\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/458/\">\n    152 Ohio St. 3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Slip Opinion No.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553231\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/458/\">\n    2018-Ohio-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 47, --- N.E.3d ----. While the appellate court determined it could not review the jury's verdict in favor of the agent on the breach of contract claims due to Nationwide's failure to submit interrogatories to the jury regarding the basis for the verdicts, the Ohio Supreme Court found this was reversible error. The appellate court still had an obligation to determine whether sufficient evidence supported the jury's verdicts and its failure to do so required reversal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553231\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/458/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Overall, McGrath has failed to identify a genuine issue of material fact as to her breach of contract claims, and the single case she relies on has now been overturned by the Ohio Supreme Court.

Here, McGrath claims Nationwide lured her into participating in its agent programs through false promises regarding her ability to purchase the servicing rights to an existing book of policies.

She also alleges that she was fraudulently induced to enter into the ACB Agreement and AE Agreement (based on the same promises that she would receive servicing rights to an existing book) as well as the AE Amendment (based on Hohlbaugh's statements that it related to \"tax liability,\" was \"not a big deal,\" had to be executed immediately, and that failure to execute it immediately would result in Nationwide's cancellation of the AE Agreement).

Nationwide argues the contradiction arises out of McGrath's sworn response to one of Nationwide's interrogatories, in which she identified only James Montelone, Kevin\n   Keto, and Emmett Santillo as having made promises to her regarding the opportunity for her to purchase the servicing rights to an existing book of policies. (Doc. 86-2, McGrath's Interrog. Resps. at 6). While it is certainly curious that McGrath failed to list Hohlbaugh in this response, she identified Hohlbaugh multiple times as having made such a promise in her Complaint and sworn deposition testimony. (Doc. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6 47; Doc. 83-1, McGrath Dep. at 35-40). Indeed, Nationwide included Hohlbaugh's alleged promises in 2007 in its statement of facts in support of the present Motion. (Doc. 79 at 4). McGrath also never asserted in her Complaint, interrogatory responses, or deposition testimony that Hohlbaugh never repeated those promises after 2011. Thus, her affidavit is not inconsistent with her prior submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Nationwide also contends that even if the Court may consider the affidavit, it does not help McGrath because she cannot demonstrate any detrimental reliance on Hohlbaugh's alleged May 2012 promise.

But although Nationwide terminated McGrath's employment as an hourly employee on December 31, 2012, when it sold the servicing rights to the policies associated with McGrath's scratch agency to another agent, McGrath has not alleged any discrimination in connection with that action. McGrath alleges discrimination based only on \"Nationwide's refusal to offer Ms. McGrath the opportunity to purchase an existing agency\" and \"Nationwide's termination of Ms. McGrath as an insurance agent.\" (Doc. 1-1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 116-17). Both of those actions were taken no later than July 23, 2012, when Nationwide terminated McGrath's AE Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As a result, McGrath has failed to properly invoke the PHRA's administrative procedures that are prerequisite to maintaining a PHRA claim in this Court.

To the extent Count VII of the Complaint relies on the PHRA, the Court has already determined that those claims are time barred. And as Nationwide correctly points out, Pennsylvania's tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy is precluded when a statutory remedy exists for the wrongful discharge.\n   <em>\n    Clay v.

The Pennsylvania legislature has set forth a clear procedure for victims of alleged discrimination to follow, and that procedure requires invoking the PHRA's administrative and judicial remedies. Because the allegations underlying McGrath's claim for wrongful discharge are the province of the PHRA, she may not assert a common law claim for wrongful discharge based on those same allegations.

McGrath has described at most a standard business relationship that went sour, not a course of conduct stretching \"beyond all possible bounds of decency\" or \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klusty v.

Ohio 1995) (Merz, M.J.) (no viable claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress where the plaintiff alleged only a \"breach of contract and then [tried] to make that into an intentional infliction case merely by adding that Taco Bell did it to cause emotional distress and that Taco Bell was successful.\"). Accordingly, Nationwide is entitled to summary judgment on Count IX of McGrath's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . The Motion is denied as to McGrath's claim for fraudulent inducement regarding her execution of the AE Amendment on March 1, 2012. All other claims are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court further recommends that the parties engage in mediation to resolve McGrath's remaining claim. If the parties wish to participate in mediation, they may contact Judge Vascura's chambers to schedule a mediation through the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Clerk shall remove Document 79 from the Court's pending motions list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Both parties' briefs cite only Ohio case law in relation to McGrath's contract claims, and the AE Agreement has a choice of law provision stating that \"this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio.\" (Doc. 83-6 at \u00a7 40). The Court will therefore apply Ohio law to McGrath's claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    In Pennsylvania, a plaintiff may commence an action by filing either a praecipe for writ of summons or a complaint.

Thus, applying Ohio's conflicts of law rules, \"if two jurisdictions apply the same law, or would reach the same result applying their respective laws, a choice of law determination is unnecessary because there is no conflict, and the laws of the forum state apply.\"\n    <em>\n     DRFP, LLC v.

It is therefore unnecessary to undertake a choice of law analysis, and the Court will apply Ohio law to McGrath's tort claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
