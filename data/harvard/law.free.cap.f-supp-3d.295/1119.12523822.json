(ECF No. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 25, 2017, Plaintiff City of Vista (\"Vista\") filed a complaint in Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego against General Reinsurance Corporation (\"GRC\"). (ECF No. 1-2). The complaint alleges that Vista is insured under an excess indemnity insurance policy (the \"Policy\") issued by GRC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The complaint alleges, \"Pursuant to its rights, duties, and obligations arising under law and the Policy, Vista is now entitled to indemnity from [GRC], and all other defendants, arising from a workers' compensation claim brought by Vista's employee, Frank Soper.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleges that Frank Soper, a Vista employee, brought a workers' compensation claim against Vista. The parties settled the underlying workers' compensation action. The complaint alleges that under the Policy, GRC is now required \"to indemnify a settlement of Mr. Soper's permanent, total disability claim\" and that GRC has \"refused to participate financially any further than they had participated effective and up to October 20, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vista brings a single cause of action for declaratory relief pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 with a claim for immediate trial setting under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1062.3. Vista \"seeks a binding declaration of its rights under the Policy, along with a binding declaration articulating Defendants' duties\" and \"a declaration from this court, that Defendants owe Vista a minimum of $1,030,000.00 (exact amount subject to proof at the time of trial) plus interest, plus fees, plus costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The complaint alleges that Vista is a municipality in San Diego \"properly formed and existing under the laws of the State of California\" and that GRC is \"a corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is authorized to do business within the state of California.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 27, 2017, GRC removed the action to this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) on the grounds that this Court has diversity jurisdiction over this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (ECF No. 1 at 2-3). The notice of removal states that Vista is a municipality organized under California law and located in San Diego County and therefore is a citizen of California. (ECF No. 1 at 2). The notice of removal states that GRC was incorporated in Delaware and has a principal place of business in Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the\n   notice of removal states that the amount in controversy is $1,030,000 plus interest because Vista seeks a declaration and judgment that it is owed that sum from GRC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 14, 2017, GRC filed an answer and counterclaim. (ECF No. 5). GRC brings the following counterclaims: (1) declaratory relief cause of action seeking \"a declaration that it is not obligated to indemnify Vista under the Policy for its claimed excess loss\" and \"a determination that it is entitled to reimbursement of loss and claim expense payments made to Vista in an amount according to proof.\"; (2) a cause of action for reimbursement and accounting, and offset; and (3) \"breach of contract, including contractual breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by Vista.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 19-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 26, 2017, Vista filed a motion to remand to state court. (ECF Nos. 7, 8). On January 12, 2018, GRC filed a response in opposition. (ECF No. 13). On January 22, 2018, Vista filed a reply. (ECF No. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CONTENTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Vista moves this Court for an Order remanding this action to state court on the grounds that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Vista contends that GRC has failed to establish that diversity jurisdiction is proper. Vista contends that the parties in this action are not diverse because GRC does business in California and is therefore a citizen of this state. Vista contends that GRC has a corporate nerve center in all states and that there is \"no rational basis for diversity jurisdiction based on the location of certain officers and offices out-of-state, particularly where, as here, [GRC] clearly also conducts business in California.\" (ECF No. 7-1 at 5). Vista contends that GRC has waived its right to remove this action because it has \"availed itself of a State of California judicial process already\" by unsuccessfully seeking to intervene in the underlying workers' compensation matter before the California Workers' Compensation Appeal Board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, Vista contends that \"where the relief sought is equitable in nature, a removed matter can and should be remanded.\" (ECF No. 7-1 at 2). Vista contends that \"[i]nasmuch as [GRC's] potential counter-claim does not sound in legal damages, either, there is no premise for diversity jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   GRC contends that this action was properly removed because this Court has subject matter jurisdiction on diversity grounds. GRC asserts that it is a citizen of Delaware and Connecticut and that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. GRC contends that Vista's argument that diversity is destroyed because GRC does business in California and has a nerve center in all fifty states has no merit and is contradicted by Supreme Court precedent. GRC contends that the Court's exercise of jurisdiction is mandatory because this is \"an action for common law damages\" rather than declaratory relief. (ECF No. 13 at 8). GRC contends that the Court \"must exercise jurisdiction\" over its counterclaim for breach of contract and other damages in the amount of $691,511.71. GRC contends that Vista has failed to demonstrate that the Court could exercise its discretion to decline jurisdiction, even if this case was primarily for declaratory relief. GRC contends that it has not waived its right to litigate in federal court. GRC asserts that it filed only the notice of removal to this court in the state court action and that its unsuccessful petition to intervene in the underlying workers' compensation proceeding was not an attempt to litigate coverage issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Diversity Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   GRC removed this case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and stated in its notice of removal that it was a citizen of Delaware, where it was incorporated, and Connecticut, where its principal place of business is located. Vista challenges GRC's assertion of diversity jurisdiction and asserts that GRC is a citizen of California because it does business in all states and therefore has a nerve center in states. With respect to California, Vista asserts that GRC is licensed in California to sell insurance and has \"purposely availed itself of the premium payment benefits of selling insurance in California.\" (ECF No. 7-1 at 4). However, in\n   <em>\n    Hertz Corp. v. Friend\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court stated that a corporation's principal place of business is a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   place located where the corporation's officers, direct, control, and coordinate the corporation's activities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p80\">\n    559 U.S. at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p80\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    3123 SMB LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264754\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/461/#p465\">\n    880 F.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, in adopting the \"nerve center\" test for determining the citizenship of corporations, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hertz\n   </em>\n   rejected an approach focused on the location of a corporation's business activities.\n   <em>\n    Hertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p80\">\n    559 U.S. at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p80\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"By contrast, a corporation's general business activities more often lack a single principal place where they take place.... If so, it will not be as easy to determine which of these different business locales is the 'principal' or most important 'place.' \"). Accordingly, Vista's argument fails because GRC cannot have a nerve center in all states and cannot be a citizen of a state solely because it conducts business activities in that state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   GRC is a citizen of the state in which it was incorporated and the state in which its\n   principal place of business is located.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). GRC provides a declaration by Lorraine Coccola, Assistant Vice President at GRC, stating\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Since at least 1998, GRC has been incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware.
