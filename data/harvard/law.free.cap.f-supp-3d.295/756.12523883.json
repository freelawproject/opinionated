In years past, La Bamba locations also have existed in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7-8.) One of La Bamba's current locations is in the Highlands neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky, conveniently located next to many popular bars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) This location has been serving the Louisville market under the name La Bamba since early 1997.

The arbitrary nature of the mark is in Plaintiff's favor on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court also considers the mark's public recognition in determining the strength of the mark. \"[A]lthough inherent distinctiveness may provide powerful support for the strength of a mark, the full extent of that support nonetheless depends on the scope of commercial recognition.\"\n   <em>\n    Maker's Mark Distillery, Inc. v.

(DN 27, Exh. A, \u00b6 15.) It further claims that the mark is particularly strong in Kentucky where it has been used in connection with the Louisville restaurant for almost twenty years and in connection to a previous Lexington, Kentucky location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.) Plaintiff emphasizes that the Louisville restaurant is a popular location visited by customers throughout the state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff further argues that the continuous use of the mark regionally and in Kentucky supports strong recognition of the mark in connection with Mexican cuisine. The Defendant does not dispute these underlying facts. In fact, Defendant even seems to concede that the mark is commercially strong within the Louisville area (\"Plaintiff's Mark Strength is not Strong\n   <em>\n    outside of Louisville Area\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). (DN 29, 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Rather, Defendant argues that third party use of the mark has weakened the LA BAMBA mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daddy's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834023\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/275/#p280\">\n    109 F.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that numerous third-party registrations of identical or similar marks may undermine the strength of the mark). However, Defendant does not point to any evidence in the record of allegedly\n   similar marks, and does not specify the number of, location of, or types of goods and services offered by these allegedly \"numerous\" but undisclosed third-party users. The court cannot conclude, based on Defendant's unsupported assertion, that there exist third-party users of the mark that weaken LA BAMBA's market recognition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The arbitrary nature of the mark, combined with Plaintiff's uncontested evidence of continuously using the mark for twenty years in the state of Kentucky, weigh in Plaintiff's favor on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

While Defendant states that the \"parties have different target markets, use different logos, and have completely different products,\" it does not explain how the parties' target markets, logos, and products are different.

Potential consumers familiar with Plaintiff's La Bamba restaurant, which holds itself out as serving casual, Mexican-style cuisine, likely could believe that La Bamba Authentic Mexican Cuisine is connected to or affiliated with the Plaintiff's restaurant. Defendant's restaurant's name is merely Plaintiff's arbitrary mark accompanied by a description of the same style of food that Plaintiff offers to consumers.

Defendant does not offer any evidence rebutting this affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because Plaintiff does not provide specific evidence indicating how often these complaints or questions occur, it cannot definitively be stated that \"chronic mistakes and serious confusion\" between the parties' restaurants has occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Therma-Scan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411734\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/623/#p631\">\n    295 F.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The court\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   find, however, that actual confusion has indeed occurred.

First, both parties serve and advertise to individual consumers of casual, Mexican-style food. (DN 27, Exh. A, \u00b6 9; DN 26, 2.)\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Therma-Scan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411734\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/623/#p631\">\n    295 F.3d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the predominant customers differed when one party sold to commercial buyers and the other party sold to individual consumers). Additionally, Plaintiff has provided evidence that there is\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   overlap in customers through testimony that actual confusion has occurred. (DN 27, Exh. A, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.) Also significant is the fact that Plaintiff's Louisville restaurant and Defendant's restaurant are both located in the same state. Further, Defendant does not dispute the testimony offered by Plaintiff that customers from all over Kentucky visit the Louisville restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) Still, the evidence provided by Plaintiff on this issue is too general to make a determination on how much overlap exists between the parties' customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Courts also consider how the parties market their services. In response to Plaintiff's interrogatory, Defendant alleged that it advertises and promotes its services through its Facebook page, through a coupon in a Lebanon, Kentucky grocery, and through a coupon in a Lebanon, Kentucky newspaper. (DN 23, 3.) Plaintiff alleges that it similarly promotes its services on its website, on Facebook, and through \"coupon and grocery store advertisements,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   which Defendant does not dispute. (DN 27, Exh. A, \u00b6 10.) Yet these general facts do not particularly \"illuminate what actually happens in the marketplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Homeowners\n   </em>\n   , 931 F.2d at 1110. For example, neither party provided evidence on marketing budgets, frequency of advertising, or sophistication of advertising. Additionally, the mere fact that both parties use Facebook and the Internet is not sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Therma-Scan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411734\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/623/#p631\">\n    295 F.3d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Entrepreneur Media, Inc. v.

Once again, the evidence is too general to conclude whether the parties' marketing approaches create a likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Despite the limited and general nature of the evidence offered by Plaintiff, Defendant has not pointed to any facts in the record indicating that the parties market their services in different ways or to different customers.

However, Plaintiff does contend that there is a strong possibility that Plaintiff will expand its restaurants into new geographic locations. Plaintiff alleges that it currently operates numerous restaurants, has previously operated restaurants in five other states, and that it is currently offering franchise opportunities. (DN 27, Exh. A, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17.) However, these facts only indicate the mere possibility that Plaintiff could open another restaurant in close proximity to Defendant. Plaintiff has not alleged any specific plans to expand and only states that \"if the right location was located, Plaintiff would potentially open another restaurant that is even closer to [Defendant].\" (DN 27, 16.) Because the evidence does not show that the possibility of Plaintiff expanding near Defendant's restaurant is \"strong,\" the last \"Frisch's\" factor is not relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Likelihood of Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The preceding discussion on the eight \"Frisch's\" factors indicates that there is no genuine dispute of material fact.

The first four factors provide the strongest support for Plaintiff's position: the LA BAMBA mark is arbitrary and has been used in Kentucky for more than twenty years; both parties use the mark in connection with casual, Mexican-style cuisine; the parties' marks are sufficiently similar as to confuse a consumer with only a vague recollection of Plaintiff's mark; and, perhaps most significantly, actual confusion between Plaintiff's and Defendant's services has already occurred.

Further, in considering the balance of hardships between the parties, Defendant has only one location which was established in 2015; conversely, Plaintiff has operated in various states under the LA BAMBA mark for nearly thirty years.
