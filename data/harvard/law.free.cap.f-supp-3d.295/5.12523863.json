MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Tony D. Parks was formerly employed at various grocery stores owned by Giant of Maryland, LLC. On April 3, 2017, he brought a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   suit against Giant in D.C. Superior Court, alleging that after being promoted he \"was not given the proper raise,\" and after he filed a \"retaliation suit\" he was \"threaten[ed] by a manager[,] transferred and written up then terminated\" Notice of Removal, Ex. A at 7 (hereinafter Complaint). Giant removed to this Court and then moved to dismiss, arguing that Mr. Parks' claims were completely preempted by federal labor laws. Mem. In Support of Mot. Dismiss 5-9 (Mot. Dismiss). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Mr. Parks' pay claims survive the motion to dismiss, but that his other claims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Parks' hand-written complaint consists of only a single paragraph, alleging that his problems began when he was working as \"a shop steward ... for Giant\" and he observed a manager \"stealing hours.\" Compl. 7. When Mr. Parks informed human resources, the manager tried to fire him, but \"the NLB (national labor board) [sic] stepped in and they transferred [him]. [He] was commended and promoted for [his] good work but was not given the proper raise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Parks \"complained to H.R.\" but \"they denied [his] promotional raise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Parks then \"complain[ed] and filed [a] retaliation suit,\" after which he \"was threatened by a manager[,] transferred and written up[,] then terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to Giant's motion to dismiss, Mr. Parks submitted a filing that summarized his original allegations in more detail and added other factual claims, including that Giant \"started putting [his] life in danger and not letting [him] practice [his] religion.\" Response to Mot. Dismiss 1-2 (hereinafter Opp.). He also discussed the union's involvement, saying that the \"case manager\" filing his \"multiple NLB [sic] charges\" \"had a heavy work load and couldn't get to it at first [and] also we had to keep adjusting it\" and that he \"went to the Union on all occasions] and unfortunately they were unable to help me[.] [T]his is the reason why I had to seek outside help[.]\" Opp. 3. In a further filing, Mr. Parks again summarized all of his prior allegations and claimed that \"[a]s for the Union they are in bed with the company and have always been no help[ ] [I]t's the reason I have to depend on outside help.\" Am.
