Parker (\"Jesse\"). On or about April 21, 2017, plaintiffs Alexander, Kim Romano (\"Kim\"), and Travelers Personal Insurance Company (\"Travelers\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a complaint in New York State Supreme Court, Monroe County, against American States Insurance Company (\"ASIC\"), Jesse, Gary W. Parker (\"Gary\"), and Amy Parker (\"Amy\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), seeking a declaratory judgment. (Dkt. 1 at 9-12). Specifically, Plaintiffs seek an order declaring that: (1) ASIC's disclaimer of liability coverage for Jesse is invalid; (2) ASIC cannot further disclaim liability coverage for Jesse; and (3) ASIC is required to indemnify Jesse for his liabilities associated with the alleged personal injuries caused to Alexander arising out of the single-car accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 6, 2017, ASIC removed this action to federal court by filing a notice of removal. (Dkt. 1). Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion to remand. (Dkt. 5). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about August 8, 2015, Jesse was operating a 2005 Ford automobile-owned by Gary and/or Jesse-with Alexander riding as a passenger. (Dkt. 1 at 10-11). While operating the vehicle in the Town of Irondequoit, Monroe County, New York, Jesse and Alexander suffered a single-car accident, resulting in allegedly \"serious injuries\" to Alexander under section 5102(d) of the New York Insurance Law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about the same day, ASIC issued one or more insurance policies to Gary and Amy, which were effective from June 20, 2015, through June 20, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Jesse was designated as an \"insured\" under one or more of these policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On February 19, 2016, ASIC disclaimed liability coverage for Jesse regarding Alexander's injuries arising from the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about April 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in New York State Supreme Court, Monroe County, seeking an order declaring that: (1) ASIC's disclaimer of liability coverage is invalid; (2) ASIC cannot further disclaim liability coverage for Jesse; and (3) ASIC is required to indemnify Jesse for his liabilities related to Alexander's injuries arising out of the automobile accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). On June 6, 2017, ASIC removed this action to federal court by filing a notice of removal. (Dkt. 1). On June 30, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court, arguing that the jurisdictional requirement for complete diversity has not been satisfied. (Dkt. 5-1). ASIC opposed remand, arguing that diversity of citizenship exists because: (1) Defendants Gary, Amy, and Jesse have been fraudulently joined in this action; (2) Gary and Amy are only nominal parties; and (3) in the event the Court determines that Jesse has not been fraudulently joined, Jesse should be realigned as a plaintiff.
