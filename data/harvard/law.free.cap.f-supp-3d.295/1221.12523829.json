FRIZZELL, CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the court on the defendant City of Tulsa's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. # 175]. For the reasons discussed below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 12, 1994, Travis Wood, the three-month-old son of Michelle Murphy, was found dead as a result of a stab wound to the chest and incised wound to the neck. The Tulsa Police Department, headed by then Chief Ron Palmer, oversaw the investigation of infant Wood's murder. That same day, Murphy made a statement to TPD detective Michael Cook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 15, 1994, Murphy was charged with murder in the first degree in the District Court in and for Tulsa County. Murphy was convicted of the charge in November of 1995 and served twenty (20) years of a sentence of life without parole. On May 30, 2014, Tulsa County District Court Judge William Kellough vacated and set aside Murphy's conviction and, on September 12, 2014, the charge against Murphy was dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Murphy now brings this case against the City of Tulsa pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the federal civil rights statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Murphy seeks section 1983 relief on the basis of two constitutional violations: (1) violation of Murphy's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and (2) violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause's right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City moves for summary judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History and Evidentiary Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before considering the City's motion for summary judgment, however, the court must first address four evidentiary issues associated with Murphy's response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of its motion, the City offers eighty-three (83) material facts to which it asserts there is no dispute. These facts are divided into six categories: (1) \"The Tulsa Police Department's Murder Investigation,\" fact nos. 1-28; (2) \"Murphy's Confession And Probable Cause,\" fact nos. 29-36; (3) \"Murphy's Confession was Given Knowingly and Voluntarily,\" fact nos. 37-46; (4) \"Causation and Waiver,\" fact nos. 47-54; (5) \"TPD Policies, Practices, Training, and Supervision,\" fact nos. 55-71; and (6) \"The 'Earlier' Case-LaRoye Hunter,\" fact nos. 72-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Murphy's response to the motion includes over 1,000 pages of exhibits. The City subsequently moved to strike the exhibits attached to Murphy's response, arguing that the exhibits did not comply with Local Civil Rule 56.1. In an order dated August 29, 2017, the court concluded that Murphy's response failed to comply with LCvR 56.1(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1) for five separate reasons. First, the court concluded that Murphy \"frequently fail[ed] to 'refer with particularity' to those portions of the record upon which she relies,\" offering as an example Murphy's collective response to the City's first twenty-eight (28) statements of undisputed material facts. In response to the City's first 28 facts, Murphy responded with the statement \"[t]he investigation was woefully inadequate, not 'thorough' or 'constitutionally sound' as asserted ...\" and cited to 140 of her own additional statements of undisputed fact, seventeen pages of an expert report prepared on her behalf by Dr. Michael D. Lyman, and twelve pages of deposition testimony from the unnamed \"scene investigator.\" Second, Murphy did not use a consistent format for her references. Third, Murphy referenced missing exhibits. Fourth, Murphy occasionally referred to multi-page exhibits as a whole, without reference to page and line numbers. Finally, for some of the exhibits containing excerpts of testimony, Murphy did not identify the individual whose testimony was presented. In order to correct these identified deficiencies, the court granted Murphy additional time to file an amended response that complied with LCvR 56.1(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 279].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1(c):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The response brief in opposition to a motion for summary judgment (or partial summary judgment) shall begin with a section which contains a concise statement of material facts to which the party asserts genuine issues of fact exist.\n   <strong>\n    Each fact in dispute shall be num\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    bered, shall refer with particularity to those portions of the record upon which the opposing party relies and, if applicable, shall state the number of the movant's facts that is disputed.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All material facts set forth in the statement of the material facts of the movant shall be deemed admitted for the purpose of summary judgment unless specifically controverted by the statement of material facts of the opposing party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   LCvR 56.1(c) (emphasis added). The local rule is consistent with statements of the Tenth Circuit interpreting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and meant to further the purposes of Rule 56. The Tenth Circuit has stated that \"on a motion for summary judgment, 'it is the responding party's burden to ensure that the factual dispute is portrayed with particularity, without ... depending on the trial court to conduct its own search of the record.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cross v.

Aug. 25, 2016) (\"The Court has no obligation to scour the record in search of evidence to support any factual assertions, and where inadequate record citations have been made, the court has ignored them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Due to a change in Murphy's counsel, the court granted Murphy an additional extension to file her amended response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 335]. The amended response lists 197 additional material facts and again appends over 1,000 pages of exhibits which Murphy asserts preclude summary judgment. However, the amended response fails to correct several of the deficiencies previously identified by this court and, for the four following reasons, the court is persuaded that portions of Murphy's amended response do not comply with LCvR 56.1(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Murphy again fails to \"refer with particularity\" to those portions of the record on which she relies. By way of example, Murphy did not correct all of the insufficiencies specifically identified by this court in its August 29, 2017 order regarding Murphy's opposition to the City's first twenty-eight undisputed material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As previously mentioned, City fact nos. 1-28 relate to TPD's investigation of the\n   murder of infant Wood. Murphy purports to specifically dispute only eight (8) of these facts. Rather, at the outset of Murphy's section stating the material facts to which she asserts a genuine issue of fact exists, Murphy again includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1-28. The investigation was woefully inadequate, not \"thorough\" or \"constitutionally sound\" as asserted on p. 31 citing these facts.

Murphy explains that \"Fact ##\" refers to Murphy's additional material facts to which she asserts there is no dispute. [Doc. # 338, p. 1 n.1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although, unlike in her original response, Murphy identifies the scene investigator as TPD officer Noordyke and includes specific page and line references, Murphy again broadly refers to 135 of her own statements of additional undisputed material facts-each of which references one or more exhibits-as well as 17 pages of Dr. Lyman's expert report, and 13 pages of Noordyke's testimony. Similarly, Murphy cites only her own statements of additional undisputed material facts to dispute the following undisputed material facts offered by the City: 20, 23, 25, 27, 37, 38\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and 67. As previously discussed by this court, this practice requires the court to first find the referenced statements of undisputed material fact in a separate section of Murphy's response, look to the exhibits referenced in that later section, and comb through the record to find the relevant material in support of Murphy's proposition. The court is not persuaded that this burdensome procedure satisfies the particularity requirement of LCvR 56.1(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Murphy fails to properly address many of the City's assertions of undisputed material fact. Murphy purports to dispute City fact nos. 22, 46, 52, 53\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   , 56, 57, 63, 72, 73, and 80, but includes only argument and no reference to any portion of the evidentiary record upon which Murphy relies. It is well established that \"argument of counsel is not evidence, and cannot provide a proper basis to deny summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton v. Colo.

In opposition to the City's undisputed material fact no. 13, Murphy refers to Exhibit 15, which was not provided to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , Murphy does not purport to specifically dispute fact nos. 1-10, 12, 14, 16-19, 21, 24, 26, 28, 31, 33-36, 40-45, 48-51, 54, 64-66, 69, 74-79, and 81-83.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To the extent that Murphy identifies a numbered material fact of the City relative to which she cites with particularity to the evidentiary record to demonstrate a dispute as required by LCvR 56.1(c), the court will consider the issue for purposes of the City's motion for summary judgment. The court will not \"seach[ ] through the record on plaintiff's behalf, however, to compile the relevant facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Stallings v.

Kan. 2009). To do so would require the court to comb through the record, essentially charting Murphy's arguments for her, in a manner not required by the Tenth Circuit. Thus, the court concludes that Murphy fails to properly address the following facts, and the court will consider them undisputed for purposes of the City's motion for summary judgment: 1-10, 12-14, 16-28, 31, 33-38, 40-46, 48-54, 56-57, 63-67, 69, and 72-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Officer BK Smith and Officer Gary Neece were among the first to arrive. They were directed to the back door of the apartment, where Smith observed Murphy's three-month old son, Travis Wood, dead, lying in a pool of blood. [CSOMF at \u00b6 1]. Smith and Neece entered Murphy's apartment through the back door to search for additional victims. They exited the apartment and set up a perimeter to protect the crime scene. Smith then guarded the back door of Murphy's apartment until he was relieved by a day shift officer. [CSOMF at \u00b6 2]. Ultimately, nine uniformed TPD officers and four detectives, including Det. Doug Noordyke, Scene Investigator, assisted in investigating the homicide of Travis Wood. [CSOMF at \u00b6 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TPD officers immediately separated the witnesses. Murphy and her neighbors, Christina Carter and Christona Lowther, were each placed in separate patrol cars. [CSOMF at \u00b6 4]. TPD officers and detectives obtained written and recorded statements from Carter, Lowther, and William Green. [CSOMF at \u00b6 5]. TPD officers and detectives also interviewed Murphy's other neighbors, James Fields, Kathy Evans, Steve Mann, LaDonna Summer, William Lee, Kevin Washington, Mike Jarnagan, Pat Jarnagan, and the security guard for the apartment complex. They also interviewed the probation officer of one of Murphy's acquaintances. [CSOMF at \u00b6 6]. 911 calls had been made by Lee and Lowther. As part of the investigation, TPD officers obtained copies of these calls. [CSOMF at \u00b6 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Allen assigned the homicide investigation to Det. Corporal Mike Cook, a 20-year TPD veteran and a 13-year homicide detective. At the time, Cook had investigated hundreds of homicide cases. [CSOMF at \u00b6 7]. Allen also assigned Noordyke, a 13-year TPD veteran, as the crime scene investigator. Noordyke's training included police academy training in crime scene processing, evidence recovery, and fingerprinting. He also attended specialized schools in blood stain pattern analysis and latent print examinations and had received training with senior SIU officers regarding crime scene processing. At the time of the Murphy investigation, Noordyke had processed hundreds of crime scenes. [CSOMF at \u00b6 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When Noordyke arrived at the scene, it had been taped off and preserved. His first duties were to document the scene with video, photographs, sketches, and narrative report. He also recovered physical evidence and processed the scene for prints. [CSOMF at \u00b6 10].\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   There were no signs of forced entry into the apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [CSOMF at \u00b6 11]. Noordyke collected\n   the sheet/drape that separated the kitchen from the living room because it was stained with what appeared to be blood. He also obtained samples from what appeared to be blood on the outside of the front screen door and near the body of the baby. [CSOMF at \u00b6 12]. Noordyke recovered seven knives from Murphy's apartment, including a 9-inch dagger in the closet and a large knife with a 7 \u00bc-inch blade found between the couch cushions. [CSOMF at \u00b6 13]. The agent from the Medical Examiner's office arrived at the scene, examined the victim and found a \"stab wound just below the neck and a deep large laceration across the throat that was close to being a full decapitation of the infant.\" [CSOMF at \u00b6 14]. In addition to obtaining latent prints, video, and crime scene photographs, Noordyke collected 25 separate pieces of evidence on September 12, 1994. [CSOMF at \u00b6 15]. Throughout the course of its investigation, TPD generated 232 pages of TRACIS documents. The investigation included: securing the crime scene; canvassing the area for potential witnesses; separating the witnesses at the scene; obtaining witness statements; documenting the crime scene with video, photographs and diagrams; obtaining and processing evidence; obtaining DNA evidence and evidence from the Medical Examiner's office; having detectives re-visit the scene; and interviewing Murphy and obtaining her tape-recorded confession. [CSOMF at \u00b6 25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Officer Gary Otterstrom was assigned to sit with Murphy in his patrol car until the detectives arrived. While Murphy was seated in the passenger seat of the patrol car, she stepped out of the vehicle several times to speak with neighbors and smoke cigarettes. [CSOMF at \u00b6 23]. Allen, the on-scene supervisor, instructed Otterstrom to obtain a written search waiver from Murphy so that she could give permission for the officers to search her residence for evidence. At 7:17 a.m., September 12, 1994, Allen witnessed Otterstrom read Murphy her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings from a card and then observed Murphy willingly sign a Consent to Search form for her apartment. [CSOMF at \u00b6 24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Cook arrived at the crime scene between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. As the detective assigned to the case, he was responsible for interviewing the witnesses and putting together the reports. [CSOMF at \u00b6 16]. At approximately 8:40-8:45 a.m., Cook went to the detective division to talk to Murphy. [CSOMF at \u00b6 17]. Cook interviewed Harold Eugene Wood (Murphy's common-law husband and infant Wood's father) and took a tape-recorded statement of Murphy. [CSOMF at \u00b6 18]. Cook subsequently arrested Murphy. [CSOMF at \u00b6 31]. After obtaining Murphy's recorded statement, Cook interviewed Murphy's neighbors, William Lee and LaDonna Summer. [CSOMF at \u00b6 19]. Cook also took a recorded statement of Scottie Dale Ritchie, a close friend of Harold Eugene Wood, and obtained copies of recorded conversations between Murphy and Earl Peck while she was in jail after her arrest. [CSOMF at \u00b6\u00b6 26 and 28]. Cook prepared a prosecution report for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office, which identified each witness and summarized their testimony. [CSOMF at \u00b6 27].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Cook and Noordyke returned to the scene two additional times. First, they went back to Murphy's apartment at night,\n   on September 19, 1994, to see the field of view from the front door and front window as well as from the back door and the back window. They checked the view during the daylight hours and returned after dark. They specifically wanted to see if they could view where the body was on the floor, from outside the back window, looking through the mini blinds as fourteen-year old William Lee had described to police. This line of sight was confirmed. [CSOMF at \u00b6 20]. In March of 1995, Cook and Noordyke were called back out to Murphy's apartment because the maintenance supervisor reported a possible break-in. The detectives discovered a box from Murphy's closet had been overturned onto her bed and a maroon-handled knife was next to overturned boxes on Murphy's bed. [CSOMF at \u00b6 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Pursuant to 22 O.S. \u00a7 285, Murphy's preliminary hearing was held on November 14 and 15, 1994 before the Honorable J. Peter Messler. Private counsel represented Murphy. [CSOMF at \u00b6 33]. At the preliminary hearing, the State presented nine witnesses including William Lee and officers Smith and Otterstrom. Cook did not testify and Murphy's taped confession was not offered into evidence. [CSOMF at \u00b6 34]. At the end of the two-day preliminary hearing, Judge Messler denied Murphy's demurrer; found probable cause existed that first-degree murder had been committed; and found probable cause existed that Murphy committed the crime. He bound Murphy over for trial for first-degree murder. [CSOMF at \u00b6 35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At a separate proceeding before the trial, on November 9, 1995, Judge E.R. (Ned) Turnbull conducted a\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Denno\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether Murphy's statement was voluntary. Murphy was represented by counsel at this hearing. [CSOMF at \u00b6 37]. At the\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Denno\n   </em>\n   hearing, Cook testified regarding Murphy's statement. The notification of rights waiver was admitted without objection as State's exhibit 1. [CSOMF at \u00b6 38]. Cook testified that he did not coerce Murphy in any way with any kind of punishment or promise; he did not threaten her in any way, with either physical force or mental intimidation; and he did not promise anything to get her to talk. Cook also described the manner in which he read Murphy her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and obtained the rights waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [CSOMF at \u00b6 39]. Murphy testified that Cook never hit her and never used any kind of physical force against her; she never told Cook she needed to see a physician; and that she understood her rights and waived them by signing and initialing the waiver of rights. [CSOMF at \u00b6 40]. At the conclusion of the\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Denno\n   </em>\n   hearing, Judge Turnbull found that the State had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Murphy's statement to Cook was voluntary and that Murphy was properly read her rights. Thus, Judge Turnbull overruled Murphy's motion to suppress her statements. [Doc. # 175-32, p. 63:1-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   During Murphy's criminal trial, which began on November 16, 1995, Murphy's\n   taped statement to Cook was played for the jury, copies of the transcript of the statement were given to the jurors, and the statement was admitted into evidence. [CSOMF at \u00b6 41]. Jury Instruction No. 16 given by the trial court defined \"voluntary confession\" and instructed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A \"voluntary confession\" is a statement, freely and knowingly made by a person who is not under arrest or in custody, to a police officer or any other person which admits facts that tend to establish the commission of an offense. Such confession is freely and knowingly made when the person voluntarily states his involvement with the alleged crime or reveals details of it, without threats, pressure, coercion, or duress from any police officer or police agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The state has offered evidence that a confession was made by the defendant to Michael Cook on September 12, 1994 [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] if you find that the defendant made the alleged confession, and made it freely and voluntarily, you may take it into consideration with all the other facts in evidence and give it whatever weight and credit you find it deserves. However, if you find that the confession was induced by coercion or by a promise of immunity or a lesser punishment than might otherwise be inflicted, or that the confession was made under threat of violence or force, you should disregard the confession in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [Doc. # 175-34, p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In November of 1995, the jury convicted Murphy of first-degree murder and sentenced her to life without parole. With separate appellate counsel, Murphy appealed her conviction to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and the court found no error in Murphy's conviction. [CSOMF at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; Doc. # 175-35]. On September 5, 2013, Murphy filed an Application for Post-Conviction Relief. [CSOMF at \u00b6 47; Doc. # 97-21]. On May 29, 2014, then-Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris filed a motion to confess the application for post-conviction relief. [CSOMF at \u00b6 49; Doc. # 175-1]. On May 30, 2014, Tulsa County District Judge William C. Kellough vacated Murphy's judgment and sentence. [CSOMF at \u00b6 50; Doc. # 175-36]. After vacating Murphy's conviction, Judge Kellough retained jurisdiction to re-try Murphy. Judge Kellough set an appearance bond and ordered her to reappear on June 24, 2014 at 9:00 a.m. for a status conference. [CSOMF at \u00b6 51; Doc. # 175-36]. Rather than retry Murphy, the State of Oklahoma filed a Motion to Dismiss the case with prejudice. [CSOMF at \u00b6 51; Doc. # 175-53].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court finds the following facts regarding the Tulsa Police Department's policies, procedures, and training in 1994:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In 1994, the basic training for TPD officers, detectives and supervisors involved in the Murphy murder investigation was approximately 14 weeks at the TPD police academy which included a legal block on constitutional rights, statutes and ordinances, as well as instruction on\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, interviewing, interrogations and juvenile law. [CSOMF at \u00b6 56; Doc. # 175-40, \u00b6 3; Doc. # 175-44, \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 11].\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   From at least 1978 to 2003, in order to maintain CLEET (Council of Law Enforcement Education and Training) certification, all TPD officers were required to attend forty hours of in-service training yearly that included current legal procedures and, every officer also received monthly legal bulletins regarding new ordinances, statutes, and court decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   [CSOMF at \u00b6 57; Doc. # 175-41, p. 13:18 to 14:7]. By 1988, all officers assigned to the Detective Division were required to complete forty hours of training in interrogations, arrest warrants, search warrants and affidavits. Officers assigned to the Homicide Unit also completed this additional forty hours of training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   [CSOMF at \u00b6 58].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In 1994, one of the written policies of the Tulsa Police Department was to protect the constitutional rights of all persons. [CSOMF at \u00b6 65; Doc. # 106-6, COT 4]. In 1994, TPD officers were required to take an oath of office which stated, in part, \"I, ______, having been duly appointed a Police Officer of the City of Tulsa, and a Peace Officer of the State of Oklahoma, do solemnly swear, that I will defend, enforce, and obey, the Constitution and Laws of the United States, the State of Oklahoma and the Charter and Ordinances of the City of Tulsa.\" [CSOMF at \u00b6 71; Doc. # 106-6, COT 3]. Therefore, the City's general guidelines required TPD officers to be stewards of the Constitution of the United States, the laws of Oklahoma, and the laws of the City of Tulsa. [Doc. # 339, Exh. 56, p. 32:15-24]. Although TPD's policy required officers to follow the Constitution, it was not possible to write a policy for every facet or intricacy of the Constitution.

[Doc. # 338, p. 34]. First, based on the testimony of former chief and final policymaker Palmer, Murphy alleges that the City gave \"full authority\" to its interrogators regarding the method and manner of interrogations, including the power to make threats. However, the evidentiary materials submitted do not support Murphy's claim. Palmer did not testify that the \"full authority\" of the police department included the authority to make threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 339, Exh. 49, p. 27:12 to p. 29:15]. To the contrary, Palmer testified to his belief that TPD's policies prohibited interrogators from violating the constitutional rights of citizens. [Doc. # 339, Exh. 49, p. 29:1-13]. It is undisputed that one of the written policies of TPD was to protect the constitutional rights of all person, and that TPD officers swore to \"defend, enforce, and obey\" the Constitution and laws of the United States as well as state and local laws. [CSOMF at \u00b6\u00b6 65 and 71]. Further, Palmer testified that TPD officers had no authority to make promises, and that striking, assaulting, or otherwise illegally touching interrogees was prohibited. [Doc. # 339, Exh. 52, p. 37:11-17; Doc. # 174-41, p. 31:4-14, p. 39:13-24]. Based on this evidence, the court is persuaded that any grant of \"full authority\" to interrogators was constrained\n   by TPD's policy requiring its officers to \"defend, enforce, and obey\" the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Murphy's position not only lacks evidentiary support, it also lacks support in the relevant law. Murphy attempts to analogize this case to\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   , wherein the trial court ruled that the jury properly found that the city had a custom or policy of vesting \"complete authority\" with the police supervisor of when medical treatment would be administered to prisoners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 338, p. 40 (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Canton, Ohio v.

However,\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   was premised on a failure to train theory, rather than a facially unconstitutional policy or procedure.\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p382\">\n    489 U.S. at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p382\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There can be little doubt that on its face the city's policy regarding medical treatment for detainees is constitutional.\"). In other words, \u00a7 1983 liability in\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   depended upon the grant of authority,\n   <em>\n    coupled with\n   </em>\n   the failure to adequately train, and then only if the failure to train amounted to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police came into contact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p382\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p382\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p382\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   is therefore distinguishable and does not obviate against summary judgment as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, Murphy alleges that TPD had in force an unconstitutional policy which treated police officers differently than citizens during interrogations, because in 1994 TPD had a regulation-part of the \"Police Officer Bill of Rights\"-which forbade the use of threats or promises during interrogations of police officers, but did not have a similar written prohibition applicable to interrogations of ordinary citizens. As an initial matter, Murphy's alleged second formal policy-which forbade threats or promises during interrogations of police officers, but not ordinary citizens-appears to be little more than a restatement of Murphy's first alleged formal policy-that TPD officers had\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   authority in the conduct of interrogations of ordinary citizens-which this court has rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Further, Murphy has not cited nor has the court identified any Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit authority standing for the proposition that a\n   <em>\n    lack of a written policy\n   </em>\n   amounts to a formal regulation or policy statement for purposes of \u00a7 1983 tort liability. Rather, Murphy appears to be attempting to shoehorn her theory of liability into the \"formal regulation or policy statement\" context in order to take advantage of the Supreme Court's pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209946\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/808/#p823\">\n    471 U.S. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209946\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/808/#p823\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209946\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/808/#p823\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (\"Proof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not sufficient to impose liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , unless proof of the incident includes proof that it was caused by an existing, unconstitutional municipal policy, which policy can be attributed to a municipal policymaker.\").

Further, the admissible evidentiary materials submitted do not establish that the Hunter case and the issues presented in this matter are sufficiently similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The state court's docket in the Hunter Case reflects only the following with respect to the suppression of Hunter's confession: \"Beasley B.R.: Deft's Motion to Suppress Deft's Confession: Sustained. Case Remanded to Preliminary Hearings on 8/9/90 at 9:00 a.m. Deft in Custody and Represented by Loretta [Radford]. State by Dennis Fries. Reba Gibson Reporting.\" [Doc. # 175-50, p. 9]. The court did not enter an order providing its reasons for suppressing Hunter's confession. Although Murphy alleges that Cook stopped the tape during Hunter's interrogation, Murphy has presented no admissible evidence that Cook coerced Hunter's confession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. # 359]. Thus, Murphy has provided no evidence of a sufficient similarity to the Hunter case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Murphy provides no further evidence of a persistent or widespread pattern of unconstitutional interrogations or\n   investigations. Palmer testified that, prior to his deposition taken in this case, he had never heard that Mike Cook had coerced a confession [Doc. # 175-41, p. 94:10-12]. Moreover, Cook's former partner, retired TPD officer, Kenneth Mackinson, averred that, to his knowledge, Cook never coerced a confession or violated a suspect's constitutional rights. [Doc. # 175-40, \u00b6 11]. Outside of Murphy's testimony regarding her own interrogation, Murphy has presented no evidence of any other TPD officer ever making promises to, threatening, or otherwise violating the constitutional rights of an interrogee. To the extent that Murphy relies upon Allen's testimony that interrogators had the full authority to decide what kind of touching would occur, what kind of promises to make, and what kind of threats to make, [Doc. # 339, Exh. 50, p. 16:1-10], this testimony does not give rise to an inference that TPD engaged in a widespread practice of coercing interrogees that, although not authorized by regulation or express municipal policy, was \"so permanent and well settled as to constitute a 'custom or usage' with the force of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Brammer-Hoelter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920337\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1175/#p1189\">\n    602 F.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryson v.

Allen did not testify that other TPD officers routinely touched, threatened, or made promises to citizens that were being interrogated, and this court may not speculate that such practices constituted a custom or usage within the department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James v.

Murphy has presented no additional evidence of inadequate training in interrogations or investigations more broadly. Rather, it is undisputed that, at the time of the Murphy's interrogation, the basic training for TPD officers, detectives, and supervisors was approximately fourteen weeks at the TPD police academy. The police academy included a legal block on Constitutional rights, statutes, and ordinances, as well as instruction on\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, interviewing, interrogations, and juvenile law.

From at least 1978 to 2003, in order to maintain CLEET (Council of Law Enforcement Education and Training) certification, all TPD officers were required to attend forty hours of in-service training yearly that included current legal procedures, and every officer also received monthly legal bulletins regarding new ordinances, statutes, and court decisions. [CSOMF at \u00b6 57; Doc. # 175-41, p. 14]. The evidentiary materials submitted demonstrate that the legal bulletins included training as to U.S. Supreme Court decisions examining the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   decision in three distinct areas-traffic stops, the public safety exception, and interruption to request counsel [Doc. # 231-2];\n   <em>\n    Miranda's\n   </em>\n   requirements, including the application of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   to juveniles [Doc. # 231-3]; the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

However, the court has reviewed the entirety of the exchange between Cook and Murphy's then-attorney during Cook's deposition, and the court is not persuaded by Murphy's characterization of Cook's deposition testimony. At the outset, Cook testified that, although he did not recall his testimony during Murphy's criminal trial, he assumed that the official transcript was accurate. [Doc. # 349, p. 5]. Further, Cook refused to agree that the transcript was untrustworthy. [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ].

Murphy objects to the City's factual assertions regarding training as to constitutional rights and interrogations, citing deposition testimony in this case of Palmer and Cook. However, the court is not persuaded by Murphy's characterization of the deposition testimony. Palmer did not testify that homicide detectives were not required to be trained in interrogations, but rather that \"[t]here was no requirement specifically that [he was] aware of\" and that he \"d[idn't] know exactly what the curriculum was for them to come into the Detective Division.\" [Doc. # 339, Exh. 52, p. 37:6-8]. Further, Cook did not testify that he had no training in interrogations but, rather, that he could not recall his knowledge of whether there were constitutional limitations on interrogations, either in 1994 or 2017. [Doc. # 339, Exh. 162, p. 55:5-8]. Even viewed in the light most favorable to Murphy, Cook's recollection of constitutional limitations on interrogations is not dispositive as to whether or not he actually received training. Because Murphy has presented no evidence to dispute the City's undisputed material facts regarding training as to constitutional rights and interrogations, the court will treat the facts as undisputed for purposes of the City's motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
