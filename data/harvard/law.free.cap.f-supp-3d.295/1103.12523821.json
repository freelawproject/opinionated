The charges result from a stop and search of defendant's vehicle by agents from the United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22, Motion at 3). In his Motion, defendant seeks to suppress evidence discovered during the traffic stop, arguing that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion and the warrantless search of his vehicle was not supported by probable cause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10-17 &amp; 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At approximately 11:00 a.m. on December 7, 2016, Lewis drove a red Mazda CX-5 sports utility vehicle (\"the Mazda\") into a Flying J service station in Ehrenberg, Arizona. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, Declaration of Rafael De Leon (\"De Leon Decl.\") at \u00b6 6); Dkt. 22-1, Exhibit A to Motion, Border Patrol Report of Apprehension or Seizure (\"Report\") at 5). Ehrenberg, Arizona is located approximately 100 \"air miles\" from the border between the United States and Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 19). The Flying J is used frequently by CBP agents to purchase fuel and food or drinks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CBP Agent Rafael De Leon (\"De Leon\") was at the Flying J station when defendant arrived. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 6 &amp; 8-9). Defendant was accompanied by one passenger, Todd Lewis, who was riding in the front passenger seat. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22, Declaration of Timothy Lewis (\"Lewis Decl.\") at \u00b6 1). Defendant and Todd Lewis are both African-American males. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 60, Transcript at 57). On the date of the stop, defendant had his hair in dreadlocks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   De Leon has been a CBP agent for approximately 15 years and is assigned to the CBP Station in Blythe, California. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). He has experience and training in \"immigration and customs law, smuggling law, international boundaries crossings, narcotics, and procedures for conducting vehicle stops.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). Since October 2016, De Leon has \"performed collateral duties in an interdiction group known as the Blythe Alien Narcotic Detection and Interdiction Team\n   ('BANDIT')\". (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). BANDIT is tasked with conducting targeted enforcement and anti-smuggling operations in areas surrounding El Centro and Indio, California, Gila Bend, Arizona, and northward to the Utah border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   De Leon first saw the Mazda as it approached a fuel pump at the Flying J. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 19). De Leon described the Mazda as a newer model, with California plates, no tinted windows, and a barcode sticker on the driver's side window which \"was consistent with those found on rental vehicles.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 6). According to De Leon, \"rental cars are often used in the transportation of undocumented aliens and contraband in an attempt to minimize los[s]es if [smugglers] run into law enforcement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Also, in De Leon's experience, smugglers stop at the Flying J gas station to \"stage\" crossings into California, meaning that \"scouts will [ ] go to the Flying J to observe Border Patrol agents[ and] then notify smugglers when\" the area is clear of law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   De Leon watched Lewis as he parked, exited the vehicle, and as he walked by De Leon into the station. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 24). According to De Leon, defendant noticed De Leon's marked CBP patrol vehicle as he walked into the station.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 9). When defendant passed De Leon, who was dressed in his uniform and equipped with a visible gun holster, defendant \"put his head down, and quickly walked inside the store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). This struck De Leon as odd because, \"usually at Flying J, most [people] will come by[ and say] how you doing, sir, you know, good morning, you know, thanks for your service, stuff like that.\" (Dkt. 60, Transcript at 82). De Leon eventually left the Flying J, and drove onto the access road connecting to the Interstate 10 (\"I-10\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 29-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, De Leon \"slow rolled\" down the access road so that he \"could keep [a] visual on [defendant.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   De Leon drove a short distance on the I-10 across the border into California and parked just west of a California Agricultural Inspection Station (\"CAIS\"), where he waited \"for the Mazda to pass to get a better look.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 60, Transcript at 26-27). De Leon claims he could get a good look at the Mazda from this vantage point, because vehicles are forced to pass through the CAIS and come \"to a complete stop before entering California.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 12). De Leon was parked at the CAIS in the median of the I-10 just south of the westbound lanes and just north of the eastbound lanes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 89). CBP Agents Eric Wilson (\"Wilson\") and Victor Herrera (\"Herrera\") were parked next to De Leon in another CBP service vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, Wilson Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 4 &amp; 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At approximately 11:30 a.m., the Mazda, with defendant still driving, passed through the CAIS in the lane closest to where De Leon was parked,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in the far left-hand lane of the three westbound lanes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 37-39 &amp; 89-90; Dkt. 26, Wilson Decl. at \u00b6 6). According\n   to De Leon, as the Mazda passed in front of his vehicle, Lewis was reclined in his seat making it difficult to see him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 13). De Leon asserts that defendant \"appeared to tense up his upper body as he passed\" and \"tilted his head slightly down and to the right[,] away from [him] and merging traffic[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). De Leon stated that this caught his attention, \"as it was not normal behavior for passing motorists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   De Leon then decided to pursue the Mazda \"for further observation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 14). Because the Mazda had \"a little bit of a head start,\" De Leon had to drive faster than the 70 miles per hour speed limit on the I-10 to catch up to it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Dkt. 60, Transcript at 42). Though he doesn't recall his exact speed, De Leon estimated that he was traveling somewhere in excess of 80, possibly up to 100 miles per hour. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 42-43). According to De Leon, when he caught up to the Mazda, the car was traveling over 80 miles per hour, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 15), and was in the left-hand westbound lane of the two-lane highway. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 50). Lewis testified that he was traveling with the flow of traffic, which was over 70 miles per hour. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   De Leon does not recall exactly how close he got to the Mazda when he eventually caught up to it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 50-51; Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 15). Lewis states that De Leon \"was traveling noticeably faster than [him], gaining ground on [him] quickly\" and that \"Agent De Leon drove his vehicle very close to [his], and tailgated [him], but did not immediately turn on his lights to stop [him] and did not pass [him].\" (Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 5). In his declaration, De Leon stated that as he was approaching the Mazda, Lewis \"could not pick a lane in which to travel\" and that he \"continuously swerved from the left lane to the right lane\" and also drove \"in the middle of two lanes for about a quarter of a mile.\" (Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 16). At the evidentiary hearing, however, De Leon testified that as he approached the Mazda, Lewis was not \"weaving in and out\" of traffic or from lane to lane, or suddenly changing speeds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 50-51 &amp; 54-55). De Leon also testified that Lewis did not attempt to evade him by exiting the I-10, and that Lewis did not increase his speed but \"actually started slowing down.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 54-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At some point after De Leon caught up with Lewis, the Mazda changed lanes from the left lane to the right lane. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 16; Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 6). Defendant states that when he saw the CBP vehicle behind him, he slowed down and moved to the right lane to allow the agent to pass him. (Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 6). According to De Leon, \"this is another tactic used by smugglers hoping that Border Patrol agents will pass them.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 15). After moving into the right lane, defendant found himself behind a large, slow-moving truck which caused him to \"slow[ ] down more.\" (Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 6). De Leon more or less corroborated Lewis's testimony, stating that he was \"pretty sure\" there was a large truck or another vehicle in front of defendant in the right-hand lane which was driving slower than defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 85). Defendant states that \"[w]hen the agent switched lanes to stay behind [him], but also did not turn on his lights to pull [him] over, [he] was not sure what to do. [He]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   was unsure whether [he] should stay in the right lane behind the truck, or switch lanes, speed up, and pass the truck.\" (Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 6). By this point, De Leon had reduced his speed to about 50 miles per hour \"in order to match the speed of the Mazda.\" (Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 17). During this time, De Leon was trying to determine if there was somebody in the passenger seat. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   De Leon subsequently activated his emergency lights and stopped the Mazda on the shoulder of I-10 near Defrain Boulevard, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 18), about five miles west of the CAIS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 54). De Leon does not recall at which point he caught up with the Mazda within that five mile section of the I-10. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). De Leon approached the Mazda and identified himself to defendant and Todd Lewis, whom he observed for the first time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 19). De Leon asked both occupants for their identification, and defendant produced an expired identification card and Todd Lewis produced a California identification card. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Neither defendant nor Todd Lewis had a valid driver's license. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). De Leon also asked about the ownership of the Mazda, and defendant responded that it was a rental. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Defendant explained that his girlfriend rented the vehicle and that he did not have the rental agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 60, Transcript at 59-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   De Leon claims he asked defendant whether he had any illegal contraband in the vehicle and that defendant responded that he had some weapons, specifically \"two long arms and three handguns in the trunk[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 24). According to De Leon, defendant then agreed to allow De Leon to \"verify that the weapons were not illegal or stolen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). De Leon asserts that he asked defendant and Todd Lewis to \"step out of the vehicle one-by-one\" to detain them while he verified the weapons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). De Leon claims that while he was detaining them, both defendant and Todd Lewis gave their consent for De Leon to search the \"entire vehicle and all of its contents.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31 &amp; 33-34).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 98; Dkt. 22, Lewis Decl. at \u00b6 8). According to defendant, De Leon did not ask whether he or Todd Lewis had guns or any other contraband before ordering them out of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wilson and Herrera arrived at the location of the stop at approximately 11:50 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, Wilson Decl. at \u00b6 9). Relying on De Leon's representation that defendant and Todd Lewis gave their consent for a search of the Mazda, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), Wilson and Herrera searched the vehicle and found numerous firearms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). The CBP agents then notified the ATF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). When ATF agents arrived, they opened packages found in the Mazda which contained additional weapons and magazines. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The Mazda did not initially catch De Leon's attention for driving erratically as it entered the Flying J. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 47-48). The Mazda did not appear to have a custom suspension system or tinted windows, both of which would have been consistent with smuggling tactics.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 11). De Leon's testimony at the evidentiary hearing, however, undermines his claim that defendant intentionally \"waited\" for him to clear the area.

So when you say he waited until you left the area, you just mean that he was still in the Flying J when you left the area, right? A. Yes, sir.\"). And neither De Leon's report nor his declaration provide an estimate as to how long Lewis remained inside the store before De Leon decided to leave the gas station. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 22-1, Report at 5-6; Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government argues that Lewis continued to act suspiciously at the CAIS because, according to De Leon, defendant \"appeared to tense up his upper body as he passed\" De Leon's patrol car and \"tilted his head slightly down and to the right[,] away from [De Leon] and merging traffic[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 26, Opp. at 16; Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 13). De Leon claims that defendant's conduct \"was not normal behavior for passing motorists.\" (Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6 13). De Leon's testimony at the evidentiary hearing, however, was inconsistent, if not contradictory, on this factor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lewis was in the far left-hand of the three westbound lanes as he passed through the CAIS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 37; Dkt. 26, Wilson Decl. at \u00b6 6). De Leon and Wilson were parked in the median just south of that lane, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 38), meaning they would\n   have been to Lewis's immediate\n   <em>\n    left\n   </em>\n   as he passed them. Because the three westbound lanes merged into two lanes after the CAIS, Lewis would have looked to his\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to locate merging traffic-not to his left toward the agents, because, of course, no merging traffic would be coming from that direction. Confronted with these facts at the evidentiary hearing, De Leon conceded as much.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39) (\"Q.

So if he wants to see where the other cars are, he's looking to the right, [correct]? A. Yes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   De Leon's credibility was further damaged at the hearing when he was impeached with evidence of recent untruthful and fraudulent behavior while on duty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 70-73). In his 15 years with CBP, De Leon has been investigated for misconduct on approximately five occasions, and was reprimanded for the misuse of his government-issued credit card. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-71). De Leon admitted that he had been reprimanded in 2015 for failing to pay a balance of more than $7,000 on his government-issued credit card and was again reprimanded in 2016 for misusing the card to pay for personal family expenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 71). De Leon acknowledged that during CBP's investigation into his credit card misuse, the investigating agent thought that De Leon was not being honest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 72). The investigator found that De Leon was \"deliberately vague and not completely forthcoming\" and that he frequently fell back on \"stating that he did not recall\" or by \"pleading ignorance of the facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52, Sealed Addendum to Joint Exhibit Stipulation, Exhibit 139, Defendant's Sealed Exhibit (\"Misconduct Report\") at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On the (questionable) basis of what he observed at the CAIS, De Leon decided to\n   pursue Lewis further. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26, De Leon Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). The government argues that \"akin to defendant's driving in\n   <em>\n    Valdes-Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\" Lewis's driving after going through the CAIS was suspicious because he \"was driving over 80 mph in 70 mph zone and then reduced his speed as if he did not want Agent De Leon to stay behind him.\" (Dkt. 26, Opp. at 16). According to the government, defendant \"swerved from the left lane to the right lane and even traveled in the middle of two lanes for about a quarter mile[,]\" and eventually \"reduced his speed to approximately 50 mph and would not pass any other vehicle on the road.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17). In response, defendant contends that he was traveling with the flow of traffic, which was above the 70 miles per hour speed limit, and that \"he saw a law enforcement vehicle bearing down on him at a high speed and then tailgating him; that he slowed down and then switched lanes to let the law enforcement vehicle pass; that when he switched lanes, the law enforcement vehicle switched lanes to stay behind him; that in the right lane he got stuck behind a slow moving truck; and then was distracted by having the law enforcement vehicle tailing him and unsure whether it was permissible for him to switch lanes to speed up and pass the truck.\" (Dkt. 65, Defendant's Post-Hear. Br. at 6-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 94-96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   De Leon's testimony at the evidentiary hearing appears to confirm defendant's account. For instance, De Leon estimated that he was driving up to 100 miles per hour to catch the Mazda and when pressed for an answer as to how close he got to the vehicle,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether he was tailgating defendant, De Leon responded that he \"didn't measure\" the distance and that he didn't remember. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 50-51). Further, De Leon testified that as he approached the Mazda, Lewis was not \"weaving in and out\" of traffic or from lane to lane, or suddenly changing speeds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51 &amp; 54-55). Nor did Lewis attempt to evade De Leon by exiting off of the I-10, and Lewis did not increase his speed but \"actually started slowing down.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast, the defendant's pickup truck in\n   <em>\n    Valdes-Vega\n   </em>\n   was \"traveling faster than the flow of traffic and passing many cars[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695243\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1074/#p1078\">\n    738 F.3d at 1076-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The truck made \"at least ten erratic lane changes without signaling\" and the CBP agent following the truck eventually lost sight of it \"because it was moving so quickly and weaving in and out of traffic.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695243\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1074/#p1078\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695243\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1074/#p1078\">\n    at 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the agent called another unit to assist him in tracking down the defendant, and when the second agent reached the truck, he observed that it was \"speeding at well over 90 miles per hour\" while the flow of traffic was about 70 or 80 miles per hour and the speed limit was 70 miles per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695243\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1074/#p1078\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, De Leon had no difficulty catching up to the Mazda and pulling defendant over within five miles of the CAIS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60, Transcript at 42 (De Leon accelerated from a full stop and caught the Mazda despite the Mazda's \"head start\" from the inspection station) &amp; 54 (De Leon stopped defendant five miles from the inspection station) ). Moreover, as noted above, the stop in\n   <em>\n    Valdes-Vega\n   </em>\n   took place near a border patrol checkpoint and after the truck had gone through the border check point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695243\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1074/#p1078\">\n    738 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1077 &amp; 1079.
