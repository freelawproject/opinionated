DAVILA, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Western World Insurance Company (\"Western World\") and Defendant Nonprofits Insurance Alliance of California (\"NIAC\") both issued insurance policies to Narconon International (\"Narconon\"). In this action, Western World seeks a judicial declaration that NIAC owes a duty to defend Narconon in two underlying lawsuits. Western World also requests reimbursement of an equitable share of the costs that it has incurred in defending Narconon. For its part, NIAC seeks a judicial declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment on NIAC's duty to defend. Western World's motion will be granted in part and denied in part, and NIAC's motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is an insurance declaratory judgment and equitable contribution action involving insurance policies issued to Narconon. The following facts are not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Narconon is an organization that promotes treatment for substance abuse and addiction. Stargardter Decl. \u00b6 8, Dkt. No. 35-2. Specifically, Narconon formulates and oversees a Scientology-based treatment program, which is implemented throughout the United States by local state affiliates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This case concerns two of those affiliates-Narconon of Georgia and Narconon of Oklahoma-that run individual drug treatment centers in Georgia and Oklahoma, respectively. Pursuant\n   to a set of License Agreements, Narconon provides materials for implementing the program and monitors operation of the centers; in return, Narconon receives ten percent of each center's revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Relevant here, Narconon is insured under three insurance policies, two issued by Western World and one issued by NIAC. Western World's two policies were issued to Narconon of Georgia and Narconon of Oklahoma in 2007, and both list Narconon as an additional insured. Evans Decl., Ex. A at 84, Dkt. No. 30-1; Evans Decl., Ex. B at 25, Dkt. No. 30-2. The third policy-issued by NIAC to Narconon for an overlapping time period-is the one at issue in the instant case. Evans Decl., Ex. C (\"NIAC Policy\") at 8, Dkt. No. 30-3. NIAC's policy has three separate coverage forms: (1) Commercial General Liability Coverage Form, (2) Liquor Liability Coverage Form, and (3) Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 12-13. The policy also includes an exclusion to the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form for bodily injury that was \"due to the rendering of or failure to render any professional service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. The question presented in this case is whether Narconon has the duty to defend two lawsuits under its coverage forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first lawsuit (\"the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action\") was brought on behalf of Patrick Desmond, who was a patient at Narconon of Georgia. Evans Decl., Ex. H \u00b6 27, Dkt. No. 31-4. On the evening of June 10, 2008, after consuming alcohol provided by Narconon staff at a staff member's apartment, Mr. Desmond left the premises with two former patients to purchase heroin and died early the next morning from a heroin overdose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-34. Mr. Desmond's family sued Narconon of Georgia and Narconon in May 2010, asserting claims for negligence, negligence per se, fraud, civil conspiracy, and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-58. Narconon tendered the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action to NIAC, but NIAC twice denied coverage, asserting that there was no \"occurrence\" triggering policy coverage and that the \"professional service\" exclusion applied. Evans Decl., Ex. O, Dkt. No. 32-7; Evans Decl., Ex. Q, Dkt. No. 33-1. In March 2012, Mr. Desmond's family amended the complaint and added civil RICO claims against Narconon of Georgia and Narconon. Evans Decl., Ex. I \u00b6\u00b6 167-76, Dkt. No. 32-1. Both Narconon and Western World tendered the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action to NIAC, but NIAC declined to defend for the same reasons it had stated with regard to the original complaint. Evans Decl., Ex. R, Dkt. No. 33-2; Evans Decl., Ex. S, Dkt. No. 33-3; Evans Decl., Ex. T, Dkt. No. 33-4. The\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action proceeded past summary judgment, and the parties settled in February 2013. Evans Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The second lawsuit (\"the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action\") was brought on behalf of Heather Landmeier, who was a patient at Narconon of Oklahoma. Evans Decl., Ex. M \u00b6 15, Dkt. No. 32-5. The action alleges that, from late August 2007 through early March 2008, employees provided drugs and alcohol to Ms. Landmeier and allowed her to enter into sexual relationships with staff members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. On March 4, 2008, Narconon of Oklahoma forced Ms. Landmeier to leave the facility, despite knowledge that she had relapsed and had become addicted to heroin and oxycontin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The day after her expulsion, Ms. Landmeier overdosed on heroin and oxycontin, leaving her in a vegetative state paralyzed from the neck down.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Her family initiated suit in March 2010 and asserted claims for negligence, breach of contract, violation of the Oklahoma Consumer Protection Act, infliction of emotional distress, and punitive damages against Narconon of Oklahoma and Narconon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-37. Narconon tendered the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   lawsuit to NIAC, and NIAC accepted the defense under the Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form but not under the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form. Evans Decl. \u00b6 68. However, NIAC later withdrew its defense, stating that its insurance was \"excess\" to Western World's policy. Evans Decl., Ex. X, Dkt. No. 34-1; Evans Decl., Ex. Y, Dkt. No. 34-2. Litigation in the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action is ongoing, and trial has not yet been scheduled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Western World filed the instant lawsuit in October 2014. Dkt. No. 1. Because Western World agreed to defend Narconon in both the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   actions, Western World seeks a declaration that NIAC also has a duty to defend the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   actions and requests an equitable share of the costs that Western World has incurred to date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In November 2014, NIAC answered and filed counterclaims asserting that it has no duty to defend or indemnify either the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action or the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action. Dkt. No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 11, 2015, Western World moved for summary judgment on NIAC's duty to defend. Dkt. No. 27 (\"Mot.\"). On December 28, 2015, NIAC responded and cross-moved for summary judgment on its duty to defend and indemnify. Dkt. No. 35 (\"Cross Mot.\"). Western World filed its opposition and reply on January 11, 2016, Dkt. No. 37 (\"Opp.\"), and NIAC filed its reply on January 19, 2016, Dkt. No. 39 (\"Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Western World filed two requests for judicial notice. The first Request for Judicial Notice (\"Pl.'s RJN\"), Dkt. No. 29, is GRANTED as to both Exhibit A (Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant Narconon Internationals's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or, In the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment or Partial Summary Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Desmond v.

NIAC seeks a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend either the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action or the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action under any of the coverage forms.

First, as to the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action alone, NIAC contends that Mr. Desmond's claimed \"bodily injury\" was not caused by an \"occurrence.\" Second, as to both the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   actions, NIAC asserts that the \"bodily injur[ies]\" allegedly suffered by Mr. Desmond and Ms. Landmeier come within the \"professional service\" exclusion because their injuries were \"due to the rendering of or failure to render [a] professional service.\" The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Mot. at 13-14. Concentrating on the causes of action in the complaint, NIAC responds that all of Mr. Desmond's claims against Narconon involve intentional, not accidental, conduct. Cross Mot. at 15-16. The Court agrees with Western World.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The original complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action alleges that \"[Mr. Desmond] was drinking beer and vodka with [Narconon of Georgia] employees and staff members in a staff member's apartment,\" that he \"bec[ame] highly intoxicated with [those] employees and staff members,\" and that he \"left the illegal housing program's premises with two former patients of [Narconon of Georgia] who had announced their intention to attempt to buy heroin.\" Evans Decl., Ex. H \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Mr. Desmond died of a heroin overdose the next morning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. Based on those facts, the complaint avers that Narconon of Georgia acted negligently in \"allowing and facilitating [Mr.] Desmond's on-going use of alcohol and drugs while in treatment\" and in \"failing to provide reasonable and adequate security and supervision to prevent its patients ... from leaving its housing program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37c-d. Neither the actions nor the result were intended or foreseen. Instead, the neglectful provision of alcohol to and deficient supervision of a patient in rehab leading to the patient's unexpected death constitute an \"occurrence\" or \"accident.\" Although the negligence claims are asserted against Narconon of Georgia alone, the complaint supplies a sufficient basis for attributing\n   those actions to Narconon. Specifically, it alleges that Narconon of Georgia is a \"subsidiary, licensee and/or alter ego\" of Narconon and that Narconon exercises some control over the drug rehabilitation facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 16. At a minimum, the allegations raise the potential for coverage, as the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action sought damages from Narconon for \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The same holds true for the amended complaint. The factual allegations regarding the events underlying Mr. Desmond's death are virtually identical to the allegations in the original complaint. See Evans Decl., Ex. I \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, 64-65. Although the amended complaint adds civil RICO claims against Narconon and Narconon of Georgia, it retains the negligence causes of action against Narconon of Georgia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146, 167-76. Finally, the amended complaint includes the same allegations about the relationship between Narconon and Narconon of Georgia, while also providing further detail about Narconon's intricate involvement and control over Narconon of Georgia's operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10, 13, 16, 32. As the trial court later observed in its summary judgment ruling, \"there is evidence presented from which a jury could conclude that [Narconon], through [Narconon of Georgia], undertook the duty of providing services to [Mr.] Desmond and failed to exercise reasonable care in carrying out that assumed duty.\" Pl.'s RJN, Ex. B at 7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (explaining that Narconon might be liable for Narconon of Georgia's actions because \"a jury could conclude that [Narconon of Georgia] was an agent or instrumentality of [Narconon]\"). Like the original complaint, the amended complaint contains enough allegations to trigger the duty to defend because there is potential for coverage based on an \"occurrence\" that caused Mr. Desmond's \"bodily injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   NIAC's primary response is that the legal causes of action asserted against Narconon all involve intentional acts. But, as noted above, the complaint raises the potential that Narconon is liable for the negligent acts of Narconon of Georgia. Moreover, the California courts have repeatedly instructed that the duty to defend does not depend on \"technical legal cause[s] of action pleaded by the third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

Cross Mot. at 20. First, the California courts have already rejected a species of this same argument. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Food Pro\n   </em>\n   , the California Court of Appeal held that an engineering consultant's failure to prevent bodily injury on-site was a breach of a common law duty, not the performance of a professional service.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    89 Cal.Rptr.3d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so ruling, the Court of Appeal rejected as too broad the argument that \"[the consultant] was only at the site to perform his professional duties; thus, any act of his at the site that resulted in injury 'arises from' a professional service and is covered by the exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, and relatedly, the consequences of accepting NIAC's argument are too far-reaching to be tolerated. NIAC effectively seeks to exclude from coverage every act by an employee at a round-the-clock treatment facility by relabeling those acts as \"departure[s] from treatment protocols.\" Cross Mot. at 20. That sweeping interpretation of \"professional service\" cannot be correct, as it bars coverage for even heinous acts that have nothing to do with the underlying profession, like the acts alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For many of the same reasons, NIAC's attempts to recast Mr. Desmond's and Ms. Landmeier's claims as pertaining only to Narconon's failure to treat patients in the program also fail. NIAC cannot usurp the duty to defend by broadly reframing the complaints to advance one particular theory of liability; instead, the Court must examine the factual allegations in the complaints.\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20657\">\n    108 Cal.Rptr.2d at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the complaints in the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   actions can properly be construed as bringing claims for Narconon's failure to provide the drug and alcohol rehabilitation services it was hired to perform, they also seek to hold Narconon liable for negligently providing alcohol and drugs and allowing sexual relationships between patients and staff. Therefore, the \"professional service\" exclusion does not definitively apply, and NIAC has a duty to defend both the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   actions under the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Western World's motion for summary judgment with respect to the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form and DENIES NIAC's motion for summary judgment with respect to the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Civ. Code \u00a7 1641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Within the context of the Liquor Liability Coverage Form, the word \"furnishing\" contemplates business relations. The policy itself does not explicitly define \"furnishing,\" but the meaning is clear from the way the word is used. The coverage section provides indemnity for damages liability \"by reason of the selling, serving or furnishing of any alcoholic beverage.\" The words immediately surrounding \"furnishing\"-\"selling [or] serving\"-involve commercial interactions. Those neighboring words provide a frame of reference for the intended scope of the entire clause and give \"furnishing\" more precise meaning. The word \"furnishing\" also appears in Exclusion 2.d, which exempts from coverage injury \"arising out of any alcoholic beverage sold, served or furnished while any required license is suspended or after such license is expires, is cancelled or revoked.\" NIAC Policy at 45. Not only does that exclusion presume that the insured normally operates pursuant to a license, but it also expressly identifies the act of furnishing alcohol as one that would require a license to perform. More broadly, the rest of the Liquor Liability Coverage Form is plainly focused on an entity that is in the business of selling, serving, or furnishing alcohol. For example, Exclusions 2.b and 2.c relate to separate obligations that an insured employer may owe to its employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Exclusion 2.e applies when the injury underlying the suit arises out of \"goods or products\" that are \"manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by\" the insured or its affiliates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    at 45, 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These textual clues provide powerful evidence that the word \"furnishing\" in the Liquor Liability Coverage Form is limited to business interactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This reading of \"furnishing\" also harmonizes with the overall policy scheme because it produces symmetry between the Liquor Liability Coverage Form and the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form. Specifically, the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form includes Exclusion 2.c that parallels the Liquor Liability Coverage Form. That exclusion is titled \"Liquor Liability\"-the mirror image of \"Liquor Liability Coverage\"-and applies to an insured that is \"in the business of manufacturing, distributing, selling, serving or furnishing alcoholic beverages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Exclusion 2.c's addition of \"manufacturing\" and \"distributing\" makes the language an inexact match, the remaining language (\"selling, serving or furnishing alcoholic beverages\") tracks the Liquor Liability Coverage Form's coverage. Moreover, the exact three categories removed from Exclusion 2.c (causing or contributing to intoxication, provision of alcohol to a minor or drunkard, and violation of an alcohol related statute) are expressly excepted from Liquor Liability Coverage.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    at 45-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, liability for those three categories falls under Commercial General Liability Coverage but not Liquor Liability Coverage. These structural choices strongly suggest that the drafters intended exclusivity in the two coverage forms, as another district court has concluded for a nearly identically worded policy.\n   <em>\n    N.E. Ins. Co. v. Masonmar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-00364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201247604\">\n    2014 WL 1247604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2014). This structure lends further support to NIAC's argument that the Liquor Liability Coverage Form does not apply when the insured is not in the business of \"furnishing\" alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The contextual understanding of \"furnishing\" accords with common usage. In the dictionary, \"furnish\" is defined as \"provide with what is needed\" or \"supply; give.\"\n   <em>\n    Furnish\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 2001),\n   <em>\n    cited in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v. Safeway, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054398\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/209/1455/\">\n    209 Cal.App.4th 1455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20809\">\n    147 Cal.Rptr.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (2012). Those definitions naturally describe a commercial setting-for example, a business might be said to \"furnish alcoholic beverages\" when it provides the supply of alcohol to a retailer or sells alcohol to a patron.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20809\">\n    147 Cal.Rptr.3d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a sale of beer qualifies as furnishing alcohol). Although the definitions are not necessarily limited to business interactions, their fit in a more informal situation is at best awkward. Indeed, it would be a strange choice of words for a host organizing a potluck to ask one friend to furnish the appetizer, another friend to furnish the dessert, and a third friend to furnish the alcohol. And, in any event, that broad understanding of \"furnishing\" is foreclosed by the many circumstantial considerations discussed above. In sum, as used in the Liquor Liability Coverage Form, \"the ... furnishing of [an] alcoholic beverage\" is best understood as referring to a business interaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In light of that construction, NIAC owes no duty to defend either the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action or the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action under the Liquor Liability Coverage Form. In particular, that form provides no possibility for coverage because neither lawsuit involves the providing of alcohol in a business or formal setting. The\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action alleges that Mr. Desmond was drinking alcohol with Narconon of Georgia staff members at a staff member's apartment, Evans Decl., Ex. H \u00b6 30; the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action alleges that Narconon of Oklahoma employees gave alcohol to Ms. Landmeier, Evans Decl., Ex. M \u00b6 16. Western World itself disclaims any professional interaction by (correctly) arguing against application of the \"professional service\" exclusion for the Commercial General Liability Coverage Form. Moreover, the exclusivity of the\n   Commercial General Liability and Liquor Liability Coverage Forms further weakens Western World's contention that both coverage forms are simultaneously triggered by the informal furnishing of alcohol at issue in the two lawsuits. The Court concludes that NIAC does not have a duty to defend either the\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   action or the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action under the Liquor Liability Coverage Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, the Court DENIES Western World's motion for summary judgment with respect to the Liquor Liability Coverage Form and GRANTS NIAC's motion for summary judgment with respect to the Liquor Liability Coverage Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form states that NIAC will indemnify Narconon for \" 'bodily injury' arising from 'improper sexual conduct.' \" NIAC Policy at 69. The policy defines \"bodily injury\" as \"bodily injury, sickness or disease including emotional distress or anguish sustained by a person, including death\" and defines \"improper sexual conduct\" as \"actual, attempted, or alleged unlawful sexual conduct by one person ... as prohibited by federal or state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74.

Evans Decl., Ex. X. NIAC no longer pursues that course, likely because Western World's policy clearly provides \"occurrence\"-based coverage, not \"claims\"-based coverage. Evans Decl., Ex. B at 44. Instead, NIAC raises two new arguments against coverage of the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action under the Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form. First, NIAC contends that the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action does not assert claims against Narconon as a result of improper sexual conduct. Cross Mot. at 24. Second, NIAC asserts that, as a matter of equity, the specialized coverage available under the Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form should be deemed in excess to the primary coverage afforded by Western World's policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. The Court analyzes each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the Court disagrees with NIAC's argument that the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action asserts no claims against Narconon arising from improper sexual conduct. NIAC does not contest that Narconon employees engaged in \"improper sexual conduct\" when they entered into sexual relationships with their patient, Ms. Landmeier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n    Okla.

Code \u00a7 86:11-3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that counselors \"shall not have any type of sexual contact with clients and shall not counsel persons with whom they have had a sexual relationship\"). Rather, Narconon contends that \"[t]he basis for liability against [Narconon] is its failure to provide the drug rehabilitation services as promised.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is an incomplete description of the complaint. As Narconon acknowledges, the complaint pleads claims that Narconon was negligent in the hiring,\n   training, or supervision of its employees, that Narconon failed to comply with federal and state law, and that Narconon's negligence caused Ms. Landmeier's injuries. Evans Decl., Ex. M \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. The complaint further asserts claims for infliction of emotional distress based on Narconon's outrageous conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 32-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such claims appear to reference or encompass Ms. Landmeier's allegations about Narconon's improperly allowing its employees to enter into sexual relationships with her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2086%3A11-3-5\">\n    \u00b6 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Ms. Landmeier's injuries are sufficiently tied to the sexual conduct under the permissive standard associated with use of the phrase \"arising from.\" Indeed, when Narconon tendered the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action to NIAC, NIAC initially accepted the defense under the Improper Sexual Conduct Coverage Form. Evans Decl. \u00b6 68. Therefore, the complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Landmeier\n   </em>\n   action raises the potential for coverage of claims for \" 'bodily injury' arising from 'improper sexual conduct.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, NIAC does not supply a sound legal basis for concluding that its Improper Sexual Conduct coverage is in excess to Western World's policy. NIAC's policy provides that Improper Sexual Conduct coverage is \"excess\" only when there is other applicable insurance written on a claims-made basis, NIAC Policy at 72, a condition which NIAC does not argue is satisfied. To get around this fact, NIAC argues that Western World's coverage has the greater primacy, but NIAC's sole cited authority,\n   <em>\n    Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. v.

That case involved an insurer who had already paid for its insured's loss and, standing in the insured's place, sought subrogation to the insured's express contractual indemnification claims against a party who had caused the loss.

Putting aside that Narconon's interests might be best served by a successful defense that completely shields it from any liability, NIAC's argument again rests on the mistaken premise that Western World's coverage is primary.
