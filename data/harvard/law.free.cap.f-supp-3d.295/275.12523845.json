(\"Adidas America\") and Adidas AG on November 5, 2015, bringing claims for breach of contract, defamation and unjust enrichment. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 104-16, 126-31, Docket Entry No. 1.) LPD also sought relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2202, pertaining to disputes regarding its use of Defendants' trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117-25.) Defendant Adidas America moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def. Adidas America Mot. to Dismiss (\"Adidas Am. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 20; Def. Adidas America Mem. in Supp. of Adidas Am. Mot. (\"Adidas Am. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 21.) LPD moved for partial summary judgment on its claims for breach of contract, defamation and declaratory relief, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Pl. Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By order dated April 6, 2016, the Court referred both motions to Chief Magistrate Judge Roanne L. Mann. (Order dated Apr. 6, 2016.) By report and recommendation dated August 25, 2016 (the \"R &amp; R\"), Judge Mann recommended that the Court grant Adidas America's motion to dismiss LPD's breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims, deny the motion as to LPD's defamation and unjust enrichment claims, and deny LPD's motion for partial summary judgment. (R &amp; R, Docket Entry No. 39.) LPD objected to the R &amp; R in part. (Pl. Obj. to the R &amp; R (\"Pl. Obj.\"), Docket Entry No. 49.) Adidas America did not file objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By Memorandum and Order dated March 27, 2017 (the \"March 2017 Decision\"), the Court adopted Judge Mann's recommendations in their entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LPD New York, LLC v.

The Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss LPD's breach of contract and declaratory relief claims, denied the motion as to the defamation and unjust enrichment claims, denied LPD's motion for summary judgment as to the defamation, breach of contract\n   and declaratory relief claims, and granted LPD leave to amend the Complaint to assert quasi-contract claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   LPD now moves the Court to reconsider the portion of the March 2017 Decision dismissing LPD's breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims, and alternatively moves the Court to certify the contract formation issue for appeal in the event the Court denies the reconsideration motion.

Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   LPD is a fashion company that creates \"streetwear\" products. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) In October of 2013, Defendants contacted LPD to discuss a possible \"collaboration\" in which LPD would create unique streetwear-style designs for Defendants' brand and five National Collegiate Athletic Association (\"NCAA\") basketball teams sponsored by Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) LPD expressed interest in the collaboration and later developed two design \"capsules\" for the collaboration: a \"Classics Capsule\" and a \"Collaboration Capsule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) The Classics Capsule consisted of \"a series of design proposals for NCAA Basketball Teams, which included prints for tee shirts, basketball jerseys, basketball shorts, and team jackets\" that Defendants would help design in collaboration with LPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) The Collaboration Capsule consisted of \"a series of design proposals for basketball jerseys, tee-shirts, outerwear, jackets, hats, shorts, sports bras, lanyards and pants\" for an athletic-streetwear collection designed primarily by LPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After receiving some preliminary prints for the Classics Capsule, Defendants responded that they were \"excited\" about the designs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 17, 2013, LPD asked Defendants how the pieces from the Classics Capsule \"should/will be branded (with both LPD and Adidas logos) and how/where they will be distributed (in Adidas' stores/distributors or otherwise).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Defendants responded that \"the rules are really what [the parties] want them to be\" because the project was the first time Adidas' basketball division was \"coordinating with a fashion brand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Defendants subsequently proposed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Branding\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Due to NCAA rules the uniforms can only be branded adidas. So our actual on court product we will be badged as adidas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   There is an opportunity for co-branding on your retail pieces and our Satin Jacket. Our designers could collab for a cool jocktag or woven label that would be badged with both logos.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If you want to just badge your product LPD only we understand the option but we would want to at least show a true collaboration to demonstrate \"court to street.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Retail\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This part is also new. But after having [internal] discussion[s] ... we have a few options of where we would retail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Adidas.com\n   </em>\n   -Our own retail would love to feature this [as] an exclusive collection. Your retail pieces are at a price point where we could feature our retail shorts with your retail pieces and make it an exclusive release online.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Your retailers-because these pieces are at a higher price point than our sales reps deal with your access to boutique and footprint accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   NYC stop-in-shop. We would do an in-store collab where we split the store in half with your retail and some of our higher price point retail and highlight this collection but gain momentum for both brands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Or the option of all [three]. Let me know your thought as I think we will have to write our rules because this has not happened with an actual on-court kit before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original).) LPD replied that it liked the idea of the collaboration and wanted to get to work on the tags and labels for the pieces, was interested in exploring all of the proposed retail options, and could get to work on \"visuals\" as soon as it had \"samples of the first approved products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) In addition, LPD asked if \"it would be possible to get a letter of intent for the collaboration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants thought \"a letter of intent [would be] perfect\" and agreed to \"work on putting some of this into a document with the purpose of this along with details.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27 (alterations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 13, 2014, LPD informed Defendants that it was going to begin creating samples from the Classics Capsule design proposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) On February 25, 2014, LPD sent Defendants \"a concept proposal for the Collaboration Capsule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) By March of 2014, Defendants had not responded, and LPD followed up to get Defendants' feedback regarding the Collaboration Capsule and a letter of intent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) A week later, Defendants replied, stating that they approved of the designs for the Collaboration Capsule and that \"[t]he letter of intent is a work in progress\" due to some \"development[al] boundaries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Defendants also provided \"some key next steps,\" which included finalization of the \"[l]etter of intent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) LPD then asked how the parties would divide or allocate the \"sales and profits,\" to which Defendants responded that the products from the Classics Capsule would be provided to the NCAA teams at no cost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) Defendants further stated that their licensed apparel division would purchase the Collaboration Capsule materials related to the NCAA teams, the \"royalties [from those sales] would go to the schools,\" and the \"capsule collection profits would likely be primarily profits to LPD\" because Defendants' products were mainly \"on court school products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Defendants also stated that the details of the collaboration would be finalized and confirmed \"once the mission statement is complete.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, LPD asked that Defendants \"just let [LPD] know the specifics and that everything is confirmed once [Defendants] know[ ] for sure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After beginning to make arrangements to prepare samples of products for both capsules, LPD contacted Defendants to determine who would cover the costs of producing the samples and to specify the location of the manufacturing for the final products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 41.) Defendants gave LPD a \"budget code\" to pay for the production of the samples and stated that the final products would be manufactured in Defendants' facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42.) Because LPD's \"pattern-and-sample maker\" refused to accept Defendants budget code to cover the sample production costs, LPD paid the costs and sought reimbursement from Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 12, 2014, Defendants notified LPD that there was a \"large re-alignment within [its] group,\" [placing] many of [Defendants'] projects ... on hold.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Nevertheless, Defendants told LPD that it wanted to finalize and launch the collaboration and instructed LPD to do the following: (1) send the \"art\" from the capsules for Defendants to review, (2) send information regarding the Classics Capsule for Defendants' \"teams\" to \"agree and sign off,\" and (3) keep any information regarding the teams involved in the collaboration confidential. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants also agreed to reimburse the sample production costs and told LPD that further details regarding the collaboration should be handled in \"the next few weeks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As to the prices for the collaboration products, LPD informed Defendants that they could not \"pin down exact[ ] [pricing] since it depends on production (specifically whether LPD is producing the pieces here or at [Defendants'] facilities abroad and how many units ... are ordered.\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (alterations omitted).) LPD also requested \"some sort of confirmation that the collaboration ... will be happening.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants responded that \"the collaboration would only be confirmed once [Defendants] were '100% on board' \" and could \"dedicate more funding for the collaboration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following week, LPD followed up, again asking about the location of the manufacturing and also sending Defendants its final design proposal for the collaboration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Defendants responded that \"upper management approved the designs\" and gave LPD \" 'permission to move forward' with the collaboration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Defendants subsequently sent LPD sample products that it produced based on the Classics Capsule and allowed LPD to pitch products from both capsules to potential buyers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.) Thereafter, LPD notified Defendants that its buyers were interested in the products and inquired as to the status of the reimbursement for the sample production costs it had incurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.) Defendants expressed their intent to reimburse the sample production costs, noted that they were having a meeting soon to discuss \"a marketing budget and promotional plan,\" and stated that they had \"enough signoff to continue to push through and continue on with the collab[oration].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60 (alterations omitted).) During a subsequent telephone call, LPD informed Defendants it would soon begin producing \"marketing materials\" to promote the collaboration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On September 8, 2014, LPD began selling women's clothing items from the collaboration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) LPD also secured promotional publications with several online\n   and print media outlets and continued to promote the collaboration in various places. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72-73, 76.) As part of its promotion efforts, LPD created a \"provocative\" marketing video for the Collaboration Capsule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) In November of 2014, V Magazine reached out to LPD, seeking to secure an exclusive feature of the Collaboration Capsule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) LPD agreed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) After V Magazine published the feature, a representative from Defendants called one of V Magazine's senior editors and told her that the collaboration was \"illegitimate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.) As a result, V Magazine withdrew the feature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After getting in touch with the representative who had contacted V Magazine, LPD provided him with information about Defendants' personnel through whom the collaboration had been taking place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.) LPD also reached out to their contacts at Defendants' company, seeking clarification of the basis for the statement made by Defendants' representative to V Magazine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) Defendants responded that the promotional material regarding the collaboration \"took another route\" than what the parties had discussed and \"raised some flags\" with its public relations team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Defendants also told LPD that the executive who approved the collaboration was no longer with the company and while they \"did provide initial green lights to proceed, ... all content needed to be approved by [Defendants'] higher ups.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) LPD expressed its confusion and sent Defendants copies of all the materials it had regarding the collaboration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Defendants then told LPD that the \"products are good to go\" but the promotional video could not be shown anymore and any sales from the Classics Capsule had to be placed on hold because it could cause legal issues with the NCAA teams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   LPD continued to promote and sell items from the Collaboration Capsule but, in January of 2015, a buyer refused to accept delivery and pay for the items because he doubted the legitimacy of the collaboration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 94-95.) To resolve the issue, LPD requested that Defendants send the buyer a letter confirming the collaboration's legitimacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) Defendants sent the letter but the buyer requested additional assurance, and LPD requested further confirmation of the collaboration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In May of 2015, Defendants sent LPD a \"back-dated licensing agreement\" dated June 1, 2014, which provided that LPD had the right to \"use the [A]didas name and the Three-Stripes trademark\" for both capsules \"provided LPD paid 10% royalties\" to Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) The proposed licensing agreement also sought to \"terminate LPD's right to manufacture and sell pieces from the Classics and Collaboration Capsules\" as of May 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) LPD refused to sign the agreement and again requested reimbursement for the sample production costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-02.) Defendants threatened to sue LPD for trademark infringement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Procedural background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Based on the foregoing, LPD filed the Complaint in this action, bringing claims for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief pertaining to disputes regarding its use of Defendants' trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 104-26.) After Defendants moved to dismiss and LPD moved for partial summary judgment, the Court referred both motions to Judge Mann. (Order dated Apr. 6, 2016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As relevant here, Judge Mann recommended that the Court dismiss the breach of contract claim, finding that LPD's allegations failed to show the formation of a contract. (R &amp; R 21-25.) Judge Mann also recommended that the Court dismiss\n   LPD's trademark abandonment claims because, even assuming that Defendants gave LPD a license to use their trademarks, Defendants exercised sufficient control over LPD's use of their trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   LPD objected to the R &amp; R, arguing that Judge Mann erred in recommending dismissal of the breach of contract claim because: (1) neither party expressed an intention not to be bound absent a formalized agreement; (2) the parties abandoned any intention to formalize an agreement; (3) the absence of a formal agreement does not preclude finding that the parties formed a contract; (4) the parties agreed on the \"material terms\" of the contract and New York law gap-fills any terms that were not agreed upon; and (5) Defendants' conduct \"expressly recognized\" the existence of a contract. (Pl. Obj. 22-34, 37-42.) LPD also argued that Judge Mann erred because Defendants \"expressly authorized\" LPD to use Defendants' trademarks and Defendants granted LPD a \"naked license\" because they never inspected the quality of the collaboration merchandise. (Pl. Obj. 42-44.) Because LPD objected to Judge Mann's recommendations as to LPD's breach of contract and trademark abandonment claims, the Court reviewed Defendants' motion as to those claims\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LPD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201162181\">\n    2017 WL 1162181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4, *6-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the March 2017 Decision, the Court dismissed LPD's breach of contract claim because LPD's allegations failed to establish the existence of a binding contract between LPD and Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201162181\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *6 -13.

[and] to determine if an agreement is a Type II preliminary agreement [courts must consider] (1) whether the intent to be bound is revealed by the language of the agreement; (2) the context of the negotiations; (3) the existence of open terms; (4) partial performance; and (5) the necessity of putting the agreement in final form, as indicated by the customary form of such transactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vacold LLC v.
