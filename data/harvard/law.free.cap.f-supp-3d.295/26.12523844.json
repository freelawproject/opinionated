Plaintiffs and Defendant Massachusetts Human Resources Division (\"HRD\") have jointly moved to modify the consent decrees controlling entry-level police officers in eight communities\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and entry-level firefighters in four communities\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). While agreeing on several key modifications, the parties disagree on the factors to be considered in defining the \"qualified labor pool\" and the appropriate end point for the decrees. After a hearing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALLOWS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion to modify in part and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALLOWS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to modify in part.

The History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The two consent decrees that have governed the hiring of entry-level police officers and firefighters were entered in the 1970s in two separate cases. In both\n   <em>\n    Beecher\n   </em>\n   (involving firefighters in Springfield) and\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   (involving police officers in Boston), the courts found that the entrance examinations administered by HRD had a racially discriminatory effect and imposed ratios for hiring Black and Hispanic candidates in most cities as the remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The First Circuit ordered HRD to create hiring certification lists using fixed ratios of minorities (Black and Hispanic) and other applicants, \"perhaps one from the priority pool to every one, two or three from the second pool, until the priority pool has been exhausted.\"\n   <em>\n    Castro v. Beecher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724296\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/459/725/#p737\">\n    459 F.2d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (1st Cir. 1972). It later described the prescribed procedure that applied to Boston police officers as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   consent decree required HRD to prepare certification lists by creating two groups. The first, \"Group A,\" would \"consist of all Black and Spanish-surnamed applicants who pass a future police entrance examination and are otherwise qualified for appointment on the basis of existing requirements.\" The second, \"Group B,\" would \"consist of all other persons who pass a future police entrance examination and are otherwise qualified for appointment on the basis of existing requirements.\" When an appointing authority, such as the City [of Boston], sought to hire police officers, it would send a request to HRD, which would send the appointing authority a certification list ordered \"on the basis of one candidate from Group A for every candidate certified from Group B.\" In making its hiring decisions, if the appointing authority chose to reject a candidate\n   in favor of another candidate who appeared lower on the HRD list, HRD would not approve the appointment unless the appointing authority \"furnished [HRD] with a written statement of [its] reasons\" for doing so; HRD would then provide a \"written statement of those reasons to ... the candidate upon written request.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   decree was to remain in effect for a given city until that city's police department \"achieves a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

In 1992, the First Circuit rejected the argument that even if the goals of the\n   <em>\n    Beecher\n   </em>\n   decree had not yet been accomplished, the decree was \"constitutionally infirm because it [swept] too broadly.\"\n   <em>\n    Mackin v.

The Court released Boston, which was subject to a one-to-one ratio, in 2004.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeLeo v. City of Boston\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-12538-PBS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%205740819\">\n    2004 WL 5740819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11 (D. Mass. Nov. 23, 2004). As of January 2018, the police consent decree remains binding on eight municipalities and the firefighter consent decree on four. All but one are required to use a certification list based on a one-to-three ratio. Springfield is subject to a one-to-one ratio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Cap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In August 2016, the parties discovered that the consent decrees were actually having the adverse and unintended effect of \"capping\" minority representation in certain remaining consent-decree cities. The one-to-three ratio effectively created a cap on minority hiring in cities that had a minority population that exceeded 25 percent. As the minority population in these cities increased after the 1970s, the formula, which was supposed to remedy the effects of the racially discriminatory examinations, unfortunately turned out to impede minority hiring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   HRD explains: \"Despite census data reflecting Black and Hispanic citizenry exceeding 40% of the total population in all five remaining cities with populations below 100,000, minority exam-passers (while often a majority on these cities' hiring lists) are effectively limited by the decrees to only 25% of certification list slots until one of the racial pools is exhausted.\" Dkt. No. 32 at 3-4. Due to the \"changing demographics\" of the consent decree cities and the fact that many more minority candidates are taking and passing the exams, the HRD states that application of the certification ratios contributed to municipalities' inability to make progress towards parity and therefore procure release from the consent decrees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To remedy this problem, the parties jointly agree that this Court must modify the decrees to suspend the application of their ratio requirements when they would\n   lower the rank order of minority candidates on certification lists. This Court allowed the joint motion to modify the consent decrees on September 14, 2016. Dkt. No. 10. This so-called \"safety valve\" modification required HRD to suspend the application of the certification ratios otherwise required under the consent decrees when such application would reduce the number of qualified minority candidates who would otherwise appear on a certification list or lower the rank of qualified Black or Hispanic candidates. Since the modifications went into effect, 15 of the 18 certification lists were issued in strict rank order in accordance with the safety valve modifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During a September 2016 hearing, the Court ordered the parties to address three subjects: (1) potential remedies for minority candidates who had been passed over due to the terms of the consent decree \"cap\"; (2) steps to be taken to help the cities reach the goal of parity identified in the consent decrees; and (3) given the age of the consent decrees, whether they should be terminated before \"parity\" was reached in the remaining consent-decree cities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) provides \"on motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\" if \"the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged ... or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\" More broadly, a court may relieve a party from an order for \"any other reason that justifies relief.\" Fed.

Commendably, they have worked well together to address the adverse effect of the cap and develop a narrowly tailored remedy. While disagreements remain, at the outset it should be noted that the gulf between the parties' positions is not as great as the briefing might suggest. Both parties agree that to cure the harm created by the ratios, the 25 percent cap on Black and Hispanic candidates should be lifted and the consent decrees should retain guaranteed spots for minorities with remaining slots filled without regard to race; that ties on the certification list should go in favor of minority candidates;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   that a qualified and properly defined labor pool-rather than the city's general population-should be used to measure parity; that ratios in Lawrence, Chelsea, and Holyoke (which have over 50 percent minority populations) should be changed to a one-to-one ratio; that prior to any conditional offers of employment, the appointing authority must replace the name of any minority who fails to respond or declines the position with the next-ranked minority candidate who is willing to accept; and that the parties should appear annually to update the Court on the progress of the decrees. As such, these modifications were adopted without objection by the Court on December 19, 2017. Dkt. No. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government identified 55 minority individuals whose candidacies likely were negatively affected by the cap between 2012 and 2015 and gave them priority in future certifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 21, 24. However, HRD was unable to identify candidates earlier than 2012 because of a change in computer systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   What continues to be the subject of dispute between the parties is which factors should be considered for defining the qualified labor pool, and whether the Court should modify the endpoint of \"parity\" in determining when the consent decrees should terminate. The parties also disagree as to whether this Court should release the Springfield Fire Department from the 1974 firefighter consent decree immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Qualified Labor Pool\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties agree that this Court should modify the benchmark for defining parity. The original consent decrees use general minority (Black and Hispanic) population as the benchmark for determining parity, but the parties agree that a qualified labor pool is a better measure. However, they dispute the methodology for determining the qualified labor pool. Courts have the discretion to \"decide what the most appropriate labor pool is and whether the expert's method utilized the best and most appropriate available labor pool information.\"\n   <em>\n    Malave v.

The Commission's statistics indicate that 655 Blacks are incarcerated per 100,000 in the population in Massachusetts, compared to 1,627 Blacks per 100,000 in the nation. However, 401 Hispanics are incarcerated per 100,000 in Massachusetts, as opposed to 362 per 100,000 in the nation. Mass.

Thus, the combined statewide rate of incarceration of minorities appears to be lower than the nationwide rate. The Court does not understand the precise impact of this Sentencing Commission data on the qualified labor pool, but a supplemental report is necessary to reflect available statewide data or to explain why that data is inapplicable or unreliable. Plaintiffs also contend that Dr. Ricchetti's incarceration analysis is inaccurate because he does not use city-level incarceration data. The Court disagrees that such localized data are necessary because there is no evidence that the data vary from city to city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs point out the criminal-record disqualification for entry-level firefighters is much narrower than the factors that lead to disqualification of entry-level police officers.

The demographic shifts in minority communities, Defendants argue, makes parity a moving target. Plaintiffs argue that parity should be calculated based on 2011-2015 community data as a requirement of the original consent decrees. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the qualified labor pool should be calculated based on updated population data.

There is no evidence of any lingering effects of the unconstitutional examinations conducted in 1968, 1969, and 1970. The HRD has been operating in good faith, so there is little likelihood that the original constitutional violation will continue. In a vacuum, these factors might suggest the modification and termination of the consent decrees even though parity has not been reached. Over the decades, however, it was not foreseen that due to demographic surges, a strict ratio requirement would prevent cities from reaching the core goal of the consent decrees: parity. In other words, the Court-imposed formula turned out to be not a remedy for the past discrimination but a cause of\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   discrimination, which does have lingering effects into the present. The Court must decide what modifications are necessary in light of these unforeseen consequences of the Court-imposed ratio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The party seeking release from a consent decree bears the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%205740819\">\n    2004 WL 5740819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. The government points out that the census data from 2010 indicates that it is unlikely the \"cap\" harmed certain consent-decree cities (Springfield, Lowell, and Worcester)\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the qualified labor pool calculations in Dr. Ricchetti's report are used. This argument is unpersuasive because the benchmark as provided in the consent decrees in effect at the time is general population rather than the qualified labor pool analysis in the proposed modified consent decree.

Lawrence and Chelsea had an overall population that exceeded 50 percent Black and/or Hispanic in the 2000 federal census. It is likely that unidentifiable minority candidates for positions in these cities were treated unfairly as far back as 2000. Sadly, the government states: \"In Chelsea, the problem had become so acute a number of years ago that Hispanic candidates consciously chose to identify as Caucasian so as to boost their prospects for a job offer.\" Dkt.

In the 2000 census, however, the minority shares of the overall population in Worcester (22.04 percent) and Randolph (24.1 percent) dipped just below 25 percent, but it is unclear when the minority population exceeded 25 percent. In Springfield, which has the one-to-one ratio, the cap adversely affected minorities as of the 2010 census, and likely much earlier, as there was a 48.2 percent minority population in 2000. It is unlikely that Lowell has been harmed at all by the cap since its minority population stayed below 25 percent in both the 2000 and 2010 censuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court declines to impose a termination date with respect to the consent-decree cities whose harm pre-dated the 2010 census. Hopefully, the consent decrees as modified will result in reaching the goal of parity within the five-year period. However, the Court imposes a presumptive five-year termination date for Lowell, which has likely never been harmed by the cap, as indicated in both the 2000 and 2010 censuses. If the government proves that parity in Lowell is precluded by nondiscriminatory other factors\n   (like veterans' preference), it may move for release of Lowell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWS\n   </strong>\n   the motions to modify the consent decrees so that parity is measured against a qualified labor pool, rather than the general minority population (Dkt.
