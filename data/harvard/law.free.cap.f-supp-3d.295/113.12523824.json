After a five-day trial, a jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded $11,900 in compensatory damages and $425,000 in punitive damages. Defendant now moves for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial, while plaintiff in turn moves for an award of attorney's fees and costs. For the reasons below, I will deny defendant's motions except that I will reduce the punitive damages award to the statutory limit $250,000. I will otherwise grant in part and deny in part plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts set forth below are based on evidence introduced at trial and presented in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict in plaintiff's favor. Defendant is a company that was in the business of selling mulch and similar earth-and-forest-related products. Plaintiff worked for defendant as a truck driver for about 12 years to deliver loads of the company's product to customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Surface Transportation Assistance Act (\"STAA\") protects employees from retaliation by their employers on account of a complaint of a violation of federal safety regulations in the transportation industry. The Act provides in relevant part that a person may not discharge an employee who refuses to operate a vehicle because the operation violates a federal safety regulation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031105\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i). Plaintiff alleged that he\n   was discharged on April 3, 2014, after he refused to operate trucks that were loaded in violation of a federal safety regulation that limits the weight of trucks on interstate highways to no more than 80,000 pounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20658.17\">\n    23 C.F.R. \u00a7 658.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's trial evidence showed that for many months prior to his discharge the company routinely loaded its trucks in excess of 80,000 pounds. In 2013, defendant hired Martin Paganini as general manager to help the company improve financially after a period of low sales. Until Paganini's arrival, defendant had generally loaded its delivery trucks with not more than 60 yards of mulch at a time. With Paganini's arrival, however, the company began loading trucks with more mulch, frequently up to 70 yards. Loading trucks with more mulch was more profitable for the company because it decreased the total number of loads necessary to drive to fulfill orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The evidence showed a 70-yard load of mulch would violate the federal weight limit. Plaintiff himself testified that based on his lengthy experience and on the basis of his truck's mechanical suspension gauge, a load of 70 yards of mulch would put a truck over 80,000 pounds. Similarly, Walter Whitbeck-a former company employee who had loaded trucks for many years-also testified that 70 yards of mulch would weigh over 80,000 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff covertly recorded Paganini making statements that a jury could have reasonably understood to mean that he not only knew but also required that the company's trucks haul loads over the legal weight limit. A covert tape recording of one of the company's meetings included the voice of plaintiff and another employee who raised concerns about the truck loads being overweight. Paganini said: \"There's going to be times that-we all know that we are heavy haulers, we're going to haul, you know, 86, 85, you know.\" Doc. # 77-11 at 38. Plaintiff voiced his concerns to Paganini about how an overweight load \"changes the whole dynamics of your piece of equipment,\" and how \"you're constantly biting your nails all day long\" with an overweight load.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20658.17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20658.17\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The company had its own scale that was used to weigh its trucks, and hundreds of weight tickets from the company's own scale showed overweight loads for defendant's trucks from December 2013 into April 2014. Doc. # 77-14; Doc. # 209 at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's own website corroborated plaintiff's claim that a 70-yard load of\n   mulch would put a truck in violation of federal weight limits. The company's website listed a range of weights for mulch-between 800 to 1,000 pounds per yard, depending on the mulch's moisture content. Assuming a 70-yard load at the very low end of the company's weight-per-yard estimate (800 pounds per yard), this would mean that a normally sized, 35,000-pound delivery truck with a 70-yard load would weigh 91,000 pounds-far in excess of the federal weight limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The complaint in this case focused on April 3, 2014. Plaintiff testified that on that day he was asked to drive two loads of 70 yards of mulch, and that after refusing to drive both loads, he was fired. To corroborate his claim that the particular truck that day was overweight, plaintiff submitted a \"load manifest\" dated April 3, 2014, which indicated a load of 70 yards of premium bark mulch to be driven from Southington, Connecticut to Hartford, Connecticut. Doc. # 205 at 222-24. He testified that \"[t]he weights were getting out of control,\" and \"by increasing 10 more yards of premium bark mulch [it] was going to be extremely heavy,\" and \"I didn't want no part of it.\" Doc. # 205 at 229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff submitted another covert audio recording of a conversation between him and Paganini that day in which he told Paganani that he refused to drive because he was being asked to drive a truck that was overweight. Paganini told plaintiff to \"go home ... because I'm just not going to deal with the chicken shit right now.\" Doc. # 77-11 at 6-8. Paganini then told plaintiff that human resources would be in touch \"within a day or so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20658.17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20658.17\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But nobody got in touch with plaintiff for several days. On April 7, plaintiff contacted defendant's human resources department, which informed him that it was sending him a pink slip. The jury could reasonably have concluded from this course of conduct that defendant discharged plaintiff because of his refusal to haul overweight loads of mulch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under Rule 50, a motion for judgment as a matter of law will be granted only if \"a reasonable jury [did] not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party\" that prevailed at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). A party seeking judgment on this basis bears a \"heavy burden,\" and will succeed only if \"the evidence is such that, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable [persons] could have reached.\"\n   <em>\n    Matusick v.

Although plaintiff did not testify about the specific route that he would have taken had he not refused to drive the overweight loads in question, the trial evidence showed that both loads to be hauled that day originated at defendant's lot in Southington, Connecticut. The first load was destined for Bridgeport, Connecticut, and the second load was destined for Hartford, Connecticut. The city of Bridgeport is about 40 miles from Southington, and the city of Hartford is about 20 miles from Southington.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Southington and Hartford are directly connected by Interstate 84. Although Southington and Bridgeport do not have a direct interstate connection, a reasonable jury could have concluded that plaintiff would have driven at least some of the 40-mile-long route on any one of the several interstate highways (I-84, I-691, or I-91) that lie between Southington and Bridgeport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In addition, the jury could have drawn upon its common sense to conclude that it was more likely than not that a commercial driver would use an interstate highway because traffic moves more quickly than on other roads and because of the specific benefits of wider lanes and turning distances for a large load truck of the type that plaintiff was asked to drive. Indeed, the jury could have reasoned that all these roadway realities were well known to defendant itself in that Paganini never suggested to plaintiff that he avoid any legal concerns by using local roadways after plaintiff complained about being asked to haul overweight loads.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

I do not agree. The evidence was easily sufficient to show defendant's long-running and greed-driven disregard for safety and the law. The jury heard defendant's general manager discussing on tape the need to boost profit margins and to do so by hauling heavy loads. As if these incriminating statements weren't enough, the jury could easily have credited the testimony of plaintiff and Walter Whitbeck about defendant's overloading practices, especially in light of the scores of weight tickets from defendant's own scale equipment and in light of the weight calculations of mulch that were drawn from defendant's own website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, the jury reasonably could have concluded that defendant acted equally maliciously or recklessly when it decided to terminate plaintiff's long-tenured employment after he was brave enough to raise concerns about defendant's illegal practices. When plaintiff refused to drive overweight loads, Paganini told him that there's \"a decision that we need to do. Just to cut through the chicken shit that's going on ... you're going home because I'm just not going to deal with the chicken shit right now,\" and he said plaintiff couldn't \"come up and back Kevin Boucher [company owner] or Mart[y] Paganini in the corner like this.\" Doc. # 77-11 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After plaintiff told Paganini that he understood that he had just been fired for refusing to violate the law, Paganini then said that \"I'm not going to sit here and incriminate myself or allow you to take and back me in a corner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Days later plaintiff received his pink slip. Paganini's words and actions were enough for a jury to conclude that defendant acted maliciously,\n   wantonly, and in reckless disregard for the law as well as for the rights of plaintiff. The jury was well within its authority to award punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant further argues that the jury's award of punitive damages in the amount of $455,000 exceeds the statutory limit of $250,000. Plaintiff agrees, and therefore I will reduce the punitive damages award to $250,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant next argues that even this reduced punitive damages award of $250,000 is unconstitutionally excessive. I do not agree. As the Second Circuit has observed, \"[p]unitive damages 'are given to the plaintiff over and above the full compensation for the injuries, for the purpose of punishing the defendant, of teaching the defendant not to do it again, and of deterring others from following the defendant's example.' \"\n   <em>\n    Stampf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152209\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/192/#p202\">\n    761 F.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 2, at 9 (5th ed. 1984) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The United States Constitution imposes a substantive limit on the size of a punitive damages award, and I must consider three \"guideposts\" in determining the propriety of a punitive damages award: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, (2) the relationship of the punitive damages award to the compensatory damages award, and (3) criminal and civil penalties imposed by the state's law for the misconduct in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152209\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/192/#p202\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    BMW of N.

Where a plaintiff's claims \"involve a common core of facts ... [a]ttorney's fees may be awarded for unsuccessful claims as well as successful ones.\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645542\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/96/#p100\">\n    361 F.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's claims against defendant and Supreme Industries, Inc., were certainly based on a common core of facts, and hours spent pursuing the claim against Supreme Industries were reasonably expended in the course of plaintiff's ultimately successful litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Third, defendant argues that plaintiff should not be awarded fees for litigating the case on behalf of Ferrell Welch, a former plaintiff in this case who was dismissed at summary judgment. I agree that plaintiff should not be awarded attorney's fees for effort expended solely on behalf of Welch's unsuccessful claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dancy v. McGinley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225685\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/141/231/#p240\">\n    141 F.Supp.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (reducing fees for work that \"pertained solely\" to the claims of an unsuccessful plaintiff.). But plaintiff has, appropriately, not sought reimbursement for any time related solely to Welch's case. I decline to reduce the fee award for items where counsel spent time on behalf of both plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225685\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/141/231/#p240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (no reduction where time spent on two plaintiffs' claims equally necessary for each one).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Fourth, Defendant argues that plaintiff should not be awarded fees or costs for the time expended in defending\n   <em>\n    Supreme Forest Prods., Inc. v. Michael Kennedy and Ferrell Welch\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00054 (JAM), a separate lawsuit that plaintiff has listed as a \"counterclaim\" in its timesheets. I agree. Defendant's lawsuit against plaintiff is a separate matter that plaintiff never requested be joined with this case. Plaintiff's reply to defendant's argument does not cite a single case in which attorney's fees were awarded in one case for time spent\n   litigating another case, and I see no reason to do so here. I therefore deny plaintiff's motion with respect to each item labeled \"counterclaim\" on the timesheets it has submitted as well as on its accounting of costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fifth, defendant argues that plaintiff should not be awarded time expended defending against defendant's motion for sanctions, as that motion \"was necessary solely because of Plaintiff's discovery misconduct.\" Doc. # 191 at 5. I agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruling on Pending Motions Re Audio Recordings and Photographs, Doc. # 151 at 8-9. Plaintiff's violation of discovery requirements should not be rewarded with attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Sixth, defendant argues that plaintiff's submissions regarding attorney's billing records \"lack sufficient detail\" and demonstrate \"block billing practices.\" Doc. # 191 at 5. Having reviewed the entries on plaintiff's timesheet, I find them to be reasonably specific. I have no concerns about the accuracy of the billing entries, and I am not concerned that they have been inflated beyond hours actually worked by plaintiff's attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, defendant argues that a variety of specific items on plaintiff's attorneys' timesheets are unnecessary, unreasonable, duplicative, or too vague, and therefore not entitled to reimbursement. Doc. # 191 at 23-34. Although defendant's list is overinclusive, I agree that plaintiff has listed two tasks that could have been handled by a paralegal or legal assistant and so are unreasonable for reimbursement at an attorney's rate: first, receiving and filing a waiver of service form, and second, drafting and filing certain motions for extension of time. Defendant is also correct that costs associated with arranging for and traveling to a deposition or trial are not taxable as costs under D. Conn. L. Civ. R. 54(c)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant is also correct that plaintiff has not submitted the necessary documentation to be reimbursed for hiring a private process server under Local Rule 54(c)(1). I therefore deny plaintiff's motion as to this item, totaling $125, subject to reconsideration if plaintiff submits adequate documentation no more than 7 days from the date of this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff's motion is granted with respect to the remaining items, which are reasonable when considered in light of the factors listed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216353\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/411/#p415\">\n    595 F.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In sum, I largely grant plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees, subject to the foregoing reductions. I will calculate the award as follows: 408 hours billed by Attorney Reilly, less 0.25 hours for receipt and filing of waiver of service, less 2.5 hours for preparing and filing motions for extension of time, less 19.5 hours for time spent on\n   <em>\n    Supreme Forest Prods., Inc. v. Michael Kennedy and Ferrell Welch\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00054 (JAM), less 18.5 hours for time spent on work subject to defendant's motion for sanctions, totaling of 367.25 hours, multiplied by the reduced rate of $300/hour, totaling $110,175; 48.25 hours billed by Attorney Cicchiello, less 4.25 hours for time spent on work subject to defendant's motion for sanctions, totaling 44 hours, multiplied by the reduced rate of $360/hour, totaling $15,840; 7 hours billed by Attorney Paradisi, multiplied by the reduced rate of $260/hour, totaling $1,820. The sum of the fees of each attorney is $127,835. Plaintiff is entitled to an award for costs of $11,932.74, less $536.02 in travel-related expenses, less $125 in private process server expenses, totaling $11,271.72. This results in a total award of $139,106.72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law and/or for a new trial (Docs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   # 156, # 175) are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The motions are DENIED except to the extent that the punitive damages award shall be reduced to $250,000. Plaintiff's motion for costs and fees (Doc. # 174) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendant shall pay plaintiff costs and fees in the amount of $139,106.72. The Clerk of Court shall enter an amended judgment reducing the punitive damages award to $250,000 and adding the Court's award of $127,835 in attorney's fees and $11,271.72 in costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The statute provides in relevant part that \"[a] person may not discharge an employee ... because-(B) the employee refuses to operate a motor vehicle because-(1) the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order of the United States related to commercial motor vehicle safety, health, or security.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031015\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).
