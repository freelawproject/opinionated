GARAUFIS, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs in the above-captioned cases challenge the rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program, as well as other actions that Defendants are alleged to have taken in connection with the rescission of that program. Defendants have moved to dismiss these cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

For the reasons that follow, the court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and RESERVES RULING on Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As of 2014, for example, approximately 11.3 million removable individuals were present in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (The Department of Homeland Security's Authority to Prioritize Removal\n   of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of Others, 38 Op. O.L.C. at 1 (2014) (\"OLC Op.\") (Admin. R. (\"AR\") (Dkt. 77-1) at 4).) DHS has the resources to remove only a small percentage of these individuals-specifically, about 400,000 per year, or less than four percent of the total, as of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1; DHS, 2015 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics tbl. 39 (2016) (listing 333,341 removals and 129,122 \"returns\" for the year 2015).) Because of the \"practical fact\" that it cannot deport all these individuals, the Executive Branch has significant discretion to prioritize the removal of some and to deprioritize the removal of others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v.

(Mem. from Janet Napolitano, Sec'y of DHS, to David V. Aguilar, Acting Comm'r, CBP, et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, 2012) (the \"2012 DACA Memo\") (AR 1).) The 2012 DACA Memo directed CBP, USCIS, and ICE to consider exercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals without lawful immigration status who (1) were under the age of sixteen when they entered the United States; (2) had been continuously present in the United States for at least the five years leading up to June 15, 2012; (3) were currently in school, had graduated from high school or obtained GEDs, or were honorably discharged veterans; (4) had not been convicted of felonies, significant misdemeanors, or multiple misdemeanors, and did not \"otherwise pose[ ] a threat to national security or public safety\"; and (5) were not above the age of thirty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Individuals who met these criteria, passed a background check, and were granted relief \"on a case by case basis\" were shielded from removal and\n   eligible to apply for work authorization, subject to renewal every two years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The 2012 DACA Memo made clear, however, that it \"confer[red] no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship,\" but only \"set forth policy for the exercise of discretion within the framework of the existing law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Following the issuance of the 2012 DACA Memo, approximately 800,000 individuals have been granted deferred action and work authorization under the program. (Second Am. Compl.

(Mem. from Jeh Charles Johnson, Sec'y of DHS, to Leon Rodriguez, Dir., USCIS., et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children and with Respect to Certain Individuals Who Are the Parents of U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents (Nov. 20, 2014) (the \"2014 DAPA Memo\") (AR 37).) The 2014 DAPA Memo also expanded the DACA program by (1) permitting individuals born before June 15, 1981, to apply for deferred action; (2) extending the term of the benefits obtained under the DACA program from two to three years; and (3) adjusting the date-of-entry requirement so that individuals who entered the United States before January 1, 2010, could obtain deferred action and work authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) The court refers to these changes to the DACA program as the \"DACA Expansion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the issuance of the 2014 DAPA Memo, twenty-six states, led by Texas, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, claiming that the DAPA program violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. art.

Tex. 2015). On February 16, 2015, the district court concluded that those states had standing to sue and were likely to succeed on the merits of their procedural APA claim that the 2014 DAPA Memo was invalid because it constituted a \"substantive rule,\" not a \"general statement of policy,\" and thus should have been promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303866\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/591/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303866\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/591/#p598\">\n    at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Shortly after his Inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order that cast doubt on the exemption of \"classes or categories\n   of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\" Exec. Order 13,768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%208799\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 8799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 25, 2017). The following month, then-Secretary of DHS John Kelly implemented that order by issuing a memorandum rescinding \"all existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding enforcement of our immigration laws and priorities for removal,\" except for the DACA and DAPA programs, which he left in place. (Mem. from John Kelly, Sec'y, DHS, to Kevin McAleenan, Acting Comm'r, CBP, et al., Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest at 2 (Feb. 20, 2017) (AR 230).) Four months later, Secretary Kelly issued another memorandum, which rescinded the DAPA program and the DACA Expansion based on \"the preliminary injunction in this matter, the ongoing litigation, the fact that DAPA never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities.\" (Mem. from John F. Kelly, Sec'y, DHS, to Kevin K. McAleenan, Acting Comm'r, CBP, et al., Rescission of November 20, 2014, Memorandum Providing for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\") at 3 (June 15, 2017) (AR 235).) That memorandum did not, however, rescind the original DACA program or revoke the three-year-long deferred action and work authorization issued between the announcement of the DACA Expansion and the Southern District of Texas's issuance of a preliminary injunction against that program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 &amp; n.3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    DACA Rescission\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the rescission of the 2014 DAPA Memo, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on behalf of eleven states to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to demand that the \"Executive Branch\" rescind the 2012 DACA Memo. (Ltr. from Ken Paxton, Att'y Gen. of Texas, to Hon. Jeff Sessions, Att'y Gen. of the U.S. (June 29, 2017) at 2 (AR 239).) Paxton warned that, if DHS did not act to end the DACA program, the plaintiff states would amend their complaint in\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   to challenge the DACA program and the remaining work permits issued under the DACA Expansion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thereafter, Attorney General Sessions wrote to Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke to \"advise that [DHS] should rescind\" the 2012 DACA Memo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Letter from Jefferson B. Sessions, III, Att'y Gen. of the U.S., to Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec'y, DHS (the \"Sessions Letter\") (AR 251).) The Attorney General opined that DACA was unconstitutional and that the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs would likely prevail in their anticipated challenge to the program:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch. The related Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policy was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth Circuit on the basis of multiple legal grounds and then by the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote. Then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly rescinded the DAPA policy in June. Because the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects\n   that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 5, 2017, Defendants rescinded the DACA program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Attorney General announced the decision at a press conference, and Acting Secretary Duke implemented the decision by issuing a memorandum (the \"DACA Rescission Memo\") to her subordinates. (DOJ, Press Release, Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA (Sept. 5, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-daca; Mem. from Elaine C.

Duke pointed to the rulings of the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation, as well as to the Attorney General's \"legal determination\" that DACA was \" 'an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws' \" and \" 'an unconstitutional exercise of authority' \":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   Taking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012[,] DACA program should be terminated.

First, DHS would consider initial applications for deferred action and work authorization that it had received as of September 5, 2017. (DACA Rescission Memo at 4.) Second, DHS would \"adjudicate-on an individual, case by case basis\" requests for renewal of deferred action and work authorization \"from current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between [September 5, 2017,] and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by [DHS] as of October 5, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) DHS would not consider other applications for deferred action or work authorization under the DACA program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Existing grants of deferred action and work authorization would remain in effect \"for the remaining duration of their validity periods,\" though DHS would retain the authority to terminate or deny deferred action when it deemed appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under the DACA Rescission Memo, the benefits granted as part of the DACA program will\n   therefore expire gradually over the next two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Duke\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-4756 (E.D.N.Y.), predates the Trump Administration's decision to rescind the DACA program. In that case, Plaintiff Martin Batalla Vidal initially challenged DHS's compliance with the nationwide injunction issued by the Southern District of Texas in\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   . Batalla Vidal applied for deferred action and work authorization in November 2014 and, in February 2015, was notified that he had received deferred action and work authorization for the next three years under the terms of the DACA Expansion. (Compl. (Dkt. 1) \u00b6 32.) On May 14, 2015, however, DHS revoked his three-year work authorization, citing the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   injunction, and replaced it with a two-year permit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.) Batalla Vidal challenged that decision, contending that the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs lacked standing to seek, and the Southern District of Texas lacked jurisdiction to issue, a nationwide injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-47.) Batalla Vidal subsequently amended his complaint to add the nonprofit organization MRNY as a plaintiff and name then-Director of USCIS Leon Rodriguez as a defendant. (Am. Compl. (Dkt. 29).) In November 2016, the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs moved with Defendants' consent to stay briefing in the case \"[d]ue to uncertainty regarding the future of the [DACA] program.\" (Pls.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 160-66.) Finally, the State Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add claims (1) challenging the notice provided to DACA recipients of the rescission of the DACA program; and (2) further challenging the change in DHS's information-use policy. (State Pls. Am. Compl. (No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt. 54) \u00b6\u00b6 246-52, 274-80.)

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 167-70; State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 233-39.) The State Plaintiffs allege that the DACA Rescission Memo \"target[s] individuals for discriminatory treatment, without lawful justification\" and that it was \"motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory motive and/or a desire to harm a particular group.\" (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 235-36.) The\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and Acting Secretary Duke violated the Due Process Clause in deciding to rescind the DACA program because that decision \"targets Latinos and, in particular, Mexicans, and will have a disparate impact on these groups,\" and \"was substantially motivated by animus toward Latinos and, in particular, Mexicans.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 169-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Due Process-Individualized Notice.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Both sets of Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by failing to provide DACA recipients with adequate notice of the decision to rescind the DACA program. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 160-66; State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 274-80.) In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that, prior to the DACA Rescission Memo, DHS advised DACA recipients to submit applications to renew their deferred action and work authorization \"as soon as possible\" and, in particular, 120-150 days before expiration, to ensure that those benefits did not expire before DHS could process the renewal applications. (SAC \u00b6 164.) Following the issuance of the DACA Rescission Memo, Defendants did not send individual revised notices to alert DACA recipients who were eligible to renew their deferred action and work authorization (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , individuals whose benefits expired before March 5, 2018) that they only had until October 5, 2017, to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165.) The State Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by failing to provide DACA recipients with \"adequate notice\" about \"the procedures and timeline for renewing their DACA status,\" \"the general termination of the DACA program after March 5, 2018,\" or \"their inability to apply for renewal of their DACA status after March 5, 2018.\" (State Pls.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 151, 153; State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 240-45.) While, as discussed below, the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs fold this challenge into their substantive APA claim, the State Plaintiffs challenge this decision as \"fundamentally unfair,\" in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 246-52.) The State Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, having \"made repeated affirmative statements about the protections that would be given to the personal information provided by DACA applicants\" and \"placed affirmative restrictions on the use of such information for purposes of immigration enforcement\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248), are now estopped from using that information for immigration-enforcement purposes (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 250-51).

The\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend that Attorney General Sessions and Acting Secretary Duke acted arbitrarily and capriciously by deciding to end the DACA program and by changing DHS's policy regarding the confidentiality of DACA applicants' information because those decisions \"(a) lack a rational explanation for the change in policy on which persons had reasonably relied, (b) are based on a legal error, and (c) failed to consider all relevant factors.\" (SAC \u00b6 151.) The State Plaintiffs argue that the implementation of the DACA Rescission Memo and termination of the DACA program \"with minimal formal guidance\" constituted arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful action in violation of Section 706 of the APA. (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 254-55.) The court refers to these claims together as Plaintiffs' \"substantive APA claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APA-Notice and Comment.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Both sets of Plaintiffs also contend that DHS's implementation of the DACA Rescission Memo constitutes a substantive or legislative \"rule\" for purposes of the APA, and thus needed to be made through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that the DACA Rescission Memo is a substantive rule, \"as it binds DHS to categorically deny applications for deferred action to individuals who fit the original DACA eligibility criteria.\" (SAC \u00b6 146.) The State Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that the promulgation and implementation of the DACA Rescission Memo \"categorically and definitively changed the substantive criteria by which individual DACA grantees work, live, attend school, obtain credit, and travel in the United States,\" impacting those beneficiaries' \"substantive rights.\" (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 261.) The court refers to these claims together as Plaintiffs' \"procedural APA claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     RFA.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Finally, both sets of Plaintiffs assert claims under the RFA. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants violated the RFA by issuing the DACA Rescission Memo without conducting an analysis of the rescission's impact on \"small entities.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 155-59; State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 266-73.) MRNY alleges that it is a \"small organization\" that is directly affected by the DACA Rescission Memo and thus has a cause of action under the RFA. (SAC \u00b6 156.) The State Plaintiffs assert that they and their \"small governmental jurisdictions, nonprofits, and businesses, and their residents\" are harmed by Defendants' failure to conduct such a regulatory impact analysis. (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 273.)

R. 72.2. After soliciting the views of the parties as to whether discovery should proceed (Sept. 15, 2017, Order (Dkt. 58) ), Judge Orenstein authorized discovery to proceed over Defendants' objections (Tr. of Sept. 26, 2017, Hr'g (Docket Number Pending) 26:21-27:22). Judge Orenstein then issued a case management and scheduling order (the \"Case Management Order\"), which confirmed the previously announced discovery schedule. (Sept. 27, 2017, Order (Dkt. 67).) Of particular relevance to these proceedings, the Case Management and Scheduling Order required Defendants to produce, by October 6, 2017, an administrative record as well as a privilege log describing \"every document considered within any component of the executive branch as part of the process of determining the policy and actions at issue in these actions that are not being produced and as to which the defendants would assert a claim of privilege, regardless of whether the defendants deem such ... record to be part of the official administrative record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 II(c) (the \"Privilege Log Requirement\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants promptly challenged the Case Management Order. On September 29, 2017, Defendants filed a motion before this court \"seek[ing] relief from\" the Privilege Log Requirement, which, they argued, \"raise[d] substantial separation-of-powers concerns,\" to the extent it could be read as applying to White House communications, and required Defendants to assert privilege with respect to documents that were not properly included in the administrative record. (Sept. 29, 2017, Defs. Mot. to Vacate (Dkt. 69) (\"Defs. Sept. 29 Mot.\") at 2-5.) Defendants also argued that it would be impossible to comply with the Privilege Log Requirement within the deadline set by the Case Management Order (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5), and that the court should\n   consider threshold arguments for dismissal of these cases before allowing discovery to proceed (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). Defendants did not specifically argue that discovery was inappropriate, although they reincorporated arguments against discovery by reference to a letter they had filed with Judge Orenstein a week earlier and briefly outlined three \"threshold dismissal arguments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs. Sept. 22, 2017, Ltr. Regarding Discovery (Dkt. 65).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court issued two orders in response to Defendants' objections. The first order extended the deadline for complying with the Privilege Log Requirement by two weeks, so that the court could consider whether the as-yet-unproduced administrative record was adequate and whether Defendants retained the presumption that they had correctly compiled the record. (Oct. 3, 2017, Order (Dkt. 72).) Defendants subsequently asked the court to narrow the Privilege Log Requirement or vacate it entirely. (Defs. Oct. 10, 2017, Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Vacate (Dkt. 80) at 2.) At the same time, Defendants also asked the court to stay discovery pending resolution of Defendants' anticipated dispositive motions, which Defendants averred would \"raise arguments that are strong, purely legal, and completely dispositive of Plaintiffs' claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Defendants did not, however, specifically identify what those arguments were (instead cross-referencing their September 29 Motion and string-citing to authority discussed below) or address any of the factors that courts in this district consider in analyzing whether a party has demonstrated \"good cause\" to stay discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) ;\n   <em>\n    Richards v. N. Shore Long Island Jewish Health Sys.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-CV-4544 (LDW) (ETB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204407518\">\n    2011 WL 4407518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court then issued its second order, which narrowed the scope of the Privilege Log Requirement but denied Defendants' request to stay discovery. (Oct. 17, 2017 Mem. &amp; Order (the \"Oct. 17 M &amp; O\") (Dkt. 86).) With respect to Defendants' arguments that discovery outside the administrative record was inappropriate, the court noted that Defendants had not identified any reason why its review of Plaintiffs' information-use policy and notice claims should be limited to an administrative record that only purported to document the decision to rescind the DACA program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5.) The court declined to vacate the Privilege Log Requirement before Judge Orenstein decided whether the administrative record was complete. (Oct. 17 M &amp; O at 5-6.) The court agreed, however, that the Privilege Log Requirement should be narrowed to exclude materials other than DHS and DOJ communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.) Finally, the court declined to exempt DOJ from the Privilege Log Requirement, as Defendants had failed to explain their apparent reversal in position regarding whether Attorney General Sessions was responsible for the decision to rescind the DACA program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The following evening, Defendants renewed their motion to stay discovery, this time threatening to seek mandamus review if the court did not address their objections by 2 p.m. the following day. (Defs. Oct. 18, 2017, Mot. to Stay (Dkt. 87).) The court ruled expeditiously on these requests. On October 19, 2017, Judge Orenstein issued an order granting Plaintiffs' motion to compel Defendants to produce a complete administrative record. (Oct. 19, 2017, Order Granting Motion to Produce (Dkt. 89).) The same day, this court issued another memorandum and order, granting in part and denying in part Defendants' motion for a stay. (Oct. 19, 2017, Mem. &amp; Order (the \"Oct. 19 M &amp; O\") at 9-11.) In light of Defendants' ongoing (and, this time, factually substantiated) concerns about the burdens of complying with the\n   Privilege Log Requirement, the court agreed to stay the Privilege Log Requirement except with respect to documents directly considered by the Attorney General, Acting Secretary Duke, and their subordinates who directly advised them on the decision to end the DACA program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court concluded, however, that Defendants had not demonstrated \"good cause\" warranting a stay of discovery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-9), nor that they were entitled to a stay pending mandamus review (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On October 20, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an emergency stay of discovery and record supplementation in proceedings before this court, contingent on Defendants' filing a full petition for a writ of mandamus by 3 p.m. on October 23, 2017. (Oct. 20, 2017, USCA Order (Dkt. 91).) Four days later, the Second Circuit issued a second order, which extended the stay pending determination of the mandamus petition but deferred ruling on that petition \"until such time as the district court has considered and decided expeditiously issues of jurisdiction and justiciability.\" (Oct. 24, 2017, USCA Order (Dkt. 99).) In light of that order, the court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs as to whether the court \"lacks jurisdiction to consider the claims raised in [these cases] or why such claims are otherwise non-justiciable.\" (Oct. 24, 2017, Order.) In response to that order, Defendants filed the motion to dismiss currently before the court. That motion not only argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear these cases, but also contends that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief should be granted and that the court should not grant a nationwide injunction, should it decide that Plaintiffs are entitled to relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Except as noted, all docket citations refer to the docket in\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal v.

DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Defendants raise four challenges to the court's authority to hear the above-captioned cases. First, Defendants argue, these cases are not justiciable under the APA because the decision to rescind the DACA program was \"committed to agency discretion by law.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2). (Defs. Mem. at 12-17.) Second, Defendants contend that the decision to terminate the DACA program constitutes a denial of deferred action, judicial review of which is barred by Section 1252(g) of the INA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 17-19.) Third, they maintain, the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs lack standing to bring certain claims (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 28-29, 34-35, 37), and the State Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to bring any claims (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 19-21). Fourth, Defendants assert, the State Plaintiffs and MRNY cannot bring claims under the APA because they assert interests that fall outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the INA. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19-20.) The court addresses each argument in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Committed to Agency Discretion by Law\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Defendants first argue that these cases are non-justiciable because the decision to end the DACA program was committed to DHS's exclusive discretion by law. The court disagrees. Certain agency decisions, including decisions not to institute enforcement action, are presumptively immune from judicial review under the APA because they are \"committed to agency discretion by law.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2) ;\n    <em>\n     Heckler v.

But the rescission of the DACA program was not such a decision, nor have Defendants explained why Section 701(a)(2) precludes review of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims or other claims challenging actions other than the decision to rescind the DACA program.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Statutory and Equitable Claims\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Section 701(a)(2) of the APA does not preclude judicial review of Plaintiffs' statutory and equitable claims. \"Under the APA, a party aggrieved by agency action is generally 'entitled to judicial review thereof.' \"\n    <em>\n     Westchester v.

First, Plaintiffs do not challenge an agency's failure or refusal to prosecute or take enforcement actions with respect to certain violations of law. Instead, they challenge Defendants' affirmative decision to eliminate a program by which DHS exercised prosecutorial discretion with respect to a large number of undocumented immigrants. The DACA Rescission Memo curtails (if it does not eliminate outright)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    DHS's ability to exercise prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals previously eligible to request deferred action. Although the DACA Rescission Memo notes that it does not limit DHS's \"otherwise lawful enforcement or litigation prerogatives,\" it makes clear that DHS \"[w]ill reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents filed after [September 5, 2017]\" and \"[w]ill reject all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents\" inconsistent with the terms of the Memo. This affirmative decision to constrain DHS's prosecutorial discretion cannot be analogized to an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, which would be presumptively immune from judicial review.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Texas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p178\">\n     809 F.3d at 165-69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (creation of the DAPA program was reviewable because it was a \"affirmative agency action,\" not an exercise of enforcement discretion). Second, Plaintiffs do not challenge\n    <em>\n     non\n    </em>\n    -enforcement decisions, which do not subject individuals to the \"coercive power\" of the state.\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n     470 U.S. at 831\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n     105 S.Ct. 1649\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To the contrary, the rescission of the DACA program subjects individuals who previously enjoyed some protection from removal to coercive state authority. Third, Defendants' decision to rescind the DACA program does not appear to have been motivated by a \"complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within [the agency's] expertise.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Instead, Defendants stated that they were required to rescind the DACA program because it was unlawful, which suggests both that Defendants did not believe that they were exercising discretion when rescinding the program and that their reasons for doing so are within the competence of this court to review. (Sessions Letter; DACA Rescission Memo at 4.) The decision to rescind the DACA program is thus manifestly unlike the non-enforcement decision at issue in\n    <em>\n     Chaney\n    </em>\n    . While courts have also held that agency decisions to take (as opposed to refrain from taking) enforcement action are also unreviewable under the APA when there are no judicially manageable standards for reviewing the agency's discretion in choosing to bring an enforcement action,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Speed Mining, Inc. v.

Defendants do not explain why the alleged decision to change DHS's policy regarding the use of DACA applicants' information should be immune from judicial review. To the contrary, there is \"law to apply\" in reviewing that decision (namely, DHS's prior statements about the uses of DACA applicants' information), and the court does not understand how the change in that policy can be analogized to the sorts of decisions, such as enforcement and non-enforcement decisions, that courts have recognized as presumptively exempt from judicial review. Accordingly, to the extent the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs also challenge DHS's alleged change in information-use policy as part of their substantive APA claim, that claim is reviewable.

Similarly, Defendants identify no express indication that Congress intended to preclude judicial review of the actions at issue in these cases. While DHS undoubtedly exercises \"wide discretion ... in the enforcement of the immigration laws\" (Defs.

Defendants' specific arguments for a broad reading of Section 701(a)(2) likewise unavailing. While Defendants argue that judicial review of these cases is inappropriate because review could slow down the Executive Branch's removal of undocumented immigrants from this country,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g) already precludes individuals in removal proceedings from delaying those proceedings by claiming that they were improperly denied deferred action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     AAADC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     525 U.S. at 485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     119 S.Ct. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In any event, those concerns do not apply to these cases, as the court discusses in Section III.B below. Defendants also argue that judicial review of immigration decisions is inappropriate because judicial review \"may involve 'not merely the disclosure of normal domestic law enforcement priorities and techniques, but often the disclosure of foreign-policy objectives' or other sensitive matters.\" (Defs.

Defendants' stated rationale for rescinding the DACA program, however, turns wholly on questions of U.S. constitutional and administrative law, not sensitive law-enforcement, intelligence, or foreign-policy issues.

First,\n    <em>\n     AAADC\n    </em>\n    makes clear that Section 1252(g) only limits judicial review with respect to suits arising from certain enumerated decisions by immigration authorities. Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia specifically rejected the notion that Section 1252(g) was \"a sort of 'zipper' clause that says 'no judicial review in deportation cases unless this section provides judicial review.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     525 U.S. at 482\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     119 S.Ct. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In\n    <em>\n     AAADC\n    </em>\n    , the Court reasoned that Section 1252(g) must have been intended to limit judicial review of denials of deferred action:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    Section 1252(g) seems clearly designed to give some measure of protection to \"no deferred action\" decisions and similar discretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at least will not be made the bases of separate rounds of judicial intervention outside the streamlined process that Congress has designed [ (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , for judicial review of final orders of removal) ].\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     525 U.S. at 485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     119 S.Ct. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These limits were \"entirely understandable\" in order to prevent \"the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal proceedings\" that could result if immigrants were allowed to attack in-process removal proceedings by claiming that they were singled out by immigration authorities for adverse treatment.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     at 487\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     119 S.Ct. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     at 487-92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n     119 S.Ct. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs challenge the programmatic decision to rescind DACA, rather than attempting to obstruct their specific removal proceedings by claiming that they were improperly denied\n    deferred action, these cases do not implicate the concern raised in\n    <em>\n     AAADC\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Accordingly, Section 1252(g) does not preclude review of these actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Claims by MRNY and the State Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Moreover, Section 1252(g) does not preclude judicial review of the claims brought by MRNY or the State Plaintiffs in particular. Again, the court begins with the text of the statute. Section 1252(g) only bars suits \"\n    <em>\n     by or on behalf of any alien\n    </em>\n    arising from the decision or action ... to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.\" (emphasis added). But neither MRNY nor the State Plaintiffs are suing \"on behalf of any alien\" in removal proceedings or subject to an order of removal. Instead, MRNY sues in its own right, because it claims that the rescission of DACA has interfered with its operations. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 54-57.) Likewise, the State Plaintiffs sue not \"on behalf of any alien,\" but instead to vindicate their own proprietary and quasi-sovereign interests.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    (State Pls. Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (\"State Pls. Opp'n\") (No. 17-CV-5228, Dkt. 82) at 19-22.) MRNY and the State Plaintiffs seek to assert their own rights and the rights of the general public, not those of individual immigrants in removal proceedings or subject to orders of removal. There is no reason why Section 1252(g) would deprive the court of jurisdiction over their claims, brought on their own behalf.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Standing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The court next considers whether Plaintiffs have established that they have standing to sue.

Loss of their ability to work in the United States is clearly an \"injury-in-fact\" fairly traceable to the rescission of the DACA program. Additionally, if they were to lose their deferred action, the individual\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs would be subject to removal from the United States. There is nothing \"speculative\" about the possibility that they would actually be removed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hedges v.

Here, there is \"some possibility\" that if Defendants had subjected the decision to rescind the DACA program to notice and comment and analyzed the impact of that decision on small entities, they would have reached a different outcome. Accordingly, the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs also have Article III standing to assert their procedural APA claim, and MRNY has Article III standing to assert its RFA claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Defendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot assert procedural APA claims because, if the decision to rescind the DACA program was a \"substantive\" or \"legislative\" rule requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking, then, \"\n    <em>\n     a fortiori\n    </em>\n    so was enacting the policy in the first place,\" and the DACA program itself was thus \"void\n    <em>\n     ab initio\n    </em>\n    -leaving Plaintiffs without a remedy.\" (Defs. Mem. at 28-29.) It does not follow, however, that if the rescission of the DACA program required notice and comment, the program's creation necessarily required notice and comment as well. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs. Mem. at 29 n.7.) While Defendants might be correct on the merits (an issue that the court does not consider or resolve at this time), all that Article III requires is that Plaintiffs show that their alleged injury would be redressed by the ruling they seek-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that the decision to rescind DACA should be vacated because it was procedurally defective.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <em>\n     b. Information-Use Policy Claim\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs also have standing to challenge the alleged changes to DHS's information-use policy. To obtain deferred action and work authorization under DACA, an applicant was required to provide USCIS with extensive personal information, including his or her home address, height, weight, hair and eye color, fingerprints, photograph, and signature, and submit to a background check. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USCIS, Form I-821D: Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (SAC, Ex. B (Dkt. 60-1) ) at ECF pp.6-8; USCIS, Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (SAC, Ex. B (Dkt. 60-1) ) at ECF p.3.) The\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs also allege that DACA applicants \"routinely provided\" other personal information, \"including copies of school records, pay stubs, bank statements, passports, birth certificates, and similar records,\" in support of their applications. (SAC \u00b6 70.) They contend that this information will enable DHS to deport them more easily once their deferred action expires. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 127.) The court agrees. It is not difficult to infer that this information would facilitate DHS's ability to remove these individuals from the country. This increased likelihood of removal is sufficiently concrete, imminent, and traceable to Defendants' alleged conduct to establish standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their information-use policy claims because \"[n]o Plaintiff plausibly alleges that the agency has in fact used his DACA information for any enforcement\n    purpose, much less initiated enforcement proceedings against him as a result, or that there is any imminent threat of this occurring.\" (Defs. Mem. at 37.) The individual\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs need not wait, however, until they are deported to have standing to press this claim. Once their deferred action expires, they will be subject to removal from the United States, and the court will presume that Defendants will enforce the immigration laws against them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hedges\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/#p195\">\n     724 F.3d at 197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nor will the court ignore the obvious reality that many DACA recipients will be removed from the country when their deferred action expires. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 71 (quoting a statement by Acting Director of ICE Thomas Homan that undocumented immigrants \"should be uncomfortable\" and \"should look over [their] shoulder[s]\" and \"be worried\").) The threat of removal based on information provided to DHS is sufficiently imminent as to constitute injury-in-fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     c. Notice Claim\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs lack standing, however, to assert their notice claim. In their Second Amended Complaint, the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs allege that, following the enactment of the DACA Rescission Memo, Defendants failed to send DACA recipients whose status expired by March 5, 2018, individualized notices \"advising them that they must apply to renew DACA by October 5, 2017 or be forever ineligible to renew their status.\" (SAC \u00b6 165;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 3, 48, 103-05, 160-66.) As Defendants correctly note, however, the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs have not alleged that any of them missed the October 5, 2017, deadline or suffered other adverse effects from not receiving such individualized notice. (Defs. Mem. at 34-35.) Nor, even drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, does the Second Amended Complaint show that MRNY was injured by Defendants' failure to provide DACA recipients with individualized notice of the renewal deadline.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    While the Second Amended Complaint alleges that \"MRNY has not been able to reach four DACA recipients to inform them that they need to renew now\" (SAC \u00b6 48), that does not support the reasonable inferences either that those individuals failed to apply for renewal or that such failure was \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants' actions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the absence of a showing that anyone has been harmed by a failure to receive notice of the change to the application deadline, the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have Article III standing to bring this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     State Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The court next considers whether the State Plaintiffs have Article\n    III standing.

(State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 190 (states employ \"[m]any DACA recipients\").). For example, the State of Washington represents that it employs DACA recipients within state government (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Decl. of Paul Quinonez \u00b6\u00b6 1-6 (State Pls. Am. Compl., Ex. 56 (Dkt. 55-56) ); Decl. of E. Alexandra Monroe \u00b6 3-4 (State Pls. Am. Compl., Ex. 62 (Dkt. 55-62) ) ) and at state-run colleges and universities (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Decl. of Lucila Loera \u00b6 4 (State Pls. Am. Compl., Ex. 58 (Dkt. 55-58) ) ). If DACA were rescinded, these employees would lose their work authorization, and the State of Washington would incur expenses in identifying, hiring, and training their replacements. (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 190.) Accordingly, the State of Washington has standing to assert equal protection and substantive APA claims challenging the decision to end the DACA program. Moreover, Washington has standing to\n    challenge the procedures by which Defendants decided to end the DACA program, because \"there is some possibility\" that, if DHS complied with notice-and-comment and RFA rulemaking procedures, it might \"reconsider the decision.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts v.

Because Washington has established its standing to assert substantive and procedural APA and RFA claims, the State Plaintiffs therefore have Article III standing to bring these claims.\n    <em>\n     SeeFAIR\n    </em>\n    , 547 U.S. at 53 n.3,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1297\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Defendants' arguments that State Plaintiffs lack Article III standing because they would be only \"incidentally\" harmed by the rescission of the DACA program are without merit. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs. Mem. at 19.) Defendants protest that \"[i]t would be extraordinary to find Article III standing\" based on a state's assertions of \"alleged harms to their residents, employees, tax bases, health expenditures, and educational experiences at their universities,\" as \"virtually any administration of federal law by a federal agency could have such effects.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) That a federal policy may have sweeping, adverse effects on states and state-run institutions is not, however, a convincing argument that states should not have standing to challenge that policy. Moreover, Defendants' position is irreconcilable with their own stated rationale for rescinding the DACA program. Defendants have stated that they rescinded the DACA program because it suffered from the same legal flaws as the DAPA program and could not be defended in court against the threatened challenge by Texas and other state plaintiffs. That necessarily assumes that at least one of the plaintiff states in the\n    <em>\n     Texas\n    </em>\n    litigation has standing to challenge the existence of the DACA program.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Texas,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p178\">\n     809 F.3d at 150-62\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding standing based on the likely costs of having to issue drivers licenses to DAPA beneficiaries).

In order to assert these claims, the State Plaintiffs must identify some cognizable proprietary or quasi-sovereign interest that was harmed by Defendants' challenged conduct-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , (1) with respect to the notice claim, Defendants' communication\n    of its decision to rescind the DACA program and impose an October 5, 2017, renewal deadline; and (2) with respect to the information-use policy claims, the alleged change in DHS policy regarding the use of DACA applicants' information. In the court's view, the State Plaintiffs have not identified any interests harmed by these actions that they can sue the federal government to redress, and so they lack standing to bring these claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Proprietary Interests\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    While the State Plaintiffs allege that their proprietary interests will be harmed by the termination of DACA (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 100), they do not identify any proprietary interests that have been or will be harmed by Defendants' alleged failure to provide DACA recipients with \"adequate notice\" of the \"procedures and timeline for renewing their DACA status,\" \"about the general termination of the DACA program after March 5, 2018,\" or \"of [DACA recipients'] inability to apply for renewal of their DACA status after March 5, 2018\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 276-78;\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    State Pls. Mem. at 19-21). It is certainly conceivable that many DACA recipients who were eligible to renew their deferred action and work authorization under the DACA Rescission Memo failed to do so before the October 5, 2017 deadline. (State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 96 (noting that \"up to one third of DACA grantees who are eligible for renewal had not applied as of two days before the ... deadline\").) The State Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint does not provide a sufficient basis for the court to conclude, however, that (1) such failures to renew were \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants' decision not to provide each DACA recipient with individualized notice of the change in application procedures and timelines; or (2) that these failures to renew harmed any State Plaintiff's proprietary interests (for example, by depriving a state employee of work authorization).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Amnesty Int'l\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n     568 U.S. at 410-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n     133 S.Ct. 1138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
