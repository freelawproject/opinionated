Private Plaintiffs (hereinafter, \"Plaintiffs\") are individuals or companies who purchased certain trucks marketed under the Jeep and Ram 1500 model names. More specifically, these trucks (2014-2016 models) had diesel engines that were branded \"EcoDiesel.\" Plaintiffs have brought class action claims against (1) the manufacturers of the cars and their chief executive (the FCA Defendants); (2) the companies who manufactured the EcoDiesel engines (the VM Motori Defendants); and (3) the companies who supplied the electronic diesel control (\"EDC\") units that were used to control the emissions from the engines (the Bosch Defendants). The gist of Plaintiffs' complaint is that Defendants concealed the fact that they had installed \"defeat devices\" in Plaintiffs' cars-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , devices that reduced the effectiveness of the emissions control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and use. In other words, Plaintiffs contend that the vehicles emit excessive emissions under normal driving conditions and that the vehicles are in fact not eco-friendly. Based on that allegation, Plaintiffs have brought (1) fraud-based claims and (2) warranty-based claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Currently pending before the Court are two motions to dismiss: one brought by the FCA and VM Defendants and the other brought by the Bosch Defendants. Having considered the parties' briefs as well as the oral argument of counsel, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   in part both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The operative complaint is the first amended consolidated consumer class action complaint (\"FAC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 225 (FAC).

It distributes and sells motor vehicles under various brands, including Jeep and Ram.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 13. The motor vehicles at issue in the instant case are the 2014-2016 EcoDiesel trucks marketed under the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram 1500 model names (the \"Class Vehicles\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14, 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    VM Motori Defendants\n   </strong>\n   are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (1) VM Motori S.p.A.

To obtain a COC or EO, an automaker \"must submit an application, which lists all auxiliary emission control devices installed in the vehicle, a justification for each, and an explanation of why the control device is not a defeat device.\" FAC \u00b6 128. A defeat device is generally \"defined as any auxiliary emission control device 'that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and use.' \" FAC \u00b6 128 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2086.1803-01\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 86.1803-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \"Diesel engines pose a unique challenge\" with respect to emissions because \"the greater the power and fuel efficiency [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the benefits of a diesel engine], the dirtier and more harmful the emissions.\" FAC \u00b6 110. Notably, \"[d]iesel combustion produces NOx\"; \"NOx pollution contributes to nitrogen dioxide [and] particulate matter in the air, and reacts with sunlight in the atmosphere to form ozone. Exposure to these pollutants has been linked with serious health dangers.\" FAC \u00b6 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \"Given the [health] risks, minimizing NOx is paramount.\" FAC \u00b6 112. For the Class Vehicles, FCA US sought to minimize NOx through the EcoDiesel engine (supplied by the FCA N.V.-owned VM Motori Defendants).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 113 (alleging that \"[e]mission reductions start in the cylinder with advanced fuel injection strategies\" and, \"[a]fter the byproducts of combust\n   ion leave the engine, the EcoDiesel\u00ae technology treats these emissions using a diesel oxidation catalyst, diesel particulate filter, and SCR [selective catalytic reduction]\"). To control emissions from the EcoDiesel engine, the FCA entities used Bosch Defendants' EDC Unit 17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 114-15.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Bosch's EDC Unit 17 controls emissions by periodically reading sensor values, evaluating a control function, and controlling actuators based on the control signal. Sensor readings include crankshaft position, air pressure, air temperature, air mass, fuel temperature, oil temperature, coolant temperature, vehicle speed, exhaust oxygen content, as well as driver inputs such as accelerator pedal position, brake pedal position, cruise control setting, and selected gear. Based on sensor input, EDC [Unit] 17 controls and influences the fuel combustion process including, in particular, fuel injection timing, which affects engine power, fuel consumption, and the composition of the exhaust gas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   FAC \u00b6 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the FCA Defendants worked with the VM Motori Defendants and the Bosch Defendants\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   to customize the EDC Unit 17 to allow Class Vehicles to simulate \"passing\" the EPA and CARB [emission] testing. Unlike during testing, the software [in the EDC Unit 17] disables or restricts certain of the emission controls during real-world driving conditions. When the emission controls are de-activated on the road, the Class Vehicles emit up to 20 times the legal limits of NOx.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   FAC \u00b6 123;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 125 (alleging that all Defendants worked together \"to develop and implement a specific set of software algorithms for implementation in the Class Vehicles, which enabled FCA to adjust fuel levels, exhaust gas recirculation, air pressure levels, and even urea injection rates\"). Plaintiffs maintain that the software controls used for the EcoDiesel engines \"were concealed from regulators on COC and EO applications for the Class Vehicles, thus deceiving the EPA and CARB into approving the Class Vehicles for sale throughout the United States and California.\" FAC \u00b6 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On January 12, 2017, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation (\"NOV\") against the FCA entities for failing to disclose eight auxiliary emission control devices-which potentially were defeat devices (as defined in federal regulations)-in the 2014-2016 Ram 1500s and Jeep Grand Cherokees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 169. On the same day, CARB also issued a NOV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, not only were government regulators deceived by Defendants but also consumers-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants concealed from consumers the fact that defeat devices were installed in the Class Vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Notably, the lawsuits comprising this MDL followed in the wake of the Volkswagen \"clean diesel\" scandal. In the fall of 2015, the public learned that Volkswagen had installed a defeat device in 11 million diesel cars sold worldwide, including over 565,000 vehicles sold in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 156-57. News of the scandal gave rise to considerable civil and criminal litigation against the company. The civil cases filed in federal courts were transferred to the Hon. Charles R. Breyer in this District as part of an MDL. Classes of consumers who had purchased or leased affected Volkswagen vehicles ultimately settled their claims with the company and other defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Volkswagen \"Clean Diesel\" Mktg., Sales Practices, and Prods.

Uncertainty as to the sufficiency of their allegations of future injury, standing alone, does not negate the Article III standing with respect to the claims asserted in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Under the Ninth Circuit's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Hinojos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mazza\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Maya\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' allegations of overpayment satisfy Article III's injury-in-fact requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Traceability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Bosch Defendants separately argue that Plaintiffs' alleged economic injury is not fairly traceable to them because (1) Plaintiffs have not identified any statement that the Bosch Defendants made to Plaintiffs that could support a purportedly inflated price for the Class Vehicles; and (2) the Bosch Defendants were not a party to a contract with Plaintiffs and therefore have not deprived Plaintiffs of the benefit of their bargain with respect to the Class Vehicles. The Court does not find either of these arguments persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The thrust of Plaintiffs' allegations against the Bosch Defendants is not that these entities made misrepresentations directly to Plaintiffs, or that the Bosch Defendants entered into, and then breached, contracts with Plaintiffs. Rather, Plaintiffs allege that the Bosch Defendants participated in a scheme and conspiracy with the FCA and VM Motori Defendants to develop, implement, and conceal software used in the Class Vehicles to cheat emissions tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 215, 231, 238-40. Plaintiffs' alleged economic injuries are traceable to this conduct in at least two ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   First, the hidden software is part of what has rendered the Class Vehicles defective and, consequently, worth less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Toyota I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181754\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/790/1152/\">\n    790 F.Supp.2d at 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A vehicle with a defect is worth less than one without a defect.\"). Because the Bosch Defendants allegedly had a hand in developing and implementing this software, their conduct plausibly caused Plaintiffs' economic loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices &amp; Prods. Liab.

Cal. 2011) (concluding that Article III's traceability requirement was satisfied where the plaintiffs alleged that Toyota's \"defective designs resulted in devaluation of their vehicles purchased under the guise of defect-free vehicles\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Second, to the extent the Bosch Defendants knowingly concealed the software installed in the Class Vehicles from regulators and consumers, Plaintiffs' economic injuries are also fairly traceable to that conduct. This is because Plaintiffs contend that they would not have bought or leased the Class Vehicles, or would have paid less to do so, if Defendants had disclosed that the Class Vehicles were equipped with software used to cheat emissions tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 34-96;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juarez v.

Cal. 1981) (holding that plaintiffs' allegations of economic loss were \"fairly traceable to the defendants' failure to disclose\"). Plaintiffs' economic injuries are accordingly traceable to the Bosch Defendants' failure to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   As the above demonstrates, Plaintiffs do not need to identify a statement on which they relied that was made by the Bosch Defendants to plausibly trace their economic injuries to these entities. Nor do Plaintiffs need to allege that they had a contract with the Bosch Defendants. The Bosch Defendants played a role in designing the accused device that caused vehicles to perform in a way that deceived consumers and regulators, and allegedly did so knowingly and purposefully as part of a conspiracy with the other Defendants. The injuries suffered by Plaintiffs are sufficiently traceable to the Bosch Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Faced with nearly identical allegations, the district court in\n   <em>\n    In re Duramax Diesel Litigation\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-11661, --- F.R.D. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20949856\">\n    2018 WL 949856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2026543\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist.

In both instances, the named plaintiffs seek to bring claims under the laws of states where they reside or transacted with defendants, as well as under the laws of states where they do not reside and where they did not transact with defendants, but where other putative class members do or did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/\">\n    78 F.Supp.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referring to this as the \"sister state\" law scenario). The disjuncture in\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   was different. The claims there were federal and constitutional claims, so standing to assert state-law claims was not at issue. Rather, the disjuncture was factual, with plaintiffs who were stopped during saturation patrol seeking to being claims on behalf of others who were stopped during nonsaturation patrol. Ultimately, however, this distinction appears immaterial. As in\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   , there is a \"disjuncture between the claims of the named plaintiffs and absent class members.\"\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180252\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1254/\">\n    784 F.3d at 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And when such a disjuncture exists,\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   requires courts in the Ninth Circuit to apply the \"class certification approach.\" That is, once the named plaintiffs\n   demonstrate their individual standing to sue, as Plaintiffs have done here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II.A-B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the standing inquiry may be concluded; the disjuncture may better be addressed in the context of class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Even if\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   does not sweep so broadly as to impose a per se rule, however, and district courts retain discretion to address standing before or after class certification in the \"sister state\" law scenario, it is appropriate to defer the standing analysis here. In\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   , the Court chose to address standing before class certification in part because the named plaintiffs had ties to less than a third of the states for which state-law claims were asserted. (The named plaintiffs came from 13 states, and there were no named plaintiffs from 35 other states.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/\">\n    78 F.Supp.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the ratio of states with named Plaintiffs to states without is almost the opposite: the named Plaintiffs reside in or purchased or leased Class Vehicles in 43 states, and there are no named Plaintiffs for only seven states and the District of Columbia. As a result, Defendants would need to engage in near-nationwide discovery even if the Court dismissed the state-law claims for states that do not have a named Plaintiff. There is therefore less concern here, as compared to in\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   , about \"subjecting the [Defendants] to the expense and burden of nationwide discovery without Plaintiffs first securing actual plaintiffs who clearly have standing and are willing and able to assert claims under these state laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The other factor considered in\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   was whether deferral of the standing issue could lead to delay at the class certification stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/\">\n    at 1074-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Deferring consideration of the standing issue in this case, as in\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   , poses a risk of delay at the class certification stage. But because the number of states without a named Plaintiff is substantially smaller than in\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ\n   </em>\n   , such delay, if any, is likely to be short.

First, they allege that, but for Defendants' scheme to defraud the EPA and CARB, they could not have purchased or leased the Class Vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 274(A). In opposition to the motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs characterize this injury as \"damage in the amount of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the money\" they spent on the Class Vehicles. Opp'n at 23 (\"No consumer could have spent a single dime on the Class Vehicles but for Defendants' scheme.\"). Second, Plaintiffs allege that as a result of Defendants' scheme they overpaid \"at the time of purchase or lease for Class Vehicles purportedly having 'EcoDiesel' properties and benefits, and meeting applicable federal and state emissions standards, that did not have these properties or meet these standards.\" FAC \u00b6 274(B). Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they \"paid between $3,120 and $5,000 more for the EcoDiesel option than for the comparable gasoline vehicles.\" FAC \u00b6 191.

Drawing on those sources here, it is not plausible that Plaintiffs have been injured in an amount equal to the entire purchase price of the Class Vehicles because they have presumably been using the vehicles and obtaining value from them. (There are no allegations to the contrary.) Even if Plaintiffs theoretically could not have purchased and leased the Class Vehicles \"but for\" the fraud on the regulators, Plaintiffs did purchase and lease the Class Vehicles, and their use of the vehicles must be considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VW 2.0-Liter Settlement ApprovalOrder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206248426\">\n    2016 WL 6248426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 (\"Class Members could only be entitled to a full refund of the purchase price if they returned their vehicles in the same condition they received it.

Second, in\n   <em>\n    Anza\n   </em>\n   there were two \"discontinuit[ies] between the RICO violation and the asserted injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, there is no analogous layering of intervening independent factors that could have caused Plaintiffs' alleged injury. To be sure, factors other than the EcoDiesel features likely impacted the price of the Class Vehicles.

By deceiving regulators, Defendants were able to sell Class Vehicles that emitted NOx at levels up to 20 times legal limits and that contained one or more defeat devices.

Plaintiffs do not rely on a fraud on the market theory.

It arose because of difficult causation questions inherent in that context. As the Supreme\n   Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Halliburton\n   </em>\n   , the theory is based on the idea that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations .... [Thus], rather than scrutinize every piece of public information about a company for himself, the typical investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price-the belief that it reflects all public, material information. As a result, whenever the investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his reliance on any public material misrepresentations may be presumed ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581622\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2398/#p2408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The theory allows plaintiffs to prove and recover damages, based not on each shareholder's specific reliance upon the securities fraud committed by defendants, but derivatively through the discernible effect of the fraud upon the market price of securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Such a theory is not necessary nor is it invoked by Plaintiffs in the instant case for several reasons. First, reliance is not a necessary element of a RICO claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p652\">\n    553 U.S. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p652\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show ... that it relied on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations.\"). Second, to the extent Plaintiffs have asserted damages based on reliance, they pin their damages claim not indirectly or derivatively on the fraud's general effect on market prices, but on the fact that they \"paid between $3,120 and $5,000 more for the EcoDiesel option than for the comparable gasoline vehicles,\" FAC \u00b6 191, a premium they would not have paid had Defendants disclosed the emissions problems. Their claim for damages is not predicated on what would have happened generally to the market price of the class vehicles, but more directly on the fact that they would not have paid for something they did not get.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   To be sure, Defendants cite cases which have used the phrase \"fraud on the market\" to mean something else outside the context of securities fraud-as shorthand for a theory of overpayment that occurs when a seller's misrepresentations cause its goods or services to sell for an inflated price. Courts using this shorthand have held that such a theory of overpayment is too speculative to support a concrete RICO injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Schering-Plough\n   </em>\n   , for example, insurance companies alleged that a prescription drug manufacturer illegally marketed certain of its drugs for off-label uses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schering-Plough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202043604\">\n    2009 WL 2043604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.

First, Plaintiffs' allegations are materially distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Schering-Plough\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lawrie\n   </em>\n   . In those cases, the plaintiffs alleged that they overpaid for defendants' goods as a result of defendants' fraudulent misrepresentations about the goods, but the plaintiffs were not able to identify their overpayment with specificity. As a result, the plaintiffs in those cases, like securities fraud plaintiffs, had to rely on a kind of proxy theory to prove their economic injuries-basing their damages indirectly on the effects the frauds had on market prices for the goods they purchased. The courts in those cases, however, deemed the market effects of the\n   <s>\n    se\n   </s>\n   alleged frauds to be speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs have identified a specific range by which they allegedly overpaid for the Class Vehicles-\"between $3,120 and $5,000 more for the EcoDiesel option than for the comparable gasoline vehicles.\" FAC \u00b6 191. As noted above, these allegations of overpayment are not based on speculation as to the indirect effect of the fraud on the market but on the premiums that FCA US directly charged Plaintiffs for the Class Vehicles. The Court must take these allegations as true in considering the motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, Plaintiffs allege that the Bosch Defendants exercised near-total control over the EDC Unit 17: They locked the software \"to prevent customers, like Fiat Chrysler, from making significant changes on their own.\" FAC \u00b6 133. They also used other security measures to \"protect vehicle systems against unauthorized access in every operating phase.\" FAC \u00b6 134. Given this level of control, it is highly plausible that the Bosch Defendants played a role in developing and implementing the AECDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Additional support for this conclusion comes from allegations that researchers-at the University of California, San Diego and Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany-have analyzed technical documents showing that code written by the Bosch Defendants was used in a defeat device found in the Fiat 500X.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 126.

FAC \u00b6 174.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Despite the Bosch Defendants' plausible involvement with the hidden AECDs, Plaintiffs allege that the Bosch Defendants did not disclose the AECDs to regulators and the U.S. public.

For example, in January 2013 Bosch LLC marketed the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee in a PRNewswire press release as \"compliant with the most stringent emission regulations in the world.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9 &amp; n.5, 122.

Plaintiffs have accordingly pled with sufficient detail that the Bosch Defendants knowingly participated in the scheme to defraud for purposes of RICO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    VW Italy and VM America\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   FCA N.V. owns both VM Italy and VM America. VM Italy is an auto parts manufacturer, and VM America supports VM Italy customers and activities in North America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Plaintiffs allege that the VM Motori Defendants designed, calibrated, and manufactured the EcoDiesel engine used in the Class Vehicles,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 237, and that the VM Motori Defendants' comprehensive involvement with the EcoDiesel engine ultimately led them to work closely with the Bosch Defendants and the FCA Defendants \"to customize the EDC17 to allow Class Vehicles to simulate 'passing' the EPA and CARB testing.\" FAC \u00b6 132. The VM Motori Defendants' involvement with these customization efforts is plausible given that, to run effectively, the EcoDiesel engines required a careful balancing between engine performance and emission levels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 110-13. It is therefore plausible that the VM Defendants were responsible not only for the nuts and bolts of the EcoDiesel engine (managing elements such as power and performance), but also for how the EcoDiesel engine generated and treated emissions. This conclusion is supported further by allegations that the VM Motori Defendants participated in \"[e]xhaust after-treatment system development, and [e]nvironmental trips (hot/cold climate, high altitude, etc.).\" FAC \u00b6 120. And the VM Motori Defendants' facilities included a \"Rolling dyno for vehicle emission measurement and 17 engine test benches for emission/performance development.\" FAC \u00b6 237. Further, Plaintiffs allege that the VM Motori Defendants \"provided information to FCA [US] for inclusion in the COC and EO applications,\" FAC \u00b6 237, which also supports that the VM Motori Defendants were involved with the Class Vehicles' emissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Together, these allegations plausibly support that the VM Motori Defendants were knowing participants in the scheme to deceive regulators into certifying that the Class Vehicles.

They offer the following allegations in support of this position. Plaintiffs allege that the seeds of the emissions scheme were sown in 2009\n   when FCA N.V. acquired U.S. automaker Chrysler-which became FCA US-as part of FCA N.V.'s strategy to increase its North American presence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 102. To further that strategy, CEO Sergio Marchionne unveiled ambitious five-year plans in 2009 and 2014 to sell Jeep and Ram 1500 models with diesel engines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 102-03. Diesel-powered engines were a strength of FCA N.V.'s in the European market, and Mr. Marchionne sought to capitalize on this strength in the United States. FAC \u00b6 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Around the same time that Mr. Marchionne announced plans to sell more diesel-engine vehicles in the United States, emission standards in the United States \"were ratcheting up.\" FAC \u00b6 104. Certain automakers, including Toyota and Ford, responded by focusing on hybrid and electric vehicles. The FCA Defendants, along with Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and General Motors, instead sought to enter the \"clean diesel\" market, advertising light-duty diesel-engine vehicles powered by new emission-control technology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 104-06. Specifically, FCA N.V. used FCA US to \"design, market, manufacture and sell the Class Vehicles\" under the Jeep and Dodge brands. FAC \u00b6 231. FCA US then advertised the Class Vehicles as a more efficient alternative to gasoline vehicles, with no loss of power or performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 106, 145-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   While promoting the new EcoDiesel technology, Plaintiffs allege that behind the scenes the FCA Defendants were \"either unable or unwilling\" to develop the emission control technology needed to bring the EcoDiesel vehicles into compliance with U.S. emission standards. FAC \u00b6 123. \"Instead of cutting their losses on 'EcoDiesel,' delaying the production of the Class Vehicles, or coming clean,\" Plaintiffs allege that employees at both FCA entities \"worked closely with VM Italy and VM America and Bosch GmbH and Bosch LLC to customize the EDC Unit 17 to allow Class Vehicles to simulate 'passing' the EPA and CARB testing.\" FAC \u00b6 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   These allegations are sufficient to plausibly support the FCA Defendants' participation in the emissions scheme. Given Mr. Marchionne's focus on expanding FCA's footprint in the United States through the sale of diesel-engine vehicles, and the importance of meeting increasingly strict U.S. emission requirements to do so, it is plausible that the FCA Defendants would have been involved with customizing the emission software in the Class Vehicles, including the hidden AECDs. And although the Bosch Defendants are alleged to have maintained tight control over the EDC Unit 17,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 133, it is plausible that the FCA Defendants would have had some oversight over their work given that the EDC Unit 17 affected vehicle performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 110, 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Two other allegations also support the plausibility of the FCA Defendants' involvement with the hidden AECDs. First, in the study referenced above by researchers at the University of California, San Diego and Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany, the researchers studied various technical documents and concluded that the defeat devices in a Fiat vehicle were \"created\" by Bosch and then \"enabled\" by Fiat. FAC \u00b6 126. In other words, the researchers' study suggests that even if the Bosch Defendants developed the defeat devices, the FCA Defendants ultimately put them into use. Second, Plaintiffs allege-and Exhibit 6 to the Cafasso Declaration confirms-that in the EPA's January 12, 2017 NOV to the FCA Defendants for failure to disclose the eight hidden AECDs in the Class Vehicles, the EPA noted that \"\n   <em>\n    despite having the opportunity to do so\n   </em>\n   , Fiat and FCA failed to refute that the 'principle effect of one or more of these\n   AECDs was to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative one or more elements of design installed to comply with emissions standards under the [Clean Air Act].\" FAC \u00b6 3 (emphasis added) (alteration in original). If the FCA Defendants had not knowingly concealed the AECDs at issue, it is reasonable to infer that they would have disclosed the AECDs in discussions with the EPA. Their failure to do so further supports the plausibility of Plaintiffs' allegations that they knowingly participated in the scheme to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   iv.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Marchionne\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Mr. Marchionne, as the CEO of FCA N.V. and FCA US, is alleged to have been a champion of leveraging FCA N.V.'s strength in diesel engines to promote the sale of light-duty diesel engine vehicles in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 103-04, 227-28, 235. He made the sale of light-duty diesel-engine vehicles in the United States a part of his 2009 and 2014 five-year plans to increase the FCA Defendants' sales and market share.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 102-03. He also \"made numerous public statements on behalf of Fiat Chrysler concerning the Class Vehicles, their EcoDiesel\u00ae engines, and their emissions and performance characteristics.\" FAC \u00b6 18. With respect to emissions, he specifically noted in 2012 that he was still \"optimistic about the potential of light-duty diesels in the U.S. despite significant emissions challenges.\" FAC \u00b6 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Given Mr. Marchionne's focus on expanding the sale of diesel-engine vehicles in the United States, and his awareness of the regulatory challenges that the FCA Defendants faced to bring the EcoDiesel vehicles to market, it is plausible that Mr. Marchionne would have known about, and maintained oversight over, the modifications to the EcoDiesel engine that implemented the hidden AECDs. The allegations are therefore sufficient to support that Mr. Marchionne was also a knowing participant in the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rule 9(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   The allegations above not only plausibly support each Defendant's knowing participation in the alleged scheme, but they also answer the \"who,\" \"what,\" and \"how\" questions regarding the fraud as required to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344027\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/1097/#p1106\">\n    317 F.3d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, Mr. Marchionne championed the EcoDiesel project; FCA N.V. used FCA US to design, market, manufacture, and sell the Class Vehicles; both FCA entities oversaw and worked closely with the VM Motori Defendants and the Bosch Defendants to customize the emissions software for the Class Vehicles; and FCA US submitted the COC and EO applications to regulators that concealed the eight AECDs that are alleged to constitute defeat devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   As to \"where\" the fraud took place, Plaintiffs allege that the EcoDiesel engines were developed and calibrated in Michigan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 231, 237, which is where FCA US, Bosch LLC, and VM America are headquartered, and where Fiat's Group Executive Committee is based.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 12, 20, 23, 231, 235. As to \"when\" the fraud took place, the FAC can reasonably be read to support that customization of the EDC Unit 17 took place sometime between 2011 and 2014. This is based on allegations that the VM Motori Defendants began developing the EcoDiesel engine in 2011, FAC \u00b6 117, and that \"[i]n January 2013, Bosch LLC announced that its 'clean diesel' technology, including the EDC Unit 17, would be featured in the new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee 3.0-Liter EcoDiesel\u00ae.\" FAC \u00b6 122. Plaintiffs also allege that customization of the EDC17 was an intensive three- to five-year process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   The Bosch Defendants protest that Plaintiffs have improperly \"lumped\" the Bosch entities together, failing to specify\n   what each company's wrongdoing was.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bosch Mot. at 14. This \"lumping\" argument is not persuasive. As Plaintiffs point out, in their FAC, they have alleged that the Bosch Group-the \"umbrella\" that covers the Bosch Defendants (among others)-is divided into four business sectors,\" and the business sectors are \"grouped not by location, but by function. [Thus, for example,] [the business sector] Mobility Solutions [formerly Automotive Technology] includes knowledgeable individuals at both Bosch GmbH and Bosch LLC.\" FAC \u00b6 25. Accordingly, if there has been lumping together of the Bosch Defendants in the FAC, that is a direct result of how the Bosch Group and/or the Bosch Defendants have chosen to operate.

Conspicuously absent, however, are any allegations that FCA officials or Marchionne ever received test results, reports, or other communications indicating that FCA vehicles were not in compliance with relevant emissions regulations prior to the EPA's and CARB's notices on January 12, 2017.

In fact, the timing-chain defect in\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   may have very well been the result of an unintentional, negligent design flaw.

Such devices are not developed by accident or as part of routine business dealings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   Further, as detailed above, Plaintiffs' allegations plausibly support that each Defendant participated in developing or implementing the AECDs. Plaintiffs allege that the Bosch Defendants' software documentation describes parameters and functions that correlate with many of the hidden AECDs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 174; that the VM Motori Defendants were responsible for how the EcoDiesel engine generated and\n   treated emissions, and therefore plausibly would have been involved with implementing the AECDs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 110-13, 120, 237; and that the FCA Defendants initiated and oversaw development of the EcoDiesel engine and activated the AECDs in the Class Vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 102-06, 126.

First, with respect to Mr. Marchionne, Plaintiffs allege that it was his focus on diesel that led the FCA Defendants to develop light-duty diesel-engine vehicles for sale in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 226-28. Plaintiffs also allege that Mr. Marchionne was \"at the helm\" of the enterprise to illegally circumvent stringent U.S. emission standards. FAC \u00b6 236. Mr. Marchionne, then, did not simply perform services for the enterprise; he plausibly played a role in directing the enterprise's affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   The same is true for the FCA Defendants. Led by Mr. Marchionne, Plaintiffs allege that the FCA Defendants \"conspired to install and conceal emission control software in the EcoDiesel\u00ae engines to illegally circumvent stringent U.S. emission standards.\" FAC \u00b6 236. To further their efforts, both FCA entities are alleged to have \"worked with, and oversaw, VM Italy and VM America in the development and calibration of the engines at Michigan headquarters,\" FAC \u00b6 237, and to have \"worked closely with VM Italy and VM America and Bosch GmbH and Bosch LLC to customized the EDC Unit 17 to allow Class Vehicles to simulate 'passing' the EPA and CARB testing.\" FAC \u00b6 123. Together, the allegations support that the FCA Defendants were not simply taking orders, but instead were responsible for orchestrating the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   As for the VM Motori Defendants, Plaintiffs allege that they \"designed, manufactured, calibrated, and delivered the EcoDiesel\u00ae engine system for inclusion in the Class Vehicles.\" FAC \u00b6 22. Although some of this work may have been performed at the behest of the FCA Defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 237 (alleging that the FCA Defendants \"oversaw\" the VM Motori Defendants' development and calibration of the engines), Plaintiffs allege that the VM Defendants were \"deeply involved in the development and testing of all aspects of the engine.\" FAC \u00b6 119. Given their technical expertise and the importance of the EcoDiesel engine to the enterprise, it is plausible that the VM Motori Defendants participated in conducting the enterprise's affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   Finally, the Bosch Defendants argue that they were simply performing services for the enterprise. But given the level of control they are alleged to have maintained over the emissions software in the Class Vehicles, that conclusion is not sustainable at the pleading stage. Plaintiffs allege that the Bosch Defendants locked the EDC Unit 17 \"to prevent customers, like Fiat Chrysler, from making significant changes on their own.\" FAC \u00b6 133. As a result, the Bosch Defendants would have needed to consent to any customization of the EDC Unit 17, including the addition of the hidden AECDs.

In the alternative, however, Plaintiffs also seek to hold the Bosch Defendants liable for violating RICO under an aiding and abetting theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 254, 266.

There are three basic factual allegations in the FAC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-390\">\n   (1) Each named plaintiff decided to buy a Class Vehicle \"based in part on FCA [U.S.'s] representations that [the truck] was an 'EcoDiesel' vehicle (i.e., reduced emissions).\" FAC \u00b6 34\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Although the complaint is not the model of clarity, it appears that the \"EcoDiesel\" logo-using a leaf and green coloring-was displayed on each Class Vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 145. Defendants do not dispute the display of the \"EcoDiesel\" logo on the Class Vehicles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-391\">\n   (2) Each named plaintiff decided to buy a Class Vehicle based in part on the vehicle's advertised fuel economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 34\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-392\">\n   (3) Each named plaintiff was not aware that the Class Vehicle was equipped with a \"defeat device.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 34\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   With respect to (1), this is an allegation of an affirmative misrepresentation, and not a fraudulent omission or concealment. Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs have characterized their fraud-on-consumer claims solely as fraudulent concealment claims,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 276\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , that appears to be mistaken. This mistake, however, is inconsequential with respect to the Court's ability to adjudicate this claim. Defendants recognize that Plaintiffs have an affirmative misrepresentation theory based on the EcoDiesel logo displayed on\n   the Class Vehicles and attacked that theory in the pending motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   As for (2), this allegation does present a fraudulent concealment theory-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants failed to disclose that the advertised fuel economy could be achieved only because \"the emission treatment technology de-activated under real-world driving conditions.\" FAC \u00b6 278;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 34\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (alleging that each named plaintiff \"did not know that the Class Vehicle could perform as advertised only by emitting NOx at levels that are greater than advertised and above legal limits\"). The problem for Plaintiffs is that they have failed to identify what advertising they saw that promised certain fuel economy or performance, a predicate to Plaintiffs' specific concealment theory in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (providing that \"a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake\");\n   <em>\n    Kearns v.

While the FAC does refer to FCA U.S.'s website and some blogs operated by a FCA entity,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 148-49, 151-55, there is no allegation that any named plaintiff actually saw the website or blogs, or any promises contained therein, regarding fuel economy or performance.

Accordingly, for purposes of this opinion, the Court cannot consider the factual allegation in (2) as a basis for Plaintiffs' fraud claims; it is not sufficiently specific in identifying the advertisements which contained the misleading partial representations.

Furthermore, this is a concealment theory that the Court may consider for purposes of this opinion because this theory-unlike the fraudulent concealment theory in (2) above-is not dependent on any advertising by Defendants. In other words, this is a straight omission/concealment theory.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

Mr. Marchionne argues, for example, that \"Plaintiffs cite to only two statements by [him], both of which express intentions to expand FCA operations[;] [t]hose statements are not alleged to have been false or misleading in any way.\" FCA/VM Mot. at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   While Mr. Marchionne's position is not without some merit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 18 (alleging in conclusory terms that \"Mr. Marchionne has made numerous public statements on behalf of [the FCA entities] concerning the Class Vehicles, their EcoDiesel\u00ae engines, and their emissions and performance characteristics\"), there is enough in the FAC to withstand the 12(b)(6) challenge. Plaintiffs' theory is not that Mr. Marchionne himself made misrepresentations about EcoDiesel but rather that he \"signed off\" on the FCA companies' statements about EcoDiesel.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 261 (in RICO claim, alleging that \"FCA [US],\n   <em>\n    under the direction and control of [FCA N.V.] and [Mr.] Marchionne\n   </em>\n   , made misrepresentations about the Class Vehicles on their websites, YouTube, and through ads online, all of which were intended to mislead regulators and the public about the emission standards and other performance metrics\"). In other words, Mr. Marchionne approved of, or ratified, the use of the \"EcoDiesel\" logo on the Class Vehicles, and with knowledge of the emissions problem.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gassis v.

It is a reasonable inference that Mr. Marchionne approved or ratified use of the logo because there are allegations in the FAC that he heavily promoted diesel within the FCA entities, particularly with respect to the Jeep and Ram brands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 102\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1.a.iv,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (discussing knowing participation in scheme to defraud). Mr. Marchionne plausibly would have maintained oversight as to what was happening with the diesel engines, including but not limited to the \"EcoDiesel\" brand and the use of defeat devices which were instrumental in passing emissions tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   Finally, even if Mr. Marchionne did not approve or ratify any misrepresentation by the FCA companies, Plaintiffs also have, as discussed above, a fraudulent concealment theory. Similar to above, given the role that Mr. Marchionne played vis-\u00e0-vis diesel engines, it is a reasonable inference that he was directly involved with, and therefore knowledgeable about, what was happening with the EcoDiesel engines and FCA's concealment of the defeat devices. The Court therefore rejects this challenge raised by Mr. Marchionne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Bosch Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   The Bosch Defendants make an argument similar to that made by Mr. Marchionne; that is, the Bosch Defendants argue for dismissal on the ground that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the Bosch Defendants made any misrepresentations to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   The Bosch Defendants have a legitimate argument to the extent Plaintiffs are making a claim for an affirmative misrepresentation. Notably, the FAC does not contain any allegation that the Bosch Defendants had a hand in branding the Class Vehicles \"EcoDiesel.\" In addition, while there are allegations in the FAC about,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bosch press releases and promotional events,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 115, 122, 142-43, there is no allegation that any of the named plaintiffs saw the press releases or participated in the promotional events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   That being said, as discussed above, Plaintiffs are not simply relying on an affirmative misrepresentation theory; rather, they also have a fraudulent concealment theory. The fraudulent concealment theory is not dependent on any advertising by any defendant, including but not limited to the Bosch Defendants. As noted in the above discussion regarding RICO liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1.a.i,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (discussing knowing participation in scheme to defraud), the FAC alleges that the Bosch Defendants played a substantial and knowing role in devising and installing the defeat devices, and concealed that fact from the government and consumers. The Court therefore rejects the Bosch Defendants' argument that no claim of concealment is possible absent any particular advertisement being seen by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   To the extent the Bosch Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to distinguish\n   between the two Bosch companies-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pinpoint what\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   company's alleged misconduct was vis-\u00e0-vis the alleged concealment-as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1.a,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court is not persuaded. While, in general, \"lumping\" of defendants is not permissible, Plaintiffs have made allegations explaining why it is appropriate in the instant case, at least at this stage of the proceedings. That is, at this early stage in the proceedings, Plaintiffs have essentially been forced to lump the Bosch companies because the Bosch Defendants have chosen to operate a specific way, grouping business sectors by function (instead of location), such that plausibly both Bosch companies played a role with respect to the EDC Unit 17 that was used in Class Vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' fraud-on-consumer claims, whether based on an affirmative representation theory (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , misleadingly branding the Class Vehicles \"EcoDiesel\") or a fraudulent concealment theory (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , failing to disclose the defeat devices in the Class Vehicles), are preempted.

To meet them the vehicle must not emit more than a certain amount of a given pollutant, must be equipped with a certain type of pollution-control device, or must have some other design feature related to the control of emissions. This interpretation is consistent with the use of \"standard\" throughout Title II of the CAA (which governs emissions from moving sources) to denote requirements such as numerical emission levels with which vehicles or engines must comply\n   or emission-control technology with which they must be equipped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877502\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/246/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877502\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/246/\">\n    at 252-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877502\" index=\"475\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/246/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Jensen Family Farms, Inc. v.

Section 209(e)(2) essentially bars states and political subdivisions thereof from adopting and enforcing \" 'standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions from' \" nonroad engines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648855\" index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/934/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648855\" index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/934/\">\n    at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   was a for-profit agricultural corporation that owned and operated diesel engines, in particular, to provide power to irrigation pumps on its farms. It filed suit against the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District after the District adopted and began to enforce rules regulating diesel-powered engines. The rules included ones that required owners and operators to register and pay fees for certain diesel engines used in agricultural operations. The plaintiff asserted that these rules were preempted by the CAA because, even though they did not directly control emissions, they were still\n   <em>\n    related to\n   </em>\n   emissions control. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-417\">\n   We find this argument unconvincing. Jensen specifically argues that because the legislative mission of the District is to \"control ... air pollution from all sources [other than motor vehicles],\" Rules 220 and 310 necessarily relate to emissions standards.

Such a broad reading of the \"relating to\" clause would render inconsequential the analysis contained in [\n   <em>\n    EMA\n   </em>\n   ], which clarified the breadth of the word \"standard.\" Moreover, the Court did not suggest in [\n   <em>\n    EMA\n   </em>\n   ] that the statutory mission of the governmental authority has a bearing on whether its air pollution regulations are federally preempted. We therefore decline to embrace Jensen's expansive interpretation of the term \"relating to.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648855\" index=\"478\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648855\" index=\"478\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/934/\">\n    at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Given the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   , this Court likewise does not apply an overly broad reading of the phrase \"relating to\" as used in \u00a7 209(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   Bearing in mind the above, the Court holds that the fraud-on-consumer claims herein are not expressly preempted by the CAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Affirmative Misrepresentation Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   The Court addresses first Plaintiffs' fraud claims based on an affirmative misrepresentation theory. As discussed above, the affirmative misrepresentation theory is based on the branding of the Class Vehicles as \"EcoDiesel,\" a logo displayed on the Class Vehicles themselves. According to Plaintiffs, \"EcoDiesel\" conveys that the Class Vehicles are environmentally friendly (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , reduced emissions) when in fact they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   The Court holds that the affirmative misrepresentation claims are not an attempt to enforce an emissions control standard, and thus not subject to CAA preemption. In reaching this conclusion, the Court finds the reasoning of the state court in\n   <em>\n    In re Volkswagen \"Clean Diesel\" Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"479\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Va.%20Cir.%20189\">\n    94 Va.

The state court noted that\n   the CAA preemption provision would be a bar to a claim only \"if the legal duty that is the predicate of the [claim] 'relates to' enforcement of new motor vehicle emission standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195. The court then held that, with respect to the plaintiffs' fraud and consumer protection claims, there was no CAA preemption.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-424\">\n   On their face, Plaintiffs' fraud and [consumer protection] claims do not rely on emissions violations or enforcement to make out their claims. Instead Plaintiffs' claims rely upon allegedly false promises of compliance, efficiency, and new technology; or concealment of the fact that compliance testing was being circumvented. Although Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    reference\n   </em>\n   the EPA violation notice in support of their allegations of falsehood and concealment, their claims ultimately rest on and seek remediation of injuries arising from\n   <em>\n    misrepresentations and concealment\n   </em>\n   of material facts made to (or hidden from) the Plaintiffs about the compliance, efficiency, and technology of their vehicles....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-425\">\n   Plaintiffs' lack of reliance on emissions standards is further revealed when one considers whether Plaintiffs even need to assert lack of compliance in raising their fraud and [consumer protection] claims. Plaintiffs point to advertising materials and news releases promising not only compliance with regulations, but also describing new technologies developed by [VW] and offering improved fuel economy. Plaintiffs also point to [VW's] public statement that it had been \"dishonest\" to consumers in such advertising. As such, and although emissions compliance or lack thereof\n   <em>\n    may be further proof of deceit\n   </em>\n   , it is\n   <em>\n    the deceit about compliance\n   </em>\n   , rather than the need to enforce compliance, that is the gravamen of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196-97 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    VW Va.\n   </em>\n   thus rested on two points. First, the gravamen of the complaint was misrepresentation and concealment, not the violation itself of federal regulations. Second, as a factual matter, the state claims could be established independent of any federal regulatory standard, even if, as a matter of proof, evidence of regulatory violations would strengthen the case.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Counts v.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    VW Va.\n   </em>\n   , the wrongful conduct being targeted by Plaintiffs is not Defendants' failure to comply with federal law (the CAA), but rather Defendants'\n   <em>\n    deceit\n   </em>\n   about the vehicles' emissions. In other words, the legal duty underlying Plaintiffs' affirmative misrepresentation claims is not a federal law requirement but rather a state tort law prohibiting deception. Furthermore, Plaintiffs may establish their affirmative misrepresentation claims without proving a violation of the CAA. For example, Plaintiffs could prove that the Class Vehicles are not environmentally friendly (contrary to the \"EcoDiesel\" label) by offering evidence\n   as to how much NOx is spewed into the air when the vehicles are in regular use and then offering expert testimony as to how that amount of NOx poses risks to health and safety.

The state court's ruling on the common law claims appears to have been informed by the AG's issuance of subpoenas.

They sued manufacturers of urban transit buses and diesel engines, claiming injury as a result of their ingestion of harmful diesel exhaust fumes. The plaintiffs' claims included claims for negligence and strict product liability. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants were negligent because,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the vehicles did not meet emissions standards of the CAA; also, with respect to strict product liability, the design of the buses violated CAA emissions standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   court held that the plaintiffs' claims were preempted by the CAA.

First, contrary to what Defendants\n   argue, it is plausible that a reasonable consumer would understand \"EcoDiesel\" to mean environmentally friendly or reduced emissions. While it is also plausible that a reasonable consumer would simply understand \"EcoDiesel\" to mean good fuel economy (as Defendants maintain), the fact that there is an equally plausible interpretation in Plaintiffs' favor means that Plaintiffs survive a 12(b)(6) challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starr v.

At this point in the proceedings, Plaintiffs need only prove that it is plausible that the \"EcoDiesel\" representation is not a representation that is \" 'extremely unlikely to induce consumer reliance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Demetriades\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331106\" index=\"567\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/228/294/#p311\">\n    228 Cal.

Plaintiffs' allegations suffice. \"[A]dvertising statements placed in an ad knowing or intending that they are of the type that will affect the consumer's judgment, are not puffery, but rather constitute actionable representations.\"\n   <em>\n    U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v.

Here, it is a reasonable inference that Defendants marketed the Class Vehicles as \"EcoDiesel\" intending and expecting to cash in on the consumer interest in \"green\" products. Notably, the representation that the Class Vehicles were environmentally friendly is different in nature from the representations that are generally deemed puffery-classic examples being a vague advertising claim that one's product is better than a competitor's or a boastful, exaggerated description of a product.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"570\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20691757\">\n    2012 WL 691757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9, 2012 Ohio App. LEXIS 752, at *26-27 (noting that, \"[i]n general, '[m]ost statements of puffery consist of vague advertising claims that one's product is better than comparable products offered by competitors' \" and \"[e]xamples of puffery include 'boastful assertions and exaggerated descriptions,' such as 'luxuriously soft,' 'the real McCoy,' and 'classic detail' \");\n   <em>\n    Kesling v.

This Court, like the court in\n   <em>\n    Counts\n   </em>\n   , deems those arguments waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Counts\n   </em>\n   , 237 F.Supp.3d at 594 (noting that both parties \"attempt[ ] to 'raise' certain state-specific arguments by referencing appendices attached to their briefing\"; adding that the \"scattershot effort to raise arguments and defenses by simply citing to dozens, if not hundreds, of state court cases will not be addressed,\" particularly as the court permitted expanded briefing and a court is not \"responsible for combing through appendices in an attempt to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise and resolve legal arguments which the parties have not briefed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   That being said, the Court finds that each of these three issues has largely been addressed above-(1) and (2) in the context of the common law fraud claims and (3) in the context of Article III standing. Also, with respect to (1), it is not clear that reliance is required for all consumer protection statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 65-66 &amp; n.34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-547\">\n   The Court now turns to the specific challenges to the consumer protection claims, as raised in Defendants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-548\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prohibitions on Class Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   Defendants' first substantive argument with respect to the consumer protection claims is that some states do not allow class actions for violation of their consumer protection statutes. More specifically, Defendants advance three arguments: (1) that multiple states (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and South Carolina) do not allow class actions for violations of their consumer protection statutes; (2) that two states (Colorado and Tennessee) do not allow for class actions for damages for violations of their consumer protection statutes; and (3) that one state (Iowa) requires approval of the attorney general before a consumer protection class action may be brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   In response to (1) and (2), Plaintiffs argue that a decision is premature; that is, the issues are better addressed when Plaintiffs move for class certification. Plaintiffs add that, in any event, Defendants' two arguments do not dispose of Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   claims for relief. Both of Plaintiffs' responsive arguments have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-551\">\n   As for (3)-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in Iowa, approval of the attorney general is needed first for a class action), here, Defendants are in better stead. Iowa Code \u00a7 714H.7 provides as follows: \"A class action lawsuit alleging a\n   violation of this chapter\n   <em>\n    shall not be filed\n   </em>\n   with a court unless it has been approved by the attorney general.\" Iowa Code \u00a7 714H.7 (emphasis added). However, that deficiency is potentially capable of being cured, and therefore, the Court gives Plaintiffs leave to amend their Iowa consumer protection claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Prohibitions on Actions for Damages and Standing for Injunctive Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-553\">\n   Defendants argue next that some states (Delaware, Georgia, and Minnesota) do not allow any actions (private or class) for damages and, to the extent Plaintiffs want injunctive relief with respect to these state consumer protection statutes, they lack standing such that the consumer protection claims for these states should be dismissed in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-554\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Defendants are wrong on Delaware in that Delaware does provide for damages. Under Delaware law, \"[i]f damages are awarded to the aggrieved party under the common law or other statutes of this State, such damages shall be treble the amount of the actual damages proved.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"626\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%206%2C%20%C2%A7%202533\">\n    Del.

Nevertheless, contrary to what Defendants argue, Plaintiffs do have standing to pursue injunctive relief under Georgia and Minnesota (or even Delaware) law. A plaintiff has standing to seek injunctive relief to address an \"ongoing injury,\"\n   <em>\n    Mayfield v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223912\" index=\"628\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/964/#p969\">\n    599 F.3d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (9th Cir. 2010), and, here, Plaintiffs have alleged that they are still suffering ongoing harm based on Defendants' past conduct-at the very least, the Class Vehicles need to be fixed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-556\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Heightened Pleading Requirements re Injury and Scienter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-557\">\n   Defendants argue that the consumer protection claims should also be dismissed for those states that have heightened pleading requirements for injury. See FCA/VM Mot. at 57-58 (asserting that there are twenty-five such states). Defendants also argue that there is a heightened pleading requirement for scienter in certain states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FCA/VM Mot. at 58-59 (arguing that there are fourteen such states). Neither argument is persuasive. Defendants' injury argument is effectively a rehash of its argument above regarding damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (addressing injury-in-fact); Part III.A.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (addressing RICO injury),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and Defendants' scienter argument is not supported by their citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-558\">\n   To the extent Defendants are trying to make a different argument on scienter-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that a defendant in a consumer\n   protection case must have acted with the intent to\n   <em>\n    deceive\n   </em>\n   -Plaintiffs have, in fact, made allegations regarding such an intent, as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1.a to .b,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs properly assert that not all consumer protection claims actually require, as an essential element, an intent to deceive.

These cases do not address the situation where a contract is with a defendant's dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-577\">\n   As for Kentucky, however, Plaintiffs have the weaker position. The case cited by Defendants states that \"[c]laims may only be brought under the [Kentucky Consumer Protection Act] by individuals who personally purchase goods or services from a merchant.\"\n   <em>\n    Keaton v.

But the\n   <em>\n    Keaton\n   </em>\n   court went further and required that the plaintiffs have a direct contractual relationship with the defendant. According to the court, the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring a consumer protection claim against a subcontractor because there was no immediate contract between the plaintiffs and the subcontractor. The plaintiffs had a contract with the contractor only, not the subcontractor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928275\" index=\"671\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/436/538/#p546\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The fact that the subcontractor seemed to have a close relationship with the contractor-the two companies had \"common owners\"-did not impact the court's decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928275\" index=\"672\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/436/538/#p546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Keaton\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs' mother was buried in a plot different from the one she had purchased next to her husband. The mother was eventually reinterred in the correct plot. The plaintiffs filed suit against both the funeral home and the cemetery. One of the claims asserted was violation of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act. The court held that the plaintiffs did not have a claim against the cemetery because they did not have a contract with the cemetery; rather, the only contract the plaintiffs had was with the funeral home who then subcontracted with the cemetery to perform the interment. The court stated that because there was no privity of contract between the plaintiffs and the cemetery, they lacked standing to pursue a claim against the cemetery. Arguably, the situation here is distinguishable because the dealers who sold the Class Vehicles acted as agents for FCA. However, Plaintiffs do not cite any cases employing agency theory for the Kentucky Consumers Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-578\">\n   The Kentucky case cited by Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    Craig &amp; Bishop, Inc. v.

There, the defendant, a used car dealer, argued that the plaintiffs did not have consumer protection claim because there was an incomplete sales transaction. The Kentucky Supreme Court rejected the defendant's argument but only because the statute simply required that a person \"purchase\" a good or service, and purchase was defined broadly as \" 'taking\n   by sale, lease, discount, negotiation, mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest, issue or reissue, gift, or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in property.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8387637\" index=\"674\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/247/897/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8387637\" index=\"674\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/247/897/\">\n    at 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In contrast, in the case at bar, there is no direct relationship between Plaintiffs and Defendants, only a relationship between Plaintiffs and the dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-581\">\n   In sum, the Court finds in Plaintiffs' favor on the Idaho claim and Defendants' favor on the Kentucky claim. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Kentucky consumer protection claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-582\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-583\">\n   According to Defendants multiple states bar punitive damages as relief-namely, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Defendants also argue that Oklahoma requires malice or evil intent for punitives, and Plaintiffs have failed to allege such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-584\">\n   Plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss their claims for punitives under Nebraska and West Virginia law (without prejudice).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 69. They have also conceded that Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, and South Dakota do not allow for punitives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 69-79. This resolves all of the states identified by Defendants, except for Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-585\">\n   As to Oklahoma, Plaintiffs have adequate alleged malice. As noted above, Plaintiffs' theory is that there was specific manipulation of the emission control system which resulted in NOx emissions up to twenty times the legal limit. Hence, the motion to dismiss the Oklahoma claim for punitive damages is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-586\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Identification of False Advertisements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   Defendants also argue for dismissal of the New York consumer protection claim on the ground that New York law requires all allegedly false advertisements to be identified. As discussed above, Plaintiffs have identified one specific affirmative misrepresentation-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the use of the \"EcoDiesel\" logo on the Class Vehicles. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the New York consumer protection claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-588\">\n   9.\n   <em>\n    Attorney General Approval\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-589\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that at least one state (Mississippi) requires the approval of the state attorney general before a private suit may be filed for violation of the consumer protection statute. Plaintiffs concede but ask the Court for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 70.

Plaintiffs' warranty claims are as follows: (1) breach of express warranty under state law; (2) breach of implied warranty under state law; and (3) breach of written and implied warranties under federal law (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a violation of the MMWA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    State Law Warranty Claims: Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-593\">\n   Defendants argue that the state law warranty claims (both express and implied) should be dismissed because of preemption. In addressing this argument, the Court begins by identifying the factual predicate for the warranty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-594\">\n   For breach of express warranty, the warranties at issue are two emission control warranties, which, as expressly alleged in the FAC, federal law\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   manufacturers to provide: (1) a \"Performance Warranty\" and (2) a \"Defect Warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 453 (allegations regarding claim for breach of express warranty under California law). For breach of implied warranty, the Class Vehicles are allegedly not in merchantable condition because their design violated state and federal laws; furthermore, the Class Vehicles are allegedly not fit for their ordinary purpose because they were built to evade state and federal emission standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 465 (allegations regarding claim for breach of implied warranty under California law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-595\">\n   Based on the factual predicate of the warranty claims, the Court agrees with Defendants that there is preemption-more specifically, that the warranty claims are expressly preempted by the CAA.

The court explained as follows: \"Here, the relief sought in each of the injunctive counts, Lemon law claims, warranty claims, and public nuisance claims directly relates to enforcement of emissions standards because the basis for the breach or nuisance is violation of the federal emissions standards.\"\n   <em>\n    VW Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"688\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Va.%20Cir.%20189\">\n    94 Va. Cir. at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the legal duty that was the predicate of these claims was compliance with CAA emissions standards. Indeed, unlike the claims of fraud and deception discussed above, noncompliance with the CAA emissions standards constitutes the breach-of-warranty claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"689\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Va.%20Cir.%20189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , that \"the Virginia Lemon Law and breach of warranty claims cite Plaintiffs having to drive an 'illegal' vehicle or one that fails to comply with emissions regulations as the source of their injury\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-602\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that, in the instant case, the warranties were voluntarily adopted and therefore their warranty claims are really based on contract. But that argument has no force for the express warranty claim because that claim is based on a \"Performance Warranty\" and a \"Defect Warranty,\" both of which-as alleged in the FAC-are required by federal law.

There, the Supreme Court did note that \"[a] manufacturer's liability for breach of an express warranty derives from, and is measured by, the terms of that warranty. Accordingly, the 'requirements' imposed by an express warranty claim are not 'imposed under State law [the language used in the preemption provision at issue],' but rather imposed\n   <em>\n    by the warrantor.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481129\" index=\"693\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/504/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481129\" index=\"693\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/504/\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481129\" index=\"694\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/504/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). But in the instant case, the warranties at issue\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   required by federal law. And a finding of violation of a CAA emissions standard necessarily results in a breach of warranty without any intervening independent and volitional conduct (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , deceit and misrepresentation) by the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-603\">\n   As for the implied warranty claims, Plaintiffs' voluntariness argument is irrelevant because the voluntariness question applies to express warranties only. In other\n   words, a defendant can voluntarily adopt only an express warranty. Implied warranties obtain irrespective of a defendant's volition. The problem for Plaintiffs is that their implied warranty claims are entirely predicated on compliance with federal emissions standards (EPA or CARB). Breach of the implied warranty is synonymous with violation of federal emissions standards, and thus, this amounts to direct enforcement of federal emissions standards preempted by the CAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-604\">\n   Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' state law warranty claims (both express and implied) based on express preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-605\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Federal MMWA Warranty Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-606\">\n   Defendants take the position that, if the state warranty claims are preempted, then the federal warranty claim must be dismissed as well, not because of preemption per se but because the federal warranty claim is ultimately based on state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FCA/VM Mot. at 49 (arguing that, \"[b]ecause Plaintiffs do not adequately plead state warranty claims, their MMWA claim fails along with all of their state warranty claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-607\">\n   Defendants' position is problematic. The MMWA provides in relevant part that \"[a] consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier, warrantor, or service contractor to comply with any obligation ... under a written warranty [or] implied warranty ... may bring suit for damages and other legal and equitable relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"695\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added). Admittedly, if a plaintiff cannot state a claim for breach of warranty under state law, then it makes sense that the plaintiff cannot state a MMWA claim either.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"696\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2301(7) (defining \"implied warranty\" as \"an implied warranty arising under State law\"). However, in the instant case, there is no contention that Plaintiffs have failed to state a substantive claim for breach of warranty under state law; rather, the only challenge that Defendants have made to the state warranty claims is that such claims are preempted. Preemption is a question entirely independent of the merits of breach of warranty claims. Defendants have cited no case holding that MMWA's effective incorporation by reference to state warranty claims is meant to refer to anything other than the merits of such claims. Absent case authority so holding, the Court is not persuaded that a finding of CAA preemption should vitiate a MMWA claim. After all, the MMWA is a federal law and its incorporation of state law to create a\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   cause of action would, if anything, counsel against preemption, at least in the absence of a clear congressional directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-608\">\n   The cases that Defendants cite in their brief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FCA/VM Mot. at 49, are distinguishable precisely because they do not address the issue of whether preemption of a state warranty claim\n   <em>\n    by itself\n   </em>\n   is a reason to dismiss a MMWA claim. For example, the court in\n   <em>\n    Meaunrit v.

Therefore, dismissal of the MMWA claim could have rested on failure to state a claim for relief alone (and not preemption).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-609\">\n   Accordingly, although the Court finds preemption of the state claims for breach of warranty (express and implied), there is no reason why the MMWA warranty claim cannot continue at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-610\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     PERSONAL JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-611\">\n   The final issue for the Court is whether it has personal jurisdiction over the foreign entities that have been sued-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , FCA N.V., VM Italy, and Bosch GmbH.
