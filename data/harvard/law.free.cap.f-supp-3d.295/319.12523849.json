For the reasons set forth below, plaintiff's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Section 1983 action arises from plaintiff's arrest on February 15, 2008. On the evening of February 14, 2008, the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") received reports of two attempted gun-point robberies of taxi drivers committed by two individuals in the area of the Simpson Street subway station in the Bronx, New York (Defendants' Memorandum of Law, dated Sept. 13, 2017 (D.I. 75) (\"Def. Mem.\") at 7). According to defendants, officers from several precincts, including defendant Officer Philip Lobello, were dispatched to search for the suspects (Def. Mem. at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his Amended Complaint, plaintiff alleges that, during the early morning of February 15, 2008, he was leaving a party in the Bronx and was walking towards a subway station in order to make his way back to Queens, where he lived (Amended Complaint dated Oct. 4, 2011 (D.I. 12) (\"Am. Compl.\") at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that he was stopped by Lobello and his police dog (Am. Compl. at 3). In compliance with Lobello's directive, plaintiff alleges that he presented his identification to Lobello (Am. Compl. at 3). Plaintiff further alleges that Lobello ordered him to stand against a nearby wall (Am. Compl. at 3). According to plaintiff, shortly thereafter, Lobello's police dog began to bark, prompting plaintiff to ask that Lobello hold the police dog's leash tighter (Am. Compl. at 3). Lobello allegedly responded, \"No! He's an officer and he can search you too!\" (Am. Compl. at 3). Plaintiff claims that Lobello then unleashed the police dog without any justification or provocation, and that the police dog attacked plaintiff until he lost consciousness (Am. Compl. at 3). As plaintiff was lying face down on the sidewalk, bloodied and unconscious, he was arrested (Am Compl. at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was treated for his injuries at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center (\"LMMHC\") (Am. Compl. at 5, 8). As a result of the attack, plaintiff sustained multiple puncture wounds on his neck, rear, arms and forearms (Am. Compl. at 3, 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although plaintiff made no mention of it in his Complaint or Amended Complaint, he alleges in his proposed Third Amended Complaint that he learned at LMMHC that he had been arrested for pointing a firearm at and attempting to shoot a police officer, and that a police dog had subdued him (Proposed TAG \u00b6 12). In addition, defendants state in their Answer that plaintiff was charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon, menacing and criminal possession of stolen property following his arrest (Answer, dated Feb. 13, 2012 (D.I. 20) ). Defendants also advise in their response to plaintiff's motion that a jury convicted plaintiff of criminal possession of a weapon and resisting arrest, but acquitted plaintiff of robbery, on April 12,\n   2011 (Def. Mem. at 8 n.2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 2, 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 13, 2011, plaintiff was sentenced to seven years in prison-a sentence that he is currently serving-and five years of post-release supervision (Def. Mem. at 7-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 16, 2011, plaintiff commenced this Section 1983 action against Oliver and Lobello, former NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly and the City of New York (Complaint). Although plaintiff's Amended Complaint did not specify which of his federal rights were violated, plaintiff appears to be alleging claims for excessive force and false arrest under Section 1983 (Am. Compl. at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 21, 2012, plaintiff sought leave of court to file a Second Amended Complaint (Motion to Amend the Amended Complaint, dated June 21, 2012 (D.I. 30) ). The proposed Second Amended Complaint (1) asserted unspecified state law claims and (2) added 13 LMMHC employees as defendants (Proposed Second Amended Complaint, dated Sept. 3, 2012, annexed as Ex. B to Declaration of Aimee K. Lulich, Esq., dated Sept. 13, 2017 (D.I. 76) (\"Lulich Decl.\") ). While that motion was pending, plaintiff retained attorney David Segal to represent him in this action (Notice of Appearance, dated Nov. 11, 2013 (D.I. 45) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By Opinion and Order dated May 2, 2014, the Honorable Andrew L. Carter, Jr., United States District Judge, granted in part and denied in part plaintiff's motion to file his proposed Second Amended Complaint (Opinion and Order of Judge Carter, dated May 2, 2014 (D.I. 52) (\"May 2, 2014 Order\") ). Specifically, Judge Carter granted plaintiff leave to add the 13 LMMHC employees as defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (2) and 15(c) (May 2, 2014 Order at 5-6). However, Judge Carter denied plaintiff's motion to the extent that it sought leave to assert any state law claims against both the named and proposed defendants (May 2, 2014 Order at 4-6). Judge Carter directed that plaintiff file a Second Amended Complaint with the appropriate amendments by no later than May 16, 2014 (May 2, 2014 Order at 7). That deadline passed without any submission from plaintiff or Segal; Judge Carter granted an extension of time for plaintiff to file his amended pleadings\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   and set a deadline of July 22, 2014, noting that he was \"not inclined to grant further relief from this deadline unless good cause is shown\" (Order of Judge Carter, dated July 14, 2014 (D.I. 54) (\"July 14, 2014 Order\") ). Although Segal appeared on plaintiff's behalf at a pretrial conference held on July 21, 2014 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order of the undersigned, dated July 22, 2014 (D.I. 55) ), neither he nor plaintiff ever filed a Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In March 2015, I advised plaintiff that Segal had been suspended from the practice of law for one year beginning in December 2014, and asked plaintiff how he wished to proceed (Order of the undersigned, dated Mar. 27, 2015 (D.I. 66)(\"Mar. 27, 2015 Order\") ). Plaintiff chose to place the matter in suspense until Segal's suspension ended; however, Segal has not responded to communications from either plaintiff or the Court (Mar. 27, 2015 Order; Letter of Jermaine Dunham to the undersigned, dated July 7, 2015 (D.I. 69) (\"Dunham's Letter\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Applications for Pro Bono Counsel, dated Dec. 2, 2016\n   (D.I. 70) (\"Pl. Pro Bono App.\") at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff made numerous, unsuccessful, attempts to secure competent counsel (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Pro Bono App.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed the instant motion on August 18, 2017. Plaintiff's proposed amendments (1) add \"Lieutenant Batignani\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a defendant and (2) assert \"new\" claims for (a) assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence under state law and (b) malicious prosecution under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments against Lobello, Oliver and proposed defendant Batignani (Proposed TAC \u00b6\u00b6 28-55). For the purpose of resolving this motion, I shall assume that plaintiff also intends to assert these claims against the remaining named defendants, Commissioner Kelly and the City of New York, and that his failure to do so was inadvertent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to Batignani, plaintiff alleges, among other things, that one of the robbery victims provided Batignani with a description of the suspects (Proposed TAC \u00b6\u00b6 4-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, plaintiff alleges, Batignani canvassed the area and observed, but lost track of, an individual fitting the description of one of the suspects and carrying something in his hand (Supp. to Proposed TAC \u00b6 6). Batignani radioed a description and the approximate location of the individual to other officers involved in the search, including Lobello, and directed that they establish a perimeter around the area (Supp. to Proposed TAC \u00b6 7). Plaintiff appears to allege that Batignani's directive led to plaintiff's arrest. Furthermore, plaintiff also appears to allege that he did not fit the description of the suspect that Batignani had allegedly conveyed to the responding officers (Proposed TAC \u00b6 23). Plaintiff alleges that, although Batignani did not personally observe plaintiff's arrest, he learned of it when he arrived at the scene of arrest afterwards (Supp. to Proposed TAC \u00b6 8). Plaintiff also states that Batignani learned by police radio that Lobello had stopped plaintiff as that stop was occurring (Mot. at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff's motion should be denied in its entirety due to\n   plaintiff's failure to file his Second Amended Complaint by the deadline provided in Judge Carter's July 14, 2014 Order (Def. Mem. at 12-13). Furthermore, defendants appear to argue that plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint is redundant of his Amended Complaint, except for that it seeks to (1) add Lieutenant Batignani as a defendant, (2) assert state law tort claims and (3) assert a claim for malicious prosecution. Defendants argue that each of these amendments is futile and that plaintiff's motion to amend must, therefore, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The standards applicable to a motion to amend a pleading pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2) are well stated and require only brief review.

Rather, plaintiff's failure to submit an amended complaint was principally caused by \"extraordinary circumstances\"-the well-established and detailed allegations of Segal's attorney misconduct. Specifically, on December 9, 2014, Segal was suspended from the practice of law for a \"pattern of misconduct\" in a number of matters, including failing to communicate with clients and ignoring court scheduling orders.\n   <em>\n    In re Segal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340747\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/123/260/\">\n    123 A.D.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340747\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/123/260/\">\n    997 N.Y.S.2d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dep't 2014). Segal appears to have conducted himself in a similar manner with respect to his representation of plaintiff here. Not only did Segal fail to submit plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint in compliance with Judge Carter's July 14, 2014 Order, he failed to advise plaintiff of his default. In fact, Segal's communication with plaintiff was so deficient that plaintiff was entirely unaware that Segal had been suspended from the practice of law until the Court informed plaintiff of this development In March 2015, approximately four months after the suspension had occurred (Mar. 27, 2015 Order). Segal's misconduct is aggravated by plaintiff's incarceration, which made it impossible for plaintiff to oversee Segal's work in any meaningful way. In addition, the delay of approximately three years was not due to any lack of diligence on the part of plaintiff. After learning of Segal's suspension, I gave plaintiff the option of holding the matter in suspense until Segal was reinstated; plaintiff elected to do so (Mar. 27, 2015 Order). When plaintiff was informed by Segal's former associate\n   that Segal had not returned to the practice of law (Wilt Letter), plaintiff attempted to find counsel (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Pro Bono App.). Only after his efforts to find counsel proved fruitless did plaintiff choose to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ; he then filed this motion to further amend his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thus, because plaintiff's failure to submit a Second Amended Complaint and the subsequent delay were caused by extraordinary circumstances, he has established \"good cause\" for purposes of Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). Accordingly, I shall proceed to the merits of plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Addition of Defendant Batignani\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff's proposed Third Amended Complaint seeks to add Batignani as a defendant and asserts state law tort claims and Section 1983 claims against him as a supervisor.

Defendants contend that those claims must fail as a matter of law for the same reasons Judge Carter held that state law tort claims plaintiff sought to assert in his proposed Second Amended Complaint were deficient, namely, plaintiff has failed to serve a notice of claim as required by New York's General Municipal Law (May 2, 2014 Order at 4). Specifically, Judge Carter's May 2, 2014 Order explained that, in order to assert state law claims against individual employees of a municipality,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   a plaintiff must serve notice of a claim against the [individual] to be sued within 90 days of the accrual of the claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Mun.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n    N.Y.

Specifically, plaintiff was convicted of resisting arrest and criminal possession of a weapon; both offenses related to his conduct towards Lobello immediately prior to and during plaintiff's arrest.

However, this lack of clarity with respect to plaintiff's potential sentence exposure does not preclude plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim at this stage; the charges that he was acquitted and convicted of, respectively, were sufficiently distinct such that a jury could reasonably find that part of plaintiff's underlying criminal proceeding terminated in his favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graebe v.
