INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is Defendant Orange County's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 86 [hereinafter, \"Mot.\"].) For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. In April 2014, Plaintiff Shane Miles Wilkey pled guilty to violating California Penal Code section 261.5(c) (felony unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor) and was placed on three years of supervised probation. (Dkt. 66 [Declaration of Frank Harrell, hereinafter \"Harell Decl.\"] Ex. C [Deposition of Plaintiff Shane Wilkey, Volume II, hereinafter \"Wilkey Depo. Vol. II\"] 80:3-13, 94:1-95:1.) Plaintiff was arrested\n   on June 6, 2016, for violating his probation by possessing sexually explicit material. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   109:17-110:20; Dkt. 103 [Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, hereinafter \"SUF\"] 1.) After his arrest, Plaintiff was incarcerated at the Orange County Jail from June 6, 2016, until his release on June 9, 2016. (Dkt. 50 [hereinafter \"TAC\"] \u00b6 11; SUF 1, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon arrival at the Orange County Jail, Plaintiff was evaluated by a health professional as required by Orange County Health Care Agency (\"OCHCA\") protocol. (SUF 6.) During this initial screening process, a registered nurse asked Plaintiff if he had any medical conditions or if he had been taking any medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7.) Plaintiff told the registered nurse he was taking mental health-related medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8.) Based on Plaintiff's answer, the registered nurse referred Plaintiff to the mental health triage for a follow-up mental health evaluation, as required by OCHCA protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9.) Plaintiff claims he had a panic attack during the three hours between his initial health evaluation and his mental health screening. (Wilkey Depo. Vol. II 136:1-137:17.) When a registered nurse in the mental health triage conducted a mental health screening of Plaintiff, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   10), Plaintiff told the nurse he had been prescribed mental health medication, but he did not remember what medications or doses he was taking, (SUF 11; Dkt. 90 [Declaration of Denise Patarello, hereinafter \"Patarello Decl.\"] Ex. A). Pursuant to OCHCA protocol, (SUF 13), the mental health triage nurse prepared an \"Authorization to Use &amp; Disclose Protected Health Information\" (\"PHI\") for dispatch to Plaintiff's pharmacy to discern the type and dosage of medication Plaintiff had been prescribed, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12). OCHCA safety protocol requires jail personnel to verify an inmate's medications with the inmate's health care provider before administering the medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   13.) Plaintiff signed the PHI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14.) The registered nurse informed Plaintiff how to contact mental health staff, should he feel the need to do so, while confirmation was pending. (Patarello Decl. Ex. A.) The mental health triage nurse then faxed the PHI to Plaintiff's pharmacy on June 6, 2016, around 5:45 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   15.) On June 6, 2016, around 8:20 p.m., Plaintiff was again seen by a registered nurse and told the nurse he wanted his mental health medications. (Harrell Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. G.) The nurse again explained that the medical staff was required to verify the identity and dosage of his medications with his pharmacy, and Plaintiff expressed his understanding of this safety protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's pharmacy faxed a copy of Plaintiff's \"Patient Profile\" back to the Orange County Jail on June 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16.) According to the Patient Profile, Plaintiff was prescribed Escitalopram and HydrOXYzine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly after receiving Plaintiff's Patient Profile, a registered nurse placed an order through the jail pharmacy for Escitalopram and HydrOXYzine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   17.) On June 7, 2016, around 1:00 or 2:00 p.m., Plaintiff was given the medication authorized by his pharmacy, specifically \"50 MG\" of \"HydrOXYzine Pamoate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   18-19.) Plaintiff received medication again on June 7, 2016, around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20.) On June 8, 2016, Plaintiff received another dose of medication between 3:00 and 4:25 a.m., (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   21), and around 7:56 p.m., (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   22). Plaintiff was released from jail custody on June 9, 2016, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   23), and was given 10 MG of Escitalopram before his release, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   24). Plaintiff admits that he received medication at all of these times, but argues that \"[i]mmediately necessary medical care [was] denied, threatened, [and] no medication provided ... Plaintiff needed medical attention and medication but was threatened instead ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff had a panic [sic] and was provided no medication.\" (SUF 6, 9-17.) Plaintiff argues these actions amount to a \"failure to accommodate Plaintiff's disabilities ... due to the customs, patterns, and practices, of the County of Orange as carried out by [former] Defendants Steven J. Sentman and Rodney S. Grantham for failing to provide ADA accommodations, including mental health care to Mr. Wilkey's damage.\" (TAC \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time of Plaintiff's June 6, 2016, arrest, Plaintiff claims he was experiencing sporadic \"panic attacks\" for which he was taking prescribed medication. (SUF 5.) Plaintiff identifies one \"panic attack\" \"hospitalization\" on an unidentified date, and alleges he has suffered a three panic attacks in total. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5; Wilkey Depo. Vol. II 209:20-210:9; Harrell Decl. Ex. D.) Plaintiff denies that he suffers from isolated panic attacks, but rather states he has \"regular panic attacks and continuing anxiety, stress and depression issues.\" (SUF 5.) Plaintiff's denial is supported by Plaintiff's Declaration attached to his Opposition. (Dkt. 102-2 [hereinafter \"Wilkey Decl.\"].) Plaintiff states in his declaration that he has a disability, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 9), that he is \"unable to participate in ordinary life functions as a result of [his] disability\" and suffers from anxiety, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7), and that he is \"still on medication for [his] continuing disability [he is] currently taking Escitalopram and Hydroxyzine HCL which cause migraines,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed suit against the County of Orange, Sheriff Hutchens, Chief Probation Officer Steven J. Sentman, and Rodney S. Grantham on June 23, 2016, bringing four causes of action-two pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging various deprivations of substantive due process, and two alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012132\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's operative complaint is his Third Amended Complaint (\"TAC\"). (TAC.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TAC brought two causes of action: one pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the County of Orange, Sheriff Hutchens, and Chief Probation Officer Sentman, and a second claim for violation of the ADA against the County of Orange, Chief Probation Officer Sentman, and Mr. Grantham. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants filed motions to strike and dismiss the TAC on February 9, 2017, (Dkts. 52, 53), and the Court dismissed Plaintiff's first cause of action and the related class action allegations, as well as the second cause of action as to Sentman and Grantham on March 1, 2017, (Dkt. 56 (\"Despite this Court's clear guidance, Plaintiff's TAC is substantially identical to his original Complaint, his FAC, and his SAC.\"). Plaintiff\n   filed an amendment to his Prayer for Relief on March 8, 2017, to indicate his cause of action arises under Title II of the ADA, rather than \"Title III.\" (Dkt. 57.) Plaintiff now brings a single cause of action for an ADA violation against the County of Orange. (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 29-37.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Once Plaintiff reported that he was taking mental health medications, a registered nurse verified his prescribed medications and dosages. The jail staff placed a medication order with the jail pharmacy less than an hour after receiving confirmation of Plaintiff's prescribed medications from his pharmacy.

Moreover, when Plaintiff asked for medication before his pharmacy had verified his medications, the nurse explained the verification protocol and that Plaintiff could contact the jail mental health staff if necessary.
