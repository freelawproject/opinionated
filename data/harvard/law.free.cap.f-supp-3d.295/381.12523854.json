On February 16, 2018, the Court issued an Order, with opinion to follow, that denied Defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction and vacated the amended temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") that was in place. (Doc. 115.) This Memorandum explains the reasons for the Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Can't Stop Productions, Inc. filed this lawsuit against Defendants Sixuvus Ltd. and its members Eric Anzalone, Alexander Briley, Felipe Rose, James F. Newman, Raymond Simpson, and William Whitefield on August 25, 2017, for trademark infringement and a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff is the owner of all rights, title and interest in the \"Village People\" trademarks. (Doc. 1 (\"Compl.\").) On November 30, Defendants answered and asserted counterclaims for (1) tortious\n   interference with a settlement agreement between Defendants and former Village People lead singer, Victor Willis; (2) naked licensing; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of contract implied in fact / promissory estoppel; (5) tortious interference with contractual relations; and (6) tortious interference with prospective contractual relations / prospective economic advantage. (Doc. 32 (\"Answer\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 1, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin Plaintiff \"from taking any action, alone or in concert with others, that would interfere with Sixuvus'[s] ability to perform live as Village People.\" (Doc. 41 at 1.) After reviewing Defendants' moving papers and hearing oral argument from Plaintiff and Defendants, the Court entered a TRO on December 1, 2017, temporarily permitting Defendants to perform as \"Sixuvus Presents The Legendary Village People\" and restraining Plaintiff from directly or indirectly interfering with Defendants' ability to book live performances. (Doc. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 8, 2017, Karen Willis d/b/a Harlem West Entertainment (\"Intervenor\") filed a motion to intervene and to vacate or modify the TRO, contending that Harlem West Entertainment was the exclusive licensee of the Village People marks and that vacating or modifying the TRO was necessary to avoid harm to Intervenor and a likelihood of confusion. (Doc. 110.) After reviewing Intervenor's motion papers and hearing argument from the parties, the Court temporarily allowed Karen Willis-who is Victor Willis's wife-to intervene as a preliminary plaintiff and a preliminary counterclaim defendant, and issued an amended TRO. (Doc. 52.) The amended TRO provided that Intervenor's group would perform as \"Village People* featuring Victor Willis\" and Defendants would perform as \"Village People* featuring _______,\" followed by the name of an individual group member or members of Defendants' choosing, provided that the following disclaimer accompanied any advertising or other use of the name: \"*The trademark 'Village People' is the subject of litigation. There are two groups performing under the name 'Village People.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The amended TRO further provided, among other things, that the parties would not disparage the opposing group or interfere with their ability to perform, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7), and that on consent of the parties the briefing schedules and hearings in connection with Defendant's and Intervenor's motions were stayed pending the parties' participation in mediation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Defendants filed a letter requesting a pre-motion conference to compel Intervenor's immediate compliance with the amended TRO or else hold her in contempt. (Doc. 53.) Intervenor responded on December 15, 2017, (Doc. 57), and a pre-motion conference was held on December 15, 2017, during which the Court declined to impose contempt sanctions but reiterated that strict compliance with the Court's amended TRO was expected, (Minute Entry dated December 15, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 25, 2018, the parties participated in mediation. (Minute Entry dated January 25, 2018.) Because no settlement agreement was reached, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ), a preliminary injunction hearing was held on January 29 through February 1, 2018, and February 6, 2018. On February 12, 2018, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. (Docs. 104-106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court issued an Order dated February 16, 2018, denying Defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction and vacating the amended TRO. (Doc. 115.)

(Hearing Transcript (\"Tr.\") 35:16-21; 63:17-21; 518:7-13; 519:1-4, 20-22.) Victor Willis, the original police officer character, was the lead singer and co-wrote a number of the group's hits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   84:3-6;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   238:24-239:7) He left the group in 1979 and was replaced by Ray Simpson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   272:7-11.) The other original members were Felipe Rose, Alexander Briley, Randy Jones, David Hodo, and Glenn Hughes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   342:25-343:5.) Village People as a performing group acquired a worldwide reputation by 1979, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit (\"P's Ex.\") 43), but in 1985, as the popularity of\n   disco music waned, Plaintiff decided to cease touring operations under the Village People marks, (Tr. 272:20-273:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1987, Jones sought to re-assemble the group and formed Sixuvus Ltd., the entity through which the members from then on would conduct business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   273:5-19, 274:18-21, 556:10-16.) At that time the members of Sixuvus included Jones, Rose, Briley, Hodo, Hughes, and Simpson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   342:10-343:2.) By letter dated January 15, 1987, David Fishof Productions Inc. (\"Fishof\"), which Sixuvus utilized for booking and management services, made a proposal to Belolo to grant Sixuvus a license to use the Village People marks in exchange for five percent of the group's gross for touring, and Plaintiff agreed. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   565:3-9; P's Ex. 37 at 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By May 1989, Plaintiff wanted to end the contract with Fishof because Fishof had not satisfied the minimum royalty obligations under the agreement. (P's Ex. 37 at 3.) On January 9, 1990, Felipe Rose sent a letter to Belolo to inform him that Sixuvus was changing management services and to request that the license agreement with Fishof be transferred to Sixuvus and put in writing on the same terms as the Fishof agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) According to Rose's letter, since April 1, 1989, Plaintiff and Defendants had been operating under \"a verbal Gentleman's Agreement\" allowing Defendants to use the Village People marks under the terms of the Fishof agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Belolo responded that Rose should contact Plaintiff's attorney, Stephen Kopitko, to execute the agreement, and asked Kopitko to prepare a license for touring in exchange for a five percent royalty fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) Rose did not directly negotiate with Plaintiff, and believes Randy Jones negotiated the agreement (presumably because it was Jones who explained the events to him). (Tr. 558:5-13.) In any event, no agreement was ever codified and signed by the parties, but Plaintiff and Defendants agreed orally that Defendants could use the mark \"Village People\" for live performances in exchange for five percent of the gross receipts after expenses such as air travel were deducted. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   64:6-23, 173:20-174:3, 501:6-11, 557:2-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties dispute the duration of the oral license granted to Sixuvus. Defendants contend that the license was of infinite duration or for as long as Defendants sought to perform, while Plaintiff asserts that the license was for as long as Plaintiff agreed to the license. Although the Court does not doubt that Defendants genuinely believe that the license was for as long as Defendants wanted to perform, they have not established that this was the agreement into which the parties entered. Various Defendants testified that they believed that the license was of infinite duration based on conversations they had with other Sixuvus members, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   275:21-25, 433:14-17, 501:6-14, 558:14-19), but none of those witnesses were involved in reaching the agreement or negotiating its terms, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   273:20-274:1, 378:18-25, 502:2-17, 558:5-19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, no witness who was directly privy to the negotiations was called by either side to testify at the hearing to explain the terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nevertheless, other evidence offered at the hearing supports a finding that the license was for a limited duration and subject\n   to Plaintiff's continued approval. For example, on January 12, 1990, Belolo sent a fax to Plaintiff's attorney Kopitko to request that he contact Rose to draft an agreement \"for a first period of 18 months (will see for extension after).\" (P's Ex. 37 at 6.) Then, in April and May of 1990, Defendants' new manager, Mitchell Weiss, corresponded with Kopitko to request changes to the agreement. (P's Ex. 39.) On May 10, 1990, Weiss acknowledged in a fax that the licensing \"agreement [was] restricted to one year\" and expressed that within the year \"we will all know if [Sixuvus] can make a success of themselves, and then hopefully Henri will proudly choose to extend the option.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) And on April 3, 2003, Kopitko sent Sixuvus and its members a letter containing a series of requirements with which Sixuvus needed to comply to continue utilizing the marks, (P's Ex. 5 at 1-2), further demonstrating that the license was more limited than Defendants contend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, in a September 7, 2007 e-mail addressed to Weiss and the members of Sixuvus, in response to Sixuvus's expressed concern regarding Plaintiff's assertion of an ownership interest in a Village People website and domain name that Sixuvus had created, Belolo stated, \"It seems to be that NOTHING in the past relationship between Felipe [Rose], David [Hodo], Alex[ Briley,] Jeff [Olson\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] and Ray [Simpson] and Can't Stop should cause any worries in the future as long as the group wants to tour and\n   <em>\n    Can't Stop agrees to it\n   </em>\n   .\" (Intervenor's Exhibit (\"I's Ex.\") 4 at 2 (second emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   I's Ex. 2 at 2.) Weiss's response expressed no surprise that the license was subject to Plaintiff's continued approval, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   I's Ex. 4 at 1), nor did Defendants offer any evidence that there was any subsequent discussion that would suggest that Plaintiff's approval of Defendants' license was a new requirement. And, finally, it would be, at the very least, an unusual business choice for the trademark holder to put the power to control the trademark in the hands of the licensee. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that their license to use the Village People marks in connection with live performances was for an unlimited duration and terminable only if Defendants elected to cease performing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the negotiations with Plaintiff in 1990, Sixuvus went on to exclusively utilize the Village People mark in connection with live music performances for approximately thirty years, with an average of fifty live performances per year, and in exchange paid Plaintiff five percent of their gross receipts. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 277:2-6, 302:17-303:2, 393:7-14, 560:24-561:1.) Defendants' performances were generally consistent with the original Village People performances, including their use of original \"Y.M.C.A.\" choreography and other routines, albeit with minor adjustments based on, for example, the size and orientation of the stage at a given venue or the performers' aging. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   42:20-25, 49:3-9, 345:12-21, 402:21-403:5, 474:1-18, 516:13-23, 571:6-11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the performers independently made some tweaks to their costumes, and added or subtracted songs from their set lists, the characters and vibe never changed. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   240:2-5, 333:3-9, 367:3-9, 375:4-10, 403:6-11, 569:4-13.) As Belolo's son, Jonathan Belolo, testified, Defendants \"knew exactly what it was that made Village People successful and\n   what the fans and the public wanted, so they never strayed very far away\" from the original Village People concept. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   42:22-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While three of the members performed since the inception of Sixuvus-specifically, Simpson, the police officer; Rose, the Native American; and Briley, the soldier/military officer-the remaining characters (namely the leatherman, construction worker, and cowboy) were played by various individuals over the years. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   270:25-271:6, 371:12-17, 386:21-387:18, 493:5-12, 524:6-18, 550:18-552:12.) Plaintiff required that Sixuvus seek Plaintiff's approval of its current and future members and temporary substitutes by furnishing their biographical information, headshots, and lists of their prior entertainment experience, (P's Ex. 5 at 2), but that information was not always promptly sought. Whitefield, for example, began performing with Sixuvus in the fall of 2001, (Tr. 524:16-18), but his photo and resume were not sent to Plaintiff until July 18, 2003, (P's Ex. 5 at 7). Plaintiff further required that Sixuvus's new performers sign agreements confirming that Plaintiff owned the Village People marks, that Plaintiff could assign the agreement or cause Sixuvus's members to be removed, and that Sixuvus's members had no rights to the marks except for their right to perform-agreements similar to those signed by the original members of Village People. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P's Exs. 21-26, 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P's Ex. 5 at 2.) The contracts, too, were not always promptly sought, but in those instances they were eventually required. For example, Defendants William Whitefield and Eric Anzalone performed for a few years before signing an agreement with Plaintiff, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 220:2-20, 524:16-528:18; P's Ex. 22), while Defendant James Newman signed an agreement shortly after joining Sixuvus, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 371:12-24; P's Ex. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During the license period, Belolo, his son, and Plaintiff's other employees and licensees reviewed Sixuvus's performances to ensure their quality. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 641:1-642:11.) This review entailed watching videos posted by Defendants and fans online, monitoring websites with Village People content, and periodically attending live performances and meeting with Defendants in France and New York. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   42:5-8, 632:13-19, 641:1-642:11; P's Ex. 57.) Plaintiff had agents in twenty countries and used them to monitor the use of the trademarks in their territories, which sometimes entailed viewing live performances to ensure that the quality of the trademarks was maintained. (Tr. 36:3-37:16.) Plaintiff also employed its attorney, Kopitko, to address occasions when Defendants attempted to exceed the scope of the license or failed to properly denote the trademark in their press kit and on their website.

Some of Defendants' witnesses testified that communications between Sixuvus and Plaintiff were sparse and did not concern Sixuvus's live performances. (Tr. 287:7-24; 584:14-586:5, 587:7-18). The evidence, however, reveals that Defendants heeded Plaintiff's request: their managers, Weiss and Deborah Crawford, provided itineraries and updates regarding the group's performances, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , P's Exs. 12, 16, 19, 34, 35, 36, 53 at 2, 54; Tr. 134:7-23), albeit not always on a monthly basis, (Tr. 173:5-13 (sometimes monthly, sometimes only two to four times per year) ). Evidently Defendants' managers did not relay to the group or its employees that these communications were transpiring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   476:16-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Belolo frequently responded to such updates with instructions and suggestions. On July 16, 2008, for example, Belolo expressed that he \"was not 100% happy by the way [Defendants] were treated [in France] last time\" and reminded Weiss \"to ask the promoters to contact [him] in order to discuss ... the artistic details\" so he could \"make sure that this time everything is 100% perfect.\" (P's Ex. 54.) He further requested that Weiss provide a song list and indicated that his studios would upgrade the mixing of backing tracks so that Defendants would have the \"[b]est possible sound.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 123:21-124:22.) Likewise, in response to a January 16, 2009 e-mail with Defendants' upcoming schedule, Belolo stated that he was \"surprised\" about some of the schedule and stated, \"[P]lease note that nothing can be 'decided' without me being informed and consulted in advance, and it is subject to my prior checking and approval,\" and that he wanted Defendants \"to FIRST consult with [him] before [S]ixuvus g[a]ve its ok for any of the projected dates\" so he could \"make sure that everything is rightfully done for the ... tour.\" (P's Ex. 16 (emphasis in original).) He suggested that Defendants tell promoters, \" 'please talk to Henri [b]efore we can accept anything,' \" requested copies of all contracts, and stated that he and Sixuvus would decide \"how many, and w[h]ich songs, will be performed during the tour and make sure to finali[z]e the mix/sound of the tracks of each songs to be perform\" to avoid \"the problems we had in the last tour,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), which problems apparently arose from Sixuvus making decisions without Plaintiff's approval, (Tr. 129:8-130:9). Additionally, in May of 2009, Belolo informed Weiss that his son Jonathan was revising the music tracks for \"YMCA,\" \"Macho Man,\" and \"In the Navy\" for Defendants' upcoming France Tour, (P's Ex. 12), as Plaintiff had done before for other songs, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , I's Exs. 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff, however, was not involved in many aspects of Defendants' live performances. Defendants hired their own agents and booked their own shows without obtaining Plaintiff's permission or instructions regarding where, or where not, to perform. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 63:22-64:5, 132:4-16, 286:11-14, 303:20-23, 304:9-17, 416:4-10, 504:17-20.) They designed their own costumes, while staying true to the six Village People characters, and made adjustments to some of the choreography. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   132:10-16, 327:14-17, 345:3-21, 410:10-20, 411:6-14, 413:4-414:21, 504:7-15, 569:4-9.) Although Defendants did not need Plaintiff's approval for costumes and dance routines, Plaintiff nevertheless kept an eye on these aspects of Defendants' performances and would have informed Defendants if changes needed to be made, but such instructions were not necessary because Plaintiff was pleased with Defendants' performances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   47:11-21, 49:13-14.) Defendants further held auditions, trained new members, and rehearsed for upcoming performances without Plaintiff's involvement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   371:18-372:10, 388:2-14, 389:25-390:2, 524:16-525:7, 528:2-15.) Indeed, some of the new members of Sixuvus never met with Plaintiff or its representatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   376:6-8, 436:23-437:4, 533:25-534:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beginning in at least 2010, Intervenor's husband Victor Willis initiated a series of lawsuits against Plaintiff and Defendants concerning, among other things, Willis's rights in Village People songs and Plaintiff's rights in the trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   26:11-13, 27:12-24, 28:11-29:13, 31:16-32:19; Defendants' Ex. (\"Ds' Ex.\") X.) For at least one such lawsuit that was ongoing in 2010 and 2011, Plaintiff paid over $100,000 toward Defendants' legal fees, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P's Ex. 59), and Plaintiff's counsel met with Defendants regarding their litigation strategy, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P's Ex. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the spring of 2017, as part of a settlement agreement in another lawsuit initiated by Willis against Plaintiff, Plaintiff granted Intervenor a ten-year, written and exclusive license to use the Village People marks for live performances effective June 1, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ds' Ex. B; Tr. 29:8-33:11.) By e-mail dated May 30, 2017, Jonathan Belolo notified Defendants that Plaintiff had terminated their license to use the Village People marks in live performances and that such termination was effective June 1, 2017. (Ds' Ex. A.) At that time, Plaintiff offered Defendants the ability to perform as Village People for their existing contractual commitments through December 1, 2017, and Defendants continued performing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Tr. 72:22-73:5;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   317:2-7.)

Undisputed testimony shows that Plaintiff and its agents monitored Defendants' performances by attending live shows; reviewing media content on the Internet; and requiring that new members sign contracts and that Defendants periodically provide itineraries and set lists for upcoming performances. Plaintiff remixed the backing tracks used in Defendants' performances to promote the sound quality of their shows and made other efforts to ensure that Defendants were well-received during their tours. Although some of Sixuvus's members testified that they did not interact with Plaintiff and, to their knowledge, Defendants' communications with Plaintiff were non-existent or sparse, their testimony is at odds with documentary and other evidence presented during the hearing that makes clear that such communications did occur and that they were principally between Plaintiff and Defendants' managers, who were not called to testify and evidently did not relay the extent of the communications to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The evidence further demonstrates that Defendants' performances as Village People were consistent with the original Village People performances and did not change in a significant manner during the license period, adhering to the artistic vision of its founders Belolo and Morali and the essentials of the showmanship that originally made Village People so popular. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 343:6-10; 571:6-11.) Although Defendants modestly modified their costumes and choreography over the years, they retained the six Village People characters and dance numbers, and, by all accounts, never strayed far from the manner in which Plaintiff wanted the marks to be utilized. Indeed, the evidence presented demonstrates that Defendants had a history of satisfactory performances for decades, with no risk of public deception.

First, citing the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart's Food Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants assert that conclusory statements regarding \"regular\" inspections of, or \"many\" opportunities to observe, a licensee are insufficient to demonstrate the level of supervision and control necessary to comply with the Lanham Act.

But in so doing they rely on Judge Lumbard's partial dissent from the Court's opinion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and so, presumably, the Court's majority found the evidence at issue sufficient to defeat a naked-licensing challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawn Donut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1974734\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/267/358/#p362\">\n    267 F.2d at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (majority \"conclude[s] that the district court's finding that the plaintiff exercised the degree of control over the nature and quality of the products sold by its licensees required by the Act was not clearly erroneous\"). In any event, the evidence of Plaintiff's familiarity with Defendants' performances; the measures taken by Belolo, his son Jonathan, and Plaintiff's other employees and agents to monitor Defendants' performances; and Plaintiff's awareness of Defendants' dedication to maintaining the Village People concept as originally envisioned by Village People's founders and embraced by its fans, suffices to show that Defendants have not met their burden of establishing that they are likely to succeed in demonstrating insufficient control or a sufficiently serious question on that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawn Donut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1974734\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/267/358/#p362\">\n    267 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   360-61 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barcamerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434867\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/589/#p598\">\n    289 F.3d at 596-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (naked licensing found because no evidence licensor was familiar with or relied upon licensee's efforts to control quality and licensor gave only conclusory statements about existence of quality controls).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, Defendants assert that, notwithstanding Plaintiff's undisputed policing of the use of the Village People marks in other areas such as merchandising and recordings, the sixteen-year period from 1987 to 2003 where Defendants allege Plaintiff engaged in virtually no communications with Defendants regarding live performances is alone sufficient to warrant a conclusion that Plaintiff engaged in naked licensing, and that the Court can separate live performances from the rest of Plaintiff's rights in the mark to conclude that Plaintiff has forfeited its rights in the live performance area. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ds' COL \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 55-61.) Defendants are correct that some courts have held that long periods of inadequately controlled licensing may estop a licensor from challenging a licensee's use of the mark or function as an abandonment of the license that divests the licensor of its ownership of the mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheila's Shine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"222877\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/486/114/#p124\">\n    486 F.2d at 123-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (licensor that did not communicate with or attempt to supervise licensee for eleven years was estopped from challenging licensee's use of the mark in trade area where licensee operated);\n   <em>\n    Yocum v.

It is no surprise that there is more electronic evidence of communications occurring post-2000 than pre-2000. That Kopitko's April 3, 2003 letter to Sixuvus indicated that a series of requirements necessary to maintain the license was \"[e]ffective immediately,\" (P's Ex. 5 at 1-2), does not establish that there were no controls or monitoring in place before that date, only that the controls in place were not as formal or stringent, or had faded somewhat with time, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (Belolo acknowledging that he had \"not been involved as much as [he] should have\" because \"after a period of time a certain comfort level sets in\" but noting his obligation on behalf of Plaintiff to maintain integrity of mark) ).

Further, even assuming there was no control by Plaintiff for a long period, Defendants have provided no authority for the proposition that a lengthy period of inadequate policing, followed by an equally lengthy period of adequate policing, permits a court to infer abandonment, and the Court does not see how such evidence logically could support such an inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Defendants are estopped from challenging Plaintiff's ownership of the Village People marks, and even if they could assert a naked-licensing challenge, they have not demonstrated that Plaintiff inadequately controlled Defendants' use of the marks under the licensing agreement.

Accordingly, they must show that Plaintiff terminated the license agreement after a license period that was unreasonably short or upon unreasonably short notice. Defendants do not assert (with good reason) that a nearly thirty-year license period is too short, but they do contend that the notice period concerning the termination of the license was unreasonable. In so arguing, Defendants focus almost exclusively on the alleged one-day notice on May 30, 2017, that the license would terminate June 1, 2017. (Doc. 41 at 17; Ds' COL \u00b6 93.) But Plaintiff gave Defendants an additional six months to fulfill their existing contractual obligations to perform through December 1, 2017, and Defendants' notice period was effectively extended an additional two-and-a-half months through court action in light of the Court's entry of a TRO and amended TRO that enabled Defendants to continue utilizing the marks. Defendants have made no effort to demonstrate that this notice period was unreasonable, and the Court finds no basis to conclude that it was. For example, they did not adduce evidence showing that they incurred expenses that a longer notice period would have avoided,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chenoweth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988%20WL%2052777\">\n    1988 WL 52777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, or that a longer notice period is more customary in the industry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creative Foods Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=458%20N.Y.S.2d%20917\">\n    458 N.Y.S.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants assert two claims for tortious interference of existing contractual relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's grant of an exclusive license to Intervenor interfered with a settlement agreement in a prior lawsuit between Sixuvus and Victor Willis that included an injunction prohibiting Willis, his \"associates, agents, suppliers, servants, employees, officers, directors, representatives, successors, assigns, and attorneys, and any other person(s) acting in concert or participation with Victor Willis, [from] ... engaging, committing, or performing, directly or indirectly, any and all of the following acts:\n   <strong>\n    Disrupting any live performance or public appearance of Sixuvus performing as the Village People.\n   </strong>\n   \" (Doc. 45 Ex. 3 at 2 (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ds' Ex. X at 64:4-16; Answer at 15-19.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff's actions induced Intervenor to disrupt Sixuvus's performances by contacting venues to inform them that she, not Sixuvus, possessed an exclusive license to perform as Village People. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 105 \u00b6\u00b6 140-45.) Defendants have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation, because they have not established an actual breach of their contract with Willis or Plaintiff's intentional inducement of such a breach. The plain language of the injunction-prohibiting Willis from disrupting Defendants' live performances and public appearances, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 45 Ex. 3 at 2)-refers to his showing up at Defendants' shows and causing problems (which apparently had happened, (Tr. 298:1-299:20) ). Had the parties agreed that Willis would never do anything to prevent Defendants from performing as Village People, they would have used much broader language to that effect. The conduct here-giving Intervenor the license to perform live as Village People going forward-does not strike the Court as the type of conduct that would constitute a violation of the settlement agreement. Defendants have not shown that the settlement agreement was designed to preclude contacting venues or promoters concerning licensing issues, or that it would preclude Plaintiff from terminating Defendants' license and granting one to Willis or Intervenor. Accordingly, Defendants have not shown that they are likely to prevail on their claim for tortious interference with the settlement agreement or that there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, Defendants assert that Plaintiff's termination of Defendants' license on one day's notice and Plaintiff's grant of an exclusive license to Intervenor caused third parties to breach their agreements with Sixuvus. (Answer at 25-27.) Although Simpson testified that at least one show in Mexico was canceled during the six-month period following the notice of termination of the license, and that he believed that it was canceled because Intervenor had contacted the venue, he could\n   not provide a basis for this belief and, accordingly, the Court excluded his testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 318:14-320:9.) Defendants further failed to present evidence that Plaintiff intentionally caused the Mexico promoter or any other third party to breach a contract. Instead, the record reveals that Defendants had performances scheduled until November, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   317:2-7), and Plaintiff expressly permitted Defendants to honor their existing obligations, (Ds' Ex. A). Defendants have therefore failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits, or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation, on their claim for tortious interference with contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED, and the previously entered TRO is vacated. Intervenor's original and amended motions to introduce newly discovered evidence, (Docs. 109, 112), are DENIED as moot. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the pending motions.
