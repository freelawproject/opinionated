First, in September 2016, Congress enacted the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\"JASTA\"), Pub. L. No. 114-222,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Stat.%20852\">\n    130 Stat. 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B ), which Plaintiffs claim was intended to allow victims of the 9/11 Attacks to hold accountable parties that provided assistance to al Qaeda \"wherever acting and wherever they may be found.\" (Opp'n at 7 (quoting JASTA \u00a7 2(b), 130 Stat. at 853).) Second, as part of this multidistrict litigation, Plaintiffs' counsel took the deposition\n   of Zacarias Moussaoui, a federal prisoner and former al Qaeda operative, and the self-described \"20th hijacker,\" who is serving six life sentences for his role in the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moussaoui Dep. Tr., Aff. of Sean P. Carter dated February 3, 2015, Ex. 5, ECF No. 2927-5.) According to Plaintiffs, Moussaoui's testimony establishes new facts showing that the Moving Defendants aided Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda by providing funds and other forms of material support in furtherance of the 9/11 Attacks. (Opp'n at 16, 23-25, 28.) This Court heard oral argument on the Moving Defendants' motions to dismiss on January 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For substantially the same reasons this Court previously dismissed Defendants NCB and SBG from this multidistrict litigation for insufficient contacts with the United States, the Moving Defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) are GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTIONAL FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Bank Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant NCB is a Saudi-based financial institution with its principal place of business located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. (FAC \u00b6 68.) Nonetheless, it maintains operations around the world and offers a broad range of financial services, including Sharia-compliant financial products and services, to institutional and individual clients alike. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that NCB provided funds and financial services to charities that operated as fundraising front organizations for al Qaeda, including the International Islamic Relief Organization (\"IIRO\") and the Saudi Joint Relief Committee for Kosovo and Chechnya (\"SJRC\"). Plaintiffs also allege that NCB was one of al Qaeda's preferred banks and that it frequently funneled contributions from wealthy Saudi businessmen to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 201-02, 204, 214-15, 235-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Khalid bin Mahfouz, NCB's president and chief executive officer, founded the Muwafaq Foundation (\"Muwafaq\") in 1991 and provided up to $30 million for its operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 194, 206-07.) Plaintiffs allege further that during the 1990s, Muwafaq provided resources to al Qaeda to support its jihad against the United States by, for example, laundering contributions from wealthy sympathizers and funding terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Bosnia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 210.) According to Plaintiffs, NCB also provided financial services \"and other support\" to Muwafaq, which merged with al Qaeda in 2001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 210, 212.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant ARB is also a Saudi-based financial institution that offers Sharia-compliant banking and investment products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153.) Plaintiffs allege that in the\n   years leading up to the 9/11 Attacks, ARB, as well as members of the Al Rajhi family, provided funds and financial services to numerous charitable organizations that operated as fronts for al Qaeda, including IIRO and the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation (\"AHIF\"), among others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 173-74, 183.) For instance, Plaintiffs allege that ARB maintained at least twenty-four bank accounts and handled \"unusual\" transactions for AHIF, which operated as a front for al Qaeda in thirteen different countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158.) According to a July 2007 press account, a top AHIF official deposited $130,000 into an ARB account in Saudi Arabia in 2000, which was then sent to al Qaeda fighters in Chechnya. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That same article also describes the Al Rajhi family's longstanding support of Islamic charities suspected of funding terrorism, including by allegedly trying to \"conceal and disguise unusual transfers\" through such entities to evade government authorities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 159-61.) According to Plaintiffs, ARB and members of the Al Rajhi family knew that the charities were acting as fronts for al Qaeda because members of the family held leadership positions with several of those organizations and were thus privy to their terrorism connections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 174, 180-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs allege further that al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations ordered their operatives in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Yemen to use ARB to fund and facilitate terrorist attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-63.) Consistent with those directives, Plaintiffs claim that multiple instances have been discovered where bank accounts at ARB were used to fund terrorist attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163.) For example, Plaintiffs claim that funds were funneled through ARB to members of an al Qaeda cell in Hamburg, Germany. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the members of that cell was 9/11 hijacker Abdulaziz al Omari, who received funds in his ARB account as late as September 7, 2001-just four days before the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also allege that Omari utilized a credit card issued by ARB when he was planning the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to providing al Qaeda and its operatives with financial services, Plaintiffs allege that ARB provided al Qaeda with other forms of operational support. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165.) For instance, Plaintiffs claim that ARB's couriers delivered money to an al Qaeda affiliate in Indonesia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs, ARB also sponsored a travel visa for a money courier who worked for Ayman al Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's second-in-command. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166.) Plaintiffs allege that this type of support and the nature of the services ARB generally provided to al Qaeda played a critical role in enabling it to carry out the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195.) Indeed, Plaintiffs describe ARB as \"one of al Qaeda's most essential and critical partners in the years preceding\" the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6155.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Saudi Binladin Group\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant SBG is a Saudi-based construction company founded by Osama bin Laden's father and still controlled by the bin Laden family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Plaintiffs allege that SBG is an \"integral part\" of the al Qaeda network and that the assistance it provided to the terrorist organization during its early years was essential in allowing al Qaeda to carry out the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 246.) In particular, Plaintiffs allege that before SBG removed Osama bin Laden as a shareholder in 1993, it provided significant financial support to him while he was establishing a haven for al Qaeda in Sudan, with knowledge that, at the time, he was targeting the United\n   States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142-46, 250-78.) According to Plaintiffs, SBG's controlling shareholders-the bin Laden family-had \"intimate knowledge of al Qaeda's objectives\" and provided \"extensive support to al Qaeda with the intent of furthering its objectives [of] harming the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   279.) For instance, Plaintiffs allege, one of SBG's corporate subsidiaries sponsored a visa application to the United States for Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, whom they describe as one of al Qaeda's founding members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1280.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that even after SBG removed Osama bin Laden as a shareholder in 1993, it maintained a \"financial lifeline\" to him throughout the period leading up to the 9/11 Attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 283-84). For example, Plaintiffs allege that despite being ousted from SBG in 1993, the value of Osama bin Laden's shares were not placed in a trust until April 2000, and even then, not all of the funds were deposited, suggesting that funds continued to flow from SBG to Osama bin Laden after he was removed as a shareholder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 290-95.) According to Plaintiffs, some of those funds still \"remain[ ] unaccounted for.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 295.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C.\n   <strong>\n    Zacarias Moussaoui Deposition Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At a deposition conducted by Plaintiffs' counsel, former al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui offered testimony concerning all three Moving Defendants. According to Plaintiffs, Moussaoui was handpicked by Osama bin Laden to build an electronic database recording the identities of al Qaeda's financial donors, their contributions to the organization, and the sources of those funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 202.) Moussaoui testified at his deposition that, in that capacity, he \"personally reviewed and documented financial transactions benefiting al Qaeda involving NCB.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 202.) Moussaoui also testified that Osama bin Laden described ARB to him as a \"good brother\" who \"mov[ed] money around\" for al Qaeda. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167.) According to Moussaoui, Osama bin Laden also told him that ARB was one of the primary financial supporters of charities that operated as fronts for al Qaeda's fundraising activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for SBG, Moussaoui testified that even after Osama bin Laden was formally removed as a shareholder, he continued to maintain strong ties to his family and that he enjoyed the support of his family and SBG long after he relocated from Sudan to Afghanistan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 305.) Moussaoui further testified that between 1998 and 2000, when Osama bin Laden was in Afghanistan, he regularly received visits from his family members in Saudi Arabia, including his mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, Moussaoui called SBG's claims throughout this multidistrict litigation that the bin Laden family and the SBG cut ties with Osama bin Laden in 1994 a \"complete ... and absolute lie.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   307.) Plaintiffs also allege that SBG assisted al Qaeda in building the terrorist training camps where the hijackers responsible for the 9/11 Attacks were trained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 306.) This allegation is ostensibly based on Moussaoui's testimony that in the late 1990s, SBG \"covertly\" shipped construction parts from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan, where they were received by al Qaeda members and later transported to Afghanistan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff has the burden of making a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction over the defendant exists.\n   <em>\n    Licci ex rel.

In addition, the Second Circuit expressly rejected the argument that SBG's \"distributions to Osama [b]in Laden as a shareholder\" and its support for him through \"government infrastructure contracts that SBG had in the Sudan\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s were \"expressly aimed at the United States or ... connected in any meaningful\n   way, for the purpose of establishing personal jurisdiction, to the September 11, 2001 attacks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864585\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/659/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864585\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/659/\">\n    at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted). For the same reasons this Court and the Second Circuit previously rejected Plaintiffs' allegations about SBG's pre-1993 support of Osama bin Laden, they are again rejected here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In support of their argument for specific jurisdiction, Plaintiffs point to two new sets of allegations, neither of which is sufficient. The first concerns documents recovered from the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 299.) Among the documents recovered is what Plaintiffs describe as a \"will\" allegedly executed by Osama bin Laden in the late 1990s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs, the document, which has not been reproduced here, indicates that at the time it was executed, Osama bin Laden had approximately $29 million in Sudan, of which $12 million came from SBG for Sudanese investments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The document purports to direct that those funds be returned to the bin Laden family with wishes that the funds be used to pursue jihad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 300.) Plaintiffs argue that this newly recovered document suggests that \"SBG established a continuing funding mechanism for al Qaeda, the benefits of which redounded to al Qaeda until at least into the late 1990's, and that Osama bin Laden understood that his family, including the head of SBG itself, remained entirely supportive of his jihadist agenda.\" (Opp'n at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   These allegations fail for a number of reasons. First, as noted, allegations that SBG disbursed funds to Osama bin Laden when he was in Sudan in the 1980s and 1990s are inadequate to support specific jurisdiction for claims arising out of the 9/11 Attacks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks VII,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864585\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/659/\">\n    714 F.3d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, even if Plaintiffs' allegations as to the putative Osama bin Laden will are true, they at most reflect\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   intent as to how any inherited funds should be used, not what his family members-assuming they were even involved with SBG-actually did with those funds. Nor do these allegations, by themselves, suggest one way or another whether Osama bin Laden's family was supportive of his activities. Third, these allegations still do not support the inference that SBG \"expressly aimed\" its conduct at residents of the United States.\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks VI,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221993\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/840/776/#p780\">\n    840 F.Supp.2d at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, it is insufficient to allege that SBG should have foreseen harm occurring in the United States, or even that SBG provided indirect funding to an organization openly hostile to the United States. Rather, Plaintiffs must show that the \"necessary relationship\" between SBG and this forum arises out of contacts that SBG\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   creates.\n   <em>\n    Walden,\n   </em>\n   134 S.Ct. at 1122. In this regard, Plaintiffs' allegations about Osama bin Laden's ties to his family, as allegedly reflected in the putative \"will,\" fall short.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The second set of new allegations relate to Moussaoui's deposition testimony about SBG. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 305-06.) These allegations, however, also fail to establish personal jurisdiction over SBG. First, for the reasons already stated, vague allegations about Osama bin Laden's contacts with his family members do not support an inference that\n   <em>\n    SBG\n   </em>\n   created sufficient contacts\n   with the forum by expressly aiming its conduct at residents of the United States. Plaintiffs do not even allege that the family members Osama bin Laden remained in contact with after his exile from Saudi Arabia had any connection to SBG or, for that matter, the 9/11 Attacks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    \" Terrorist Attacks Discovery Order\"\n   </em>\n   ), No. 03-MDL-1570 (GBD) (FM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%208183819\">\n    2008 WL 8183819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2008) (Maas, Mag. J.) (denying Plaintiffs' requests for discovery as to SBG based on family members' visits to Osama bin Laden since \"such trips do not ... show that SBG materially supported [his] terrorist activities\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, the FAC considerably mischaracterizes Moussaoui's testimony as to SBG's alleged provision of construction materials for the building of terrorist training camps. At his deposition, Moussaoui was asked by Plaintiffs' counsel whether he had received information indicating that Osama bin Laden's family \"in general\" sent money to him, to which he responded, in relevant part, \"when we wanted to buy spare part of-okay, the-the spare part were bought by the Saudi bin Laden group [sic], and was sending to-to Jeddah, and, then, after to Karachi.\" (Moussaoui Dep. Tr. at 21:4-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, contrary to the FAC's allegations, Moussaoui did not testify that SBG sent construction parts to al Qaeda to build\n   <em>\n    terrorist training camps,\n   </em>\n   nor does his testimony even suggest that the transfers were done surreptitiously. But even if that were his testimony, it would still not be enough to establish jurisdiction over SBG absent allegations that SBG\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   engaged in intentional tortious conduct expressly aimed at the United States.\n   <em>\n    Waldman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354952\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/317/#p331\">\n    835 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   337 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks VII,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864585\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/659/\">\n    714 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e decline to say that the provision of ... services to an entity that carries out a terrorist attack on United States citizens could make a defendant, in the circumstances presented here, subject to the jurisdiction of American courts.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant SBG's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO JURISDICTIONAL DISCOVERY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs seek limited jurisdictional discovery to allow them to \"develop evidence\" necessary to establish personal jurisdiction over the Moving Defendants.

As noted, Plaintiffs have already had several years of jurisdictional discovery as to NCB and SBG monitored under the close supervision of Magistrate Judge Maas. Their efforts thus far have failed to uncover facts sufficient to demonstrate a prima facie case for jurisdiction and Plaintiffs have failed to articulate a reasonable basis for believing it would be any different this time. Although Plaintiffs have not yet had jurisdictional discovery with respect to ARB, none is warranted, much less \"necessary,\" since, for the reasons explained, the underlying legal theories upon which Plaintiffs seek to premise jurisdiction over ARB are untenable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrorist Attacks IV,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080677\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/718/456/#p478\">\n    718 F.Supp.2d at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs further allege that between 1993 and 2000, Ghaleb bin Laden invested substantial sums of money in Bank al Taqwa (\"BAT\"), which was designated by the United States Treasury Department as a terrorist entity after the 9/11 Attacks for its support of al Qaeda in the 1980s.
