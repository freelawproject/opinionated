Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the allegations of the Complaint (Doc. 1-1 at 8-30) in this purported class action, which are accepted in pertinent part as true for purposes of resolving this motion, MSPAC is the assignee of Florida Healthcare Plus, Inc. (\"FHPI\"), a Medicare Advantage Organization (\"MAO\"). In May of 2013, one of FHPI's enrollees-whose name is being kept confidential-received medical items and services at the hospital operated by Halifax. (Complaint at 17-18). Halifax billed and received payment for those items and services from both FHPI and from 21st Century Preferred Insurance Company (\"21st Century\"), which was primarily liable. (Complaint at 18). 21st Century, which was the enrollee's no-fault PIP insurer, paid $10,000 to Halifax on November 6, 2013. (Complaint at 18). FHPI paid the full amount of its enrollee's charges-$31,722.23-to Halifax on December 16, 2013, rather than the $21,722.23 remaining after 21st Century's payment. (Complaint at 18). On May 12, 2014, Halifax sent a reimbursement check to MSPAC for $9,750.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Complaint at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2017, MSPAC filed this suit in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida. (Doc. 1 at 1). On February 23, 2017, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. (Doc. 1). On October 16, 2017, pursuant to Halifax's motion, the case was transferred to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Count I of the Complaint, MSPAC asserts a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A), the Medicare Secondary Payer (\"MSP\") Act's private cause of action, alleging that Halifax violated the Act by failing to reimburse it within 60 days of FHPI's payment. (Complaint at 26). MSPAC seeks to recover double the amount that it was entitled to receive in reimbursement-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $20,000-subject to a setoff for the $9,750 eventually paid by Halifax. (Complaint at 27). Based on these same allegations, MSPAC also asserts a claim under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.201\">\n    Fla.

In 1980, in an effort to curb the rising costs of Medicare, Congress enacted the MSP Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b), which made other insurers covering the same treatment the primary payers and Medicare the secondary payer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350400\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1229/#p1234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To accomplish this, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A) forbids Medicare from making payments-with one exception-for any item or service when payment has been made (or can reasonably be expected to be made) by another form of insurance, such as a group health plan, worker's compensation law, or automobile insurance. (These other forms of insurance are referred to as \"primary plans.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A).) The one exception is found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B), which authorizes Medicare to make a \"conditional payment\" if a primary plan \"has not made or cannot reasonably be expected to make payment with respect to such item or service promptly\". Any such payments are \"conditioned on reimbursement\" to Medicare. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(i). A primary plan-and an entity that receives payment from a primary plan-must reimburse Medicare for any conditional payment \"if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   To facilitate recovery of conditional payments, the MSP provides for a government action against any entity that was responsible for payment under a primary plan, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii), and subrogates the United States to the rights of a Medicare beneficiary to collect payment under a primary plan for items already paid by Medicare, \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iv).

Halifax seeks dismissal on the grounds that MSPAC can only proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A) against a primary plan, not a provider such as Halifax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   MSPAC responds that a claim\n   under the MSP private cause of action can \"unequivocally\" be brought against providers. (Doc. 29 at 3). In support, however, MSP cites to portions of the MSP Act, federal regulations, and judicial opinions holding that Medicare-and, by extension, MAOs such as FHPI-are entitled to reimbursement from the recipients of payments made by a primary payer. For example, MSPAC quotes a portion of the MSP Act stating that a \"primary plan,\n   <em>\n    and an entity that receives payment from a primary plan\n   </em>\n   , shall reimburse\" Medicare for any payment \"with respect to an item or service if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii) ) (emphasis added). But the issue here is not FHPI's right to reimbursement; the issue is whether FHPI's assignee can pursue that right via the MSP Act's private right of action. By its terms, that right of action only applies to primary plans. MSPAC offers no argument as to why it should also apply to entities, such as Halifax, that receive payment from primary plans. Count I will therefore be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Halifax argues that MSPAC's state law claims for reimbursement in counts II and III are preempted because the MSP Act governs the reimbursement of overpayments. (Doc. 16 at 20). However, Halifax does not cite to any case law so holding\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or provide any other support for this contention. The Court's research has not uncovered any cases holding that the MSP Act preempts any state law claims for reimbursement. Accordingly, the Court rejects this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Count II-FDUTPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FDUTPA creates a private right of action for \"[u]nfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    Fla.

Halifax contends that Florida law recognizes a distinction between \"wrongful enrichment\" and \"unjust enrichment,\" and what MSPAC is seeking falls into the former category and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Flint v.

The law of unjust enrichment is concerned solely with enrichments that are unjust independently of wrongs and contracts. When the plaintiff relies on a breach of contract to supply the \"unjustness\" of the defendant's holdings, the right on which he or she relies arises from the breach of contract, not from an unjust enrichment; analogously, when the plaintiff relies on a wrong to supply the \"unjust factor,\" the causative event is a wrongful enrichment rather than an unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Peter Birks,\n   <em>\n    Unjust Enrichment and Wrongful Enrichment\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Tex.%20L.%20Rev.%201767\">\n    79 Texas L.Rev. 1767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1783 (2001).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Tex.%20L.%20Rev.%201767\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1330 n.2.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

MSPAC is only partially correct. The cases cited by Halifax do indeed rely on the Birks article (or on cases that rely on it). However, while that article was published in a Texas law review, it is national in scope, citing to various Restatements and to English civil law, not decisions of Texas courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2670418\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/420/1288/#p1309\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With that said, this Court previously declined to recognize the distinction between unjust and wrongful enrichment on the grounds that no Florida court has ever done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Silver Star Health and Rehab, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206338496\">\n    2011 WL 6338496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (M.D.Fla. December 19, 2011). In the instant case, the Court finds that it need not consider whether to recognize the distinction, because MSPAC has not explicitly alleged that Halifax engaged in wrongful conduct here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As noted above, MSPAC alleges that Halifax billed and received payment from both FHPI and from 21st Century for the treatment provided to FHPI's enrollee. (Complaint at 18). MSPAC never explicitly alleges that Halifax billed FHPI for the entire cost of the treatment even after 21st Century paid the first $10,000. In analyzing whether MSPAC stated a claim under FDUTPA, which requires unfair or deceptive conduct, the Court drew an inference from these allegations that FHPI was a victim of double billing. However, in the absence of that inference, MSPAC's allegations can be read as simply asserting that FHPI made a mistaken overpayment for which Halifax has refused to make a full reimbursement. Such allegations state a claim for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly the motion will be denied as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Count I is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .

(Complaint at 18).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Halifax also challenges MSPAC's entitlement to maintain this matter as a class action. The Court declines to consider these arguments at this stage of the proceedings. In addition, Halifax raises, in its reply, an argument that MSPAC was not assigned the state law claims it asserts in counts II and III, and therefore it lacks standing. (Doc. 34 at 9). Because MSPAC has not had an opportunity to address this argument, the Court will not consider it in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Halifax describes the issue as one of standing-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    that MSPAC lacks standing to raise a claim under this cause of action. (Doc. 16 at 10). But the doctrine of standing focuses on the injury suffered by the plaintiff rather than the identity of the defendant.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     504 U.S. 555\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 560-61,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2136,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     119 L.Ed.2d 351\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992) (defining \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\" as consisting of \"injury in fact\" to plaintiff, a \"causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,\" and a likelihood \"that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"). Halifax's argument in regard to Count I is based on the fact that it is not a primary plan, rather than anything regarding MSPAC's injury, and therefore the Court will not treat it as an argument about standing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In the alternative, Halifax had argued that FHPI's $10,000 overpayment was not a conditional payment, and therefore was not one for which a remedy would be available under the MSP Act, because that act bars MAOs from making payments where \"payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made\" by a primary payer such as 21st Century-which, in this case, had already paid the $10,000. Because the Court concludes that MSPAC cannot proceed under its chosen cause of action in Count I, it does not reach this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Halifax cites to\n    <em>\n     Western Heritage\n    </em>\n    for this proposition, but the passage it cites to is merely a recitation of the proceedings in an earlier state court case addressing a different issue.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1232. The\n    <em>\n     Western Heritage\n    </em>\n    court did not itself address preemption. Halifax also cites to\n    <em>\n     United States v. Rhode Island Insurers' Insolvency Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639170\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/616/#p622\">\n     80 F.3d 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 622-23 (1st Cir. 1996) on this point, but that court was considering whether a state law that purported to make Medicare, rather than a state insolvency fund, the primary payer was preempted by the MSP Act. In the instant case, there is no allegation that allowing MAOs to seek reimbursement under state law runs counter to the intent of Congress in passing the MSP Act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
