Defendants move for summary judgment on all claims. The Court grants summary judgment on nearly every claim but concludes that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the claims of deprivation of a right to a fair trial brought by two of the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Demonstration and Arrests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 5, 2011 on Occupy Wall Street demonstration occurred in the area around the courthouse at 60 Centre Street and Foley Square in New York, New York.

No. 103, Resp. 1, 2. Plaintiffs Shirazi, Heinz, LaPenne, Collins, A. Weisenhaus and C. Weisenhaus were participants in the demonstration, and Plaintiff Maclean was a volunteer Legal Observer with the National Lawyers Guild-New York Chapter who was present during the demonstration. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 81-82; Pl. Resp. 1. Defendant Anger was the \"NYPD Incident Commander in charge of subordinate officers policing the [Occupy Wall Street] demonstration\" on November 5. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 1. Demonstrators formed a crowd on the sidewalk in front of 60 Centre Street but were kept off the steps of the courthouse by police officers issuing verbal warnings. Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 18; Pl. Resp. 16, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At approximately 3:00 p.m., Anger ordered subordinates, including Defendant Zielinski, to direct all people on the sidewalk in front of 60 Centre Street to leave the area or face arrest due to an alleged concern that demonstrators were obstructing the sidewalk and causing some pedestrians to walk in the roadway. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26; Pl. Resp. 23, 26; Def. Response to Pl. 56.1 (\"Def. Resp.\"), Dkt. No. 108, at 4.

Zielinski, I am with the Manhattan South Task Force, you are blocking pedestrian traffic. I am ordering you to leave the sidewalk. If you do so voluntarily no charges will be filed against you. If you refuse to leave you will be placed under arrest and charged with disorderly conduct.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 26; Pl. Resp. 26; Def. Ex. U at 6:35-7:00. The parties dispute whether all demonstrators were able to hear this order. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 27; Pl. Resp. 26, 27. From video of the event, it appears that Defendant Zielinski's initial order was intermittently drowned out by the playing of harmonicas and shouts from the crowd.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. U at 6:47-50, 6:55-58. Defendant Zielinski thereafter read several orders telling the crowd to leave the area. Def. Ex. U at 8:00-15, 8:52-9:10; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 35; Pl. Resp. 35.

Resp. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Over the following several minutes, officers gave a series of other warnings. Defendant Zielinski announced through a bullhorn \"Ladies and gentlemen you're going to have to leave this area. Right now it's temporarily closed. Right now you have to leave the sidewalk.

Defendant Cooke announced through a bullhorn \"Ladies and gentlemen you got to clear the sidewalk please. Ladies and gentlemen please clear the sidewalk, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen please clear the sidewalk.\" Def. Ex. U 12:37-51; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 51; Pl. Resp. 51. He repeatedly ordered the sidewalks be cleared over the course of the next two minutes. Def.

Def. Ex. U at 17:10-25, Pl. Resp. 83. Defendant Zielinski subsequently read an explicit arrest warning through a bullhorn, stating: \"Okay, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My name is Lt.

If you interfere with an arrest and delay the opening of traffic or obstruct the roadway you will be charged with obstructing governmental administration. You will be fingerprinted and charged with the New York State Penal Law.\" Def. Ex. U at 18:06-18:31; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 88; Pl.

Weisenhaus. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 194; Pl. Resp. 194. Plaintiff C. Weisenhaus told the arresting officers that she had been confused by the police officers, and the officer responded either that she should not have been arrested or that the officer was not sure why she had been arrested. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44; Def. Resp. at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Zielinski again told the crowd that if they did not leave, they would be arrested. Def. Ex.

The Court agrees that the Plaintiffs have abandoned certain claims and that summary judgment on those claims is therefore appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Federal courts may deem a claim abandoned when a party opposing summary judgment fails to address the [movant's] argument in any way.

Memo. in Support of Mot. for SJ (\"Support\"), Dkt. No. 96. As relevant to the issue of abandonment, Defendants make several arguments to which Plaintiffs do not respond. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' generic claim for \"deprivation of federal civil rights\" should be dismissed as either duplicative of other claims or because it is too general to give Defendants fair notice of the claims against them. Support at 3-4. As a result, Defendants are granted summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that the excessive force claim predicated on overly tight handcuffs should be dismissed as to all Plaintiffs. Support at 10-12. Plaintiffs only argue in their memorandum in opposition that a reasonable jury could find that Defendant Louie used excessive force against Plaintiff Shirazi. Pl. Memo. in Opp. to SJ (\"Opp.\"), Dkt. No. 104, at 19-20. As a result, the Plaintiffs have abandoned any excessive force claim as to any other Plaintiff, and summary judgment is granted on this claim as to all Plaintiffs except Plaintiff Shirazi and as to all Defendants except Defendant Louie on the ground that the claims were abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' selective enforcement claim because Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that they were treated differently than a similarly situated group of others as required to sustain a claim arising from the Equal Protection Clause. Support at 15-17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Deegan v. City of Ithaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322545\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/135/#p146\">\n    444 F.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146 (2d Cir. 2006) ). Plaintiffs do not respond to this claim in any way and do not argue that they can point to a similarly situated group of others to sustain their claim. As a result, the Court deems this claim abandoned, and summary judgment is granted to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Fourth, Defendants Zielinski and Anger argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' supervisory liability claims based on their direction or supervision of other Defendants at the scene or\n   their failure to intervene because a constitutional claim requires personal involvement and an opportunity to intercede. Support at 17-18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Colon v.

Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument or provide any legal support or factual support for a claim of supervisory liability or failure to intervene as to Defendants Zielinski or Anger. As a result, summary judgment is granted to the Defendants on these abandoned claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fifth, Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim should be denied because the Plaintiffs have not identified any actual policy or custom that existed and that, of the eight theories alleged in the complaint in support of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability, Plaintiffs have not adduced any record evidence to support either that these policies existed or that the policies violated any of the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Support at 20-25. Plaintiffs do not discuss their\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim in their opposition to summary judgment or explain what evidence exists that would support any theory of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability at trial. The Court therefore concludes that the Plaintiffs abandoned their\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim and grants summary judgment to Defendants thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for malicious abuse of process because Defendants had probable cause to arrest the Plaintiffs and that Plaintiffs have not adduced evidence of one of the elements of a claim for malicious abuse of process-a collateral objective outside legitimate means of process. Support at 12-14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Savino v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110734\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/63/#p76\">\n    331 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (2d Cir. 2003) ). Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument or provide any evidentiary support for their malicious abuse of process claim in their opposition to summary judgment. As a result, the Court concludes that the claim has been abandoned and that it is therefore appropriate to grant summary judgment to the Defendants on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity on Plaintiffs' First Amendment, First Amendment Retaliation, Wrongful Arrest, Malicious Prosecution, and Remaining Excessive Force Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to the remaining claims, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. Specifically, Defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' claims for violation of the First Amendment, First Amendment retaliation, unlawful arrest, malicious prosecution, excessive force, and violation of the right to a fair trial. The Court concludes that the Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' claims of violation of the First Amendment, unlawful arrest, First Amendment retaliation, malicious prosecution, and excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The doctrine of qualified immunity 'gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments' by immunizing them from suit for damages unless their conduct violated clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Memo. &amp; Order (\"\n   <em>\n    Mediavilla\n   </em>\n   Order\") at 13-14,\n   <em>\n    Mediavilla v.

Def. Ex. U at 22:43-53 (MacLean); Def. Ex. W at 1:35-53 (LaPenne and Collins); Def. Ex. Y at 2:30-3:05 (A. Weisenhaus and C. Weisenhaus); Def. Ex. Z, Dkt.

Second, with respect to obstruction under section 240.20(6), the Defendants who arrested one or more of the Plaintiffs were aware that numerous warnings to leave the area had been given to the crowd by Defendant Zielinski, Defendant Cooke, and others over bullhorns.

These general warnings were sufficient for a reasonable officer to reasonably believe that all of the demonstrators were aware that they should leave the sidewalk and street areas around 60 Centre Street and the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse. As a result, the Defendants had arguable probable\n   cause to arrest the Plaintiffs based on the reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs were refusing to comply with the orders to disperse that had been given.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heicklen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20565426\">\n    2010 WL 565426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs dispute this conclusion, arguing that a reasonable jury could believe that the Plaintiffs could not hear the warnings given by officers. Opp. at 15. It is true that an officer can only be found to have arguable probable cause to arrest someone under section 240.20(6) if the officer had reason to believe that that person received an order to disperse before being arrested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zellner v.

However, in the present case, the number of warnings given to the crowd, the use of bullhorns to amplify the warnings, the amount of time over which warnings were given, and the fact that warnings were given by different officers while standing at different locations in the crowd all could have led a reasonable officer to conclude that the Plaintiffs had heard one or more order to disperse and refused to do so. A reasonable officer could also have concluded that everyone in the crowd was aware of the orders to leave because the crowd started cheering, in apparent response to the need to move to allow pedestrian traffic to use the sidewalk, \"We\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   pedestrian traffic.\" Pl. Resp. 46 (emphasis added); Def. Ex. U at 10:54-11:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even if these generalized warnings did not give the Defendants arguable probable cause, every arresting officers-or the officer who ordered the Plaintiffs to be arrested-saw all Plaintiffs except Plaintiff LaPenne either receive a direct order or be in close proximity to an officer giving an order to leave. First, Defendant Zielinski gave an explicit order for demonstrators to leave while standing directly in front of Plaintiffs A. Weisenhaus and C. Weisenhaus before he ordered that the two women be arrested. Def. Ex. U at 18:39-55; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 90-91; Pl. Resp. 90-91. As a result, reasonable officers in Defendant Zielinski's position could conclude that Plaintiffs A. Weisenhaus and C. Weisenhaus had heard his order to disperse and were refusing to comply in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 240.20(6). Second, Defendant Sharma stated that he personally ordered Plaintiff Collins to \"move along\" prior to arresting her. Sharma Dep. at p. 68 ln. 3-22; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 147; Pl. Resp. 147. Third, Defendant Louie observed Plaintiff Shirazi in a crowd that received multiple orders to leave from Defendant Zielinski. Louie Dep. at p. 69 ln. 14-p. 70 ln. 22. Defendant Delgado observed Plaintiff Heinz in a group that received repeated instructions from Defendant Zielinski to leave the area prior to arresting her. Delgado Dep. at p. 43 ln. 15-20, p. 53, ln. 4-11; Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 164-65; Pl. Resp. 164, 165. Defendant Delgado also saw Plaintiff MacLean receive a specific order to leave the area prior to arresting her. Delgado Dep. at p. 49, ln. 2-12. Finally, although no Defendant saw Plaintiff LaPenne receive a direct warning, she was in close proximity to Plaintiff Collins and was arrested near where Plaintiffs A. Weisenhaus and C. Weisenhaus had been arrested just moments before. Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 94-95; Pl. Resp. 94, 95. As a result, a reasonable officer could have reasonably concluded that Plaintiff LaPenne had heard the warnings given to Plaintiffs A. Weisenhaus and C. Weisenhaus, as well as the warning given to Plaintiff Collins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs next dispute whether the orders given by Defendants Zielinski, Cooke, and others constituted \"orders to disperse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Opp. at 14-15. However, reasonable officers could have reasonably concluded that the demonstrators had been given orders to disperse, and therefore the Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Demonstrators were repeatedly told that they had to leave the area. First, they were told to \"clear the sidewalk,\" which unambiguously required the demonstrators, including the Plaintiffs, to\n   <em>\n    leave\n   </em>\n   the sidewalk in front of 60 Centre Street entirely. Def. Ex. U at 9:35-10:25, 10:59-11:17, 12:05-23, 12:37-45, 12:58-14:37; Def. Ex. V at 4:00-15; Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 41-45, 49, 51, 52-53, 62-63; Pl. Resp. 41, 42, 44, 45, 49, 51, 52, 53, 62, 63. Demonstrators were also told \"you're going to have to leave the area. Right now it's temporarily closed.... [Y]ou need to move.\" Def. Ex. V at 3:25-46; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 48; Pl. Resp. 48. Demonstrators were then told that they had to \"leave this location\" or they would be \"charged with obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct.\" Def. Ex. U at 17:30-17:55; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 32; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 84; Pl. Resp. 84. In context, these orders were clearly orders to disperse, and a reasonable officer could reasonably conclude that there was probable cause to arrest demonstrators who did not comply by leaving the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs LaPenne, Collins, and MacLean also dispute that they were refusing to comply with the Defendants' orders to disperse by arguing that they were in the process of leaving the area when they were arrested. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 46-50, 88. However, all three were arrested after numerous warnings had been given and several minutes after Defendant Zielinski had informed the crowd that they had already committed disorderly conduct by refusing to leave up to that point and were therefore going to be arrested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. U at 18:09-18:31; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 88; Pl. Resp. 88. As a result, even if the Plaintiffs were in the process of leaving, a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to arrest all three Plaintiffs for having committed disorderly conduct notwithstanding their subsequent attempts to leave the area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marcavage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501476\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/98/#p105\">\n    689 F.3d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding arrests for disorderly conduct where plaintiffs \"gravitated in the general direction of the demonstration zone\" but were nonetheless found \"hostile and noncompliant\" to officers' orders).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that the orders to disperse violated the First Amendment, as discussed above. Opp. at 7-11;\n   <em>\n    see also supra.\n   </em>\n   Orders to disperse \"must be lawful before failure to obey it gives rise to liability\" for committing the offense disorderly conduct.\n   <em>\n    Mediavilla\n   </em>\n   Order at 20.

First, Plaintiffs have not identified any case establishing that twisting an arrestee's arm behind her back when she appears to be trying to escape from an officer constitutes excessive force. To the contrary, courts in this circuit determined that such actions were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional in the years prior to the Occupy Wall Street demonstration held on November 5, 2011. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Bartlett v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , the district court found that officers did not use objectively unreasonable force when they \"grabbed [the plaintiff's] wrist and twisted her arm behind her back\" while arresting her because she had \"used her hands in an attempt to prevent the officers from walking into [her] apartment\" and had made slight\n   contact with an officer before he grabbed her arm.

Feb. 11, 2005). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Kalfus v. New York &amp; Presbyterian Hospital\n   </em>\n   , the district court concluded that it was not objectively unreasonable for officers to turn the plaintiff, \"twisting his arms behind his back, pushing him face first onto the concrete slab, cuffing him, pinning his knee, and yanking his cuffed arms up with enough force to tear his right rotator cuff\" because the officers had asked the plaintiff to stand up and put his hands behind his back and the plaintiff had responded \"no.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956378\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/706/458/#p472\">\n    706 F.Supp.2d 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). As a result, it would not be unreasonable for an officer in Defendant Louie's position to believe that he was using appropriate force when he twisted Plaintiff Shirazi's arm behind her back when she appeared to be resisting arrest. Defendant Louie is therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, no law clearly established that it was inappropriate to tightly handcuff an arrestee at the time of Plaintiff Shirazi's arrest. Rather, \"there is a consensus in the case law that tight handcuffing does not constitute excessive force unless it causes injuries beyond pain and bruising.\"\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham v.

Sept. 4, 2012) (holding that \"[t]wenty-four hour swelling of the wrists does not rise to the level of injury necessary to sustain an excessive use of force claim for tight handcuffs\"). Nor is there any evidence pointed to by the Plaintiffs to suggest that Plaintiff Shirazi complained immediately that her handcuffs were too tight. Rather, she complained several minutes later to a different officer, and her handcuffs were loosened shortly thereafter. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 113, 115-16; Pl. Resp. 113, 115, 116. As a result, a reasonable officer in Defendant Louie's position could have reasonably concluded that he had not used excessive force in tightly handcuffing Plaintiff Shirazi because he had not made the handcuffs so tight that they were likely to cause damage beyond swelling and bruising and because Plaintiff Shirazi did not immediately complain to him that they were too tight, and they were loosened soon thereafter.

While Sharma could not identify which individuals were pedestrians, no reasonable jury could conclude that he fabricated testimony by stating that any pedestrians who were present were forced to go around the large group blocking the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court notes that Plaintiffs raise several arguments that Officer Ciaramitaro may have falsified documents pertaining to Plaintiff Collins. Opp. at 22-23; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 126-31. However, Officer Ciaramitaro is not, and has never been, a defendant in this action. As a result, the Court does not\n   consider Plaintiffs' evidence with respect to Officer Ciaramitaro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff Heinz\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendant Delgado is entitled to summary judgment on the claim that he provided false information in connection with the arrest of Plaintiff Heinz. Plaintiffs identify two statements on Plaintiff Heinz's arrest slips that they allege are false. However, even drawing all available inferences in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant Delgado gave false testimony that would support a claim for the denial of a right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs make two insufficient arguments as to Defendant Delgado's allegedly falsified testimony regarding Plaintiff Heinz. First, Plaintiffs state that Defendant Delgado lied when he wrote on Plaintiff Heinz's DA Datasheet that she was in a group of \"[a]pprox 25 people [who] were told numerous times to disperse, blocking sidewalk, unsafe, blocking pedestrians from walking.\" Heinz DA Datasheet, Dkt. No. 101-44;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 23; Heinz AI, Dkt. No. 101-49. Specifically, Plaintiffs state that this was a lie because during his deposition, Defendant Delgado stated, \"I don't remember her [Heinz] blocking pedestrians.\" Pl. Excerpts of Delgado Dep. at p. 55 ln. 8-9. However, in context, it is unmistakable that Defendant Delgado recalled the group in which Plaintiff Heinz was standing blocking traffic even if he did not see her individually stand in the path of a pedestrian. Just two pages before the exchange Plaintiffs excerpt, Defendant Delgado explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Q. Did you see Ms. Heinz block traffic?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   A. Just pedestrian traffic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Q. What did you see with respect to her blocking pedestrian traffic?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A. It was herself along with others blocking pedestrian traffic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Pl. Excerpts of Delgado Dep. at p. 53 ln. 4-10. Defendant Delgado's two statements are consistent, and both are consistent with what he attested to in his official statement-that a group of approximately 25 people with whom Plaintiff Heinz was standing were collectively blocking traffic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heinz AI. As a result, no reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Delgado gave false testimony to prosecutors when he made that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiffs next state that Defendant Delgado lied when he attested that Defendant Zielinski ordered protesters to disperse from the sidewalk but that Heinz did not leave the area. Opp. at 23; Heinz AI; Heinz DA Datasheet. However, no reasonable jury could conclude that these statements were a lie. Plaintiffs identify Defendant Delgado's statements that he was \"observing the whole crowd\" and that in addition to Plaintiffs Maclean and Heinz, he was watching \"[w]hoever was in that crowd behind the orange mesh\" as evidence that he had not been observing Plaintiff Heinz and therefore could not know if she received warnings from Defendant Zielinski. Pl. Excerpts of Delgado Dep. at p. 40 ln. 21-22, p. 44 ln. 17-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 23. These statements are not contradictory, and Defendant Delgado stated affirmatively that he remembered seeing Plaintiff Heinz in the crowd that Defendant Zielinski ordered to leave. Pl. Excerpts of Delgado Dep. at p. 66 ln. 8-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff LaPenne\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the claim that they denied Plaintiff LaPenne's right to a fair trial by making false statements to prosecutors regarding her arrest. The only allegedly\n   false statements forwarded to prosecutors with respect to Plaintiff LaPenne were made by Officer Ciaramitaro. As discussed above, Officer Ciaramitaro is not a defendant in this case, and any evidence that he may have falsified arresting documents has no relevance to this case. As a result, the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff MacLean\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant Delgado is entitled to summary judgment on the claim that he provided false information in connection with the arrest of Plaintiff MacLean, thereby denying her right to a fair trial. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Delgado provided false testimony as to Plaintiff MacLean when he stated that he observed her in a group that blocked pedestrians and was instructed by Defendant Zielinski to disperse, as well as stating that he saw Plaintiff MacLean not leave the area. Opp. at 24. In support of their argument that these statements were false, Plaintiffs point to statements Defendant Delgado made in his testimony that were nearly identical to the statements he made about Plaintiff Heinz. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 151, 153;\n   <em>\n    see also supra.\n   </em>\n   The reasons that no reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Delgado lied with respect to Plaintiff Heinz are also the reasons that no reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Delgado lied with respect to Plaintiff MacLean. Defendants are therefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Defendants Are Not Entitled to Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendant Li is not entitled to summary judgment on the claim that he provided false information in connection with the arrest of Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus. A reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Li provided false testimony to prosecutors, thereby denying Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus's right to a fair trial. Specifically, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Li fabricated his testimony, written on Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus's arrest papers, that he saw Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus \"blocking [the] street\" and \"blocking cars from driving.\" A. Weisenhaus DA Datasheet, Dkt. No. 101-47; A. Weisenhaus AI, Dkt. No. 101-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiffs identify several pieces of evidence tending to show that Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus was not blocking traffic and that Defendant Li never saw her blocking traffic. First, Plaintiffs identify numerous portions of Defendant Li's deposition transcript in which he repeatedly contradicts whether he can remember seeing A. Weisenhaus in the street or seeing cars avoiding her or whether he cannot remember anything about her arrest.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pl. Excerpts of Li Dep., Dkt. No. 101-22, at p. 21 ln. 10-16 (remembering),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Pl. Excerpts of Li Dep. at p. 23 ln. 6-18 (same),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Pl. Excerpts of Li Dep. at p. 48 ln. 5-18 (same),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl. Excerpts of Li Dep. at p. 38 ln. 10-18 (not remembering),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Pl. Excerpts of Li Dep. at p. 43 ln. 10-p. 46 ln. 9 (same),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Pl. Excerpts of Li Dep. at p. 48 ln. 19-24 (same). A jury could conclude from such evidence that Defendant Li's testimony is not trustworthy. In addition, Plaintiffs identify a video showing that when Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus was arrested, she was standing in a bike lane and not in the street blocking traffic. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 40-41; Def. Ex. W at 0:28-1:04. Plaintiff C. Weisenhaus also testified at her deposition that she and her sister were standing in the bike lane when they were both arrested. C. Weisenhaus Dep., Dkt. No. 101-7, at p. 24 ln. 4-17, p. 28 ln. 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As a result, taking all evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as\n   to whether Defendant Li lied about observing Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus in traffic. Defendant Li's testimony is evidence the jury likely would have relied on because it was the eyewitness testimony of an officer, it was the only evidence that linked Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus with specifically blocking traffic instead of more generally being part of a group blocking the sidewalk, and there was no other evidence given to prosecutors pertaining to her blocking of traffic. Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus was detained for five hours and appeared five more times in court in connection with her desk appearance ticket. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 168-69. As a result, a reasonable jury could conclude that she suffered a deprivation of liberty as a result of Defendant Li's falsified statements. Summary judgment is therefore denied as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment as to C. Weisenhaus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Walker testified falsely when he forwarded information to prosecutors that he observed Plaintiff C. Weisenhaus in a \"group of approximately 100 to 200 individuals\" and that \"due to the presence of said group, the sidewalk was blocked, pedestrians could not walk on said sidewalk, and pedestrians were forced to walk into the street to get around said group.\" C. Weisenhaus AI, Dkt. No. 101-53;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 25. Plaintiffs argue that this information is false because Walker stated in his deposition that he could not recall the details of Plaintiff C. Weisenhaus's arrest and because she was arrested in a bicycle lane. Opp. at 25. No reasonable jury could conclude that either piece of evidence identified by Plaintiffs demonstrates that Defendant Walker testified falsely. In particular, Defendant Walker could have seen C. Weisenhaus in the group that was blocking the bike lane as the officers were trying to clear the sidewalk in front of 60 Centre Street. In fact, this is exactly what video evidence shows. Def. Ex. U at 16:53-18:00. As a result, no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Defendant Walker made any false statements to prosecutors in violation of Plaintiff C. Weisenhaus's fair trial right. Summary judgment is granted to Defendants on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment is granted on Plaintiffs' claims that the Defendants violated their right to a fair trial with respect to all Defendants except Defendants Louie and Li.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Summary judgment is granted on all claims as to all Defendants except that summary judgment is denied on Count Nine with respect to Plaintiff Shirazi's claim against Defendant Louie and Plaintiff A. Weisenhaus's claim against Defendant Li. All other parties are dismissed from the action. This resolves Docket Number 93. A post-discovery conference in this action will be scheduled under separate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    In fact, the only argument that the Plaintiffs make specifically to the Defendants' defense of qualified immunity on\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    claim is that \"Defendants have not shown each constitutional right as to which they claim qualified immunity was not clearly established.\" Opp. at 29.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    \"Criminal violations of NYPL sections 240.20(6) (Disorderly Conduct) and 195.05 (Obstruction of Governmental Administration) overlap to a large degree, because '[a]n officer has probable cause to arrest for obstructing governmental administration where a person refuses to comply with an order from a police officer.'
