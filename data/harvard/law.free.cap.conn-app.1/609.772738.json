In his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant assigns as error (1) the trial judge\u2019s conduct toward the defendant\u2019s counsel; (2) certain evidentiary rulings; and (3) the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury on the issue of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The facts may be summarized as follows: The defendant and the victim, after having been introduced in a telephone conversation in 1980, had contact with each other mostly through letters. She saw him for a second time on January 6,1982. After she had sexual relations with the defendant on that date, a disagreement ensued between them regarding their future plans and overall relationship. Thereafter, the defendant allegedly attacked the victim with a knife, inflicting stab and slash wounds to the victim\u2019s head, neck and hand. From early afternoon until the evening, the defendant drove the victim from Shelton to Ashford. In Ashford, the defendant told the victim to walk to a house and get assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On February 7,1982, the defendant was arrested and charged with kidnapping in the first degree and assault in the first degree. He was found guilty of the assault charge only and sentenced to a term of twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s numerous interruptions, the chastisement of his counsel and the failure to permit his counsel to speak on the record deprived him of his right to a fair trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The function of the court in a criminal trial is to conduct a fair and impartial proceeding. <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 82, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680 (1942); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 401, 439 A.2d 387 (1981); see also <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>145 Conn. 11, 19, 138 A.2d 512, cert. denied, 356 U.S. 969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>78 S. Ct. 1010, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1075 (1958). The trial judge must avoid taking an apparent position of advocacy in the case before him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>supra, 402; <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>170 Conn. 11, 13-14, 364 A.2d 225 (1975). Judges in this state, however, are given wide latitude to comment fairly and reasonably upon evidence received at trial, but the court must refrain from making improper remarks which are indicative of favor or condemnation, or which disparage a defendant before the jury. Id.; see also <em>La Chase </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>142 Conn. 122, 125, 111 A.2d 690 (1955). Even though a judge may take all reasonable steps necessary for the orderly progress of the trial, he must always be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 169, 444 A.2d 915 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">It is evident from a review of the transcript that a departure from these standards occurred in the trial court. On cross-examination of the victim, the trial judge interrupted counsel for the defendant on many occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where, as in the present case, much of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>evidence of the commission of a crime is based upon the testimony of the complainant, the court must allow the defendant a broad latitude on cross-examination. Any undue interference may seriously curtail the legitimate and proper defense of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gionfriddo, </em>154 Conn. 90, 96, 221 A.2d 851 (1966). The repeated interruptions and rebukes of counsel by the trial judge prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case, thereby denying him a fair trial. Id., 97.</p>\n<p id=\"AP10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>In addition, the judge made prejudicial statements to the jury, embarassed counsel and denied counsel the right to speak on the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>remarks and conduct far exceeded the permissible bounds of a judge\u2019s function during a trial. The defendant\u2019s trial was not a fair one since it was not conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>in all material things in substantial conformity to law, before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in the atmosphere of judicial calm. See <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>supra. We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s conduct constituted reversible error. Since the defendant must be afforded a new trial, his other claims of error will be reviewed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The second issue raised by the defendant concerns the admission of certain evidence: the color photographs of the victim\u2019s head, the tracking-dog evidence and the testimony of a physician based on a hypothetical question.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The trial court, over objections by the defendant, admitted into evidence several photographs of the head of the victim in the emergency room of the hospital. The defendant argues that this evidence should have been excluded because the trooper who took the pictures could not distinguish between blood and disinfectant and, therefore, the photos were not a true representation of the victim\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">\u201cThe great weight of authority is that photographs, even though gruesome, are admissible in evidence when otherwise properly admitted if they have a reasonable tendency to prove or disprove a material fact in issue or shed some light upon some material inquiry . . . . A photograph, the tendency of which may be to prejudice the jury, may be admitted in evidence if, in the sound discretion of the court, its value as evidence outweighs its possible prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 452-53, 450 A.2d 828 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>LaBreck, </em>159 Conn. 346, 351, 269 A.2d 74 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The state offered the evidence to show the nature, location and extent of the injuries and to give the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the best evidence available that this was a serious physical injury<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather than merely a physical injury. The prosecution, with its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, must be given the right to prove every essential element of the crime by the most convincing evidence it is able to produce. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 408, 439 A.2d 387 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 701-702, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). The trial court exercises a broad discretion in admitting such evidence, and its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of that discretion is shown. <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>supra. Such abuse has not been demonstrated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>180 Conn. 481, 489, 429 A.2d 931 (1980), set forth a four part test which must be shown as a condition precedent to the admissibility of tracking-dog evidence: (1) that the handler was qualified to use the dog; (2) that the dog was trained and accurate in tracking humans; (3) that the dog was placed on the trail where circumstances indicate the alleged party to have been; and (4) that the trail had not become so stale or contaminated as to be beyond the dog\u2019s competency to follow it. The testimony of the Connecticut state police canine handler was offered to prove the probable location of where the victim was dropped off in Ashford and the path that she took leading to the residence which offered her assistance. In light of the state\u2019s offer of proof as to the qualifications of the canine handler and the trained dog, the circumstances surrounding the tracking of the victim\u2019s scent and the time the tracking took place, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The defendant further argues that the testimony of physician Hubert S. Bush, Jr., based on a hypothetical question could easily have prejudiced the jury. The question posed to Bush asked whether the victim if left unattended for three to four hours would have bled to death. Bush responded that, \u201c[t]he patient could have fainted and she could have bled further and she might have died from the bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The admissibility of a hypothetical question calls for the exercise of sound discretion as to whether the question, even though it does not contain all of the facts in evidence, presents the facts in such a manner that they bear a true and fair relationship to each other and to the whole evidence in the case, whether it is not so worded as to be likely to mislead or confuse the jury and, further, whether it is not so lacking as to be without value in the decision of the case. <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 446-47, 378 A.2d 540 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The question did not ask Bush to reach a conclusion on the basis of a misleading presentation of the facts. It merely asked him to project the results of a hypothetical situation. We thus conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit certain letters and photos sent by the victim to the defendant as relevant to the victim\u2019s motive, bias and prejudice. The question of relevance is to be determined in each criminal case in accordance with reason and judicial experience, and requires the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 405-406, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 646, 431 A.2d 501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>178 Conn. 427, 437, 423 A.2d 72 (1979). Reversal of the court\u2019s ruling is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 291, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">After an examination of the letters and photographs offered by the defendant, the trial court concluded that they added nothing relevant to the victim\u2019s testimony regarding her relationship with the defendant of which the jury was not aware. It is well within the discretion of the trial court to exclude evidence if its relevance is so slight and inconsequential that to admit it would distract attention which should be concentrated on other evidence which bears directly on the vital issues in the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 511, 438 A.2d 749 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>176 Conn. 445, 450, 408 A.2d 239 (1979). We hold that the trial court did not err in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The final claim pursued by the defendant is that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury on the issue of self-defense. Specifically, the defendant argues (1) that the jury was not instructed that the state had to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) that the court never attempted to apply any of the conflicting facts to the law in its instructions; and (3) that the court erroneously emphasized a doctor\u2019s opinion that the victim\u2019s injuries were serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The record before us, when viewed in a light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s claim, fails to demonstrate that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to require a jury instruction on the defense of self-defense under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant never claimed to have used the knife against the victim in order to defend himself or that deadly force was necessary for him to retreat from her in complete safety. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19. The state\u2019s burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt does not attach until the defense is raised at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassino, </em>188 Conn. 237, 243-44, 449 A.2d 154 (1982). Because there was not sufficient evidence submitted by the defendant to warrant an instruction on self-defense, the trial court did not err in refusing to so instruct.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The degree to which reference to the evidence may be called for in the jury charge lies largely in the discretion of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 171, 422 A.2d 299 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cari, </em>163 Conn. 174, 182, 303 A.2d 7 (1972). In its instructions, the court applied the law to the evidence where it deemed necessary. It stressed that \u201c[t]he accused relies on you to consider carefully his claims to evaluate carefully all the evidence and to render a verdict of not guilty if the facts and the law require such a verdict.\u201d Repeatedly, the court charged that the state has the burden of proving each and every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it was the jury\u2019s recollection, and not that of the court\u2019s which controlled. A review of the court\u2019s comments on the evidence in the instructions indicate that the charge was correct in the law, adapted to the factual issues, and sufficient to guide the jury in reaching a verdict. The trial court, therefore, did not err in declining to recite the evidence in more detail. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The defendant lastly claims that the court in its jury instructions unfairly emphasized the testimony of a doctor as to the seriousness of the victim\u2019s injuries. It is well settled that the trial court may, in its discretion, call the attention of the jury to the evidence on any point in issue and comment on the weight of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 210, 445 A.2d 314 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 705, 443 A.2d 915 (1982). It may comment on the evidence as long as the court does not advise or direct the jury how to decide the case. Id. The court also included in its instructions that expert opinion testimony by the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tor must be scrutinized for its reliability. We do not find that the trial court abused its discretion regarding the doctor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 2 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\"> The following conversations transpired between the trial judge and the defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">\u201cThe Court: Haven\u2019t you been all over this before?</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I am, Your Honor, but this isn\u2019t the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\u201cThe Court: I hope not. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: My question is \u2018did you consider yourself\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">\u201cThe Court: She answered the question.

This is how we conduct our trials.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-25\"> During the cross-examination of Officer James J. Allen III, the court and the defendant were engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-26\">\u201cQ. So you determine that spot where he would start.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-27\">\u201cThe Court: Counsellor, that is not the testimony. He brought the dog back, lower from this map at the starting point, and walked with the dog until the dog went into the tracking position. That\u2019s the testimony, as I remember it.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-28\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, this is cross-examination. I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>I have a right to ask him these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqjr\">\u201cThe Court: You do not have the right to make\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AA4\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Then Mr. Kelly doesn\u2019t have the right.</p>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ve gone through this before. I\u2019m going to excuse the jury. (Jury excused.)</p>\n<p id=\"A6OZ\">\u201cThe Court: No lawyers, during the cross-examination of the witness, get up and make an erroneous statement regarding testimony before the Court and except that, merely because there\u2019s no objection by the State, who may or may not care that the judge who is trying the case and controlling the case, has no right to make comments like that. Now I told you this before and I give you another exception, because I believe that the judge has every right and every obligation to control the conduct of the case. And I\u2019m not going to allow counsel to get up and make erroneous statements. If you agree that you are erroneous, then I think you should apologize and re-state your questions instead of arguing with me. Now, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s your recollection also. It\u2019s been testified to several times. Both on direct and on cross-examination that the trooper went, and I guess on this map it\u2019s north, to that spot. He walked with the dog and all of a sudden the dog went into a tracking position. He did not start at that spot. And, I think, for you to make that statement in front of the jury means either you\u2019ve misunderstood the testimony or there\u2019s some other purpose. I so rule and exception is noted. If I\u2019m in error, you, Counsellor, have a right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AnK2\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Alright, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"AVR\">\u201cThe Court: Bring the jury back in.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, I\u2019d like to put something on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AVL\">\u201cThe Court: What you\u2019ve done is on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6m\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: No, Your Honor\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"Avg\">\u201cThe Court: If I-</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, I want to put something on the record.
