The defendant uses copying equipment in its engineering and surveying business. The defendant purchased the machine after being assured by the plaintiff\u2019s salesman that the machine could be adjusted to the satisfaction of the buyer. The machine was delivered on November 29,1979, and, despite six weeks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>service calls by representatives of the plaintiff, the machine could not be adjusted so as to meet the def end-ant\u2019s needs. The plaintiff gave up trying to adjust the machine and, by letter of January 23,1980, suggested that the defendant redesign the survey forms it produced in order to accommodate the machine. The defendant replied by letter of January 29,1980, stating that the machine was not operating as represented and that it was rejecting the machine pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-601. The defendant requested that the plaintiff make arrangements to pick the machine up and return the cash paid and the machine traded in by the defendant at the time the new copier was purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Although the copying machine had, since January 29, 1980, continuously been available for the plaintiff to pick up, the plaintiff had never done so. The defendant made some use of the machine between January 29,1980, and April 8,1980. The defendant permitted a charitable organization to make limited use of it up until June 14, 1982, the date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The court found a breach of contract; a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-314; a breach of express warranties under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-313; and a breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-315. The court further found that the defendant\u2019s rejection of the machine was timely and proper, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-601 and 42a-2-602, and that it was clearly proven that the defendant never accepted the machine pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-606. The court finally found that the defendant\u2019s use of the machine between January 29,1980, and April 8,1980, and the limited use by the local Lion\u2019s Club were not sufficient to constitute acceptance of the machine or to affect the validity of the rejection. The court found for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ant on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and for the defendant on its counterclaim for the return of the $2000 payment and the machine traded in. The court held that if the machine traded in was not returned, then judgment in the amount of $4090 would be rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal is a patent attempt to get this court to retry the facts. \u201cThis court will not reverse the decision of the trial court unless it is found to be \u2018clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole.\u2019 <em>Damora </em>v. <em>Christ-Janer, </em>184 Conn. 109, 113, 441 A.2d 61 (1981); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); see Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. Weighing the evidence is the function of the trier of fact and this court will not usurp that role. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 38, 440 A.2d 782 (1981).\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>1 Conn. App. 40, 42, 467 A.2d 936 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The defendant\u2019s use of the machine was only for its \u201cin-house\u201d purposes and not for the purpose for which it was purchased. The crucial question of whether the defendant\u2019s limited use of the copier resulted in acceptance or rejection of the machine is purely a factual finding for the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The plaintiff does not claim that it was deprived of a full and fair hearing; it raises no evidentiary claims of error. The plaintiff asks instead that we overturn the factual findings of the trial court. See <em>Superior Wire &amp; Paper Products, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Talcott Tool &amp; Machine, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 10, 17, 441 A.2d 43 (1981). The judgment of the court was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-13\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
