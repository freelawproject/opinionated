The trial court denied the request for a writ of mandamus and the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On November 15, 1977, the plaintiff, Mildred Merlo, applied to the defendant planning and zoning commission of the town of Wethersfield for approval of a forty-two lot subdivision on land owned by her. On January 3, 1978, the defendant held a public hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application. On March 7,1978, and May 2,1978, the defendant granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for two successive sixty-five day extensions of the statutory deadline for a decision by the commission. At a meeting on June 22,1978, the subject of final approval of the plaintiff\u2019s application was brought up for action. Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Larkin moved for approval of the application with certain stipulations which he proposed. There was a lengthy discussion of various aspects of the proposed subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The vote on the motion to approve the subdivision plan as amended was four \u201cayes\u201d and five \u201cnayes.\u201d The minutes of the meeting state: \u201cTherefore, the motion, with stipulations, was disapproved.\u201d There was no further action taken on the application. The clerk for the commission published a legal notice on June 28,1978, concerning the action taken on the plaintiff\u2019s application with the statement \u201cmotion to approve failed TO CARRY. Therefore this application was denied.\u201d The last day allowed by statute for a decision was July 18, 1978. On August 8, 1978, the plaintiff demanded that the commission issue a certificate of subdivision approval because of the commission\u2019s failure to \u201capprove, modify and approve, or disapprove the application\u201d as required by General Statutes \u00a7 8-26. The defendant refused to issue a certificate of approval claiming that it had voted to disapprove the application on June 22, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The trial court held that the defeat of the motion to approve the application constituted a denial of the application. The court, in its holding, referred to the cases of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>153 Conn. 574, 219 A.2d 445 (1966), and <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Thalheimer, </em>116 N.H. 299, 358 A.2d 395 (1976). The court noted that the plaintiff had appealed the commissioner\u2019s action to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It did not determine whether complete relief could be obtained in that proceeding because it concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to a writ of mandamus on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The plaintiff briefed two main issues: (1) that the court erred in finding a valid disapproval of the plaintiff\u2019s application since the action was not one of the three actions specifically authorized under General Statutes \u00a7 8-26; and (2) that the court erred in denying the plaintiff the remedy of mandamus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The commission's failure to approve the application with stipulations is not one of the three dispositions authorized in \u00a7 8-26. The commission\u2019s action obviously did not \u201capprove\u201d or \u201cmodify and approve,\u201d and the defendant just as clearly did not \u201cdisapprove\u201d the subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 176 Conn. 581, 591, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979), the commission approved the defendants\u2019 subdivision application \u201c \u2018subject to posting a bond and approval of the highway superintendent.\u2019 \u201d In upholding the trial court\u2019s finding of inferred approval,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere a commission makes the approval of a plan of subdivision subject to a condition, the fulfillment of which is within the control of neither the commission nor the applicant . . . the commission has \u2018failed to act\u2019 within the intendment of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-26 and 8-28,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> unless the coordinate agency approval appears to be a reasonable probability.\u201d (Footnote added.) Id., 592-93. Since the Supreme Court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>no indication of such a reasonable probability, it concluded that the commission did not properly \u201capprove, modify and approve, or disapprove\u201d the subdivision application so that inferred approval took place under \u00a7 8-26. Id., 593. In discussing the provision of \u00a7 8-26 which states that notice of a decision \u201cshall be a simple statement that such application was approved, modified and approved or disapproved,\u201d the court noted: \u201cThe wording of this sentence is particularly important and reinforces the obvious legislative intention that the only \u2018decision\u2019 of the commission which the statute contemplated was \u2018approval, modification and approval, or disapproval.\u2019 \u201d Id., 595. In requiring strict adherence to the statutory scheme, the court stated that \u201c[t]he legislative purpose behind General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-26 and 8-28, to secure, in the public interest, by means of rather brief appeal time periods, a speedy determination of the issues involved . . . will best be facilitated if subdivision applicants know with certainty that a definite course of statutory action has been taken by a commission, setting in motion clear avenues of appeal.\u201d Id., 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 540, 244 A.2d 391 (1968), the Supreme Court first made it explicitly clear that only the three types of decisions listed in \u00a7 8-26 are proper. In commenting on the automatic approval mechanism of that section, the court stated: \u201cThe obvious intention of the legislature in using this language was to ensure prompt and expeditious action on subdivision applications for the protection of the subdivider. <em>The language of the statute is mandatory. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We do not consider that the cases of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>153 Conn. 574, 219 A.2d 445 (1966), and <em>Lupinacci </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>153 Conn. 694, 220 A.2d 274 (1966), require a different result. In <em>Hall, </em>four members of a ten mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ber commission had voted to approve a change of zone and four had voted against approval. The court stated that \u201cthe motion to grant the application failed of passage upon the tie vote.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 576. In <em>Lupinacci, </em>the plaintiff filed separate applications with the planning and zoning commission seeking an amendment of the plan of development and a change of zone of their property. By stipulation, four members of a six member commission heard the matter. The four members split their vote evenly, two in favor of granting the change in zone and two opposed. The court, citing <em>Hall, </em>once again stated that, \u201c[t]his failure to grant the applications amounted to a denial of them.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Lupinacci </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">These cases fall short of interpreting the action of the commission in this case as a disapproval under the statute. They simply stand for the proposition that if a majority of votes is necessary for approval of a change of zone, the failure to secure such a majority means the application was denied. This is a far cry from the specific statutory mandate of \u00a7 8-26 which the Supreme Court strictly construed in <em>Carpenter, </em>and in <em>Finn </em>in the light of a clear legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Nor do we find the reasoning <em>o\u00ed Allard </em>v. <em>Thalheimer, </em>116 N.H. 299, 358 A.2d 395 (1976), persuasive. In that case, the plaintiff sought mandamus to compel the issuance of an approval of a subdivision plat under an automatic approval provision similar to the failure to act provision in the Connecticut statute. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that the planning board\u2019s letter, which stated that it would take no further action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>on eight lots included in the subdivision plat unless a dispute as to the minimum size of one lot was resolved, constituted a disapproval within the meaning of a statute requiring the planning board to approve or disapprove any subdivision plat within ninety days of its submission. The court vitiated the effect of its ruling when it stated succinctly: \u201cMatters would have been clearer if the board had disapproved the plat in so many words.\u201d Id., 301. Making matters \u201cclearer\u201d is exactly the purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 and the cases requiring strict compliance with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We conclude that the trial court was in error in finding that the defendant commission\u2019s action in this case constituted disapproval under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The case <em>o\u00ed Milford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 513, 518, 356 A.2d 109 (1975), sets forth the criteria for the issuance of a writ of mandamus as follows: \u201c \u2018The essential conditions without which the writ will not be issued to enforce the performance of a ministerial duty are: (1) that the party against whom the writ is sought must be under an obligation imposed by law to perform some such duty, that is, a duty in respect to the performance of which he may not exercise any discretion; (2) that the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right to have the duty performed; and (3) that there is no other sufficient remedy.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 366, 472 A.2d 336 (1984). This court has already determined that the defendant was under such a duty to issue the certificate of approval. The plaintiff has a clear legal right to the remedy. Finally, there is no other sufficient remedy. \u201cAn adequate remedy is one that \u2018enforces in some way the performance of the particular duty, and not merely a remedy which in the end saves the party to whom the duty is owed unharmed by its nonperformance.\u2019 \u201d Id. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the defendant commission cannot result in the expeditious, effective relief to which she is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In a similar automatic approval case, <em>State ex rel. Brooks </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 686, 690-91, 367 A.2d 692 (1976), the court stated: \u201c \u2018Any other relief, the existence of which will preclude the resort to the remedy by mandamus, must not only be adequate, but it must be specific, that is, it must be adapted to secure the desired result effectively, conveniently, completely and directly upon the very subject-matter involved.\u2019 . . . The subject action is an appropriate one for the application of that principle. Mandamus appears to be the only relief that will give the plaintiffs the specific remedy desired and that will be effective, convenient, complete and direct.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Mandamus was approved by the Supreme Court as the appropriate remedy in an action alleging automatic approval in <em>M &amp; L Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning &amp; Planning Commission, </em>187 Conn. 232, 445 A.2d 591 (1982); <em>Gervasi </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>184 Conn. 450, 440 A.2d 163 (1981) and <em>Viking Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 243, 435 A.2d 29 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">There is <em>error, </em>the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment ordering the defendant planning and zoning commission of the town of Wethersfield to issue a certificate of approval of the plaintiff\u2019s subdivision and to endorse the approval on the subdivision map as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or disapprove any subdivision . . . within the period of time permitted under section 8-26d. . . . The failure of the commission to act thereon shall be considered as an approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the commission on demand.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-26d provides that where a hearing is held by a planning commission on a subdivision application \u201c[a]ll decisions on such matters shall be rendered within sixty-five days after completion of such hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-10\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
