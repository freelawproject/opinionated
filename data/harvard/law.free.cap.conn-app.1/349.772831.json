Although the plaintiff must establish the probable cause for the validity of his claim and the amount of his damages in order to obtain an ex parte real estate attachment, in those cases in which the court ordering the original attachment erred, the plaintiff must then establish probable cause at the hearing. <em>Self-Service Sales Corporation </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>1 Conn. App. 188, 192, 470 A.2d 701 (1983); <em>Mullai </em>v. <em>Mullai, </em>1 Conn. App. 93, 94, 468 A.2d 1240 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The court erred in ordering the original attachment because the affidavit submitted was devoid of any allegations upon which the court could determine probable cause for the amount of damages sought. At the hearing to dissolve or modify the attachment, however, there was proof of such probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The hearing also provided evidence sufficient for the court to find probable cause for the maintenance of the plaintiffs cause of action. At such a hearing, the court is not to conduct a trial on the merits but is only to weigh the probabilities of success upon a full-scale trial. <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C.F. Wooding Co., </em>173 Conn. 426, 429, 378 A.2d 538 (1977). The trial court has broad discretion in finding probable cause and such a finding will not be overruled, absent clear error. <em>Michael Papa Associates </em>v. <em>Julian, </em>178 Conn. 446, 447, 423 A.2d 105 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 2 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> The application and affidavit of the plaintiff for a prejudgment remedy was brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e. The defendants moved to dissolve or modify the real estate attachment. After the hearing, the trial court reduced the ex parte attachment from $100,000 to $39,000, and allowed the defendants to substitute a surety bond in the amount of $39,000 in lieu of attachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
