Due to the mother\u2019s drug dependency, the child was in foster care from birth and was subsequently committed to the department of children and youth services in October, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">A petition to terminate parental rights was filed by the commissioner of the department of children and youth services in June, 1981. The mother contested the termination proceedings but failed to appear at seven of the eight scheduled hearings. At the final hearing on December 22,1981, the court denied a request from her attorney for a further-continuance and granted the termination petition. The trial court found that the state had proven that the mother had abandoned the child within the meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u00a7 17-43a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mother filed a motion to open the judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 326,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on January 21, 1982. This motion was scheduled for a hearing. Again the mother failed to appear. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The mother thereafter filed a motion to reargue her motion to open judgment. This was considered by the court and by the parties as a motion for a new trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied this motion. The respondent brought this appeal claiming error in the court\u2019s denial of her motions. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denyiug the mother\u2019s motions to open the judgment and for &amp;snew trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">^'petition for a new trial is addressed to the sound, \u00edegaf discretion of the trial court, and its action in granting or refusing such trial will not be reviewed or set Ugidyfty this court, unless it appears that the trial court hui^bgfsed the discretionary power confided to it, or hMrefused to exercise such power in a proper case, oig'hafe\u00e1jp'Some way erroneously misjudged as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>limits of such power. <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>190 Conn. 667, 669-70, 461 A.2d 1380 (1983); <em>Widman </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>96 Conn. 254, 259, 114 A. 77 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The respondent\u2019s petition for a new trial is based on the claim that she did not have a reasonable opportunity to appear and present her defense at the hearings due to her medical problems. The want of \u201ca reasonable opportunity to appear and defend\u201d is ground for a new trial only when the movant also establishes that \u201ca just defense in whole or in part existed\u201d to the ground for termination, the abandonment of her child. <em>See Bellonio </em>v. <em>Thomas Mortgage Co., </em>111 Conn. 103, 105, 149 A. 218 (1930). The respondent failed to prove that she did not have a reasonable opportunity to appear. The record describes the extraordinary efforts made by the court and her attorney to notify the respondent of the various court dates for the hearings. At the hearing on the motion to reargue, the respondent testified that she was attempting to overcome her drug abuse. This testimony was offered to support her claim that she had a defense to the state\u2019s petition. The trial court found that her continuous drug abuse did not constitute a valid defense because her drug problem was the very reason for the commitment of the child in 1980. On the evidence presented, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We further hold that the trial court\u2019s decision not to open the judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-212<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was not an abuse of discretion. The respondent posits that her constitutional right to due process was violated by the court's refusal to open and set aside the judgment because her absence at trial resulted in an inadequate presentation of her case and a default judgment was rendered against her. In its memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>dum of decision, the trial court stated that the judgment terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights was not a default judgment. The respondent had received notice, had appeared at the first hearing, and had been represented by counsel who appeared at the first hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Assuming arguendo, as did the trial court, that the judgment was rendered after a default for failure to appear, we hold that its decision not to open the judgment was not an abuse of discretion. In order to set aside a judgment passed upon default, there must be a showing (1) that a good defense existed at the time judgment was rendered, and (2) that the party seeking to set aside the judgment was prevented from appearing because of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. General Statutes \u00a7 52-212; <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 712, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983); <em>Kaplan &amp; Jellinghaus </em>v. <em>Newfield Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 290, 292, 426 A.2d 278 (1979). The trial court found that the respondent\u2019s failure to appear and assert a good defense was not the result of a mistake, accident or other reasonable cause but the result of her own negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The denial of a motion to open a default judgment is not an abuse of discretion where the failure to assert a defense was the result of the moving party\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
