A copy of the note was attached to the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant denied that the plaintiff had lent him money, but admitted that he had executed the note, and that it was genuine. By way of special defense, the defendant alleged that there was no consideration for the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The defendant claims, on appeal, that the complaint was treated as a cause of action by a holder of a promis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>sory note instead of as an action for money had and received. The trial was conducted by both parties as an action on a promissory note and not as an action for money had and received. The transcript is replete with statements of the defendant\u2019s counsel that the plaintiff brought suit on a note, with the defense being lack of consideration for the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The trial court found that the plaintiff lent the defendant $60,000 in August of 1977, that the plaintiff, as a holder of the note,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was entitled to recover on the note,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the note of $60,000 was given in payment of an antecedent debt, negating any necessity for the plaintiff to prove consideration for the note,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the plaintiff was entitled to interest and attorney\u2019s fees as provided in the note. These findings and conclusions were supported by the evidence and comported with the theory of the case as tried. See <em>Falker </em>v. <em>Samperi, </em>190 Conn. 412, 427, 461 A.2d 681 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The implications of the allegations of the complaint were that the plaintiff was the holder of the note, and that she did not specifically have to allege delivery, ownership or possession of the note. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 464, 470-71, 356 A.2d 176 (1975). There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>no material variance between the allegations and the proof which would warrant a reversal. <em>Strimiska </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>158 Conn. 179, 183, 257 A.2d 814 (1969). The defendant was not misled or prejudiced in the maintenance of his special defense, which was lack of consideration, and, therefore, any variance is immaterial. <em>Saphir </em>v. <em>Neustadt, </em>177 Conn. 191, 208, 413 A.2d 843 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusions were reasonable and were not clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391-92, 441 A.2d 629 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 2 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\"> The trial court held \u201calternatively\u201d that the plaintiff was a holder in due course of a promissory note executed by the defendant. This was an alternative basis and not the primary basis for the court\u2019s judgment for the plaintiff. The issue is not considered on appeal because of that fact and because the decision of this court makes it unnecessary to review this claim of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\"> The defendant conceded that if the plaintiff is entitled to recover on the promissory note, she is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, and further conceded in oral argument that if attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable, the sum awarded by the trial court was not excessive. The decision of this court makes it unnecessary to review this claim of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\"> The note provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">\u201con demand, for value received, the undersigned hereby promises to pay to the order of Else Mayer at her home on Route 32, North Franklin, Connecticut, or at such other place which the Holder of this Note may designate in writing, the principal sum of sixty thousand ($60,000.00) dollars, with interest from August 25,1977, at the rate of Six per centum (6%) per annum on the unpaid balance of this Note, together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>all taxes levied on or assessed on said sum or on this Note, and all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in any action brought to collect this Note, said principal and interest due and payable on April 21, 1980.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b178-11\"> \u201c \u2018Holder\u2019 means a person who is in possession of a document of title or an instrument or a certificated investment security drawn, issued or endorsed to him or to his order or to bearer or in blank.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-201 (20).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b178-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-307 (2) provides: \u201cWhen signatures are admitted . . . production of the instrument entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense.\u201d Since the trial court concluded that no defense existed, it was not necessary under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-307 (3) for the plaintiff to establish that she was \u201cin all respects a holder in due course.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-408 provides that no consideration is necessary for an instrument given in payment of an antecedent obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
