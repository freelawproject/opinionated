A warrant for the arrest of the defendant for violation of probation was issued and a hearing held thereon. The trial court concluded that probation was violated and sentenced the defendant to incarceration. The defendant appealed from that judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The state claims that the arrest warrant specified two grounds for violation of probation: failure to make restitution in accordance with the schedule of payments and failure of the defendant to keep appointments with his probation officer. The warrant was not part of the record on appeal. Whether the warrant was two-pronged is irrelevant, however, since the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision makes it clear that probation was revoked \u201c[bjecause of the defendant\u2019s complete lack of cooperation with his probation officer in making the restitution payments . . . .\u2019\u2019At the time of the hearing, the defendant, who had been ordered to pay $2260, was $540 in arrears, with nine months of his probation left.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The trial judge committed the defendant \u201cuntil restitution of $630 or 6 months whichever occurs sooner.\u201d The court later revised the arrearage to $540. The state concedes that the conditional part of the sentence was illegal. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendant appeals from the judgment revoking his probation and ordering his incarceration, claiming that imposition of the full sentence constituted an abuse of discretion and a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The case of <em>Bearden </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983), is dispositive. The state conceded on oral argument that if the trial judge based revocation of probation on the failure to make restitution, then <em>Bearden </em>would control.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires that a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay restitution in a revocation proceeding. \u201cIf the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to pay, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>may revoke probation and sentence the defendant to imprisonment within the authorized range of its sentencing authority. If the probationer could not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to do so, the court must consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment. Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the State\u2019s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay.\u201d Id., 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">No appropriate finding was made in this case nor were alternate punishments reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\"> This appeal was originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court.
