During the trial, corporation counsel for the city of Waterbury was allowed to testify on the history of art. XXXIII, \u00a7 12 of the collective bargaining agreement between the city and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Local 1339 International Association of Firefighters, AFL\u2014CIO. The trial court admitted the evidence. Judgment was rendered for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The facts can be summarized as follows: The plaintiff had been a regular member of the fire department until he sustained injuries during the course of his employment which prevented him from discharging his duties as a firefighter. The defendant Waterbury retirement board (board) granted the plaintiff a disability pension equal to 58 percent of his annual pay. The board granted the pension pursuant to division 2, \u00a7 2746 of the Waterbury city charter and article XXXIII, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The plaintiff assigns as error the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting the testimony of corporation counsel on the historical background of article XXXIII, \u00a7 12. The first sentence of \u00a7 12 provides that \u201c[t]he parties hereto agree that, effective as of July 1, 1977, any provision to the contrary notwithstanding, an employee who applies for, and receives, a disability pension . . . shall be entitled to and shall receive, a maximum disability pension of seventy-six per cent (76%) of \u2018annual pay.\u2019 \u201d According to the plaintiff, this section mandates that the board grant him, as a qualified employee, a pension equal to 76 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">During the trial the defendants offered the testimony of corporation counsel who had negotiated municipal contracts for the defendant city with the union representing the employee bargaining groups. He testified as to the intention of the parties in negotiating article XXXIII, \u00a7 12 and discussed division 2, \u00a7 2746 of the Waterbury city charter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is not referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to in \u00a7 12. The plaintiff contends that corporation counsel should have been barred from interjecting the issue of the effect of \u00a7 2746 on \u00a7 12 because the defendants, in their answer, admitted paragraph 3 of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint which stated: \u201cAt all times mentioned herein, pension agreements between the City of Waterbury and the plaintiff were governed by a 1977-1980 Written Agreement between the City of Waterbury, Connecticut, and Local 1339 International Association of Firefighters, AFL-CIO.\u201d The defendants argue that they never admitted that the pension agreements in question were governed exclusively by \u00a7 12 and, furthermore, the failure of the plaintiff to object to the admissibility of \u00a7 2746 on this ground precludes appellate review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will not consider a claim which was neither ruled upon nor decided by the trial court adversely to the moving party. See <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 505 n.14, 442 A.2d 911 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The remainder of the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that since \u00a7 12 stands by itself, it is not necessary to read it with other provisions of the city charter nor is evidence necessary for an interpretation of \u00a7 12. We do not agree. The ruling of the trial court admitting the testimony on the historical background of \u00a7 12 was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201cParol evidence is admissible (1) to explain an ambiguity appearing in the instrument; (2) to prove a collateral oral agreement which does not vary the terms of the writing; (3) to add a missing term in a writing which indicates on its face that it does not set forth the complete agreement; (4) to show mistake or fraud.\u201d <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 56, 553 A.2d 771 (1983); <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>171 Conn. 177, 194-95, 368 A.2d 44 (1976) <em>(Cotter, J., </em>dissenting). The parol evidence was received in order to resolve the ambiguity as to the intent the parties meant to express by the phrase \u201cshall be entitled to and shall receive a maximum disability pension of seventy-six percent of annual pay.\u201d See <em>Ruscito </em>v. <em>F-Dyne Electronics Co., </em>177 Conn. 149, 160, 411 A.2d 1371 (1979); <em>John Arborio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scapin, </em>121 Conn. 492, 498, 186 A. 488 (1936). Such evidence may properly be received to show the meaning of the word or words, as understood by the parties at the time the contract was entered into, and the meaning which may be given to them when used in connection with the particular circumstances. <em>Fairfield Lease Corporation </em>v. <em>Eastern Sportswear Co., </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 347, 351, 273 A.2d 300 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The testimony elicited regarding the historical development of \u00a7 12 set forth the minimum parameter for disability pensions which had been included in \u00a7 2746. The evidence was necessary because the term \u201cmaximum\u201d as used in \u00a7 12 did not refer to a minimum amount and the evidence clarified any ambiguity in the first sentence of \u00a7 12. The term \u201cmaximum\u201d in its ordinary meaning<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sets an upper limit of 76 percent which the board may not exceed in awarding a disability pension. The board had discretion to award a disability pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>sion of 58 percent to the plaintiff. We hold that the testimony was properly admitted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\"> The appeal was originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court.
