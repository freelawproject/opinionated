In a bill of particulars, the state alleged that the defendant, while armed with a knife, had entered an apartment in New Milford with the intent to commit a sexual assault therein. Once inside he compelled the female occupant to engage in both vaginal and oral sexual intercourse by the use of force and threat of force against her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Plea bargaining did not initially result in a disposition of the case. On October 2, 1979, with the agreement of all parties, a presentence investigation and report was ordered. On February 26,1980, counsel met in the trial judge\u2019s chambers at which time the case was set down for plea and sentence on February 28, 1980. The defendant\u2019s counsel submitted a detailed sentencing memorandum to the court urging a suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>sentence with successful compliance with a religiously-affiliated program known as the \u201cLighthouse\u201d program to be a special condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">On February 28,1980, the defendant pleaded guilty to a substitute information charging him with one count of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a. The state made no recommendation regarding sentencing. The assistant state\u2019s attorney then recounted the facts of the offense. She stated that the defendant and the victim lived in the same apartment building. When the victim returned home from church, she was accosted by the defendant who was wearing a ski mask and a nylon stocking over his face. The defendant threatened her with a knife, made her undress, blindfolded her with her own dress and had sexual contact with her. These events went on for approximately thirty minutes. Upon further inquiry by the court, the assistant state\u2019s attorney stated that, if the case went to trial, the victim would testify that penetration had occurred. The assistant state\u2019s attorney also alluded to a statement made by the defendant in which he admitted that he fondled the victim\u2019s breasts and \u201cperformed oral-genital sex to a fair degree.\u201d This was in fact corroborated by the victim\u2019s statement. The assistant state\u2019s attorney indicated that the state would have difficulty proving penetration because no medical tests were performed on the victim, who had taken a bath immediately after the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The defendant expressly admitted all of the facts of the offense as recited above except the part about vaginal intercourse. He admitted that he had fondled the victim, but claimed that he had had second thoughts and had stopped before intercourse occurred. The trial judge then accepted the defendant\u2019s plea, finding that there was an adequate factual basis. The judge stated that he had read both the presentence report and the sentencing memorandum prior to the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The sentencing took place immediately after the plea. The defendant spoke on his own behalf. Under questioning by the court, he again denied penetration but admitted that the victim had requested that he wear a condom and when she could not find one he permitted her to insert a diaphragm. The court indicated on two occasions that the defendant did not deny intercourse prior to the date of the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">At sentencing, the court emphasized the seriousness of the offense, even by the defendant\u2019s own account. It found strong evidence of premeditation and a strong inference of sexual intercourse. The court then stated that the defendant\u2019s denial of intercourse undercut a timely rehabilitative effort. The court then imposed a sentence of not less then two or more than four years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The defendant then moved for a hearing to reconsider the sentence claiming that the court had improperly considered the disputed evidence of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>vaginal sexual intercourse had occurred. The court denied the motion and ruled that it did not have the power to reconsider the sentence imposed and that even if it did have such power, it would not exercise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The question of whether there was a factual basis for the plea is twofold: (1) that the definition of sexual contact in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (3) requires that the other person be not married to the actor; and (2) that, under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-67 (b), it is an affirmative defense that the defendant and the alleged victim were living together by mutual consent in a relationship of cohabitation. Since no such affirmative defense was made by the defendant, we do not consider this prong of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">On appeal, the defendant now claims for the first time that there was no factual basis establishing that the parties were not married to each other.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 713 provides: \u201cThe judicial authority shall not accept a plea of guilty unless he is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Guilty pleas have been invali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>dated in those cases where the facts to which the defendant assented on the record failed to reveal all the elements of the crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>180 Conn. 702, 704-705, 433 A.2d 988 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 343-45, 387 A.2d 550 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 535, 290 A.2d 332 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In this case the state claims that there is on the record sufficient information from which to establish a factual basis for the guilty plea. Prior to the acceptance of the plea, the assistant state\u2019s attorney stated that \u201cthe victim of the crime and Mr. Huey <em>and his family </em>live in the same apartment building in New Milford, Connecticut.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The bill of particulars reveals that the victim and the defendant did not share the same surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Were this not sufficient, the court could rely on other sources of information available to it. The court stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 346, that: \u201cThe fact that the record reveals inadequate factual support for either plea in no way suggests that further facts, properly submitted to a court or jury, could not support a conviction for the crimes charged. That question is not now before this court. The only issues decided concern the sufficiency of the facts before the court at the time the pleas were entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">An evidentiary hearing is not required on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea \u201cif the record of the plea proceeding and other information <em>in the court </em>file conclusively establishes that the motion is without merit. See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 213, 215, 93 S. Ct. 1461, 36 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1973).\u201d (Emphasis added.) State v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 265, 460 A.2d 970 (1983), quoting State v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The court had before it and read both the presentence report and the defendant\u2019s sentencing memorandum at the time of the plea. The defendant\u2019s sentencing memorandum, prepared by his counsel, specifically mentioned his wife and two children and stated that the defendant enjoyed a happy marriage. The memorandum stated that the same pastor assisted both the defendant and the victim and their respective spouses subsequent to the crime. There are numerous other references to the defendant\u2019s family in the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Evidence known to the judge both from the record and from the file conclusively established the factual basis for the plea. The defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">On May 15, 1980, the defendant moved for a hearing to reconsider the sentence which the court denied after a hearing on May 28, 1980.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">There is strong authority that the trial court had residual power to alter the indefinite sentence imposed upon the defendant. \u201c[A] sentence in'a criminal case may be modified at any time during the term of court at which it was imposed, if no act has been done in exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cution of it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 123, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>119 Conn. 70, 74, 174 A. 74 (1934). The record before us does not furnish any basis for determining what steps, if any, the defendant may have taken after sentencing that would negate this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The defendant\u2019s sentence was stayed by taking the appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 946; General Statutes \u00a7 54-95. Practice Book \u00a7 934 provides for reductions in definite sentences; \u00a7 935 provides for the correction of an illegal sentence within 90 days. Neither section applies in this case since the sentence was indefinite and not illegal. We need not decide this issue, however, since the court\u2019s ruling, if erroneous, is harmless error since, as the court indicated, the claimed error could not possibly have changed its decision. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 196-97, 435 A.2d 3 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly considered evidence of the defendant\u2019s having penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina is essentially a claim that the sentence is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The trial court carefully considered the direct and inferential evidence as well the defendant\u2019s earlier statement to the effect that sexual intercourse did take place. In denying the defendant\u2019s request for a suspended sentence and conditional probation, the court quite properly considered the defendant\u2019s refusal to admit to penetrating the victim, in the face of what the court felt was strong evidence of sexual intercourse, as indicative of a lack of a rehabilitative effort on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In any event, it has long been the law in Connecticut that an appellate court will not review the proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion in sentencing a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ant within the statutory limits for the offense charged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 119, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>173 Conn. 545, 558, 378 A.2d 588 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The defendant claims, without citing authority in his brief, that the sentence was improper. A sentencing judge is not bound to a strict adherence to the rules of evidence which apply at a trial. The court exercises wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence which it may consider. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 556, 100 S. Ct. 1358, 63 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1980); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>147 Conn. 125, 128, 157 A.2d 594 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>LaPorta, </em>140 Conn. 610, 612, 102 A.2d 885 (1954); <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Allen, </em>140 Conn. 39, 44, 97 A.2d 890 (1953); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cuchelow, </em>128 Conn. 323, 324, 22 A.2d 780 (1941); see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 585, 79 S. Ct. 421, 3 L. Ed. 2d 516, reh. denied, 359 U.S. 956, 79 S. Ct. 737, 3 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1959) (hearsay); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cifarelli, </em>401 F.2d 512, 514 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 987, 89 S. Ct. 465, 21 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1968) (evidence of other crimes for which defendant had been neither tried nor convicted.) Our statutes also recognize the wide range of information which the sentencing court should consider. General Statutes \u00a7 54-91a (c) provides, in part, that a presentence investigation should consider the circumstances of the offense, the attitude of the victim, and the criminal record, social history, and present condition of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence was excessive properly belongs before the sentence review division.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 51-194 et seq. The defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence was improper is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In this opinion Testo, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-16\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.

I\u2019ll permit you to speak afterwards, but I just have some more information I want to get.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">\u201cYour counsel\u2019s presentence memorandum, sentencing memorandum, Mr. Huey makes reference to, in discussing the lack of evidence of actual sexual intercourse, penetration, to the fact that apparently the victim at some point before the intercourse, what she claims was the intercourse, requested that you wear a condom. Apparently there was a search for one, and then she went and inserted the diaphragm. Now, that doesn\u2019t appear in the presentence report, that appears in your counsel\u2019s statement in your behalf. Is that true?</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">\u201cMr. Huey: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">\u201cMr. Gill: Your Honor, it appears in her statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">\u201cThe Court: It appears in her statement. It found its way from her statement into the presentence reference you submitted, and that\u2019s how I became aware of it because it doesn\u2019t appear in the presentence report. The presentence report simply says according to the victim there was penetration, there was sexual intercourse which the defendant denies. What happened about that, how did that happen?</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">\u201cMr. Huey: I don\u2019t understand the question, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the report says that there was a search for a condom and she put in a diaphragm, tell me what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">\u201cMr. Huey: Well, she wanted me to use condoms, and she told me where they were at, and I said that I didn\u2019t know where they were at. She asked me if she could search for them, and I allowed her to, and she looked and she couldn\u2019t find them. An then she said, \u2018May I wear a diaphragm?\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>I told her, yes, she could. So she got her diaphragm out of a drawer and inserted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201cThe Court: And then what happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">\u201cMr. Huey: Uhm\u2014She laid back down; I fondled her a little bit more; and I got second thoughts about what I was doing, and began to feel guilty, and so I left.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\u201cThe Court: But you are aware that she said that sexual intercourse took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">\u201cMr. Huey: Yes sir, I\u2019m aware of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Gill, you made a reference in your last presentation to the presentence report saying that the defendant is guilt ridden.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">\u201cMr. Gill: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">\u201cThe Court: Can you direct me to that in the presentence report, I don\u2019t find it, maybe I overlooked it.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">\u201cMr. Gill: It\u2019s on page five, your Honor. The top sentence, the defendant appears to have remorseful or guilt ridden \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">\u201cMr. Gill: It also appeared in his statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Is there anything you want to add further? You wanted to say something.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">\u201cMr. Gill: Your Honor made reference to the other visits in the home. My observation of the ease, it seemed to be a fantasy building up over a long time. Without anymore details than that because I don\u2019t think it benefits anybody to elaborate on them. But I think he\u2019s put his cards on the table, he\u2019s made a complete open statement as to his total involvement here. I think that the truth is known to the Court, as the Court\u2019s function to find it. And I remain at the position that I think it\u2019s a reasonable and viable alternative to incarceration for him at this juncture in his young life to stay in close proximity to his family and receive the benefits from so many others similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">\u201cThe Court: Anything further you wish to say, Mr. Huey?</p>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">\u201cMr. Huey: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-20\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. I recognize from what the State\u2019s Attorney has said that apparently there were possible legal impediments to a conviction in this case. Based on the fact that apparently there was some question about the confession, and there would have been some difficulty in linking the defendant to the offense absent the confession. I recognize also that there certainly had to be a significant risk that the defendant would have been convicted of the more serious offense and it seems to me that the reduction of the charge from the first degree sexual assault and burglary in the first degree to one count of sexual assault in the third degree essentially gives the defendant the full benefit of those questions and the risks to the State in not having the defendant convicted and the risk to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>in avoiding the conviction of the more serious charges. I don\u2019t question the effectiveness of the Roloff Enterprise\u2019s program. It seems to me for a lot of people it\u2019s obviously been very good, and it may very well be very good for a rehabilitative program for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\u201cThere are two things that point me in another direction. The first is the seriousness of the crime. The seriousness of the crime even by the defendant\u2019s version. And by the defendant\u2019s, I\u2019ll give him credit at least for being candid today about him being in the bedroom before the incident, and then being there again two weeks after the incident. Whether out of fantasy or not, certainly it was a fantasy that had become reality in which he was acting out and making very real.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\u201cThe other thing that concerns me is something that I find very troubling about the whole notion of the defendant\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate himself. And that is, it is very difficult for me to accept the defendant\u2019s version that there was no sexual intercourse here. The victim says that there was. True, there was no medical evidence to corroborate that, that\u2019s not a requirement of law. The circumstantial facts which the defendant has admitted to and which are there very clearly create in my mind more strongly the inference that there was sexual intercourse here, in addition to the fondling, in addition to the oral-genital contact which the defendant has admitted and corroborates the victim\u2019s version. And that unwillingness or inability to admit to himself or yourself what seems to me from what\u2019s been presented here, undercuts in my mind a truly rehabilitative effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\u201cIt also, by another statement that the defendant made, apparently to the presentence report, in which he says that he disclaims that there was any extensive part of premeditation on his part. If he was there before; if you put on a mask, as I gather, two masks, a mask and a nylon stocking; had a knife; knew the person; permitted her to insert a diaphragm; search for a condom, the inference I draw there is that she was afraid of pregnancy by a rapist or venereal disease or both. That belies to me the defendant\u2019s position today, and in the presentence report that he didn\u2019t have premeditation, and that he, once he was in the apartment, he didn\u2019t think he would actually carry out the offense. I also note, and there is some discrepancy from what he said today, but at least the offender\u2019s version after the victim\u2019s version is given in which the statement is made there was sexual intercourse, the following notation appears, Huey did allow that the instant offense evolved as noted above. There is no denial here. Of course this report was back in November, I gather, some time around there. There is no denial that there was sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\u201cBased on all those factors, based on the seriousness of the crime, which I think is a very serious crime; based on the need for punishment, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>will carry, I think two bases to it. It will punish the defendant for his conduct, and it will, I think, to some extent, serve to deter he and others similarly situated in committing crimes like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">\u201cI\u2019m going to reject the defendant\u2019s request. And I cannot look at it, although there are untraditional aspects to this case, there are also some very conventional aspects to this case.

I agree with the majority in its conclusions as to the three issues raised by the defendant. I do not, however, agree with the reasoning of the majority which led it to conclude that the sentence imposed by the trial court was proper. It is my view, contrary to that of the majority, that a sentencing court may not consider, in its determination of an appropriate sentence for a defendant, the failure of a defendant to admit he is guilty of an element of a crime to which he has not pleaded guilty and with which he was not ultimately charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The defendant was orignally charged with the offense of sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, and with the offense of burglary in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101. Subsequently, the defendant pleaded guilty to a substitute information charging him with one count of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse ...\u201d whereas General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when such person compels another person to submit to sexual contact . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>During the course of taking the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and during the course of the sentencing which immediately followed the acceptance of the guilty plea, the defendant refused to admit to the court that sexual intercourse had taken place. Counsel for the defendant, during the sentencing hearing, urged that the defendant receive a suspended sentence and probation, the condition of which was to be successful completion of a rehabilitative program. The trial court stated that there were two things \u201cwhich pointed ... in another direction.\u201d The first was the seriousness of the crime and the second was that the defendant had made no effort to rehabilitate himself by admitting that sexual intercourse had taken place. The court stated that \u201cit is very difficult for me to accept the defendant\u2019s version that there was no sexual intercourse here.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The defendant claims that the court erred in imposing a sentence based upon alleged criminal behavior which was not proscribed by the statute to which the defendant pleaded guilty. The majority of this court views this claim as being a complaint that the sentence was excessive. I disagree. The issue posed here is not whether the sentence was excessive but whether certain minimal due process standards attach to sentencing hearings which would preclude the sentencing court from considering, in its quest for an appropriate sentence, the fact that the defendant persisted in his claim of innocence as to an element of a crime to which he had not pleaded guilty and with which he was ultimately not charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Although an appellate court will not review the proper exercise of a trial court\u2019s discretion to fix a sentence which is within the statutory limits of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>for which the defendant is being sentenced; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 119, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); recent decisional trends cast doubt on whether that discretion is unfettered by any guarantee of due process. The case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949), is the apex of the absolute no-due-process-at-sentencing rule since it approved the use of presentence reports by sentencing courts, regardless of whether such reports contained hearsay, and regardless of the opportunity of the defendant to rebut any such hearsay statements. In a more recent case, <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S. Ct. 1197, 51 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1977), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the sentencing process should satisfy some due process requirements in cases involving capital punishment. Legal scholars generally agree that the logic of <em>Gardner </em>should be extended to other types of cases and that certain basic due process principles should govern sentencing procedures. Nemerson, \u201cCoercive Sentencing,\u201d 64 Minn. L. Rev. 669, 740-750 (1980); Fennell &amp; Hall, \u201cDue Process at Sentencing; An Empirical and Legal Analysis of the Disclosure of Presentence Reports in Federal Courts,\u201d 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1615 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">A sentencing hearing, following a guilty plea, is, to the particular defendant, the only really critical stage of the criminal proceedings. A total dichotomy should not exist between the due process procedures required of the state to prove a defendant guilty and the lack of any due process procedures at a sentencing hearing. It may be appropriate at sentencing for a trial judge to attempt to coerce statements from a defendant about the particular crime in order to gain additional information about it for law enforcement officials and to fix a higher sentence for defendants who do not provide such information than for those who do. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Liddy, </em>397 F. Sup. 947, 951 (D.D.C. 1975); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>544 F.2d 681, 682-83 (3d Cir. 1976). Furthermore, there is no impropriety in examining, for the purposes of sentencing, a wide range of information such as the circumstances of the offense, the attitude of the victim, and the criminal record, social history and present condition of the defendant. General Statutes \u00a7 54-91a (c). I do not agree, however, that it is appropriate, during sentencing, to seek an admission of guilt of a crime of a higher degree of criminality than the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced, under the guise of testing the defendant\u2019s repentence or his potential for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">To force the admission of guilt, at a sentencing which follows a guilty plea, of a crime with which the defendant is not charged might jeopardize the defendant\u2019s rights in the future, either in connection with a retrial or with an independent trial claiming civil rights violations. See <em>Haring </em>v. <em>Prosise, </em>462 U.S. 306, 103 S. Ct. 2368, 76 L. Ed. 2d 595, 603-604 (1983); <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America </em>v. <em>United States, </em>330 U.S. 395, 412, 67 S. Ct. 775, 91 L. Ed. 973 (1947); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Broome, </em>628 F.2d 403, 404-405 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">A trial court should not consider, at sentencing, facts which underlie counts which were dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain. <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>108 Cal. App. 3d 9, 16, 166 Cal. Rptr. 131 (1980). It should not make inquiry into whether the defendant intends to appeal the conviction since that inquiry gives rise to the inference that the severity of the sentence rests upon the defendant\u2019s response. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>State, </em>13 Md. App. 105, 113, 281 A.2d 421 (1971), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 978, 93 S. Ct. 306, 34 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1972). After a verdict of guilty, a defendant may continue to assert his innocence and should not be penalized for doing so at a sentencing hearing. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>533 F.2d 214, 216 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>People </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>95 Ill. App. 3d 680, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>687, 420 N.E.2d 592 (1981). A defendant\u2019s assertions of innocence at his sentencing hearing, after a trial finding him guilty, should not result in a greater penalty, even if the sentencing court believes that he is lying about his innocence. <em>Poteet </em>v. <em>Fauver, </em>517 F.2d 393, 395 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>498 F.2d 302, 312-13 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 F.2d 941, 945-46 (5th Cir. 1966). A defendant may not be disadvantaged in the sentence rendered because of the trial court\u2019s disbelief in the defendant\u2019s answers to the court\u2019s questions regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to confess fully to other criminal behavior unrelated to the particular crime for which he is being sentenced. <em>People </em>v. <em>Westerfield, </em>71 Mich. App. 618, 625, 248 N.W. 2d 641 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The defendant in the present case should not have been asked to admit an element of a crime with which he was not charged. To do so was to exact a price from him for exercising his constitutional right to force the state to prove him guilty of sexual assault in the first degree. He chose not to plead guilty to that crime and the state chose not to proceed with a trial for that offense. When the state elected to file a substitute information charging him with the lesser offense of sexual assault in the third degree and he chose to plead guilty to the lesser offense, the trial court was then precluded from attempting, during sentencing, to obtain an admission of guilt of the greater crime. The failure of the defendant to admit that he had sexual intercourse with the victim does not necessarily indicate his reluctance to be restored to a crime-free life. It is equally indicative of his own belief in his own innocence of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Although it is my opinion that the trial court should not have tainted its sentence with the inference that a persistence by the defendant that he was innocent of the crime with which he was originally charged would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>result in a heavier sentence, I find that the sentence should not be disturbed. The sentence, on the facts of this case, was warranted even without a belief of the trial court in the defendant\u2019s desire for rehabilitation. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>supra.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> The presentence report is somewhat contradictory. It states that the victim claimed that sexual intercourse had occurred but that the defendant denied it. The report also notes, after giving the victim\u2019s version, that the defendant \u201cdid allow that the instant offense evolved as noted above.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
