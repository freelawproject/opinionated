On August 20,1981, the defendant was arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant for three illegal sales of drugs to a confidential informant which had taken place in the defendant\u2019s automobile. At the time of the arrest the defendant was driving his automobile and had come to Connecticut from New York to participate in a contemplated fourth transaction, the sale of marijuana. The police had set up the transaction using the informant. On the floor in the front of the car was a brown paper bag. After the defendant was placed under arrest the police took the automobile to the police station and made an inventory search of it which disclosed that the paper bag contained marijuana. The police then prepared and obtained from a judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a warrant for the search and seizure of the automobile, and also had the court issue an in rem summons to the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g to show cause why the automobile should not be adjudged a nuisance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">After a hearing, the court granted the state\u2019s in rem motion, declared the automobile a nuisance and ordered it disposed of under General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g. The defendant appealed claiming that the court erred in granting the motion because the scope of in rem proceedings under General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g is limited to seizures pursuant to a warrant and the seizure here preceded the issuance of the warrant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g (a) provides for in rem confiscation of property only \u201c[w]hen, pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of section 54-33a, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>property has been seized,\u201d and it further provides that \u201cthe judge or court issuing the warrant shall\u201d summon the owner and other appropriate parties to a hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a (b) (1) provides for the issuance of search and seizure warrants for \u201cany property (1) possessed, controlled, designed or intended for use or which is or has been used or which may be used as the means of committing any criminal offense.\u201d The purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g is \u201cto exercise the sovereign power to forfeit property shown to have been involved in an illegal enterprise.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bucchieri, </em>176 Conn. 339, 348, 407 A.2d 990 (1978). \u201cAs a general rule, forfeiture is not favored, and statutes providing for forfeiture are strictly construed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 1936 Model Ford Deluxe V-8 Coach, </em>307 U.S. 219, 226, 59 S. Ct. 861, 864, 83 L. Ed. 1249 (1939).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>One 1977 Cadillac, Etc., </em>644 F.2d 500, 501 (5th Cir. 1981); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Certain Contraceptive Materials, </em>126 Conn. 428, 431, 11 A.2d 863 (1940); <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1960 Mercury Station Wagon, </em>5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 1, 10, 240 A.2d 99 (1968); 36 Am. Jur. 2d, Forfeiture and Penalties \u00a7 8. This is particularly so because, although not the case here, forfeiture statutes such as General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g apply to innocent owners of the property as well as those with knowledge of the illegal enterprise. <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Alexandrovicz, 112 </em>Conn. 618, 625, 153 A. 786 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It is clear that this statute, read strictly, as it must be, requires that the issuance of the warrant, pursuant to which the property sought to be confiscated is seized, precede the seizure and that the seizure take place pursuant to that warrant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bucchieri, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-8), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 551, 559, 421 A.2d 867 (1980). This is in contrast with other statutes which have in the past permitted retrospective seizure warrants as the initial step in the in rem process. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Verilli, </em>132 Conn. 46, 42 A.2d 338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(1945) (construing then \u00a7 740g of the 1943 Supplement to the General Statutes, now repealed); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosarbo, </em>2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 399, 199 A.2d 575 (1963) (construing then General Statutes \u00a7 53-279, now repealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u201cThe word \u2018seizures\u2019 in the Fourth Amendment has, in the main, not been a source of difficulty. The \u2018act of physically taking and removing tangible personal property is generally a \u201cseizure.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 2.1 (a), p. 221; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 291-92, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982) (seizure of a person takes place \u201conly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d). \u201c[Sjtopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute[s] a \u2018seizure\u2019 within the meaning of [the fourth and fourteenth] Amendments, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 59 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979). We see nothing in General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g to indicate that its use of the word \u201cseized\u201d means any more or less than the meaning of that term in fourth amendment parlance. \u201c \u2018Pursuant to\u2019 is defined as \u2018acting or done in consequence or in prosecution (of anything); hence, agreeable; conformable; following; according.\u2019 \u201d <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>301 U.S. 379, 383, 57 S. Ct. 813, 81 L. Ed. 1169 (1937). Thus, the automobile here was seized when the police took it to the police station, and that seizure was not pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court, was transferred in 1982 to the Supreme Court and was, thereafter, transferred to this court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, J2(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g (a) provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cWhen, pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of section 54-33a, any property has been seized, which the state claims to be a nuisance and desires to have destroyed or disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this section, the judge or court issuing the warrant shall\u201d summon the owner to appear and show cause why the property should not be \u201cajudged a nuisance and ordered to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as herein provided.\u201d Subsection (c) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f the judge or court finds . . . that the property has been . . . used, with intent to violate . . . the criminal laws of this state, he shall render judgment that such property is a nuisance\u201d and order it disposed of in accordance with the remaining provisions of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> Although the warrant is dated August 20,1981, the testimony indicated that this was incorrect and that the warrant was obtained on August 21, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\"> Although the state conceded at oral argument in this court that this warrant was never executed, it attempted by an unusual postargument submission, to which the defendant objected, to convince us that the warrant was executed. Since in our view the automobile was \u201cseized\u201d prior to the issuance of the warrant; see text, infra; this dispute is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
