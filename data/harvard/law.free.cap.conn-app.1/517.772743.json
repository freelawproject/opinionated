On appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant claims that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>erred (1) in denying parts of his motion for discovery; (2) in denying his motion to dismiss; and (3) in ruling that certain evidence was not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">None of the items requested in the motion for discovery and denied by the court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is discoverable as of right. See Practice Book \u00a7 741. Section 745 of the Practice Book permits additional disclosure in the court\u2019s discretion, but only upon a showing of good cause. The defendant did not make this showing. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The second issue raised by the defendant concerns the denial of his motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Practice Book \u00a7 815 (4). The defendant argues that his \u201carrest\u201d was invalid because the state trooper was not in uniform and displayed no badge identifying himself as a trooper. Even if this were so, it would not bar prosecution of the defendant or be a defense to a valid conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>191 Conn. 433, 438, 465 A.2d 323 (1983). Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 14-237 defines the crossing of a median divider on a highway as an infraction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 51-164n (a) in relevant part states: \u201cA summons for the commission of an infraction shall not be deemed to be an arrest . . . .\u201d In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (31) requires an officer to be in uniform or display a badge when the officer is making an arrest. In the present case, the state trooper\u2019s siren and flashing headlights were on when he stopped the defendant. Even though the officer was not in uniform, he displayed to the defendant his state police identification card. We conclude that the defendant was not arrested but was merely given an infraction complaint for crossing the median divider.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The defendant next challenges the court\u2019s ruling that testimony by the officer as to his occupation is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>hearsay. That testimony was not an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gunther, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 504, 506, 466 A.2d 804 (1983); Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 93a. The trial court was correct in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-18\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-237 states: \u201cWhen any highway has been divided into two roadways by leaving an intervening space or by a physical barrier or clearly indicated dividing section, each vehicle shall be driven only upon the right-hand roadway and no vehicle shall be driven over or across any such dividing space, barrier or section, except through an opening or at a crossover or intersection established by public authority. <em>Violation of any provision of this section shall be an infraction. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-19\"> This appeal was originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court.
