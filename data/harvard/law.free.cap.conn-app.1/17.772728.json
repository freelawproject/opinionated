We hold that the plaintiff is not aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Rose Urrata left one child, Joseph Urrata. The plaintiff is Joseph\u2019s former wife and his judgment creditor pursuant to a judgment for alimony and child support arrearages. After Rose\u2019s death but prior to the filing of her will for probate, the plaintiff filed a judgment lien against Joseph\u2019s purported interest<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in real estate owned by Rose. Rose\u2019s will left $1 to Joseph, small legacies to the plaintiff\u2019s children, and the residue of her estate, consisting primarily of her former residence, to Joseph\u2019s child by his present wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The Probate Court allowed the plaintiff to contest the will and, after a hearing, admitted the will. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court. The defendant, the administrator of Rose\u2019s estate, moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the plaintiff is not aggrieved. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and the plaintiff appeals, claiming aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Aggrievement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal from a decree of a Probate Court. <em>Lenge </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>169 Conn. 218, 220-21, 363 A.2d 110 (1975). The Supreme Court has recently and thoroughly articulated the principles by which such aggrievement is measured. \u201cThe concept of standing, as presented by the question of aggrievement, \u2018is a practical and functional one designed to assure that only those with a genuine and legitimate interest can appeal an order of the Probate Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merrimac Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiSesa, </em>180 Conn. 511, 516, 429 A.2d 967 (1980). \u201c[T]he existence of aggrievement depends upon \u2018whether there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest which [an appellant] has in the estate has been adversely affected.\u2019 <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953); see <em>Gaucher </em>v. <em>Estate of Camp, </em>[167 Conn. 396, 401, 355 A.2d 303 (1974)]; <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>[165 Conn. 478, 486, 338 A.2d 497 (1973)]. Moreover, it must appear that the interest which is adversely affected is a direct interest in the subject matter of the decree from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Id., 516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Application of these principles to this case requires us to decide where a line should be drawn. As Justice Holmes said, \u201cthe great body of the law consists in drawing such lines . . . .\u201d <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>270 U.S. 230, 241, 46 S. Ct. 260, 70 L. Ed. 557 (1926) <em>(Holmes, J., </em>dissenting). We do not draw on a clean slate, however. The requirement that, in order to establish aggrievement, the interest which is adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>affected be \u201cdirect\u201d is of long-standing and unbroken lineage. See <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 321, 439 A.2d 349 (1981); <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 526, 533, 30 A. 775 (1894). Although we recognize that some jurisdictions do under some circumstances permit a creditor of an heir to contest a will; see 3 Page, Wills (Bowe &amp; Parker Rev.) \u00a7 26.60 and cases cited therein; we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the estate here is indirect rather than direct. If the will were set aside, the plaintiff would not directly take any part of the estate. Any rights she claims are not rights in the estate itself; her interest derives strictly through a third person. Under these circumstances, she is not aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-10\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 2 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45-288 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any order, denial or decree of a court of probate in any matter . . . may appeal therefrom to the superior court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-12\"> It appears that this interest is that of an expectancy of an heir at law. The lien, such as it is, adds nothing to the plaintiffs claim of aggrievement since Joseph would have no interest in the real estate unless the will were disallowed. Thus the lien does no more than evoke the aphorism about the cart and the horse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
