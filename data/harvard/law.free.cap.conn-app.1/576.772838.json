The issues on appeal are (1) whether the court erred in considering the continued disability and life expectancy of the plaintiff as factors in its award without explicit medical testimony as to permanency, and (2) whether the damages awarded were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The plaintiffs car was hit in the rear by the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The impact pushed the motor of the plaintiffs car which was located at its rear into the front seat. The driver\u2019s seat was broken and the doors were jammed. The plaintiff\u2019s injuries included a ligamentous and muscular sprain of the cervical spine, and multiple contusions. Her medical expenses were $1436.30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>her lost earnings $120, and necessary household help amounted to $500. The court found that she had a continuing need of medication and physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The medical testimony was that the plaintiff had a markedly decreased range of motion of the cervical spine in all directions and that she had \u201ca residual initial back injury,\u201d but that, as of the date of the trial two years after the accident, it was too soon to determine if there would be \u201cpermanent damage.\u201d The trial court, after noting that problems existed in estimating permanent disability, made its award based on the cost of the plaintiff\u2019s medical care and other expenses, pain and suffering, continued disability, and the plaintiff\u2019s life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Compensation to the plaintiff properly included items which, with a reasonable degree of certainty, would exist in the future. <em>Trani </em>v. <em>Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation, </em>142 Conn. 541, 544, 116 A.2d 167 (1955); <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>140 Conn. 520, 523, 102 A.2d 362 (1953). The court had the opportunity to assess the testimony of the plaintiff and her doctor. It could properly conclude that if the disability still existed two years after the accident, it would in all probability continue. A trier of facts can conclude, by inference, that an injury will be permanent even though there is no medical testimony expressly substantiating permanency. See note, 18 A.L.R.3d 170, 183-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Damages in personal injury cases cannot be computed mathematically, nor does the law furnish any precise, definite rule for their assessment. The trier of fact must evaluate the elements of an award and place a monetary value on the whole. The court\u2019s award is not excessive or exhorbitant and in no way shocks a sense of justice. <em>Kiniry </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>183 Conn. 448, 461, 439 A.2d 408 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
