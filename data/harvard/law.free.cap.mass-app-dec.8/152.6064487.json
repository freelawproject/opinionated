J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">This is an action of tort wherein the plaintiff seeks to recover for personal injuries sustained as a result of falling off a horse hired from the defendant, Thomas J. Morrison. <em>(Brooks, </em>/.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s declaration contains three counts. The first alleges the hiring of a horse which was represented as tame and safe but alleged to be unsafe and unmanageable. The second alleges that the saddle equipment rented with the horse was defective and dangerous as a result of which the plaintiff was thrown from the horse and was injured. The third alleges that the plaintiff hired a horse from the defendant and as part of the consideration paid by the plaintiff, the defendant was to provide an instructor to instruct him in horsemanship and to provide his safety while receiving said instruction and that the instructor provided was a minor who had insufficient experience in horsemanship to be considered an instructor and that as a result of the failure to provide a suitable instructor, the plaintiff was thrown from the horse and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The answer of the defendant is a general denial and contributory negligence. Defendant hereinafter referred to is Thomas J. Morrison; the finding being against him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\n<em>At the trial there was evidence tending to show the following-.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The defendant is in the business of renting out horses and ponies at a certain charge per hour. The charge for the renting of a horse or pony was at the rate of $2.00 per hour. If the rider is a small child, they try to send out a person in case anything happens.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On December <em>26, </em>1953, plaintiff, an 11-year-old boy, went to the defendant\u2019s place of business with another boy of his own age named Leo Donaghue and Leo\u2019s mother, with the express approval of plaintiff\u2019s father, and asked to hire two ponies. At that time, the stable was supposed to be in charge of one Robert May, but he was not there that day. The only persons at the stable, other than riders, were defendant\u2019s son and a boy named Murphy, both about 15 years old. Both these young men frequented the stable and went out with young riders.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Young Morrison told plaintiff that they had only one pony available at the moment. This pony was rented to Leo Donaghue. Young Morrison then brought out a horse \"much bigger than a pony\u201d and urged plaintiff to get on it, which he did with help, saying that the horse was too big. Both boys gave young Morrison a dollar for half an hour\u2019s ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The horse which was supplied to plaintiff was a bay horse about 15 years old, and according to defendant, was gentle and had been owned by him for about a year. Young Morrison asked Murphy to take the plaintiff out. Murphy led the horse, with plaintiff on it, across the street to a field. There he gave plaintiff the reins and they walked the horses for a few minutes. Then, according to plaintiff, Murphy started his horse racing and plaintiff\u2019s horse galloped after Murphy\u2019s horse. Plaintiff lost his stirrup and fell off.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">According to witness, Mrs. Donaghue, Murphy led plaintiff\u2019s horse for a while, then let go and did some \"fancy riding\u201d up and down with other, riders. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>did not see plaintiff fall but saw him getting up. Murphy testified that plaintiff\u2019s horse started to trot when other riders trotted past him and plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">Plaintiff had never been on a horse. He had ridden a pony three times, one of these times being at defendant\u2019s stable. No inquiry was made of plaintiff as to his riding experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">At the close of the trial and before the final arguments, the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The defendant, Thomas J. Morrison, moves that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">1. A verdict be directed for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">2. A verdict be directed for the defendant on the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">3. A verdict be directed for the defendant on the second count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">4. A verdict be directed for the defendant on the third count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The court made no ruling on any part of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The defendant made the following requests for rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">1. Upon all the evidence and pleading, the court is not warranted in finding for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">2. At the time of the alleged accident, the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">3. The defendant is liable only if he furnished a horse to the plaintiff, as he knew or should have known, had a vicious propensity, and the plaintiff in the exercise of due care was hurt by a manifestation of such propensity. <em>Foley v. O\u2019Flynn, </em>288 Mass. 504, 506.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-16\">4. The plaintiff cannot recover against the defendant unless he shows that the injury done by the horse, which is a domestic animal, was one which resulted from and is the natural consequence of the animars vicious habits which were known or should have been known by the defendant. <em>Greeley v. Jameson, 265 </em>Mass. 465 at 471.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-17\">5. The defendant renting the horse to the plaintiff did not warrant that it was free from defects which he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>know of and could not have discovered by the exercise of due care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">6. The plaintiff\u2019s injuries having resulted from a cause other than the vicious propensities or unsuitableness of the horse, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action against the defendant</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The court made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\"The court finds for the plaintiff against Thomas J. Morrison and assesses damages in the sum of $560.64 on Count 3 (includes interest). Plaintiff\u2019s request for rulings waived. Defendant\u2019s requests for rulings allowed as to No. 5; disallowed as to No. 1, 2, 6 and as to No. 3 and 4 on facts found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The court found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\"Plaintiff, an 11-year-old boy, inexperienced in horseback riding, went to the defendant\u2019s stable with another boy of his own age. Each asked for a pony. A 15-year-old boy, son of the defendant, Thomas Morrison, hereinafter referred to as the defendant, with another boy of his own age named Murphy, appeared at the time to be the only persons in the stable, and that only one pony was available. Plaintiff\u2019s companion got on the pony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">\"Young Morrison then brought out a horse much bigger than a pony, ready for riding. Plaintiff said it was too big, but he was urged by the stable boy to get on, which he did with help. Plaintiff and his friend each gave young Morrison a dollar. Murphy then got on another horse and led the plaintiff around for a while in a walk. Then he let go of the horse which the plaintiff was riding, and according to plaintiff started racing his own horse, whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s horse started galloping after him. Plaintiff lost at least one of his stirrups and fell off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">\"Plaintiff had never ridden a horse and had only been on a pony three times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">\"The stable was in charge of an adult named May who lived on the premises and was supposed to be on duty except at meal times. The accident happened shortly after 9 a. m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\"I find the Morrison boy was negligent in placing plaintiff on this horse without any inquiry as to his riding experience. He was further negligent in not making it plain to Murphy that he was to accompany plaintiff. It was likewise negligent for Murphy to have let go of the bridle of plaintiff\u2019s horse without knowing whether or not he could ride to a trot. The equipment was not defective. There was nothing wrong with the horse per se. He simply was not suitable for the plaintiff to ride unattended. If it can be said that either stable boy was the agent of the defendant, then defendant is liable for the injuries to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\"Defendant testified that his son was permitted, subject to the adult, May, to let out ponies or horses. According to his testimony, both boys frequented the stable and that usually it was planned that some person went out with young riders \"in case anything happened\u201d and that his son or Murphy might be one to go out with young riders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\"I find and rule that from the general conduct of the business and the appearance of things on the morning of the accident, plaintiff had a right to assume that the defendant\u2019s son was authorized to rent him an animal, whether a pony or horse, and that Murphy was authorized to go out with him. I rule that both Morrison and Mrrphy were in effect agents of defendant. I rule that plaintiff was in the exercise of due care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\"This report contains all the evidence material to the questions reported.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(signed) Lawrence G. Brooks, Justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Whether or not the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence are questions of fact for the determination of the trial judge upon a consideration of all the evidence. <em>Callahan v. The Fleischman Co., 262 </em>Mass. 437; <em>Mahoney v. Norcross, </em>284 Mass. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">It can rarely be ruled as a matter of law that the burden of proof has been sustained, especially when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>as in these cases, \"the attempt to sustain that the burden rests upon oral testimony introduced by the party upon whom the burden rests.\u201d <em>McDonough v. Metropolitan Life Insur., Co., </em>228 Mass. 450, 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The question of negligence and contributory negligence present questions of fact. <em>Ferreira v. Zaccolanti, </em>281 Mass. 91, 92. <em>Noble v. Bos. Elev. Railway, </em>287 Mass. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The burden is on the defendant by statute to prove affirmatively that the plaintiff failed to exercise due care. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a75. It rarely can be ruled as a matter of law that the defendant has sustained that burden. <em>Dubois v. Powdrell, </em>271 Mass. 394 at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The trial judge has based his finding of negligence on two factors. He has found that it was negligent for the defendant\u2019s son to permit the plaintiff to ride a horse instead of the pony which was requested and he has also found that the stable boy Murphy was negligent in releasing his hold on the horse ridden by the plaintiff. He further found that the defendant\u2019s son and Murphy were both agents of the defendant, acting in the course of the defendant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">These findings render the denial of the defendant\u2019s requests numbered 2, 3, 4 and <em>6 </em>proper since they became inapplicable in view of the specific findings of fact made by the trial judge. There is no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s request numbered 1, because it is based on all the evidence without the required specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In conclusion, the Court was also correct in ignoring the defendant\u2019s request for a directed \"verdict.\u201d There is no such procedure in the district court as a directed verdict. A verdict has application only to a jury case. See: Superior Court Rules (1954) Annotated, p. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Therefore there being no prejudicial error, the report is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b163-10\">This case was argued before Gadsby, P. J., and Cavan, J., but Judge Cavan died before any action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>was taken. The opinion was then submitted to Eno and he has concurred in the same.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b164-4\">Reuben H. Nitkin, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AeU\">E.
