(\u201cCommercial\u201d) and CU Lloyd\u2019s of Texas (\u201cCU Lloyd\u2019s\u201d) (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d) seek reversal of the district court\u2019s decision to enforce a judgment obtained by Plaintiffs-Appellees Val-mont Energy Steel, Inc. and Valmont Mi-crofLect,. Inc. (collectively, \u201cValmont\u201d) against Continental Manufacturing, Inc. (\u201cContinental\u201d), a company insured by Appellants. The district court concluded that Appellants\u2019 insurance policies covered the injury suffered by Valmont and enforced the judgment. Appellants raise three points of error: that there was no \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policies; that there was no \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the policies; and that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion in Appellants\u2019 policies with Continental plainly excluded coverage. Here, because we find the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion unambiguous, we need not address the questions of whether there was \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of Appellants\u2019 policies. We find the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion clearly barred coverage of the damages suffered by Valmont. We thus REVERSE the decision of the district court and RENDER judgment in favor of Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">The pertinent underlying facts are as follows: Valmont entered into a contract with .Continental for the purchase of steel flanges for use in Valmont\u2019s construction of microwave towers. Under the terms of the- contract, the steel flanges were required to have a 50,000-pound yield and tensile strength. With each shipment of flanges, Continental agreed to include either a Material Test Report (\u201cMTR\u201d) that verified the grade and quality of the steel used in the production of the flanges or a certification that Continental had the original MTR verifying the steel specifications on file in their Nacogdoches, Texas, offices. Continental represented to Valmont that it had an MTR on file confirming that each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>steel flange satisfied Valmont\u2019s quality-specifications. Continental shipped the flanges to Valmont, which used some flanges in the construction of a microwave tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">A Valmont customer service representative later noticed inconsistencies in the paperwork submitted by Continental, and Valmont requested that Continental supply the MTRs. Valmont then reviewed the MTRs and contacted the steel manufacturer listed, U.S. Steel Corp. (\u201cU.S. Steel\u201d). U.S. Steel responded that the MTRs had been substantially altered and that it could not verify to Valmont the origin of the steel used in the flanges or the steel\u2019s strength. Valmont subsequently submitted six of the flanges to an independent tester to determine their tensile strength. In order to test the flanges, each had to be destroyed; all six flanges failed to meet the contract specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In November 1998 Valmont filed a breach of contract suit against Continental in district court relying upon diversity of citizenship for jurisdiction. A bench trial was held in November 1999. In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court in such prior suit concluded that Continental had supplied false information because the steel used in the flanges was not of the quality specified; Continental had not maintained the original certifications on file; Continental had not exercised reasonable care in providing the certifications; and the flanges were unusable by Valmont because they could not be tested without destroying them. On February 2, 2000, the district court in such prior suit found Continental liable to Valmont for negligent misrepresentation and awarded Valmont its \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses, meaning the difference between the purchase price of the flanges and the value received, plus pecuniary loss \u2014 a total of $118,519.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Appellants had provided Continental with two commercial insurance policies: a general liability policy and an umbrella policy. Under the general policy, CU Lloyd\u2019s agreed to \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ..: \u2018property damage\u2019 to which the insurance applies.\u201d The general policy defined \u201cproperty damage\u201d either as \u201c[pjhysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property,\u201d or as \u201c[ljoss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d Property damage was covered by the general policy only if it was \u201ccaused by an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d The general policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d Like the general policy, the umbrella policy issued by Commercial applied to \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The umbrella policy thus provided similar coverage on an excess basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The general policy contained an exclusion that stated no coverage was provided for \u201c \u2018[pjroperty damage\u2019 to \u2018your product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it.\u201d The term \u201cyour product\u201d was defined in the general policy as \u201c[a]ny goods or products ... manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by\u201d the insured. That definition of \u201cyour product\u201d expressly included \u201c[wjarranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness, quality, durability, performance or use of \u2018your product.\u2019 \u201d The umbrella policy also contained an identical \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion and similarly defined \u201cyour product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">After judgment for Valmont was entered in the prior suit, Continental filed for bankruptcy and Appellants refused to indemnify Continental because the damages caused by Continental were outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>scope of the policies. On February 23, 2001, Valmont filed the present diversity suit as judgment creditor against Appellants in district court, alleging Appellants were liable to pay Valmont\u2019s damages under the terms of their policies with Continental. On October 3, 2001, Appellants moved for summary judgment, arguing first, that Continental\u2019s negligent misrepresentations did not cause \u201cproperty damage\u201d because Valmont was awarded only economic damages in the underlying suit; second, that negligent misrepresentation did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policies; and third, that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion barred any coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The district court disagreed and denied Appellants\u2019 motion on September 30, 2002. The court found \u201cproperty damage\u201d because the flanges were rendered unusable by Continental\u2019s carelessness. Under the plain terms of the policies, the loss of use of the flanges constituted \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Pursuant to case law, the court further held that Continental\u2019s negligent misrepresentations constituted an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Lastly, the district court concluded that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion did not bar coverage here because the exclusion conflicted with the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d definition and the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d in the policies \u2014 which appeared to provide coverage. Given the conflict, the district court concluded the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion was ambiguous and allowed coverage. Valmont then moved for summary judgment on January 31, 2003. The district court relied on its findings from its order denying Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted Valmont\u2019s motion for summary judgment on March 31, 2003. Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment rulings <em>de novo, </em>and apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. v. Baptist Health Sys., </em>313 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Potomac Ins. Co. v. Jayhawk Med. Acceptance Corp., </em>198 F.3d 548, 550 (5th Cir.2000)). Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c), district courts properly grant summary judgment if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the movant shows there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The district court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law also subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Canutillo Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>99 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.1996) (applying Texas law) (citations omitted). Both parties agree that the policies should be interpreted under T\u00e9xas law. In Texas, courts employ general rules of contract construction to insurance policies. <em>Balandran v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>972 S.W.2d 738, 740-41 (Tex.1998). The terms of an insurance policy are unambiguous as a matter of law if they can be given definite or certain legal meaning. <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. CBI Indus., Inc., </em>907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex. 1995) (citing <em>Coker v. Coker, </em>650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983)). The policy must be considered as a whole, and each part given effect and meaning. <em>Canutillo, </em>99 F.3d at 700 (citation omitted). If the court finds no ambiguity, the court\u2019s duty is to enforce the policy according to its plain meaning. <em>Puckett v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>678 S.W.2d 936, 938 (Tex.1984) (citation omitted). \u201cThe fact that the parties disagree as to coverage does not create an ambiguity, nor may extrinsic evidence be admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>for the purpose of creating an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Sharp v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>115 F.3d 1258, 1261 (5th Cir.1997) (applying Texas law); <em>see also CBI Indus., </em>907 S.W.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The Texas Supreme Court has found that \u201c[i]f, however, the language of a policy or contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations, it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>CBI Indus., </em>907 S.W.2d at 520. Courts can only consider the parties\u2019 interpretation of a contract if the court first determines a contract to be ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v. Madeley, </em>626 S.W.2d 726, 732 (Tex.1981)). If the court finds an ambiguity in the contract provisions, particularly in an exclusion clause, the court should construe the policy strictly against the insurer. <em>Bailey, </em>133 F.3d at 369; <em>Balandran, </em>972 S.W.2d at 741 (noting that, where an ambiguity is found, courts should adopt the insured\u2019s interpretation as long as it is reasonable, even where the insurer\u2019s interpretation is a more reasonable interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\n<em>Whether the district court erred in finding that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion in the insurance policies was ambiguous and unenforceable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Appellants argue that any \u201cproperty damage\u201d to the flanges purchased by Val-mont clearly falls within the policies\u2019 unambiguous \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion, which clause bars coverage of those damages. Again, both the general and umbrella policies contained a \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion \u2014 located in subsections k and h, respectively, of \u201cExclusions\u201d under \u201cSection I-Coverages\u201d \u2014 that expressly stated no coverage was provided for \u201c \u2018property damage\u2019 to \u2018your product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it.\u201d The term \u201cyour product\u201d was defined in both policies as \u201c[a]ny goods or products ... manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by\u201d the insured. The definition of \u201cyour product\u201d in the general policy expressly included \u201c[warranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness, quality, durability, performance or use of \u2018your product\u2019 \u201d; and the umbrella policy similarly defined \u201cyour product\u201d to include \u201cwarranties or representations\u201d made by Continental about its products. Thus, Appellants assert that any physical damage to the flanges sold by Continental to Val-mont and any loss of the use of the flanges was \u201cproperty damage\u201d to the insured Continental\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d arising out of the insured Continental\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d \u2014 Continental\u2019s representations with respect to the quality of its flanges. Appellants argue that the district court\u2019s refusal to enforce the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion as ambiguous constitutes legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Under Texas law, Appellants bear the burden of establishing that a policy exclusion constitutes an avoidance of or affirmative defense to coverage. Tex. Ins.Code Ann. art. 21.58(b) (Vernon Supp.2004); <em>see also Performance Autoplex II Ltd. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 854 (5th Cir.2003). The district court did not dispute and Valmont does not appear to dispute that, when viewed in isolation, the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion appeared to bar coverage of the damage to the flanges at issue in this case. However, the district court refused to apply the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion because it determined that other provisions in the policies \u2014 the provisions relating to \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d \u2014 appeared to grant coverage and thus rendered the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion ambiguous. Valmont contends that the district court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion as ambiguous is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Both policies define \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d in their respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>\u201cSection V-Definitions\u201d to include: \u201call ... \u2018property damage\u2019 occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of \u2018your product\u2019 ... except ... [products that are still in your physical possession.\u201d In the general policy, \u201cSection Ill-Limits of Insurance\u201d lays out certain limits of the provided \u201cproperty damage\u201d coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\"><em>2. </em>The General Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay for the sum of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">b. Damages under Coverage A, except damages because of ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d included in the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">3. The Products-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay under Coverage A for damages because of ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d included in the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Coverage A of \u201cSection I-Coverages\u201d of the general policy provided for \u201cproperty damage liability.\u201d The umbrella policy contained similar provisions laying out that policy\u2019s \u201cGeneral Aggregate Limit\u201d and \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit,\u201d also located in its \u201cSection Ill-Limits of Insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Valmont urges that the definition of \u201cproducts-completed operations \u25a0 hazard\u201d conflicted with the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion. While the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion removed coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d to Continental\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d arising from its \u201cproduct,\u201d the plain language of the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d appeared to extend coverage to \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of Continental\u2019s \u201cproduct,\u201d as long as the damage occurred off Continental\u2019s premises and not while Continental still had physical possession of its \u201cproduct.\u201d The district court was persuaded by this argument,' concluding that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion and \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d definition, when read together with the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d and in the context of each entire policy,, potentially created an ambiguity' in the scope of coverage. The court worried that if it applied the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion, then the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d definition and the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d would have an uncertain meaning; accordingly, the court determined that the ambiguity should be construed in favor of coverage such that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion was not enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">After considering the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion, -the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d definition, and the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d within the context of each policy as a whole, we conclude that the district court erred when it determined there was a conflict among the provisions. Both policies clearly included the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion under the subsection \u201cExclusions\u201d in their respective \u201cSection I-Coverages.\u201d Thus, \u201cSection I-Coverages\u201d is where coverage is both granted as to damages because of \u201cproperty damages\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and then limited by exclusions such as the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion. Clearly, \u201cSection V-Definitions\u201d is where terms such as \u201cproperty damage,\u201d \u201cyour product,\u201d and \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d used in each policy are defined. However, the district court incorrectly assumed that, the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d in \u201cSection Ill-Limits of Insurance\u201d of each policy also functioned to grant coverage. What \u201cSection Ill-Limits of Insurance\u201d did instead is simply explain the amount of damages each policy will cover \u2014 read together with the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201cproducts-completed operations hazard,\u201d it delineated the declared limits of the insurance for off-premises \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising from Continental\u2019s product. The two Section III provisions cited above\u2014 the \u201cGeneral Aggregate Limit\u201d and the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d \u2014 thus divided the amount of coverage offered under each policy into two components, each of which contained its own coverage limitation. The General Aggregate Limit for each policy provided coverage of up to $2,000,000 for all \u201cproperty damage\u201d except damage occurring away from Continental\u2019s premises arising from Continental\u2019s product \u2014 \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d Damage that occurred away from Continental\u2019s premises arising from Continental\u2019s product \u2014 \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d \u2014 had its own declared \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit,\u201d also of $2,000,000 for each policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Therefore, because the \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit\u201d provision did not separately grant \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d coverage, there is no discord with the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion. The three clauses can easily be read together without conflict. Under Section I, Appellants were obligated to indemnify Continental for all damages because of \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d that Continental became legally obligated to pay, except for \u201cproperty damage\u201d to Continental\u2019s own \u201cproduct\u201d arising from its own \u201cproduct.\u201d Included in this overall \u201cproperty damage\u201d coverage is coverage for \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d; that is, Appellants were required to indemnify Continental for all damages because of \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d occurring away from Continental\u2019s premises and arising out of its \u201cproducts,\u201d but not for damages because of \u201cproperty damage\u201d to Continental\u2019s \u201cproducts\u201d themselves. The \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion thus works together cleanly with the definition of \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Put simply: for each policy, Section I grants broad coverage of damages due to \u201cproperty damage\u201d; the Section I \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion limits that coverage; and Section III sets out limits on the amount of coverage Appellants will pay, depending on the location of the damage. Because we find that the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation and can be given definite meaning within each policy as a whole, such exclusion is unambiguous as a matter of law. Therefore, our duty is to enforce the policy according to its plain meaning. Presupposing that the sums Continental became legally obligated to pay to Valmont as damages for negligent misrepresentation were because of \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d a plain reading of \u201cyour product\u201d exclusions k and h, respectively, of the general and umbrella policies clearly bars coverage of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d to Continental\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d (the steel flanges sold to Valmont) arising from Continental\u2019s \u201crepresentations\u201d made with respect to the \u201cquality\u201d of Continental\u2019s \u201cproduct,\u201d regardless of the location where such \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurred. Thus, Appellants are not obligated to indemnify Continental.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Having carefully reviewed the record of this case and the parties\u2019 respective briefing and for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the district court erred in denying summary judgment to Appellants and in granting summary judgment to Val-mont. Therefore, we REVERSE the decision of the district court below and RENDER judgment on behalf of Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">REVERSED and RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-5\">. We note that because of the amount of the damages at issue here ($118,519.47), only the general policy issued by CU Lloyd\u2019s would have provided any applicable coverage to Continental to pay damages to Valmont, not the excess umbrella policy issued by Commercial. However, as both CU Lloyd\u2019s and Commercial were sued by Valmont and both here appeal the district court\u2019s decision, we considered the application of the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion found in both policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
