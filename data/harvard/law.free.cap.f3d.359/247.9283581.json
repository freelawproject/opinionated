Because Plotts was denied the right of allocution at sentencing, we reverse and remand to the District Court for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">In July 1995, Plotts was arrested in Delaware on the suspicion of bank robbery. Shortly thereafter, a grand jury returned an indictment against Plotts, charging him with bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). He pled guilty to a single count and received a sentence of 80 months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release. In February 2002 (after serving his sentence and while on supervised release), responsibility for his supervision was transferred to the Probation Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Plotts was arrested in November 2002 by the Pennsylvania State Police for violating 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 6105 (felon in possession of a firearm). Shortly thereafter, the Probation Office filed a petition to revoke Plotts\u2019s supervised release, alleging six violations of his release conditions. The District Court conducted a revocation hearing in December 2002. The Government presented the testimony of six witnesses. Plotts presented no evidence. After considering the evidence and arguments of counsel, the District Court found that Plotts had: (1) been in possession of a firearm; (2) engaged in credit card fraud;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) used drugs, including opiates, on repeated occasions; and (4) lied to his probation officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following these findings, the District Court revoked Plotts\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 30 months imprisonment followed by 30 months supervised release. Prior to sentencing, Plotts was not given an opportunity to address the Court, known as allocution. He appeals, alleging that (1) he was denied the right of allocution at his release revocation hearing before sentence was imposed, and (2) the District Court improperly treated a charged Grade C violation as a Grade A violation for sentencing purposes (thus increasing his sentence).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">As Plotts failed to preserve his objections at the revocation hearing, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>review the decision of the District Court for plain error. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>252 F.3d 276, 279 (3d Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Under plain error review, we may grant relief if (1) the District Court committed an \u201cerror,\u201d (2) it was \u201cplain,\u201d and (3) it affected \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of the defendant. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cA deviation from a legal rule is [an] \u2018error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>134 F.3d 171, 180 (3d Cir.1998) (citation omitted). It is \u201cplain\u201d when \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In order for an error to affect \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d it must have been \u201cprejudicial\u201d; in other words, \u201cit must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. If these requirements are satisfied, we should exercise our discretion to grant relief if the error \u201c \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (citation omitted); <em>see also Adams, </em>252 F.3d at 284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We conclude that a criminal defendant\u2019s right of allocution extends to release revocation hearings. Because the District Court committed plain error in denying Plotts\u2019s right, we remand this case for resentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The rule in our Circuit is that denying the right of allocution (at least in sentencing hearings) will generally result in resentencing under plain error review. <em>Adams, </em>252 F.3d at 289. Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states a court must, before imposing sentence, \u201caddress the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\u201d In <em>Adams, </em>we concluded the District Court in that case committed an \u201cerror\u201d that was \u201cplain\u201d by failing to address the defendant personally prior to sentencing. 252 F.3d at 286. With regard to the \u201caffects substantial rights\u201d portion of the plain error analysis, we interpreted <em>Olano </em>as requiring \u201cthe defendant to make a specific showing of prejudice, unless he can show that the error should be presumed prejudicial, or that the error belongs in a special category of errors that should be corrected regardless of prejudice (ie., the category of structural errors).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285-86. Prejudice should be presumed, however, when a defendant shows the violation of a right could \u201chave played a role in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>court\u2019s sentencing decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. We also stated that violation of the right of allocution could play a role in a court\u2019s sentencing decision whenever there exists any disputed facts in connection with sentencing or any defense arguments that might reduce the applicable guideline range or ultimate sentence. <em>Id. </em>All of this is based on the belief that a defendant is often his most persuasive and eloquent advocate. <em>Id. </em>at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">While not constitutional, the right of al-locution is \u201cancient in origin, and it is the type of important safeguard that helps assure the fairness, and hence, legitimacy, of the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we concluded in <em>Adams </em>that denial of allo-cution at the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing was plain error and warranted resen-tencing. <em>Id. </em>at 288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We have not ruled whether a defendant\u2019s right of allocution extends to a revocation hearing. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure fail to define explicitly the scope of allocution rights. Almost every circuit court to consider the issue, however, has ruled that allocution must be permitted before imposition of sentence at a supervised release (or parole) revocation hearing. <em>See United States v. Reyna, </em>No. 01-41164, 358 F.3d 344, 2004 WL 113479, 2004 U.S.App. LEXIS 1134 (5th Cir. Jan. 26, 2004) (en banc);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Waters, </em>158 F.3d 933, 944-45 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>128 F.3d 1259, 1260-61 (8th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d 919, 921 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Carper, </em>24 F.3d 1157, 1160-62 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>948 F.2d 325, 329-30 (7th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of our previously expressed views in <em>Adams </em>on the importance of allocution, and in reliance on the well-reasoned opinions in other circuits, we too conclude that a defendant\u2019s right of allocution extends to revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">For similar reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s error in this case was \u201cplain.\u201d An error may be clear or obvious absent controlling Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>or Third Circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>155 F.3d 245, 251-52 (3d Cir. 1998). In such a case, decisions from other circuit courts are instructive. <em>See United States v. Barbosa, </em>271 F.3d 438, 456 (3d Cir.2001) (relying on previous decisions of two circuit courts in finding plain error). In Plotts\u2019s case, the weight of appellate authority discussed above is sufficient to render the District Court\u2019s error clear and obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Based upon <em>Adams, </em>we also conclude that prejudice to \u201csubstantial rights\u201d may be presumed in this case because allocution could have played a role in the Court\u2019s sentencing decision. 252 F.3d at 287. First, there exists no statutory minimum term of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (permitting imprisonment for \u201call or part\u201d of the term of defendant\u2019s supervised release); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). Second, even though Plotts\u2019s 30-month added prison term was the lowest sentence within the recommended Guidelines Manual range of 30 to 37 months, the Court had discretion to impose an even lower sentence, as the revocation provisions in the Guidelines are advisory policy statements and not binding. <em>See United States v. Schwegel, </em>126 F.3d 551, 554-55 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Finally, denial of the right of allocution \u201cis not the sort of \u2018isolated\u2019 or \u2018abstract\u2019 error that we might determine does not impact the \u2018fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adams, </em>252 F.3d at 288 (citation omitted). As such, this is an appropriate case in which to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">We reverse and remand to the District Court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. In its brief, the Government states it does not oppose resentencing in this case. We commend the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for its candor and professionalism.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">. While we are unaware of any formal criminal charges against Plotts for credit card fraud, he admitted to his parole officer using another individual's credit card for an unauthorized purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-16\">. On appeal, Plotts and the Government present different versions of the facts and circumstances surrounding the revocation of his supervised release. While this may be an area for the District Court to explore on resentenc-ing, it is irrelevant to our resolution of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b276-17\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. Plotts also argues the District Court committed plain error by mischaracterizing a Grade C violation, unauthorized use of a credit card, as a Grade. A violation for sentencing purposes. As resentencing is granted on the ground that allocution was improperly denied, we decline to entertain this alternative argument. We note, however, that the revocation petition filed by the Probation Office with the District Court alleges a Grade C violation. In its brief, the Government concedes that Plotts's actions do not constitute a Grade A violation, but instead insists they should be Grade B (not Grade C). Because the petition already alleges a Grade A violation (possession of a firearm), Plotts would suffer little prejudice if, prior to resentencing, the Probation Office were to amend the violation grade assigned to his unauthorized use of a credit card. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B 1.4(a) (listing the suggested imprisonment ranges for Grades A, B and C violations). Until revised by the Probation Office, however, these actions remain as initially characterized, a Grade C violation. <em>See generally </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603(2) (stating that it is the duty of the probation officer to be aware of the conditions of supervised release and to report to the sentencing court conduct which may violate those terms); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.2 (same); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(A) (requiring that a defendant at a revocation hearing receive \"written notice of the alleged violation\"). On resentencing, the District Court should consider the effect, if any, of its alleged mischar-acterization in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. The <em>Reyna </em>Court approved of the plain error analysis in <em>Adams, </em>including the conclusion that prejudice should be presumed when violation of a right could have affected a court\u2019s sentencing decision. 358 F.3d at 350, 2004 WL 113479, at *4, 2004 U.S.App. LEXIS at *16.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The Fifth Circuit, however, disagreed with <em>Adams </em>somewhat as to when an appellate court should exercise its discretion in correcting a plain error. In <em>Adams, </em>we stated without qualification that denial of the fight of allocution affects the \u201cfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d 252 F.3d at 288 (citation and quotations omitted). In contrast, the Fifth Circuit concluded that \"[i]n a limited class of cases, a review of the record may reveal, despite the presence of disputed sentencing issues, that the violation of a defendant\u2019s right to allocution does not violate the last <em>Olano </em>prong. This case is a good example.\u201d <em>Reyna, </em>358 F.3d at 352, 2004 WL 113479, at *7, 2004 U.S.App. LEXIS at *19.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We are bound, however, to follow <em>Adams, </em>and it carves out no exception on its face. Further, the <em>Reyna </em>exception is, by its own terms, limited; indeed, the Fifth Circuit concluded that resentencing is \"ordinarily\u201d required. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 2004 WL 113479, at *6, 2004 U.S.App.LEXIS at *22. Reyna, for example, had appeared before the same judge three times, twice for violations of the terms of his supervised release. Although Reyna did not have the opportunity to allocute at his most recent revocation hearing, he \u201chad the opportunity to allocute both at his original sentencing and when resentenced following his first violation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 2004 WL 113479, at *6, 2004 U.S.App.LEXIS, at *20. <em>Reyna </em>is thus distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-12\">. Although the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>283 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir.2002), appears to support the position that allocution is not required at a revocation hearing, this opinion was later vacated. 324 F.3d 1224 (11th Cir.2003). The only other circuit court to endorse the initial position in <em>Frazier </em>is the Tenth Circuit in an unpublished decision. <em>See United States v. Fennell, </em>986 F.2d 1430, 1992 WL 401587 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
