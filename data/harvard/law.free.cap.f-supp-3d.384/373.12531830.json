(\"Plaintiffs\") commenced this action on July 27, 2018, alleging that the United States of America (the \"United States\") and Luedtke Engineering Company (\"Luedtke\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") negligently dredged the Black Rock Channel (the \"Channel\") along the Niagara River in Buffalo, New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1). On August 29, 2018, Luedtke filed an Answer to the Complaint and cross-claimed against the United States for indemnification and contribution in the event Luedtke was found liable to Plaintiffs. (Dkt. 10 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Presently before the Court is the United States' motion to dismiss the cross-claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or, alternatively, for judgment on the pleadings for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 16). For the following reasons, the United States' motion is granted and Luedtke's cross-claims are dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs own and operate a marina on the Channel opposite the United States Army Corps of Engineers' (the \"Corps\") Channel Locks. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 1). The Channel \"accommodates pleasure craft and commercial vessels up to 625 feet long with drafts up to 21 feet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). Rich Marina Corp. owns 26 acres of property abutting the waterfront along the Channel (the \"Property\"), which includes the marina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). The Property is protected by a \"retaining wall,\" referred to as the \"Bulkhead,\" which \"serves as a barrier\" between the Property and the Channel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Corps is responsible for maintaining and repairing the Channel and has previously contracted third parties to perform dredging operations within the waterway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). As part of an initiative to remove \"potentially contaminated sediment from the Channel,\" the Corps \"contracted with Luedtke in 2015 to conduct a dredging project\" within a section of the Channel that runs parallel to the Property (the \"Project\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27). The Corps determined the \"specifications, the planning, the scope, and the supervision\" of the Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, \"[u]pon information and belief, the contract between [the Corps] and Luedtke required dredging solely within the confines of the Channel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). However, Luedtke allegedly \"performed dredging outside of the Channel and up to the Bulkhead,\" and \"over-dredged the Channel beyond its contractual obligations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Plaintiffs also allege, in the alternative, that the Corps \"directed Luedtke to over-dredge the Channel and dredge outside of the Channel up to the Bulkhead.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Allegedly due to these dredging actions, \"the riverbank adjacent to and underneath the Bulkhead slid into the Channel causing unsustainable strain on the Bulkhead.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Nevertheless, \"Luedtke continued to dredge material in this fashion resulting in the removal of the riverbank which supported the Bulkhead.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result, \"on July 28, 2016, approximately 250 feet of the Bulkhead\" collapsed and fell into the Channel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). In August 2016, another 100-foot section of the Bulkhead collapsed into the Channel due to the dredging activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). Finally, in April 2017, \"a third section of the Bulkhead, approximately 75 feet in length, collapsed into the Channel as a direct result of the dredging performed by Luedtke.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). The remaining portion of the Bulkhead is allegedly \"at imminent risk of collapse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 27, 2018, Plaintiffs commenced this action, asserting several tort causes of action pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202671\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FTCA\"), and, alternatively, pursuant to the Suits in Admiralty Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030901\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"SAA\"), the Public Vessels Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031101\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"PVA\"), and the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Dkt 1). Plaintiffs claim that Defendants were negligent in carrying out their obligations under the dredging contract, and that their malfeasance resulted in damages under theories of negligence, gross negligence, and private nuisance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On August 29, 2018, Leudtke filed an Answer and asserted cross-claims against the United States for indemnification and contribution. (Dkt. 10). On October 3, 2018, the United States filed its Answer to the Complaint. (Dkt. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 9, 2018, the United States filed a motion to dismiss Leudtke's cross-claims, seeking dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 16). Specifically, the United States argues that Leudtke's cross-claims are subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C \u00a7 7101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"CDA\"), and thus, Leudtke was required to exhaust its administrative remedies before asserting these claims in this lawsuit. (Dkt. 16-1 at 4-8). According to the United States, because Leudtke failed to exhaust these administrative requirements this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the cross-claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Alternatively, the United States contends that Leudtke's cross-claims are conclusory and do not satisfy the pleading standards enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) and\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38, 40-42). In other words, Leudtke's cross-claims only become relevant if Plaintiffs successfully establish Leudtke's liability, and Plaintiffs' theory of liability against Leudtke is based on its alleged dredging activity in contravention of its contract with the United States.

For example, the Corps was allegedly required, by contract, \"to provide Luedtke details regarding where to dredge and not to dredge\" (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 54), and then violated this obligation by \"improperly direct[ing] Luedtke to dredge outside the Channel\" or \"fail[ing] to properly and appropriately specify, design, or define the scope of the Dredging Project,\" resulting in damages to the Property (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55-57, 69-72).
