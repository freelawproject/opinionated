KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Dan Hardway, Edwin Lopez, and G. Robert Blakey worked for a congressional committee in the 1970s that investigated the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and President John F. Kennedy. They suspected that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was interfering with their investigation and spying on them. About forty years later, they sought to confirm those suspicions by requesting records from the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Dissatisfied with the CIA's response, they sued, challenging the adequacy of the CIA's searches and its decision to redact its employees' names from the two documents it released to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, the CIA adequately searched for one of the categories of records Plaintiffs seek and properly withheld the names of its employees. The Court will therefore grant summary judgment for the CIA on those aspects of its response to Plaintiffs' request. But the Court cannot determine on the current record whether the CIA's searches for the other categories of records were adequate, so it will otherwise deny both motions and permit the parties to renew them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Office of Security Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As part of their broader request, Plaintiffs sought all records related to them housed in the CIA's Office of Security. Pl. Request at 1. Shiner's second declaration describes the CIA's search for these records in detail. In describing how the agency decided where to search, she explains that the CIA identified \"record systems maintained by the Office of Security that can be searched for records related to particular individuals and would include records dating back to the relevant time period.\" Shiner Decl. 2 \u00b6 6. The CIA identified one record system that fit that description, and \"[n]o other databases or sets of files within the Office of Security were deemed likely to maintain responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As for the CIA's search methodology, Shiner represents that the database can be queried by an individual's name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   employees searched each Plaintiff's name, and the database showed that Plaintiffs' personnel security files had been destroyed \"pursuant to ordinary records control procedures\"-Blakey's on March 26, 2002, and both Hardway's and Lopez's on November 24, 2006.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Shiner Decl. 1 \u00b6 15. The database also reflected that there were no archived hard-copy records related to Hardway or Lopez, but that there were some records \"in hard copy form at an Agency records archive facility\" related to Blakey. Shiner Decl. 2 \u00b6 8. The CIA retrieved those hard-copy records, which were two nondisclosure agreements signed by Blakey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The CIA then released them to Plaintiffs, with CIA employees' names and signatures redacted, in December 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This declaration provides the Court the basis to conclude that the CIA conducted an adequate search for records within the Office of Security. The CIA identified the one database that would contain responsive records and searched it by Plaintiffs' names. And to the extent that the search indicated that there were records stored elsewhere, the CIA obtained, reviewed, and produced them (with redactions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the search was inadequate because they received no \"proof of [the] destruction\" of their Office of Security files. Pl. Mot. at 22-23. To start, as noted above, \"the adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in any event, the CIA has now produced the Shiner declaration, which explains and provides some detail about the destruction of the records. More fundamentally, though, FOIA does not require an agency to provide plaintiffs information about the destruction of records they requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jean-Pierre v. Bureau of Prisons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307231\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/880/95/#p103\">\n    880 F. Supp. 2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103-04 (D.D.C. 2012) (finding that requests for information-\"what was the reason,\" \"who gave the order,\" and \"on what day\"-were not requests for records and therefore did not fall within FOIA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Still, say Plaintiffs, the CIA needed to undertake a separate search for records\n   <em>\n    about the destruction\n   </em>\n   of the records they requested. But this argument, based on one of the purported instructions Plaintiffs appended to their FOIA request, fails as well. After Plaintiffs listed the eight categories of records they requested, they also included about three pages of directives about how the CIA should search its files, communicate with them about their request, and provide them responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Request at 5 (\"Where paper copies of a record responsive to any request herein have material of any kind on the reverse side of a page, please provide both sides of [the] page.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307231\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/880/95/#p103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Please provide all responsive materials in a digital format reproduced on word searchable CDs.\"). One directive instructed that, if the CIA had destroyed any responsive records, it should \"provide proof of that destruction, including any documentary evidence indicating the date of destruction, a description of exactly what was destroyed, and any cited authority for the destruction, and any identifying information regarding the person(s) who accomplished and recorded the destruction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307231\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/880/95/#p103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   That instruction did not, as Plaintiffs allege, require the CIA to undertake a separate search for potential records about the destruction of the records they requested. Plaintiffs essentially contend that the CIA should have interpreted their instruction as part of their substantive FOIA request, because as part of the \"proof\" of a record's destruction they demanded, along with other information,\n   \"documentary evidence indicating the date of the destruction.\" But considered in context, that instruction was not a request that \"reasonably describe[d]\" additional records under FOIA, like the eight categories of records Plaintiffs identified.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A).

Of course, if Plaintiffs now wish to submit a FOIA request for records about the destruction of their personnel security files, they are free to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the CIA needed to conduct additional searches for their Office of Security files because the agency had a statutory obligation to preserve them under the President John F.

These search terms, she says, \"generated a number of hits ... each of which was retrieved from the database and individually reviewed\" for responsiveness. Shiner Decl. 2 \u00b6 13. Employees determined that none of the hits related to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Shiner's description of the CIA's search for the Directorate of Operations records, though, does not provide the Court enough information to determine whether summary judgment is warranted.

For non-operational records about Gaeton Fonzi, she explains that employees searched his name, \"HSCA,\" and \"House Select Committee on Assassinations.\" Shiner Decl. 1 \u00b6 19. But she provides no other details, such as the record system or systems the CIA searched using those terms, why it selected those systems, and how those systems can be queried. And as for non-operational records about Plaintiffs, Shiner includes no description of the CIA's search methodology at all. It may well be that the Directorate of Operations stores potentially responsive non-operational records in the same database Shiner describes as containing its operational records. But she does not say so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The declarations therefore lack the level of detail that allows the Court to determine whether the agency conducted an adequate search for Directorate of Operations records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology of Cal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185401,3686196\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/784/\">\n    662 F.2d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The CIA interpreted \"P files\" to refer to personnel records, because \"experienced CIA officers determined that the term 'P file' has at times been used within the Agency as a shorthand description of a 'personnel file.' \" Shiner Decl. 1 \u00b6 14. Plaintiffs do not appear to object to this interpretation. Pl. Mot. at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In explaining the potential locations for personnel records, Shiner explains that the CIA \"maintains an electronic database of personnel records that can be queried by an individual's name.\" Shiner Decl. 1 \u00b6 14. Employees \"searched this database for the names of plaintiffs Hardway, Lopez, and Blakey and no responsive records\" were found.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185401,3686196\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/784/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This search for personnel records appears to pass muster in almost all ways. But once again, Shiner does not state that \"no other record system was likely to produce responsive documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court hesitates to infer that is the case here, if only because the records Plaintiffs requested date to the 1970s and might well not be housed in an electronic database. The Court will therefore deny both summary judgment motions without prejudice as to personnel records and will allow the CIA to address in another declaration whether any additional record system was likely to contain responsive files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Records of Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs requested all records about the CIA's search efforts for the other categories of records they requested. But FOIA only requires agencies to search for records as of a specific cut-off date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p152\">\n    445 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p152\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the one hand, the D.C. Circuit \"has indicated that an agency must have a 'compelling justification for imposing a date-of-request cut-off on a particular FOIA request.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

Cir. 2002) ). But on the other, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly held that a date-of-search cut-off is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3728624,9452924\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/634/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The parties do not appear to dispute that it would have been reasonable for the CIA to use a date-of-search cut-off here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 7; Pl. Mot. at 29; Def. Resp. at 6-7. But the Court cannot tell from Shiner's declarations whether it did so. Shiner explains that the CIA did not search for this category of records because they \"by definition, did not exist at the time the CIA received and began processing the plaintiffs' request.\" Shiner Decl. 1 \u00b6 20. But this representation raises more questions than it answers. Although it seems quite likely that no responsive records existed at the time the CIA received the request, using that cut-off date would at least arguably require a \"compelling justification,\" as is required when an agency uses a date-of-request cut-off. And it is far from clear that no responsive documents would have existed at the time the CIA conducted the searches at issue, since they appear to have taken some time and effort to design. The Court will thus deny summary judgment for both parties on this issue and allow the CIA to explain in more detail, given the caselaw above, the basis for its decision not to undertake a search for records about the CIA's searches for the other records Plaintiffs requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether the CIA's Withholdings Were Proper\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although FOIA generally requires the disclosure of responsive records, it contains nine exemptions under which an agency can withhold them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Under Exemption 3, an agency may withhold information \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, ... if that statute ... requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(3)(A)(i). When an agency has invoked Exemption 3, the only questions for the reviewing court are (1) whether the statute the agency has identified does in fact exempt information from disclosure, and (2) whether the information the agency has withheld falls within the statute's scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CIA v.
