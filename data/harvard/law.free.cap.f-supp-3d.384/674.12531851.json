Binkley III, based on his involvement in an alleged orchestrated campaign to harass and damage Plaintiffs' reputations. The alleged campaign took the form of several emails in which Binkley and other investors/directors questioned O'Gara's academic credentials and ability to lead the company, all in an alleged attempt to undermine\n   other directors' and stockholders' confidence in the company and induce breaches of contract. Binkley seeks dismissal of this suit under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) arguing that the Complaint violates his rights of association and free speech and that O'Gara and Wanu Water fail to state any plausible claims for relief. Having been fully briefed, the Court finds that the TCPA does not apply in federal court, and thus, declines to grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to the TCPA. However, as discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 8) under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This dispute involves a series of allegedly defamatory emails and interactions between investors\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Wanu Water and the founder and president of the company, O'Gara. In 2010, O'Gara founded Wanu Water (formerly known as FLUROwater). Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6 7. The company is a Delaware corporation, based in California, and creates and sells nutrient-infused water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Binkley is a Texas investor in Wanu Water and as of July 2018, he owned a 0.13% share of the company's outstanding equity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Discussed in more detail below, the events giving rise to this lawsuit began in August 2018, when Binkley and other investors began emailing O'Gara, his legal counsel, and other investors regarding O'Gara's purported academic credentials and management concerns they had.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-68. Based on this conduct, Plaintiffs filed suit against Binkley on September 28, 2018, invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Although all the claims are brought under California law and based on the same alleged conduct, the claims are brought by O'Gara individually, Wanu Water individually, or by both Plaintiffs jointly. Specifically, O'Gara brings his own claims for tortious interference with business relations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-76; tortious interference with contract,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-84; and libel,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-91. Wanu Water brings its own claim for libel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 100-08. And both Plaintiffs bring claims for civil conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-99; and unfair and/or unlawful business practices in violation of California's unfair competition laws,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 5, 2018, Binkley filed this Motion to Dismiss under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) arguing that the Complaint violates his rights of association and free speech and that Plaintiffs otherwise fail to state any plausible claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8, Mot. to Dismiss.

Plaintiffs counter that California's anti-SLAPP statute should apply because even if Binkley made the statements in Texas-which they argue is unclear since his email signature lists a Nashville, Tennessee area code-Binkley cannot overcome the Restatement's presumption in favor of applying the law of a plaintiff's domicile-here, California.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Cuba v. Pylant\n   </em>\n   , Judge Graves authored a well-reasoned dissent disputing the majority's presumption that the TCPA applies. Instead, Judge Graves went on to conduct an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   analysis and concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   the TCPA is procedural and must be ignored. The TCPA is codified in the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, provides for a pre-trial motion to dismiss claims subject to its coverage, establishes time limits for consideration of such motions to dismiss, grants a right to appeal a denial of the motion, and authorizes the award of attorneys' fees if a claim is dismissed. This creates no substantive rule of Texas law; rather, the TCPA is clearly a procedural mechanism for speedy dismissal of a meritless lawsuit that infringes on certain constitutional protections. Because the TCPA is procedural, I would follow\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   's command and apply the federal rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 719 (internal citations omitted). Judge Graves went on to state that even if the TCPA were deemed substantive, it would still yield to federal law because it conflicts with federal procedural rules-namely with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56 because the TCPA heightens the pleadings standards and burdens of proof required to defeat an anti-SLAPP motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 719-20 (noting that to survive a motion to dismiss the TCPA requires evidence of a claim to be \"unambiguous, sure, or free from doubt,\" whereas Rule 12(b)(6) only requires facts sufficient to state a claim that are plausible on their face). Similarly in\n   <em>\n    Abbas v. Foreign Policy Group, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the D.C.

Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   And lastly, because O'Gara refused to submit to a third-party background check, Binkley and other board members and investors allegedly retained Corporate Resolutions to perform a background check on O'Gara based on information Binkley and others provided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Then, on August 21, 2018, based in part on this information and its own investigation, Corporate Resolutions issued its report on O'Gara, which O'Gara argues \"was incomplete, inaccurate, and the result of a less than thorough effort.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. The report noted all of O'Gara's degrees he touted as \"unconfirmed\" and summarized the investigatory steps Corporate Resolutions undertook in reaching those conclusions. Doc. 10, Def.'s App., 94. O'Gara alleges that the report was circulated; however, no where in the Complaint does O'Gara allege that Binkley in particular circulated the report or sent the report to any specific person. Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 87, 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With this background in mind, the Court now turns to whether Plaintiffs' allegations regarding these emails and background-check report state a libel claim. The only allegation of a false statement regarding O'Gara's academic credentials in Plaintiffs' complaint states: \"Binkley's suggestion that O'Gara did not attend schools that he did in fact attend were false and misleading.\" Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6 89. However, in his Complaint and briefing on this Motion, O'Gara fails to allege what institutions he attended or received degrees from. Regardless, interpreted in context, the Court finds that Binkley's questions regarding O'Gara's academic credentials or the background check were not focused on what academic institutions O'Gara did or did not attend, but whether the\n   <em>\n    degrees\n   </em>\n   he touted in the Private Placement Memorandum were in fact accurate. Furthermore, any potential false statements that O'Gara did not attend a certain school that he may have attended, but not received a degree from, are not reasonably capable of maintaining a defamatory meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masson v.

Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to allege that these statements were\n   false and that O'Gara in fact received these degrees.

Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6 31. Plaintiffs argue that these statements are defamatory because they suggest that Wanu Water was being mismanaged and performing poorly, despite the fact that a recently completed third-party report\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   on\n   the company and the company's financial performance at the time showed that the opposite was true.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is clear that the statements regarding O'Gara's academic credentials and the mismanagement of Wanu Water fall within the scope of the common-interest privilege provided by \u00a7 47(c)(2). The California Supreme Court has recognized this privilege as one that applies to a \"narrow range of private interests[:] The interest protected [is] private or pecuniary; the relationship between the parties [is] close, e.g., a family, business, or organizational interest; and the request for information must have been in the course of the relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Here, the statements were made in private emails and in an investor letter sent by Binkley and other investors addressed to O'Gara-the founder and president of the company they were invested in and who was significantly involved in the day-to-day operations of Wanu Water. All of the statements and questions-even those Plaintiffs do not specifically object to-were regarding either O'Gara's academic credentials he touted in company documents or the management and operation of Wanu Water. All of these matters are ones investors and board members are interested in since they can ultimately affect their pecuniary interests in Wanu Water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although Plaintiffs do not dispute that the common-interest privilege applies in this case, in other parts of their Response, Plaintiffs do argue that these communications were intended to have a disparaging effect on O'Gara and Wanu Water in part because \"[t]hese communications were sent or copied to most of Wanu's stockholders, many of whom did not follow the company on a daily basis and were unaware of facts concerning O'Gara.\" Doc. 20, Pls.' Resp., 17. However, even though Binkley did copy other board members and shareholders on the email, all of these people were either investors or then-board members in the company and many of them signed the investor letter sharing the same concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 10, Def.'s App., 82 (investor letter signed by six individuals who were either investors or board members and who were included in the email);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1, Ex. A, 1. The fact that other shareholders who did not sign the investor letter were also included in the email does not defeat the privilege since all the recipients were interested in Wanu Water. And Plaintiffs do not allege that these statements or questions were shared with anyone who was not involved with Wanu Water as an investor or board member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deaile v.

Therefore, the Court finds that the common-interest privilege\n   applies to the statements forming the basis of Plaintiffs' libel claims. Thus, the questions then becomes whether Plaintiffs have shown that these statements were made with actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The malice necessary to defeat a qualified privilege is 'actual malice' which is established by a showing that the publication was motivated by hatred or ill will towards the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   by a showing that the defendant lacked reasonable ground for belief in the truth of the publication and therefore acted in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Taus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20775\">\n    54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20P.3d%201185\">\n    151 P.3d at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). Plaintiffs argue the latter-that the statements were reckless and made without regard for their truth. Doc. 20, Pls.' Resp., 19-21. Ultimately, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs have shown that the questions regarding O'Gara's academic credentials or management of Wanu Water were made with the requisite malice necessary to defeat the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although the Court recognizes that questions into the operation of Wanu Water or O'Gara's academic credentials-by the mere fact that they were posed-may have suggested that Binkley and other investors believed Wanu Water was having operational issues or that the academic degrees were inaccurate, they have not been shown to be made with malice. For example, the investor letter O'Gara takes issue with begins with an introductory paragraph showing the legitimate motivation behind these questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   We are at the end of yet another reporting period with ZERO information, and ZERO transparency. We understand members of the Board are working very hard, and we appreciate that. However, we must express our concerns and ask questions. Please take them in a constructive light, we just want what is best for the company and the shareholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Doc. 10, Def.'s App., 82 (emphasis in original). Despite this introductory language, Plaintiffs ask this Court to infer actual malice on behalf of Binkley and other investors because the recently issued third-party report had completely discredited allegations regarding O'Gara's mismanagement and because the company's \"recent financial success also belies Binkley's allegations of mismanagement.\" Doc. 20, Pls.' Resp., 20. However, that report was allegedly not circulated to all investors in the company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6 25 (alleging that \"[n]o one at the Company, including any director, was authorized to share this Confidential Report to anyone outside of management or the Board\") And more importantly, even assuming it was widely circulated, based on the introductory language of the investor letter, the investors appear to not have been given information for the reporting period that proceeded the August 3, 2018 email; therefore, they still had reason to ask the questions contained in the investor letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 10, Def.'s App., 82. Also, even assuming that Wanu Water was highly successful at the time, the Court is unwilling to find that an investor's common-interest privilege to inquire into the management of a company exists only if a company is performing poorly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Next, to show actual malice regarding misstatements on O'Gara's academic credentials, O'Gara argues that the resume discrepancies Binkley circulated as well as the background check on O'Gara's academic credentials were \"incomplete, inaccurate, and the result of a less than thorough effort-in some instances reaching its conclusions based on a single phone call to various undergraduate and dental institutions O'Gara attended, and with no follow-up requests for\n   transcripts, diplomas, or other evidence.\" Doc. 20, Pls.' Resp., 20-21. Thus, O'Gara argues that these misrepresentations were reckless and made without regard for their truth.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20P.3d%201185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, to sustain a showing of actual malice requires more than mere negligence in inquiry or investigation.\n   <em>\n    Noel v.

Rptr. 3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222 (2003). Instead, actual malice is shown only when the \"negligence amounts to a reckless or wanton disregard for the truth, so as to reasonably imply a willful disregard for or avoidance of accuracy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). In this case, Binkley had independent grounds based on his own investigation and the background-check report issued by Corporate Resolutions to believe that he could at least question O'Gara regarding whether his purported academic credentials were valid. Therefore, even assuming that Binkley and Corporate Resolutions were negligent in how they conducted their investigations, that is not enough to show actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lastly, the Court notes that its holding is also guided by public policy concerns surrounding the interactions and inquiries that often must occur between investors and company management. Defamation law should not prevent shareholders from engaging in the type of reasonable and professional inquiry that Binkley undertook in this case-especially, as is the case here where the inquiry was made between other interested individuals. Although O'Gara and Wanu Water may have found the inquiry embarrassing, unpleasant, or otherwise unwelcome, the good that may be accomplished by allowing these types of inquiries-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , increased oversight and corporate accountability-outweighs the potential harm that may result. Thus, the common-interest privilege should protect these types of inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Therefore, in light of the standard required to show actual malice, and while drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to show that actual malice motivated Binkley and other investors in questioning O'Gara on his academic credentials and management of Wanu Water. Thus, these statements are subject to the common-interest privilege and Plaintiffs fail to state a libel claim under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    C. Tortious Interference With Business Relations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Next, Binkley seeks dismissal of O'Gara's claim for tortious interference with business relations. O'Gara brings this claim asserting that by sending the above-discussed emails, Binkley and others \"engaged in unlawful and unethical conduct in mounting a campaign to deliberately interfere with O'Gara's business relations.\" Doc. 1, Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.
