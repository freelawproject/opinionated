BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Although the Special Counsel's investigation into Russian election interference may have come to an end, this long-running litigation over the Comey Memos marches on. Since the existence of the Memos first came to light, Plaintiff Cable News Network has steadfastly sought copies of these documents, which were penned by then-Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to memorialize his meetings with President Trump. Last year, this Court ruled that the ongoing nature of the Special Counsel's investigation barred the records from release under the Freedom of Information Act. Much has changed since. Most notably, Defendant FBI publicly released lightly redacted copies of the Memos, and the Special Counsel's investigation has concluded. Still hoping to see what lies beneath the few remaining redaction boxes, CNN now renews its quest for disclosure. It also asks the Court to release an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declaration submitted by the Bureau to justify its withholding in this litigation's last go-round. The FBI resists both requests. Finding that the Government has partially - but not completely - met its burden on the Memos, the Court will grant in part and deny in part both the FBI's Motion\n   for Summary Judgment as well as Plaintiff's Cross-Motion. Presented with little meaningful opposition from Defendant to Plaintiff's Motion for Access to Judicial Records, moreover, the Court will also grant CNN's request to see the unredacted declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The purpose of such documentation, Comey later reported, lay in his concern that the President \"might lie about the nature of [their] meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    CNN II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523702\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/59/#p65\">\n    293 F.

Within a week, a\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   story catapulted the Memos to the forefront of public consciousness, galvanizing CNN and others to seek their release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523702\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/59/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523702\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/59/#p65\">\n    at 65-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a means to get its hands on these written narratives, CNN employed a well-known tool: the Freedom of Information Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Unhappy with the Government's rebuff of its request, Plaintiff filed suit here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unmoved, the FBI invoked a slew of FOIA exemptions, including 1, 3, 6, 7(C), and 7(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CNN II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523702\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/59/#p65\">\n    293 F.

Most notably, however, Defendant relied on the protection of Exemption 7(A), which shields documents whose release \"could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(A) - namely, the then-nascent Special Counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. To aid the Court in understanding why release could obstruct the investigation, the Government submitted two declarations from FBI Special Agent David W. Archey\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CNN II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523702\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/59/#p65\">\n    293 F.

But before much could happen in that legal proceeding, outside circumstances intervened. In response to a congressional request, the Department of Justice agreed to turn over copies of the Comey Memos to the Hill - its calculation altered, it appears, by the recent publication of Comey's memoir - but only after redacting what it deemed to be classified information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69, Attach. 3 (Def. Statement of Facts), \u00b6 14; ECF No. 70 (Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp.) at 27 (Pl. Statement of Facts), \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. The deletions were fairly minor, and these versions of the Memos soon found themselves splashed across the\n   front pages of multiple outlets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF, \u00b6 14; Pl. SOF, \u00b6 5. The FBI then followed suit. Believing that its tight-handedness could no longer be justified, it published the redacted versions of the Memos on its public site, which is dubbed the Vault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF, \u00b6 15. In light of these developments and \"subsequent statements by government officials that release of the memoranda would no longer adversely impact any ongoing investigation,\" the D.C. Circuit remanded the case to this Court for further proceedings without deciding the merits of Plaintiff's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cable News Network, Inc. v. FBI\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-5041,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203868760\">\n    2018 WL 3868760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 8, 2018). With the ball now back in this Court, the facts on the ground stand thus: the vast majority of the Memos have been publicly released, but some minor redactions remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FBI has again moved for summary judgment. It invokes multiple FOIA exemptions to justify keeping the redacted snippets of the Comey Memos from public view - namely, Exemptions 1, 3, and 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69, Attach. 1 (Def. MSJ) at 9, 17, 19. Believing the Government overzealous in its protectiveness, CNN, too, has moved for summary judgment, urging the Court to order release of the information underlying all 24 redactions remaining in the Memos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 6, 17, 18, 20. As in the last iteration of this investigation, the Court ordered the FBI to produce\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   unredacted versions of the Memos to the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of Mar. 28, 2019. This has been done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff has also taken another step in its efforts to deliver information withheld by the Government to the public eye. It filed a second motion in this case, this time seeking access to the two\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   Archey Declarations from the last round of briefing and a transcript of the sealed,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proceeding that the Court relied upon in its earlier Opinion. As the legal bases for this relief, it leans on both the First Amendment and common-law rights of access to judicial records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 72 (Pl. Access Mot.) at 1. On this count, the FBI has shown some flexibility. In response to CNN's Motion, Defendant released both Archey Declarations with redactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 76 (Def. Access Opp.) at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 74, Attach. 1, Exh. A (Redacted Third Archey Declaration) &amp; Exh. B (Redacted First Archey Declaration). Plaintiff, however, is not yet satisfied and maintains its request for access to the unredacted documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 78 (Pl. Access Reply) at 1-2. In order to provide thorough consideration, here, too, the Court required the Government to provide unredacted copies of the declarations at issue\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of Mar. 28, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite this already protracted saga, the tale is not yet over. Demonstrating, again, the ability of real-world events to outpace judicial proceedings, the Special Counsel announced the end of his investigation after the latest round of briefing in this case had been completed. Because the Government's opposition to releasing some of the materials requested by CNN relied, in part, on the ongoing nature of that investigation, the Court ordered the FBI to file a notice indicating whether the investigation's conclusion altered the positions taken in its briefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of Apr. 1, 2019. In response, the Government agreed to release one of the two Archey Declarations at issue in full and narrowed the redactions of the second.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79 (First Def. Response) at 2. A week later, the FBI filed another copy of this redacted declaration, removing again some of the claimed redactions and explaining its rationale for retaining the remainder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81 (Def. Notice) at 1. Defendant also withdrew its reliance on one\n   exemption - namely, Exemption 7(A), which protects information collected for ongoing law-enforcement proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Def. Response at 1. The import of that last concession is narrow, however. The FBI's invocation applied to only one redaction in the Comey Memos, and Defendant maintained that two other exemptions continued to shield this information from public release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203868760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Just a few days after this response from the Government, the Special Counsel's Report was publicly released in redacted form. As this disclosure, too, could affect the FBI's calculation, the Court sought to learn \"whether such release alters the Government's position in relation to any withheld portions of the Comey memos, the Archey Declaration, or the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proceeding.\" Minute Order of Apr. 18, 2019. Once again, this development resulted in a further softening of the Bureau's stance. More specifically, it dropped its objection to release of the transcript of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 84 (Second Def. Response) at 2. The Court thus ordered the Government to turn over that transcript to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of May 7, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Winnowed down over this lengthy history, what remains disputed are the propriety of 24 redactions to the Comey Memos and a handful of redactions to one Archey Declaration. After setting out the legal standards that govern its analysis, the Court will turn to the merits of these two legal quarrels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This Order establishes procedures and standards to govern the federal government's classification of records. It requires both substantive and procedural steps. On the\n   substantive side - the only disputed step here - the Executive Order demands that the information pass two separate standards. First, its disclosure must \"reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security.\" EO 13526, \u00a7 1.4. Second, the information must \"pertain[ ] to one of\" several possible categories, only one of which is at issue here: Section 1.4(d), which shields \"foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This provision, the Bureau maintains, covers the remaining redactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fifth Hardy Decl., \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CNN's challenge is straightforward.

Apparently, as the President was toasting PM May, he was explaining that she had been the first to call him after his inauguration and Flynn interrupted to say that [Redaction 2] had called (first, apparently). It was then that the President learned of [Redaction 3] call and he confronted Flynn about it (not clear whether that was in the moment or after the lunch with PM May). Flynn said the return call was scheduled for Saturday, which prompted a heated reply from the President that six days was not an appropriate period of time to return a call from the [Redaction 4] of a country like [Redaction 5] (\"This isn't [Redaction 6] we are talking about.\").

That rationale may very well suffice, it says, when the withheld information contains\n   <em>\n    negative\n   </em>\n   information about foreign countries or dignitaries.

As the public version of this Memo makes clear, however, redactions 1 through 5 and 7 contain only factual or positive statements; they alone reveal nothing about the\n   <em>\n    relative\n   </em>\n   importance assigned to foreign leaders. Disclosing these few redactions, further, would not risk revealing the remaining one -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , redaction 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   If the Bureau intends to argue more in its Reply brief, it fares no better.

It has not met this minimal burden here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Two notes are necessary before moving to the next category of redactions. First, the Court does not impose a categorical rule that a statement must be disparaging to fall under the Executive Order's protection under \u00a7 1.4(d). Far from it. It only concludes, consistent with other courts in this district and controlling law, that the FBI must set forth a logical connection between disclosure and damage to national security. In this factual circumstance, the Bureau has not articulated the links to forge such a chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the deficiency evident in Defendant's declaration does not extend to redaction 6. Given the statement and context, the Court has no trouble following the link offered by the FBI between disclosure and harm to national security. Although Plaintiff points out that \"President Trump has insulted any number of foreign countries and leaders using far sharper language,\" Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 9, that does not diminish the logical likelihood that an additional statement could cause additional harm. The plausible connection is evident. The Court, therefore, will uphold the Bureau's withholding of this redaction, but not the others in this group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   b. Redaction 20\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Skipping redactions 8 through 19 - which the Court has already held are properly protected by Exemption 3 - the next stop is redaction 20. In this part of his Memo, Comey states that Trump\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   then pivoted to the Russians wanting an apology from Bill O'Reilly. I said I had seen that and O'Reilly's reply, which was to \"call him in 2023.\" The President then said that O'Reilly's question about whether he respected Putin had been a hard one. [Redaction 20]. He said he does respect the leader of a major country and thought that was the best answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Comey Memos at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   According to the FBI, the redacted sentence contains \"a reference about the President's observation about responding to a question he was asked about Russian President Putin.\" Fifth Hardy Decl., \u00b6 38. \"In the context of other surrounding information,\" Hardy asserts, the \"disclosure of the redacted information could reasonably be expected to impart or adversely impact relations with the referenced countries, and thus, cause harm to national security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37 (explaining link between foreign relations and national security). Unlike some of the earlier redacted information, which is classified at the \"Confidential\" level, this information garnered the higher \"Secret\" classification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38. The FBI determined, therefore, that its disclosure could be expected to cause \"serious damage\" - as opposed to merely \"damage\" - to national security.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CNN offers a single rebuttal. It says that \"President Trump has already offered what is effectively every possible opinion one could have about Putin.\" Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 15. This \"broad array\" of statements \"renders implausible any argument that releasing this one additional\" observation could harm national security.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court does not see things the same way. As an initial matter, the FBI has offered a \"logical connection\" linking disclosure to a consequent harm to national security. It requires little explanation to establish that most confidential observations about a foreign leader - other than those that are patently laudatory, which\n   may require additional justification - could plausibly harm relations with that leader's country and thus adversely affect national security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528116\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/62/#p86\">\n    342 F.

Plaintiff's precise beef, it seems, is not with the links in this logical chain -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , if President Trump had uttered no other public statements, nothing in CNN's brief would undermine the FBI's rationale for disclosure here. Rather, it contends that any harm to foreign relations is muted by statements already in the public record. This rationale suffers from two primary deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   First, even granting CNN's premise that the President may have uttered \"effectively every possibly opinion one could have,\" its conclusion does not necessarily follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 15. Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, it is by no means \"implausible\" that a further observation stated by a President could have an additional impact on relations with the subject country. Other courts in this district have endorsed the intuitive proposition that official disclosure of information already in the public realm can nevertheless affect national security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edmonds v. FBI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098771\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/272/35/#p49\">\n    272 F.

Supp. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (D.D.C. 1991) ).

And here, the FBI determined that release would cause \"serious damage\" to national security and thus classified the information at the \"Secret\" level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fifth Hardy Decl., \u00b6 38. To the degree Plaintiff challenges the \"extent\" that disclosure would \"harm[ ] national security,\" Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 15, that argument finds no success here in light of Defendant's plausible calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court will, accordingly, permit the FBI to keep secret the text that lies beneath redaction 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   c. Redactions 21-24\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the last of the redactions occur in a description of a discussion between the two men concerning foreign leaders. Comey states that Trump\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   then switched topics and began to talk about Egypt and its leader, saying Obama didn't like the guy [Redaction 21].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   He mentioned the Coptic church bombings and how horrible they were. He said that three Americans had been killed by an Egyptian soldier and the Egyptian leader had raised it with him. I interrupted to say that I thought he meant [Redaction 22] and an incident in Jordan. He agreed and said [Redaction 23] had told him he wanted to bring the soldier to justice quickly, but that the FBI was in some way asking them to delay. He said [Redaction 24].

For much the same reasons as redaction 20, discussed above, the Bureau thus believes that release of these impressions could harm national security.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike that earlier redaction, however, the FBI applied the lower \"Confidential\" classification to this material.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As to redactions 22 and 23, the Government has not toed the line. The Court fails to see, quite simply, how the redacted information contains anything about Trump's \"impressions of specific foreign leaders.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Redaction 22 concerns a factual correction about a particular event, and redaction 23 contains information about what another foreign leader purportedly said\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   the President. Perhaps this information warrants protection in its own right, but if it does, it is not on the basis offered by the FBI. And because the Bureau has offered no other concrete explanation for its withholding, once this proffered rationale collapses, it is left with only abstract and conclusory statements about national security untethered to the specific information withheld. That is plainly not enough to carry its burden. The Government must offer the Court \"an adequate foundation to review[ ] the soundness of the withholding.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n    164 F.3d at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1763299,4332748\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/830/210/\">\n    830 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   218 ).

Supp. 2d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As for redactions 21 and 24, however, the story is different. The FBI's justification for the possible harm to national security that could result from sharing impressions of foreign leaders applies to this information. The Court finds no fault in this rationale for withholding. CNN's only response is to advocate for the categorical rule the Court rejected earlier. It contends that if the comments are positive, then they cannot possibly damage national security; if they are negative, they are by now too old to have any real impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp. at 16. The Court is unpersuaded by this position. The complex world of international diplomacy is a poor fit for such categorical statements, and Plaintiff's judgment about the degree of harm that might ensue from release matters little. Having reviewed the redactions\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court is satisfied that the FBI has met its burden here. Redactions 21 and 24 need not be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The final tally is now in: the FBI has properly justified its invocation of Exemption 3 for redactions 8 through 19 and Exemption 1 for redactions 6, 20, 21, and 24. These may continue to be withheld. The others - namely, redactions 1 through 5, 7, 22, and 23 - must be released, as the FBI has only asserted the protection of Exemption 1 here, which it failed to substantiate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Archey Declaration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With this tour of the Comey Memos complete, the Court moves to the last stop on its journey. In the previous iteration of this litigation, the FBI provided material in two\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations and one sealed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proffer to justify its decision to keep the Memos secret. In response to Plaintiff's Motion and this Court's probing, the Bureau has now publicly released both declarations - one in full and a second with redactions - and a transcript of the sealed proceeding. CNN is not satisfied. It wants unfettered access to all the FBI's submissions to this Court. What remains at issue, therefore, are approximately five redactions in a single declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff mounts its attack on two fronts. Both the First Amendment and common-law rights of access - two distinct but overlapping doctrines - entitle the public, CNN contends, to know what lies beneath the black boxes. In other words, CNN is not relying on FOIA or its status as a requester here; it acts simply as a member of the public. The Court begins with the common law. As this route gets Plaintiff to its desired destination, the Court need not wade into the parties' constitutional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"In the courts of this country - including the federal courts - the common law bestows upon the public a right of access to public records and documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Wash.

Although not stated in such explicit terms, what the FBI appears to argue is that this statute's strictures obviate the need to consider the applicability of the public's right to records; simply put, the Act supersedes this common-law right. Second, along similar lines, the Government invokes - although somewhat equivocally - the protection of FOIA Exemption 7(E).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275646\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/661/#p665\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court addresses the operation and applicability of each statute in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   a.

The question upon which the propriety of the FBI's withholding then turns is whether the six\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factors sufficiently tip the scales back in the Government's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Children's Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696756,7652381\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1406/\">\n    98 F.3d at 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will march through each prong in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   First is \"the need for public access to the documents at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696756,7652381\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This one favors Plaintiff. Although the Court sees little public value in the specific information that remains redacted, there is enormous public interest in the Comey Memos and documents related to their disclosure. The FBI does not argue to the contrary; in fact, it does not even mention this factor. The need for public access, therefore, counsels disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court next weighs \"the extent of previous public access to the documents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696756,7652381\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is little, in the end, helpful here. On the one hand, the FBI has already released the vast majority of the declaration. This previous public access seems to cut in favor of release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Previous access is a factor\n   which may weigh in favor of subsequent access.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fort Totten Metrorail Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836960\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/960/2/#p6\">\n    960 F.

Then again, the reason the FBI would like to keep the remaining redactions secret is, presumably, because the specific information is somehow distinct from what is in the public record. Defendant, however, offers no explanation or argument here. The Court thus concludes that this factor, too, tips in favor of access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Third, the Court considers \"the fact that someone has objected to disclosure, and the identity of that person.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Children's Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696756,7652381\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1406/\">\n    98 F.3d at 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On this prong, the Government makes a bit more progress. The FBI has objected to disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sixth Hardy Decl., \u00b6 6. Given that it is an agency tasked with national security, the Court takes this objection seriously. That said, \"litigants to this proceeding have a lesser claim to privacy than third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Hyatt v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273975\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/251/181/#p185\">\n    251 F. Supp. 3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (D.D.C. 2017) (citation omitted). The strength of any potential objection related to national security, moreover, is taken into account in the next two prongs, obviating the need to place much weight on it here. While the Court thus takes the FBI's objection into account, it \"do[es] not have the same strength as a third-party objection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273975\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/251/181/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The fourth and fifth prongs go hand in hand.

The National Security Act's protection for \"intelligence sources and methods\" - which the FBI says applies to the redactions here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sixth Hardy Decl., \u00b6 6 - favors withholding. Such a \"congressional judgment about the importance of maintaining ... confidentiality\" creates a privacy interest in favor of keeping the records from public view, which the Court must \"weigh heavily.\"\n   <em>\n    Metlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275646\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/661/#p665\">\n    865 F.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But beyond a brief nod to this Act in Hardy's declaration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sixth Hardy Decl., \u00b6 6, the Government does nothing to address the strength of the interests at play. To be sure, it repeatedly invoked the then-ongoing nature of the Special Counsel's investigation in its earlier briefing as a reason to keep the documents from public light.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Access Opp. at 5-6, 10. That investigation, however, has now come to an end. And with it, so has the strength of the Bureau's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant's brief and subsequent filings articulate no other basis for the Court to conclude that these two prongs favor withholding. Nor is it self-evident from the Court's review of the withheld information why secrecy is important here. Perhaps the redactions constitute \"superficially innocuous\" material that, in conjunction with other available data, may \"enable an observer to discover the identity of an intelligence source [or method].\"\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    471 U.S. at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198922\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/159/#p178\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FBI, however, has provided no such rationale, and the Court is not in the position to make such a determination without the Government's help. On the current record, therefore, these two prongs also provide little support for Defendant's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The sixth and final factor is \"the purposes for which the documents were introduced during the judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Children's Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696756,7652381\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1406/\">\n    98 F.3d at 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this prong, \"[t]he public's entitlement to judicial records is commensurate with the documents' importance to the judicial proceeding in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Leopold to Unseal Certain Elec. Surveillance Applications &amp; Orders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524332\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/300/61/#p96\">\n    300 F. Supp. 3d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (D.D.C. 2018). This is the \"single most important\"\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the FBI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   spills most of its ink on this prong, CNN still comes out ahead in the end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Government introduced the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declaration to persuade the Court to rule against CNN, which sought to inform the public about documents that were central to an investigation in the public eye. This Court relied on those declarations and noted their existence in its prior Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CNN II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523702\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/59/#p65\">\n    293 F. Supp. 3d at 66-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This sequence of events elevates the public's interest in disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Children's Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696756,7652381\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1406/\">\n    98 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1409 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting fact that documents were not \"expressly relied upon by the trial judge in his decision\" as reason for withholding). At first blush, therefore, the purposes for which the documents were introduced appear to cut heavily in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Not so fast, says the FBI. If the redacted information were released, Defendant counters, it would \"impair the very ... rights [defendants] seek to vindicate\" - namely, the exemptions to FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Access Opp. at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   321 ). Rather, the FBI continues, it is FOIA itself that should provide the appropriate framework here and submitting\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations is routine in such cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. That may be so.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275646\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/661/#p665\">\n    865 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that FOIA does not displace common-law right). The Court, however, has already found that the Government has fallen short of meeting its burden for invoking any FOIA exemption here. And if the FBI is not, in fact, entitled to the \"right\" it seeks to \"vindicate,\" then nothing in this prong counsels withholding the redacted information. The Court's initial take is also its final: the sixth\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factor stands on Plaintiff's side of the aisle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   All in all, Defendant's showing under the\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factors does not overcome the presumption in favor of disclosure. No factor overwhelmingly favors the Government; some, on the other hand, counsel strongly for disclosure, including the \"single most important\" one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On this record, Plaintiff must prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and will grant in part and deny in part Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. It will also grant Plaintiff's Motion for Access to Judicial Records. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
