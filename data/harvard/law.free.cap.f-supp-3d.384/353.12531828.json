About a year later, the immigration court mailed Pereira a more specific notice setting the date and time of the initial hearing, but the notice was sent to the wrong address. As a result, Pereira failed to appear and the immigration court ordered him removed in absentia. Several years later, Pereira was arrested and the immigration court reopened the removal proceeding. When Pereira applied for cancellation of removal and argued he had been continuously present in the United States for more than ten years, the immigration court denied his application on the grounds that the notice to appear had interrupted the ten-year period under the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The Supreme Court held that \"[a] notice that does not inform a noncitizen when and where to appear for removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under \u00a7 1229(a) ' and therefore does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.

The Court observed that \u00a7 1229(a)(2), which addresses changes in the time and place of removal proceedings, allows the government to give notice specifying a new time or place of the proceedings, which presupposes that the government has already specified an initial time and place.

The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   jurisdictional issue must be one of subject-matter jurisdiction. To begin with, a plain reading of the relevant regulation indicates that it references subject-matter jurisdiction. On its face,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) concerns whether a particular case is properly before an immigration court. Without\n   this propriety, an immigration court lacks authority to render any decisions regarding the issues raised. Any court action taken without this prescribed prerequisite is an extrajudicial act. This is the conceptual domain of subject-matter jurisdiction-- what the Supreme Court was speaking of when it stated that courts have a duty to ensure that their jurisdiction \"defined and limited by statute, is not exceeded.\" ... [T]he jurisdictional issue is not a matter of the person appearing before the court. It is, instead, an issue with the legally prescribed capacity of the court to act, and thus the subject-matter jurisdiction deficiency is non-waivable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Johnson,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5-6 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    Aftershocks\n   </em>\n   , another author takes the opposite view.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Just as Congress has set the parameters of the authority it has vested in Article III courts in various statutory grants of original jurisdiction, it has done the same for immigration courts. But the relevant statute is not section 1229. It is section 1229a. And the language of section 1229a(a)(1) is clear in delineating the classes of cases that an immigration court can hear: \"An immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.\" This is the entire scope of an immigration court's subject matter jurisdictional authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Hoffman,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The defendant received full timely notice of his hearings to determine removability. He participated fully in the hearings by the immigration judge. He received a full hearing, with no hint of prejudice or unfairness in immigration procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Banegas Gomez\n   </em>\n   decision by Judge Livingston for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have made this conclusion uncontestable. It also makes deciding whether or not defendant waived his objection to the immigration court's jurisdiction unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The motion to dismiss the indictment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   This opinion denying a motion to dismiss is based on the special factual situation of a full and fair hearing after notice of the hearing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
