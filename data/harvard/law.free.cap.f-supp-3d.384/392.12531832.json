R. Civ. P., to dismiss the claims against them in the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). INAP and the Blue Chip Defendants have additionally moved to dismiss the SAC for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P. Defendants Spectrum Media\n   Services LLC (\"Spectrum\") and Multiplier Capital LLC (\"Multiplier\") have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), Fed. R. Civ. P., joining in arguments made by the other moving defendants. For the reasons that follow, the Blue Chip Defendants', INAP's, and Costella Kirsch's motions to dismiss are granted. Multiplier's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted. Spectrum's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are alleged in the SAC and are assumed to be true for the purpose of addressing this motion. Plaintiff New London Associates, LLC (\"NLA\") is a software developer. NLA owns a federal copyright registration for a software program known as \"RTR.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011, NLA entered into an agreement with nonparty Twelvefold Media Inc. (\"Twelvefold\"), in which NLA agreed to provide the RTR software to Twelvefold in return for a promised payment, which was never received. NLA alleges that it installed the RTR software on an NLA server that was located at a server hosting space in New York City that it rented from INAP. INAP provided internet access to the servers so that the servers could be accessed via the internet by Twelvefold. The servers were subsequently moved to an INAP facility in Secaucus, New Jersey. NLA also provided Twelvefold with access to the source code to RTR via Github, an online source code hosting service that allows programmers to remotely access and modify the source code. As NLA alleges, this is generally accomplished by downloading a local copy of the source code, modifying that local copy, and then uploading the modified copy onto Github.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At an unspecified date, Twelvefold defaulted on its obligations to NLA. NLA alleges that, notwithstanding its failure to make the required payments to NLA, Twelvefold continued to use and modify the RTR software through Github. At an unspecified date, Twelvefold agreed to settle its debt to NLA in exchange for a discount and a guarantee of payment, but it defaulted on that obligation as well. Accordingly, NLA alleges that Twelvefold did not own and was not licensed to use RTR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2016, Twelvefold's assets were acquired by defendant Kinetic Social LLC (\"Kinetic\") in an asset sale completed under the \"supervision\" of Multiplier, the Blue Chip Defendants, and Costella Kirsch (collectively, the \"Financing Entities\"), as well as non-party Bridge Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Financing Entities allegedly conditioned their funding of Kinetic upon the distribution of the RTR software to Kinetic and to an escrow service. The SAC references an email from Chris McCleary, Kinetic's CFO, to Twelvefold and Costella Kirsch, stating \"Guys, we will need the entire code base in escrow before closing. Let us know what we can do to make this happen.\" NLA asserts that McCleary was also the \"agent\" of the Blue Chip Defendants. The SAC also references an email discussion regarding McCleary's request, in which Rich Ginn, a partner of Costella Kirsch, wrote \"Costella Kirsch is ok with this request.\" NLA also asserts that Multiplier was aware of McCleary's request and NLA's objections to it, but does not offer further details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   NLA alleges that, prior to the asset sale to Kinetic, Twelvefold's Chairman, Peter Horan, personally ordered employees of Twelvefold to transfer a copy of the RTR source code to Twelvefold's creditors, believed to include the Financing Entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SAC alleges that \"Horan and other Twelvefold personnel were ordered to carry out copying the RTR source repository and distribute it to Kinetic in New York and to an escrow service.\" At Twelvefold's instruction, a new source code repository was established with Atlassian, which is a competitor of Github.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   NLA repeatedly objected to the transfer of the RTR software. NLA's CEO personally informed Twelvefold and Costella Kirsch that NLA owned the rights to RTR and had not been paid for it. NLA alleges that it is aware of emails exchanged during the period between May and June of 2016 between Twelvefold, Kinetic, Costella Kirsch, and a Blue Chip Defendant regarding the RTR software and NLA's claim to ownership thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The SAC alleges that the Financing Entities \"gained control\" over Twelvefold and Kinetic through \"lending, equity, or other financial transactions,\" but the details of those transactions and the Financing Entities' role in them are not described in the SAC. The Financing Entities \"partially or completely owned and/or controlled both Twelvefold and Kinetic.\" Various personnel from the lending entities participated actively in the asset sale as well as in the management and operations of Kinetic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the asset sale, Kinetic issued a one million dollar note (the \"Note\") to NLA for a \"setup fee, as well as a separate equipment rental agreement for NLA's servers,\" which were located at INAP's facility in New Jersey. Kinetic defaulted on the Note and the rental agreement in 2016. To date it has not paid for its use of RTR, despite continuing to use the software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   NLA filed suit against Kinetic for nonpayment of its obligations under the Note in New York Supreme Court in November 2017 and obtained an $ 893,570.09 judgment against Kinetic on May 18, 2018. Also in 2017, NLA filed an action in New Jersey Superior Court against INAP and Kinetic. In March 2018, NLA obtained an order of replevin from that court to repossesses its servers from INAP and Kinetic, as well as a judgment against Kinetic related to Kinetic's unpaid lease agreement with NLA. NLA alleges that INAP has refused to provide access to the servers in accordance with the order of replevin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the pendency of the New Jersey action, Kinetic sold its assets, including the RTR software, in a private asset sale to Spectrum Media Services LLC (\"Spectrum\"). NLA alleges that the sale was conducted with the knowledge and consent of the Financing Entities because their personnel were copied on \"notices and correspondence\" concerning the sale on November 14, 2017. Multiplier and the Blue Chip Defendants are alleged to have had control over Spectrum through their investments in that company, and to have caused the RTR software to be copied and transferred from Kinetic to Spectrum. NLA again contacted the Blue Chip Defendants to object to the sale of the RTR software. Spectrum has continued to access and modify the RTR software through\n   NLA's Github repository as recently as April 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In March 2018, an INAP employee in New York informed NLA that, at Spectrum's request, it had set up a high-speed network connection between NLA's servers located in INAP's facility in Secaucus, New Jersey, and Spectrum's servers in that same facility. Such a connection is known as a \"cross connect\" and involves physically connecting the two servers using network cables. NLA alleges that this \"cross connect\" was used to copy the RTR software from NLA's servers onto Spectrum's servers. NLA did not consent to the establishment of the cross connect or the copying of the RTR software onto Spectrum's servers. NLA further alleges that INAP personnel in New Jersey, at the direction of an INAP employee in New York, provided access to the locked cage in which its servers were stored and installed the cross connect cable. NLA had notified INAP of the ongoing legal proceedings against Kinetic and had specifically instructed INAP that no access to the servers was to be allowed. The SAC alleges that NLA's contracts with INAP, including a \"Master Services Agreement\" (\"MSA\"), do not allow INAP to provide third parties with access to equipment or software, and that INAP has a \"general policy\" against permitting such access. NLA also requested that INAP shut down NLA's servers, but INAP refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   NLA commenced this action against Kinetic, Spectrum, and INAP on August 20, 2018, asserting three claims for copyright infringement. On October 30, NLA filed a first amended complaint (\"FAC\"), which added the Financing Entities (Costella Kirsch, the Blue Chip Defendants, and Multiplier) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (\"WAB\") as defendants. The FAC also added claims for breach of contract, conversion, and tortious interference under New York law, as well as claims under the New Jersey Computer Act (\"NJCA\") and the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"). After multiple defendants filed motions to dismiss the FAC, an Order of November 29 directed NLA to file any further amended complaint by December 21 and advised NLA that it was unlikely to have a further opportunity to amend. NLA filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") on December 21, thereby mooting the motions to dismiss. The SAC asserts the same claims as the FAC against the same defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kinetic has not appeared and has not answered any of the complaints filed in this action. Accordingly, an Order of Default was entered against Kinetic on March 14, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 16, 2019, Spectrum and Multiplier answered the SAC, and the Blue Chip Defendants, INAP, WAB, and Costella Kirsch moved to dismiss the SAC for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. The Blue Chip Defendants and INAP additionally moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P. WAB was voluntarily dismissed from this action on January 30, 2019. The motions to dismiss became fully submitted on February 15, 2019. On February 22, Spectrum and Multiplier moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), Fed. R. Civ. P., joining in arguments made by the other moving defendants. Those motions became fully submitted on March 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.

INAP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   INAP is subject to specific personal jurisdiction in New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   NLA and Spectrum are New York-based companies. NLA's claims against INAP arise out of its contract with INAP and out of allegedly tortious conduct by INAP in New York.

The Blue Chip Defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Blue Chip Defendants each have their principal places of business in Ohio and are incorporated in Ohio and Delaware. NLA has made a prima facie showing that the Blue Chip Defendants are subject to specific personal jurisdiction in New York. NLA has alleged that, while in New York, the Blue Chip defendants entered into transactions with Twelvefold and Kinetic -- both New York entities. NLA's claims against the Blue Chip Defendants arise from those transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II. Venue\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   INAP has moved to dismiss on the ground that this lawsuit has been filed in the wrong venue. It seeks to enforce the forum selection clause in its contract with NLA. Its motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   NLA's claims against INAP in this action are foreclosed by the broad and mandatory forum selection clause contained in the MSA. NLA bases its breach of contract claim on \"a contract between NLA and INAP, including but not limited to the Master Services Agreement.\" It then purports to quote from that alleged contract. NLA did not attach any written contract to its SAC. In connection with its motion to dismiss, INAP has submitted a copy of what it asserts is its MSA with NLA. Puzzlingly, NLA now disclaims having ever signed that MSA -- or indeed, any MSA -- with INAP, despite quoting from it in the SAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   INAP, in its reply, has submitted a sales order executed between it and NLA on January 8, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That sales order was signed by David Simon on NLA's behalf, and incorporated the MSA by reference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MSA contains a broad forum selection clause, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement\n   <em>\n    shall be\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    brought in\n   </em>\n   a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Atlanta, Georgia\n   </em>\n   . Customer [NLA] consents to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the state and/or federal courts located in Atlanta, Georgia and waives (a) any objection to jurisdiction or venue, or (b) any defense claiming lack of jurisdiction or improper venue, in any action brought in such courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis supplied.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Second Circuit has set forth a four-part test for determining whether to dismiss a claim based on a forum selection clause. That test asks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) whether the clause was reasonably communicated to the party resisting enforcement; (2) whether the clause is mandatory or permissive, i.e., whether the parties are required to bring any dispute to the designated forum or simply permitted to do so; and (3) whether the claims and parties involved in the suit are subject to the forum selection clause. If the forum clause was communicated to the resisting party, has mandatory force and covers the claims and parties involved in the dispute, it is presumptively enforceable. A party can overcome this presumption by (4) making a sufficiently strong showing that enforcement would be unreasonable or unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Starkey v.

Copyright Infringement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   NLA's copyright claims against Spectrum survive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Spectrum's only argument with respect to NLA's copyright claims is that these are barred by the doctrine of election of remedies. They argue that, because NLA already obtained a judgment from the New York Supreme Court against Kinetic for breach of its Note, it cannot also recover in copyright. This argument is unpersuasive. While it is generally true that a plaintiff is not entitled to recover twice for the same injury, it is not clear on the face of the SAC that the NLA's award against Kinetic from the New York Supreme Court is addressed to the same injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The one million dollar Note that Kinetic gave to NLA was allegedly for a \"setup fee.\" The Blue Chip Defendants have submitted a copy of that Note, which is integral to the complaint, with their moving papers. There is no indication on the face of that document that the Note was given in exchange for a license to use the RTR software, or in satisfaction of Twelvefold's obligations to NLA. Rather, it recites that the Note was given \"in connection with an infrastructure service setup fee for services to be provided by [NLA] to [Kinetic].\" NLA alleges that it performed the promised services, and Kinetic defaulted on the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The moving defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   observe that the obligations memorialized in the Note are contingent on an asset purchase agreement between Kinetic and Bridge Bank for the assets of Twelvefold. This has little relevance to the analysis. The Note does not define or describe Twelvefold's assets, and the core allegation of the SAC is that the RTR software was not an asset of Twelvefold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   While NLA has pleaded a claim of direct infringement by Spectrum, it has not pleaded sufficient facts to plausibly allege a claim for direct infringement against any of the Financing Entities. NLA simply alleges, in a conclusory manner, that the Financing Entities directly infringed NLA's copyright by distributing RTR to Kinetic, and then to Spectrum, in connection with the asset sales. Beyond conclusory assertions, nothing in the SAC describes any act or acts taken by any of the Financing Entities that could plausibly be understood to constitute direct infringement. Indeed, the gravamen of the SAC is that other parties copied and distributed the RTR software. NLA's claims for direct infringement against the Financing Entities, therefore, must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   B. Contributory Infringement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   NLA has also failed to state a claim for contributory infringement against the Financing Entities. It has not plausibly alleged that they induced or encouraged the direct infringement by Kinetic\n   or Spectrum; it has not pleaded sufficient non-conclusory facts to \"nudge[ ] [its] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible....\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   NLA has cited email communications in which Kinetic's Chris McCleary directed Twelvefold personnel to place the software in escrow for eventual transfer to Kinetic. A conclusory allegation that McCleary was also acting as the Blue Chip Defendants' \"agent\" is insufficient to satisfy NLA's Rule 8 pleading burden. The existence of a principal-agent relationship is a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Alitalia Airlines, S.p.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048565\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/448/#p462\">\n    347 F.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462 (2d Cir. 2003). \"Establishment of such relationship requires facts sufficient to show (1) the principal's manifestation of the intent to grant authority to the agent, and (2) agreement by the agent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048565\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/448/#p462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although NLA alleges elsewhere in the complaint that McCleary is a current Managing Director and former Venture Partner of Blue Chip Venture Company Ltd.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the SAC contains insufficient factual allegations to support a legal conclusion that McCleary was acting as Blue Chip's agent at the time he sent this email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   NLA has also cited to an email in which a partner of Costella Kirsch stated that Costella Kirsch was \"okay with\" McCleary's request to transfer the software to escrow prior to Kinetic's purchase of Twelvefold's assets. This falls short of NLA's burden under Rule 8 to plausibly allege that Costella Kirsch knowingly induced, caused, or materially contributed to Kinetic's infringement. NLA has made no factual allegations to support an inference that Costella Kirsch had any involvement at all in Spectrum's alleged infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The sole non-conclusory factual allegation regarding Multiplier's involvement in the alleged infringement is the existence of unspecified communications making Multiplier aware of NLA's objections to the transfer of the RTR software. This is similarly insufficient to satisfy NLA's burden to plead contributory infringement under Rule 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   C. Vicarious Infringement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   NLA has also failed to state a claim against any of the Financing Entities for vicarious infringement. In support of its claims for vicarious infringement, NLA makes several conclusory allegations regarding the Financing Entities' ownership and control of Twelvefold, Kinetic, and Spectrum. It is well settled that corporate ownership and control is insufficient to establish vicarious liability for torts committed by a corporate entity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    524 U.S. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    141 L.Ed.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Moreover, NLA's allegations that certain individuals who were affiliated with the Financing Entities also had roles in the management and operation of Twelvefold, Kinetic, or Spectrum are insufficient to state a claim for vicarious liability. NLA's allegations in this respect are vague and conclusory and fail to satisfy its Rule 8 pleading burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   D. State Law Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   NLA's claims for conversion, tortious interference, and violation of the NJCA are preempted by the federal Copyright Act. A state law claim is preempted by the Copyright Act when a plaintiff \"seeks to vindicate a legal or equitable right that is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of\n   copyright as specified by section 106.\"\n   <em>\n    Forest Park Pictures v.

The SAC alleges that the defendants \"converted the computer hardware, software, and intellectual property of NLA for their own use.\" This is simply a restatement of NLA's claims under the Copyright Act for unlawful copying and distribution. The conversion claims are not \"qualitatively different\" from NLA's copyright claims. The allegation that certain defendants physically interfered with NLA's property by accessing their servers and establishing a \"cross connect\" does not save the conversion claim. \"Conversion requires not merely temporary interference with property rights, but the unauthorized dominion and control to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor.\"\n   <em>\n    Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914523\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/723/195/#p201\">\n    723 F.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201 (1983). For that reason, the Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Harper &amp; Row\n   </em>\n   that \"[m]erely removing one of a number of copies of a manuscript (with or without permission) for a short time, copying parts of it, and returning it undamaged, constitutes far too insubstantial an interference with property rights to demonstrate conversion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1914523\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/723/195/#p201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same principle applies here -- merely accessing NLA's server and temporarily attaching a cross connect for the purposes of copying and distributing the RTR software do not constitute an act of conversion that is qualitatively different from the act of copyright infringement. The gravamen of the claim is still the copying and distribution of the RTR software. Count 5 of the SAC must therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   NLA's claims for tortious interference are also preempted by the Copyright Act. The basis of NLA's tortious interference claim is that the defendants tortiously interfered with NLA's business relationships with Kinetic and Spectrum by inducing them to copy and distribute the RTR software without paying for it. Again, this simply restates NLA's claims under the Copyright Act, and does not qualitatively differ from those claims. Count 6 of the SAC must therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   NLA's claims under the NJCA are also preempted by the Copyright Act. NLA notes that the NJCA requires an \"extra element\" that its copyright claims do not -- unauthorized access to a computer. Merely accessing a computer, however, is insufficient to establish liability under the NJCA. Rather, a plaintiff must show that it was \"damaged in business or property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    P.C. Yonkers, Inc. v. Celebrations the Party and Seasonal Superstore, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280338\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/504/#p508\">\n    428 F.3d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508 (3d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). In order to sustain a claim under the NJCA, NLA must therefore show that the defendants did more than \"gain access to their information.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nickelodeon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335134\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/262/#p277\">\n    827 F.3d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"something more\" here is that the defendants deprived NLA of revenue by accessing, copying, and distributing the RTR software. Again, this merely restates NLA's copyright claims. The conduct for which NLA seeks to recover under the NJCA is not \"qualitatively different\" from the conduct that forms the basis of its copyright claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   E. CFAA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   NLA's CFAA claim fails because it has failed to adequately allege that it suffered losses that are compensable under that statute. Although NLA has alleged that it had ten or more computers in a locked cage at INAP's datacenter when that cage was accessed by INAP and Spectrum, it has not alleged any damage to those computers. NLA has also alleged that it has suffered damages that exceed $ 5,000 because, prior to Spectrum's infringement, Kinetic offered to pay \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" as a setup fee, which Spectrum declined to pay. There is no allegation, however, that these alleged economic losses arose from damage to, or interoperability of, any of the allegedly accessed computers. Rather, NLA's claim for damages under the CFAA is merely duplicative of its claim for copyright damages. These damages are not compensable under the CFAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Blue Chip Defendants' January 16, 2019 motion to dismiss is granted. Costella Kirsch's January 16 motion to dismiss is granted. INAP's January 16 motion to dismiss is granted without prejudice to NLA refiling its claims in the appropriate venue. Multiplier's February 22 motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted. Spectrum's February 22 motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted in part; the copyright infringement claims against it survive to the extent that NLA seeks actual damages and an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Blue Chip Venture Company Ltd. asserts that it is not a proper defendant in this action because it has no relationship with any of the parties or the transactions at issue, but rather is a management company for an unrelated fund that is not an investor or participant in any of the entities relevant to this action.
