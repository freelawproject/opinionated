FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was hired by Shell in August 2012 in the position of ID Process Technician in the Alpha Olefins and Isomerization Unit (\"AOID Unit\") at the Geismer Plant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that she has worked in this capacity for Shell despite the fact that she suffers from a lifelong condition of scoliosis and back pain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shell had an attendance management policy that informed employees of the \"company's expectations regarding attendance: be at work on time; make every reasonable effort to minimize the amount of time away from work; notify your immediate supervisor promptly when not able to be at work as scheduled; and comply with the medical documentation/notification requirements set forth within the policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chargeable offenses include unexcused absences or absences that do not qualify for FMLA leave or an employee's failure to notify the supervisor that he/she is going to miss his/her shift.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After an employee exceeds two incidents within a twelve-month period and has received a counseling session, the employee is subject to the formal discipline process. The formal discipline process in place includes: an oral reminder which includes a written document; a written reminder; and a decision-making leave. Additional absences may result in higher discipline including termination of employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant contracted with the Reed Group to facilitate all FMLA leave requests and authorizations. It is the employee's responsibility to submit the appropriate medical certifications to the Reed\n   Group within the allotted time to obtain approved FMLA leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that in the twelve-month period leading to Plaintiff's termination, she had the following unapproved absences that did not qualify for FMLA leave: Feb. 22, 2015;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Apr. 8, 2015;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   June 22, 2015;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   July 16, 2015; Sept. 4, 2015; Nov. 9, 2015; Feb. 10, 2016; Feb. 22, 2016; and Feb. 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff disputes some of the dates listed as unapproved absences or leave. Plaintiff disputes July 16, 2015, arguing that she left work two hours before the end of her shift because she did not feel well. She claims to have sought medical treatment at an emergency room in Thibodeaux, Louisiana. She claims that her medical issues were related to being \"picked on\" at work. Plaintiff cites to no admissible evidence to support these \"facts\". Plaintiff also argues that leaving work early does not equate to a \"chargeable absence\" under Shell's policy and suggests that this incident was a \"non-occupational disability\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff similarly disputes November 9, 2015 because she missed work due to a medical appointment \"connected to an occupational disability\" that should have been considered a \"non-FMLA Occupational Health Issue\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, Plaintiff does not direct the Court to any admissible evidence in support of her \"facts\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff contends that she took \"intermittent FMLA leave\" from September 2014 through March 2015 due to her neck and lower back pain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also disputes Defendant's labeling of her absences or calling in to work as sick as \"occurrences\" that were used against her in the\n   formal disciplinary process. Plaintiff contends that if an employee is scheduled for overtime work and calls in sick, it is not considered an \"occurrence\" for discipline purposes. Plaintiff contends that she was treated unfairly in this respect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant argues that unsuccessful counseling sessions took place with Plaintiff, after which she received an oral reminder memorialized in writing and a written reminder. This purportedly qualified for the first two steps in Shell's formal disciplinary process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The written reminder is dated March 10, 2016, and Plaintiff does not dispute receiving the written reminder on this date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that the \"occurrences\" that are outlined in the written reminder \"were undeserved,\" and this was communicated to Chad Mason (\"Mason\"), Human Resources Account Manager, at Shell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the very next day, March 11, 2016, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was operating her vehicle, she was involved in a one-vehicle accident, was arrested and issued a citation for driving while intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff testified that the accident occurred some time before midnight on March 10, 2016, and that she was scheduled to report to work at 4:30 a.m. on March 11, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the accident, it is undisputed that Plaintiff called Harlan Hart (\"Hart\"), a supervisor at Shell, just before or around midnight and advised that she was in an accident, that she would not be in to work, and that it should be coded as \"sick\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that she was experiencing back pain due to the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record evidence does not reflect that Plaintiff applied for FMLA leave for March 11, 2016, which was a Friday. She later applied for FMLA leave beginning March 14 or 15, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant contends that \"after an investigation\", Shell decided to terminate Plaintiff. After several attempts to reach Plaintiff by telephone, Shell sent Plaintiff a letter terminating her employment. The first termination letter was dated March 30, 2016, but it was not delivered; therefore, Defendant issued the identical letter dated April 5, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff admits receiving these letters on \"March 30, 2016, and later on April 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   \".\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was terminated\n   for allegedly failing \"to show up/properly report off for scheduled work\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff disputes the reason for her termination and argues that she was on FMLA leave at the time she was terminated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also contends that she had properly reported her leave, provided the necessary medical information to the Reed Group, and understood that most of her \"absences\" were approved and not considered \"occurrences\" subject to formal discipline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant terminated her because of her back pain and medical treatment which was perceived as a disability in violation of the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC on July 11, 2016, alleging that she had been terminated in violation of the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant, averring that Defendant violated the FMLA and the ADA. Specifically, Plaintiff asserted the following claims: (1) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202614\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) of the FMLA for failure to restore to an equivalent position;\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) of the FMLA for interference with the exercise of FMLA rights; (3) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) of the ADA for disability discrimination; and (4) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(A) and (B) of the ADA\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   for failure to make reasonable accommodations and denying employment opportunities\n   on the basis of a disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination under the FMLA and ADA and for claims of interference with Plaintiff's FMLA rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to offer evidentiary support necessary to prevail on her claims and to defeat summary judgment. Defendant further contends that the uncontroverted evidence shows that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's reasons for termination were merely pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted if the record, taken as a whole, \"together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"When assessing whether a dispute to any material fact exists, we consider all of the evidence in the record but refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has interpreted the plain language of Rule 56(c) to mandate \"the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   A party moving for summary judgment \"must 'demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,' but need not negate the elements of the nonmovant's case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the moving party \"fails to meet this initial burden, the motion must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If the moving party meets this burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmovant to go beyond the pleadings and show by affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, or other admissible evidence that specific facts exist over which there is a genuine issue for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The nonmovant's burden may not be satisfied by conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, metaphysical doubt as to the facts, or a scintilla of evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Factual controversies are to be resolved in favor of the nonmovant, \"but only when there is an actual controversy, that is, when both parties have submitted evidence of contradictory facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will not, \"in the\n   absence of any proof, assume that the nonmoving party could or would prove the necessary facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unless there is sufficient evidence for a jury to return a verdict in the nonmovant's favor, there is no genuine issue for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court \"has no duty to search the record for material fact issues.

Without countervailing Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Statement of Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n   , but in an effort to demonstrate a dispute of material facts, Plaintiff offers\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Sworn Declaration of Leah Michelle Amedee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 43 other exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant challenges Plaintiff's statement of disputed facts because it contains \"conclusory statements of opinion and unfettered argument\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Defendant challenges Paragraph 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   Paragraph 15\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Plaintiff's statement of disputed facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conclusory statements without proper support do not meet the requirements of Rule 56(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   After reviewing Paragraphs 1 and 15 of Plaintiff's statement of disputed facts, the Court agrees with Defendant and finds that these paragraphs of Plaintiff's statement are conclusory or argumentative statements of opinion without any factual or evidentiary support. Accordingly, the Court will not consider Paragraphs 1 and 15 of\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant next argues, \"[e]ven where she does offer facts, they are almost entirely without support: only four of eighteen 'facts' contain any citation whatsoever.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendant does not cite to or challenge any specific paragraphs of Plaintiff's statement of disputed facts on these grounds. While the Court is able to determine which statements contain citations to purported factual and evidentiary support, the Court is unclear to which \"facts\" Defendant contends are \"without support\" and whether Defendant is seeking to strike all statements that contain no citation whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant continues, \"[a]nd the e-mails and other documents that she does cite are also defective because they consist of unauthenticated hearsay and/or pertain to facts that are not material to Shell's motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court construes Defendant's argument to be that Plaintiff (1) did not support her statements of disputed facts by citing to proper evidentiary support, and (2) where Plaintiff did cite to purported support for her statement of fact, the document was not proper evidence because it was unauthenticated hearsay or immaterial to the motion before the Court. With that in mind, the Court considers\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts\n   </em>\n   with the exception of Paragraphs 1 and 15 which have already been ruled upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Paragraphs 5-18, 20-21, and 23 of\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts\n   </em>\n   do not contain any citation to any evidentiary support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   A party asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support\n   the assertion by (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or (B) showing that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-35\">\n   But merely stating that a fact is disputed, as the plaintiffs did in their statement, is not sufficient to establish a genuinely disputed factual issue. Instead, as explained in Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1), a party asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by citing to the record or showing that cited materials establish a genuine dispute. There is not a single record citation in the plaintiffs' statement.... The plaintiffs' effort in opposing the defendants' motion for summary judgment fell short of establishing any genuinely disputed issues of material fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds that the same holds true here. Plaintiff's statement of \"disputed facts\" is insufficient where Plaintiff has not cited to the record and evidentiary support. As such, the Court will not consider Paragraphs 5-18, 20-21, and 23 of\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court turns to consideration of Paragraphs 2-4, 19, and 22 of\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragraph 2 of Plaintiff's statement asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Leah Amedee was examined by her physician on November 7, 2014 and Dr[.] Isaza concluded, 'I spoke with Leah about work.

The Fifth Circuit and Middle District of Louisiana have frequently noted that unauthenticated documents are not competent summary judgment evidence under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Similarly, hearsay documents are not competent\n   summary judgment evidence under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with the basis of Defendant's challenge to Paragraph 2 of Plaintiff's statement of facts. The statement contained in Paragraph 2 relies upon unauthenticated/hearsay documents that are insufficient evidence for purposes of summary judgment.

It is not for the Court to guess or speculate as to Defendant's grounds for same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Court will consider Paragraph 3 of\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Paragraph 4 of\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Material Facts\n   </em>\n   avers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-42\">\n   The series of 'Return to Work' examinations which Amedee was subjected to in December 2014 was impermissible because it failed to meet the criteria established by the FMLA and its implementing regulations.

She attests that she has worked in training status on the Control Board,\n    which, presumably, provided her with the background to attest to the quoted matters. However, while the attestations appear to be based on personal knowledge (given Plaintiff's work history and experience), the statement invites the Court to make a credibility determination as to whether Plaintiff's opinions (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \"it does not matter if you occasionally come in late\"; \"allowed to make up the time\"; \"was not responsible for operations or making relief of another employee\") are well-founded and based in fact. As stated previously, it is not proper for a Court to make credibility determinations and make findings of fact on summary judgment. Therefore, the Court declines to consider Paragraph 22 of Plaintiff's declaration as a statement of undisputed fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Paragraph 35 of Plaintiff's declaration contains statements regarding Guba, a supervisor to Plaintiff's direct supervisor, and the scope of his duties as supervisor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     96\n    </footnotemark>\n    After reviewing Paragraph 35 of the declaration, the Court finds that Plaintiff did not lay the proper foundation to evidence that this affiant possesses personal knowledge about this subject.\n    <footnotemark>\n     97\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court will not consider Paragraph 35 of the declaration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Defendant challenges Paragraphs 12 and 29 of the declaration because these attestations contain argument rather than fact.\n    <footnotemark>\n     98\n    </footnotemark>\n    On review of Paragraph 12\n    <footnotemark>\n     99\n    </footnotemark>\n    and Paragraph 29,\n    <footnotemark>\n     100\n    </footnotemark>\n    the Court agrees that these attestations contain unsupported argument and opinion and are not statements of fact.\n    <footnotemark>\n     101\n    </footnotemark>\n    For the reasons set forth herein, these paragraphs will not be considered by the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Defendant objects to Paragraph 28 of the declaration as it contradicts statements in Plaintiff's \"disputed facts\" or prior deposition testimony.\n    <footnotemark>\n     102\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendant specifically compares Paragraph 28 of the declaration to Paragraph 22 of Plaintiff's statement of disputed facts. Defendant does not direct the Court to deposition testimony that contradicts the declaration; therefore, the Court is not in a position to determine whether attestations and prior testimony are conflicting. Specifically, Defendant argues that Paragraph 28 of the declaration reflects a termination date of \"April 8\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    \" and \"April 5\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    \", representing conflicting dates within the same\n    paragraph,\n    <footnotemark>\n     103\n    </footnotemark>\n    and Paragraph 22 of the statement of contested facts reflects a termination date of \"April 24, 2016\".\n    <footnotemark>\n     104\n    </footnotemark>\n    Paragraph 22 of the statement of contested facts has previously been determined to be disregarded by the Court for the reasons previously stated. Regarding the conflict within Paragraph 28, the precise date is unimportant to the Court's analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Defendant challenges Paragraphs 3 and 13 of the declaration on the grounds that they are not material to the issues in this case.\n    <footnotemark>\n     105\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendant does not offer any grounds or authority to support its challenge to these paragraphs other than a brief statement that the attestations are not material to the present motion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     106\n    </footnotemark>\n    Based on these grounds alone, the Court will not disregard these paragraphs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     3.

These courts misread\n    <em>\n     Nero.\n    </em>\n    It is true that an employer may not fail to reinstate an employee following his return from FMLA leave,\n    <em>\n     but only if the statutory requirements have been satisfied.\n    </em>\n    Among those requirements is one dictating that an employee must actually be entitled to the position to which he seeks reinstatement,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202614\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3) ; and an employer may challenge that entitlement by offering evidence that the employee would have lost his position even had he not taken FMLA leave,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.216\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). Thus, although denying an employee the reinstatement to which he is entitled generally violates the FMLA, denying reinstatement to an employee whose right to restored employment had already been extinguished - for legitimate reasons unrelated to his efforts to secure FMLA leave - does not violate the Act. Although we might have been clearer in\n    <em>\n     Nero\n    </em>\n    , we in fact considered the employer's reasons for terminating the employee, which, of course, would have been unnecessary had those reasons been irrelevant.\n    <footnotemark>\n     128\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The reasoning above is equally applicable in the present case.

Approval of FMLA leave does not create the guarantee of employment. FMLA was intended to guarantee the ability to take leave without risk of loss of employment.

She claims that she has been forced to receive Medicaid benefits, which does not afford her the same treatment as she had in the past when she had \"flare-ups\".\n    <footnotemark>\n     208\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff claims that this is sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable factfinder that since she was able to defeat previous flare-ups of back pain, there is no reason to believe that she could not have done so here.\n    <footnotemark>\n     209\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Although not argued by Plaintiff, the Court notes that the record reflects that Plaintiff has plead a claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodations under the ADA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     210\n    </footnotemark>\n    Also, the Plaintiff's declaration reflects that there was work that she was capable of doing and that she made a request for a special chair to reasonably accommodate her back condition and office work.\n    <footnotemark>\n     211\n    </footnotemark>\n    This evidence calls into question whether, even if Plaintiff was disabled from March 11, 2016, forward as she represented to the Social Security Administration, would she have been qualified to do her job with a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. As such, the Court finds that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Plaintiff would have been qualified to perform her job duties with a reasonable accommodation and whether a reasonable juror could conclude that, despite her representations of disability to the Social Security Administration and in her deposition testimony, she could have returned to her job duties with reasonable accommodation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <strong>\n     b. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason for Termination\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Plaintiff has not made a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    showing of her claim for disability discrimination under the ADA. Even assuming she did, Defendant advances the\n    same argument for a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for termination as is set forth above regarding her FMLA claims.\n    <footnotemark>\n     212\n    </footnotemark>\n    Based on the same analysis and reasons stated previously regarding Plaintiff's FMLA claims, the Court finds that the Defendant has made a proper evidentiary showing supporting a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination of Plaintiff's employment under the ADA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Both the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the district courts of Louisiana have granted and affirmed summary judgment where, regardless of the showing on the\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case, the fact that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination with no showing of pretext, warranted summary judgment on the discrimination claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     213\n    </footnotemark>\n    As with Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim, absent from the record is any evidence of a connection between a discriminatory animus based on a disability to the subject termination based on recorded absences, early departures, late arrivals, and discussion in accordance with the Defendant's formal disciplinary process.\n    <footnotemark>\n     214\n    </footnotemark>\n    As such, the Court grants summary judgment in Defendant's favor on Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    2. Request for Accommodation\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Plaintiff separately alleges Defendant violated the ADA by failing to provide her with a reasonable accommodation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     215\n    </footnotemark>\n    The ADA obligates an employer to reasonably accommodate the known physical or mental impairments of \"a qualified individual with a disability\".\n    <footnotemark>\n     216\n    </footnotemark>\n    This obligation\n    arises once an employer is put on notice of an employee's need to be reasonably accommodated-which usually, but not always, occurs after the employee requests an accommodation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     217\n    </footnotemark>\n    Once the employer is put on notice, the ADA requires both parties to engage in a good faith interactive process to develop a reasonable accommodation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The precise \"contours of the interactive process must be determined on a case-by-case basis.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     218\n    </footnotemark>\n    An employer that demonstrates a good faith effort to engage in the interactive process and to make a reasonable accommodation is shielded from liability for compensatory and punitive damages. On the other hand, \"[w]hen an employer's unwillingness to engage in a good faith interactive process leads to a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee, the employer violates the ADA.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     219\n    </footnotemark>\n    But if the breakdown of the interactive process is traceable to the employee rather than the employer, there is no violation of the ADA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     220\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Here, Defendant claims that it moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims and seeks dismissal of this entire matter without the need for trial.\n    <footnotemark>\n     221\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, Defendant's motion for summary judgment does not move for dismissal of or in any way address Plaintiff's claim for failure to make a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     222\n    </footnotemark>\n    In opposition, Plaintiff sets forth the standard and applicable elements of a failure to accommodate claim in two very brief paragraphs, even though the Defendant did not move for summary judgment on this claim specifically.\n    <footnotemark>\n     223\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Defendant argues in its reply memorandum, \"Amedee asserts that she requested a chair for her position in the unit control room beginning in January 2016, but she was not provided with one prior to her termination and therefore has a claim under the ADA for failure to accommodate. This is more misdirection.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     224\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot \"establish an entitlement to relief under the ADA\", and Defendant concludes that \"Amedee has not established a genuine issue of fact that she requested a medical accommodation or that she did not have access to the desired chair that remained in the control room.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     225\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, Defendant does not acknowledge that Plaintiff plead this claim in her\n    <em>\n     First Amended Complaint\n    </em>\n    ; that Defendant did not address this claim and put forth an evidentiary showing to support summary judgment on this claim; or that Defendant was addressing this issue as a separate claim for the first time in its\n    reply memorandum.\n    <footnotemark>\n     226\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Court previously found that Plaintiff has not made a showing that she is disabled or regarded as disabled, the first prong of her\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case under the ADA. Therefore, Defendant is not obligated to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's purported physical impairment.\n    <footnotemark>\n     227\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because Plaintiff has not made a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    showing of a disability under the ADA, Plaintiff's claim for failure to make a reasonable accommodation also fails and is hereby dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    <strong>\n     III.
