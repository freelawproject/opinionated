SUF 1. Matthew was transported to Restpadd under California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 5150, with \" section 5150 patients\" referring to individuals who are involuntary committed based on their mental health status. SUF 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205150\">\n    Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

Ex. 1, ECF No. 76-3,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 5. As Schneider neared Restpadd, Matthew became vocal and restless, telling Schneider to slow down because people were after them. SUF 7. Matthew was agitated when he and Schneider arrived a Restpadd, so rather than try to get Matthew into the facility himself, Schneider rang Restpadd's buzzer for assistance. SUF 9-10. Two Restpadd employees came to the car, unsuccessfully attempted to calm Matthew by speaking to him through the car's window, then refused to accept Matthew because of his agitated state. SUF 10-11. A Restpadd employee told Schneider that Matthew needed to sit unrestrained and cooperative for several hours before Restpadd would allow him to enter the facility. SUF 11. Matthew had taken his shirt off, smashed a light fixture in the car, torn a pillow apart, punched and kicked the cage between him and Schneider, and hit his seat belt against the back passenger's window. SUF 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Contacting Redding Police\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unable to deliver Matthew to Restpadd, Schneider called a crisis worker at Butte County Mental Health, who advised Schneider to call the Redding police to take Matthew to a hospital. SUF 12. Schneider called the Redding police and explained he had a Butte County \u00a7 5150 patient that Restpadd had refused and he had been told to call the police to pick up Matthew and take him to a hospital to be medicated or calmed down. SUF 15. Officer Woods responded to the call. SUF 16. Schneider told Woods that Matthew had broken a plastic light that could possibly use to hurt himself or others. SUF 16; Pls.'

SUF 18. Woods leaned through the front passenger window of Schneider's car and told Matthew \"to calm down or [Woods] was gonna bring a bunch of police officers over\" to \"kick [Matthew's] fucking ass.\" SUF 18-20; Woods Dep. 140:5-22 (admitting he made this statement), Schneider Dep. 83:7-84:9 (confirming he reviewed video capturing Woods telling Matthew words to the effect, \"knock it off or I'm going to get a bunch of officers here and beat your ass,\" though he had not overheard that interaction on the scene). Matthew stopped \"banging around.\" SUF 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Officer Hollemon arrived after Woods. SUF 22. Woods and Hollemon approached Schneider's car and Matthew again became agitated, at which point Woods showed Matthew his can of pepper spray and threatened to use it if Matthew did not calm down. SUF 24. Matthew responded by complying with the officers' commands to put his hands on his head and get out of the car. SUF 25. Woods and Hollemon each grabbed one of Matthew's wrists as he stepped out. SUF 26. Schneider indicated that Matthew did not appear to have the plastic from the broken light when he exited the car, as his hands were on his head and he had taken his pants off. Schneider Incident Report at 190. Matthew was initially cooperative, but as Woods started putting his pepper spray canister away, Matthew freed one of his hands. SUF 27. There is a factual dispute as to what happened next.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   SUF 27 (citing Woods' deposition),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Response to SUF 27 (citing Hollemon's deposition). Woods testified that Matthew freed his hand, pulled away from Hollemon, punched Hollemon in the face or upper body and began to lunge away from the car. Woods Dep. 96:12-18, 97:4-14, 98:9-13. Hollemon testified that Matthew broke from Woods' grip, used his free hand to slap Hollemon's elbow with an open hand, hard enough that Hollemon felt the impact but not hard enough to injure or move him, and Hollemon maintained his grip on Matthew until Woods placed him in a bear hug. Hollemon Dep., Defs.' Ex.

SUF 28; Woods Dep. 98:10-16, 99:25-102:18. What happened next is contested. Woods testified he could \"feel [Matthew] pulling on [his holstered gun]\" as Matthew lay on top of him. SUF 29; Woods Dep. 107:4-19. Schneider testified he never saw Matthew reach for Woods' gun. Schneider Dep. 122:2-4. Hollemon testified he never saw Matthew's hands free or near Woods' gun, and \"it would have been difficult for [Matthew to attempt to strike Woods] ... due to the fact that Woods had [Matthew's] upper arms in a bear hug.\" Hollemon Dep. 82:16-25, 102:25-103:5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Woods Dep. 104:20-105:7; SUF 30 (describing Woods' strikes as \"distraction strike[s]\"). As Matthew put his hand to his face, Woods rolled out from underneath Matthew and pinned him to the ground by lying on top of him while Hollemon held Matthew's legs. SUF 31. As Woods called for backup, Matthew screamed and pushed against the ground. SUF 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Officers Smyrnos and Renault arrived as backup, Woods, Hollemon, Smyrnos and Renault handcuffed Matthew's hands behind his back. SUF 33; Hollemon Dep. 56:19-22. Woods returned to his car.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUF 34. Matthew continued to resist officers' attempts to restrain him. SUF 37. Those attempts included Hollemon trying to hold Matthew's legs in various positions with his hands and his expandable baton as Matthew tried to push Hollemon away with his legs, sometimes face down, sometimes on his side. SUF 37-38; Hollemon Dep. 57:6-17, 58:13-59:13. Another officer relieved Hollemon after eight minutes of attempting to restrain Matthew. SUF 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During this struggle, as Matthew yelled and screamed, Smyrnos noticed blood and saliva projecting from Matthew's face. SUF 41;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. to SUF 41 (noting neither Hollemon, Woods nor Smyrnos saw Matthew intentionally spit or attempt to spit). Smyrnos placed a \"spit hood\" over Matthew's head to prevent potential contamination from Matthew's blood and saliva. SUF 41. Smyrnos testified that after he applied the spit hood, he monitored Matthew's breathing \"throughout this time.\" Smyrnos Dep., Defs.' Ex.

Ex. A(7), ECF No. 67-6, at 2 (\"The prisoner shall be monitored while the net hood is worn.\")). Plaintiffs dispute that Smyrnos continuously monitored Matthew's breathing, noting Smyrnos also testified he had \"disengaged from [Matthew] to try to retrieve leg restraints\" from his patrol car, though it is unclear whether this occurred before or after the spit hood was applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Smyrnos then noticed Matthew's breathing becoming labored and noticed he was taking longer between each breath. SUF 43. After another officer confirmed Matthew still had a pulse, the officers rolled him onto his side. SUF 44. An officer then announced Matthew had stopped breathing. SUF 45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Smyrnos Dep. 20:11-15 (testifying one to two minutes after Matthew stopped yelling and resisting, an officer announced he wasn't breathing).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The officers removed the spit hood.

Plaintiffs contend this use of force was excessive and deprived plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected liberty interest in Matthew's companionship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court first determines if, construing the record in plaintiffs' favor, the conduct here violated a constitutional right. As explained above, the analytical framework\n   derives from the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Determining whether Woods used excessive force requires the court to wade through factual disputes and credibility determinations, the classic province of the jury. Woods claims he tackled Matthew because Matthew had \"punch[ed] [Hollemon] on the face or the upper body area and start[ed] to lunge forward away from the car.\" Woods Dep. 96:15-18, 98:9-16. Other evidence of record is inconsistent with Woods' account, leaving a factual dispute. Hollemon testified Matthew used an open hand slap rather than a punch, hitting his elbow rather than his face or upper body, and that Matthew did not break free because Woods put Matthew in a bear hug before Hollemon lost control of Matthew's arm. Hollemon Dep. 65:11-66:3, 79:6-10. When asked about the severity of Matthew's slap, Hollemon explained he \"felt the impact,\" but it did not injure or move him, and he could not tell if Matthew was trying to hurt him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:4-12. Construing these discrepancies in plaintiffs' favor, as required, a reasonable jury could conclude that Woods did not tackle Matthew because Matthew punched Hollemon in the face and attempted to flee; a reasonable jury could find Matthew had freed one hand from Woods' grip and slapped Holleman on the elbow while his other hand remained in Hollemon's grip and reject Woods' account and justification for initially tackling Matthew, setting off the events that followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Also reserved for the jury to credit or reject is Woods' contention that, after he tackled Matthew and went to the ground with Matthew on top of him, he beat Matthew's face with a metal can of pepper spray only because he felt Matthew reach for his gun. Woods Dep. 107:4-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, Woods' description lacks corroboration and is inconsistent with other, circumstantial evidence. Both Hollemon and Schneider watched the events unfold, yet neither saw Matthew try to grab Woods' gun. Hollemon Dep. 82:6-83:13; Schneider Dep. 122:2-23. Hollemon testified he never saw Matthew's hands near any weapon, and when asked if he saw Matthew strike Woods, Hollemon explained, \"it would have been difficult for him to do so due to the fact that Woods had Matthew's upper arms in a bear hug.\" Hollemon Dep. 83:11-13, 102:25-103:5. Schneider testified that neither Woods nor Hollemon ever stated that Matthew was reaching or had reached for a gun, though Schneider testified he would have remembered such a statement. Schneider Dep. 122:5-20. Construing this evidence in plaintiffs' favor, without predetermining the resolution, a rational jury could conclude Matthew was immobilized by Woods' bear hug, never tried to grab Woods' gun and that Woods provided this justification only after the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Fundamentally, there is a dispute over the amount of Matthew's resistance, which construed in plaintiffs' favor, was minimal and did not justify Woods' use of force: Matthew slapped Hollemon's elbow with an open hand, the slap did not move Hollemon, and Matthew never broke free. Matthew was unarmed as well as shorter\n   and roughly 100 pounds lighter than Woods. Woods Dep. 98:17-22 (Woods estimating his height as \"[a]bout six feet, maybe a little bit shorter\" and his weight at 270 pounds); Autopsy Report, Pls.' Ex. 3 at 23 (indicating, \"per driver's license,\" Matthew was five feet, eight inches tall and weighed approximately 160 pounds). Construing the factual record in Matthew's favor, again as required, a reasonable factfinder could conclude Matthew posed little if any threat to the officers and Woods had no legitimate need to violently restrain him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A reasonable factfinder could also find Woods' response was excessive. Woods admitted he struck Matthew in the face \"as hard as [he] could\" while holding a metal can. Woods Dep. 105:1-7. He did so without any warning. In his report, Schneider described Woods as \"beat[ing] the hell out of [Matthew's] face with the butt of his Mace can.\" Schneider Report at 7. As a result, Matthew's face \"starting bleeding pretty badly, almost instantly swollen from the blows.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Woods beat Matthew with the pepper spray can, Schneider and a Restpadd employee \"looked at each other like we knew something was wrong,\" but did nothing because \"[y]ou can't pull an officer off ... a suspect or a patient.\" Schneider Dep. 134:1-17. Viewed in plaintiffs' favor, a reasonable jury could find Woods's use of force was excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There also is evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude Woods' reaction was vindictive, undercutting his version of events and bolstering plaintiffs' account. Schneider testified that Woods appeared \"physically upset that ... a patient from Butte County was [ ] taking up Redding police time.\" Schneider Dep. 87:2-4. He testified that Woods complained that having to deal with Matthew was \"a bunch of Butte County bullshit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86:4-12. Woods himself referred to Matthew as \"a nut\" and Woods was annoyed at having \"to deal with him.\" Woods Dep. 139:9-22. He admits he threatened \"to bring a bunch of cops over there and ... kick [Matthew's] fucking ass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:14-19, 140:5-15. He admits he initially threatened Matthew with a can of pepper spray because Matthew was agitated. UMF 24. With this evidence, a reasonable jury could find Woods tackled Matthew and beat him with the canister not because such force was reasonable under the circumstances but because Woods wanted to punish Matthew, to express his frustration with the situation and to relieve his anger and annoyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, construing all disputed facts in plaintiffs' favor, as required, a reasonable jury could find Woods' use of force was unreasonable and violated Matthew's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Qualified Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Officers Woods, Hollemon, Smyrnos and Renault argue that even if they used excessive force against Matthew, they are entitled to qualified immunity.

Because defendants do not acknowledge the difference between the California and Fourth Amendment analyses, the court DENIES summary judgment as to all defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Fifth Claim: Disability-Based Violence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs allege they are entitled to recovery under California Civil Code \u00a7 51.7 for violence against Matthew based on his disability. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-50. To succeed on this claim, plaintiffs must prove Mathew's disability was \"a substantial motivating reason for\" the defendants' conduct. Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instruction 3063.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants devote only one paragraph to this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 22. Plaintiffs do not directly respond. Regardless, the record before the court includes sufficient evidence to deny defendants' motion as to Woods. That evidence indicates the officers were aware they were responding to a call for assistance with a \u00a7 5150 patient and thus were presumably aware Matthew suffered from mental health issues. There is evidence that Matthew exhibited symptoms of his mental health issues and the officers, Woods in particular, responded with hostility to those symptoms. He referred to the call for assistance as \"Butte County bullshit,\" he responded to Matthew's behavior by threatening to kick his ass and spray him with pepper spray. He later referred to Matthew as a \"nut.\" On this record, there is evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude Woods was hostile to and motivated by Matthew's disability when he tackled Matthew and hit him with the pepper spray canister. There is insufficient evidence as to the remaining defendants and, as noted, plaintiffs have made no attempt to prove otherwise. The motion is DENIED as to Woods and GRANTED as to all other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Sixth Claim: Negligent Hiring\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs bring their sixth claim for \"negligent hiring\" against Chief Paoletti, as well as other unidentified \"superior officers\" and the City. The claim also includes allegations of negligent training, retention and supervision. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.
