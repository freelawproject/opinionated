Brock Hornby, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This litigation concerns the scope of an insurer's duty to defend a lawyer and his law firm in two lawsuits. The underlying lawsuits are an SEC enforcement action against the lawyer and several other defendants for violating federal securities laws, and a private class action against the lawyer and his law firm in which investors seek damages. The primary issues involve interpretation of a lawyers' professional liability (LPL) policy-specifically, whether the SEC's requested disgorgement from the lawyer is a covered claim under the policy; whether the policy's investment advice exclusion bars coverage for both lawsuits; and the effect of a related claims provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I conclude that the insurer has no duty to defend the SEC lawsuit because disgorgement is a penalty not covered under the policy, but that the insurer does have a duty to defend the private class action notwithstanding the policy's investment advice exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 30, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against the defendant, Attorney George Marcus, and others in this court,\n   <em>\n    Securities and Exchange Commission v. Michael A. Liberty, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-139 (D. Me.). That lawsuit asserts that along with others, Attorney Marcus-who for years represented Michael Liberty and some of his businesses (including corporate defendants in the SEC lawsuit)-violated the federal Securities Acts through a deceitful investment scheme involving fraudulent securities offerings. The SEC seeks an injunction, disgorgement of \"ill-gotten gains,\" and a civil monetary penalty under the Securities Act. Marcus's insurer, Allied World Insurance Company (Allied World), has denied any coverage or duty to defend Marcus in the SEC lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Allied World refused to defend Marcus, Marcus filed this federal declaratory judgment complaint in June 2018 seeking a defense. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-38 (ECF No. 1). He also requested damages from Allied World for breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing and for unfair claims practices under Maine statutes.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 39-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Second Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 22, 2018, two private plaintiffs sued Marcus and his law firm, Marcus, Clegg, Bals &amp; Rosenthal, P.A., seeking to proceed as a class action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Tina A. Endicott, et al. v. George Marcus, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-331 (D. Me.) (the Endicott lawsuit). The complaint alleges that Marcus's and his firm's misconduct occurred both \"within their legal practice\" and \"outside of their legal services,\" and that Marcus knowingly profited, through legal fees, from the fraudulent scheme that he helped Michael Liberty perpetrate. Endicott Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 (ECF No. 22-3). Specifically, the Endicott plaintiffs accuse Marcus and his law firm of \"drafting ... faulty and misleading legal documents\"; of \"negligent and improper handling of investor funds deposited in their law firm IOLTA account, in breach of their duties and in other instances outside of their legal services wherein Defendant Marcus became directly involved in the improper sale of securities\"; of \"misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to investors\"; and of \"misappropriation and misuse of the investors' funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 4. Allied World initially agreed to defend the Endicott lawsuit, but reserved its right to argue that it had no duty to defend or indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At a conference of counsel, I allowed the parties to amend their pleadings to encompass this second lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of Pre-filing Conference under D. Me. L.R. 56 at 1 (ECF No. 20). They have done so. Allied World now denies any duty to defend either lawsuit, whereas Marcus and his law firm say Allied World is obligated to defend both. All parties have moved for summary judgment. I heard oral argument on April 18, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Maine law, a duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations of the complaints in the underlying lawsuits to the language of the policy.\n   <em>\n    Merrimack Mut.

Thus, on the interpretation issues concerning the duty to defend, there can be no facts in dispute. For some collateral issues concerning Count 2 and unfair claims practices, I examine the parties' statements and opposing statements of material facts and find no genuine issue of material fact to affect the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Insurance Policy Interpretation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Maine law is clear that I first determine whether a claim is potentially covered under the insurance policy.

But covered damages under the policy expressly do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include \"the return or restitution of legal fees, costs and expenses, no matter how claimed,\" Policy \u00a7 III.G.4, so the requested disgorgement of Marcus's legal fees alone would not generate a duty to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marcus argues that Allied World nevertheless must defend him here because, under SEC disgorgement principles, there is \"a possibility that Mr. Marcus, if found liable, could be held jointly and severally liable for amounts far exceeding his attorney's fees.\" Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 16 (ECF No. 27) (in other words, for amounts that\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   defendants may have fraudulently gained). The United States Supreme Court recognized that possibility in 2017, saying that disgorgement \"sometimes exceeds the profits gained as a result of the violation,\"\n   <em>\n    Kokesh v.

In this opinion, I will call that kind of disgorgement \"excess disgorgement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allied World has not disputed that excess disgorgement could occur, but says that form of disgorgement fits within \"penalties\" that\n   are not included in LPL damages coverage and that it therefore has no duty to defend the SEC lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I have looked for cases interpreting use of the term \"penalties\" before Marcus and Allied World executed the policy (and before\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   was decided).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The cases I have found do not agree on whether the term is ambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining whether court-imposed sanctions or a statutory surcharge fit within the \"penalties\" exception to coverage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the courts generally focus on whether the remedy is punitive or compensatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I have found no cases dealing with whether SEC excess disgorgement is excluded from LPL policy coverage as a penalty. The Restatement (Third) of Restitution &amp; Unjust Enrichment (2011) speaks of disgorgement. It says: \"The object of restitution in such cases is to eliminate profit from wrongdoing while avoiding, so far as possible, the imposition of a penalty.\" \u00a7 51(4). \"The profit for which the wrongdoer is liable by the rule of \u00a7 51(4) is the net increase in the assets of the wrongdoer, to the extent that this increase is attributable to the underlying wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1644\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1644\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 51 cmt. e. The Restatement does not consider \"disgorgement of wrongful gain\" to be \"a punitive remedy\" because \"the wrongdoer who is deprived of an illicit gain is ideally left in the position he would have occupied had there been no misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1644\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1644\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 51 cmt. k. Those statements do not seem apt for recovery of amounts beyond the wrongdoer's gain like the excess disgorgement the SEC may obtain against Marcus. The Restatement recognizes that sometimes the goal of deterrence requires going beyond simple disgorgement and points, for example, to exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1644\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/#p1644\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing \"punitive or exemplary\" damages). The potential remedy in the SEC lawsuit here-excess disgorgement beyond Marcus's legal fees-is a demand by a government agency that would not merely eliminate Marcus's allegedly ill-gotten gains, but would also force Marcus to pay the SEC for gains that other defendants may have garnered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that respect, the requested relief operates as a punitive deterrent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   not compensation for an injured investor.

The Complaint has numerous allegations about what Marcus allegedly did in drafting the documents and performing other services for Liberty and his companies, but I find no allegation that Marcus or his firm actually gave investment advice to the Endicott plaintiffs. Paragraph 4 says that Marcus and his firm engaged both within their legal practice \"and in other instances outside of their legal services wherein Defendant Marcus became directly involved in the improper sale of securities, misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to investors, and the misappropriation and misuse of the investors' funds.\" Paragraphs 134 and 141 state that Marcus and his law firm\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   substantially encouraged and assisted Liberty in connection with the false representations made to Plaintiffs and the putative class members in connection with the MDO Scheme. Such assistance and encouragement-and in particular, Defendants' decision to allow Liberty to use Defendants' law firm IOLTA account as his personal bank account, and their decision to actively participate in the securities sales process including by discussing about the investment with investors-was a departure from the typical services offered by lawyers to clients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   These are troubling assertions, but they do not amount to an allegation that Marcus and his law firm rendered investment advice. Paragraph 10 says that \"Liberty with the help of Marcus and his associates went fishing for investors.\" That allegation is too vague to satisfy the investment advice exclusion. Paragraph 11 says that the third-party plaintiffs were told things \"by Liberty, with the assistance of Marcus, as co-conspirator,\" that exaggerated the value of the investment.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Endicott Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41, 45. Misrepresentation that a lawyer makes on behalf of a client (Liberty) to third parties like the Endicott plaintiffs may be actionable misrepresentation, but it is not by itself investment advice from the lawyer to those third parties. After all, lawyers regularly represent companies making a public stock offering, conducting a merger, or selling one company to another. \"In the course of providing legal services to a client, a lawyer may be asked to investigate or analyze issues of fact or law and report the results to persons who are not clients.\" Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 95 cmt. b (2000).

These allegations are distressing and the conduct may be actionable if investors relied upon the alleged misrepresentations, but-contrary to Allied World's position at oral argument-they do not say that Marcus and his firm gave\n   <em>\n    investment advice\n   </em>\n   to the Endicott plaintiffs and other investors, or that they advised them to make, or not to make, the investments (in the words of the policy exclusion, \"advice ... to make any investment or refrain from doing so\"). Allied World cites two trial court cases that interpret the identical investment advice exclusion used by a related firm, Darwin Assurance Company, and find no duty to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the allegations about attorney conduct in those cases were very different from what is alleged here.\n   <em>\n    Darwin Nat'l Assurance Co. v.

Both cases involved clear investment advice. There are no such allegations in\n   <em>\n    Endicott\n   </em>\n   with which to accuse Marcus and his law firm of giving investment advice to the Endicott plaintiffs. Moreover, one of the cases contains language adverse to Allied World's position here.\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   states: \"the Investment Advice Exclusion concerns only situations in which a lawyer exceeds his or her role as a legal advisor by assuming the role of financial advisor as well.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2052069\">\n    2014 U.S. Dist.

Nothing in the Endicott complaint suggests that Marcus and his law firm assumed the role of financial advisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I conclude that Allied World has not established that its investment advice exclusion applies. Allied World therefore has a duty to defend Marcus and his law firm in the Endicott lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Related Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There is one more policy interpretation issue. Under a section titled \"Notice of Claims and Circumstances,\" the Allied World LPL policy has a sub-subsection 5, captioned \"Related Claims\" that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   All Claims based upon or arising out of the same Wrongful Act or Related Act or Omission shall be considered a single Claim and shall be considered first made at the time the earliest Claim arising out of such Related Act or Omission was first made.

Marcus and his law firm argue that as a result of this provision, the SEC and Endicott lawsuits here must be considered a single claim. If I conclude that Allied World has a duty to defend Marcus and his law firm in the Endicott lawsuit (and I do), they argue that under the single-claim analysis, Allied World's duty to defend extends to the SEC lawsuit as well. They cite a Maine case where the Law Court noted that \"in some circumstances the duty of an insurance company to defend one count in a lawsuit imposes a duty to defend all counts.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

It would be cumbersome to have different defense lawyers for different counts in a trial. That difficulty is not present in two different lawsuits. There will of course be logistical and strategic issues: which lawsuit will proceed first? The one proceeding first will probably incur the greater attorney fees and expenses in discovery. Will there be collateral estoppel issues arising out of motion practice, trial or settlement in the first lawsuit? That could lead the lawyers in the second lawsuit to seek involvement in the first lawsuit.
