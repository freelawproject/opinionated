MAZZANT, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Laura and Mark Jordan (the \"Jordans\") seek a new trial based on claims that the jury was exposed to outside influence shortly before a verdict was reached. This is a serious complaint. The Constitution promises that, when defendants are charged with a criminal offense, they will face criminal sanctions only after a jury of their peers finds them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based solely on the evidence before them. The Court is mindful of the substantial burden a new trial poses on the Government, which, through no fault of its own, would lose a favorable verdict after a nearly month-long trial. But, after much reflection, the Court must agree with the Jordans and grant their Motion for New Trial under Rule 33 (Dkt. #174).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Laura Jordan served as Mayor of the City of Richardson from May 2013 to April 2015. As Mayor, Ms. Jordan voted as part of the Richardson City Council on whether to approve zoning projects, among other matters. During her term, Ms. Jordan allegedly exchanged votes on apartment development projects for cash, sex, and luxury hotel stays, among other items and services from Mark Jordan, the apartment developer. The Government charged the Jordans with violating several federal bribery statutes on this basis. A nearly month-long trial followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the trial's close, the Court instructed the Jury to \"decide the case for yourself,\" and \"not give up your honest beliefs as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\" (Dkt. #153 at p. 26). The case was then left for the Jury to decide. Over the next day-and-a-half of deliberations, the Jury sought guidance from the Court through eight written notes. Only Jury Note No. 8 (the \"Note\") is at issue. According to the Note, Juror No. 11 was \"very upset,\" felt she could not continue, and \"ask[ed] to be excused.\" (Dkt. #178, Exhibit 1 at p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Neither the Court nor the Parties seemed sure on how to proceed. The Note did not explain why Juror No. 11 sought release from the panel, and a juror may be excused only if she is \"unable to perform\" her duties, or is disqualified. FED. R. CRIM. P. 24(c)(1). The Court offered to interview Juror No. 11 to further investigate, if the Parties requested. The Parties did not object. Instead, Counsel for Laura Jordan stated that \"[w]e would like, your Honor, for you to talk to her\" since \"[w]e don't even know what we're dealing with.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at pp. 4-5). And Counsel for Mark Jordan and the Government promptly agreed (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court then met with Juror No. 11 in chambers, with a law clerk and court reporter, and asked why she was unable to serve on the panel (the \"First Meeting\"). The Court emphasized that she should not reveal how the jurors had voted. But the vote was apparently what caused her distress. Juror No. 11 explained that she could not vote because she was worried about causing a \"hung jury.\" (Dkt. #174 at p. 6). At this point, the Court reminded her of what is written in the Final Jury Instructions-that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   What I say in the charge is that you can't worry about the consequences. Every juror should re-examine their own views is what I say in the charge, and if you have a firmly held conviction, whatever that conviction is, that's up to you\n   to decide. You have to make your own decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Dkt. #174, Exhibit A at p. 7). The Court also stated that, if she \"had a certain conviction about what the vote should be or not be,\" then she \"should stay firm to [her] convictions, whether that is yes or no, whatever that vote would be.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit A at p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Juror No. 11 responded that it was making her \"sick to my stomach to convict them.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit A at p. 8). The Court tried to assuage those concerns. This meant reminding her that, \"if your decision isn't with the rest of the group, you should stand firm on what your convictions are.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit A at p. 8). After all, as the Court would go on to explain, jurors do not have to agree. The jury can always \"send a note back saying we can't reach a unanimous verdict,\" and certain procedures would follow at that point (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 8). But Juror No. 11 remained unpersuaded. The Court apologized for her symptoms, dismissed her from chambers, and apprised the Parties of this conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court relayed that Juror No. 11 was \"physically ill\" out of concerns of causing a mistrial, and that it had advised her to \"stand by [her] conviction, whatever [that] is,\" without regard to the consequences (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 8). A debate over Juror No. 11's health followed. While the Government asked the Court to take Juror No. 11 at her word and release her from the panel, the Jordans were less concerned. Counsel for Mark Jordan insisted \"the deliberations continue with this juror and ... object[ed] to her being excused,\" and Counsel for Laura Jordan urged that the Court could release her only if she was \"incapacitated.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit A at p. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court signaled that it would likely keep Juror No. 11 on the panel, as the Jordans requested, but was open to dismissing her based on \"how she reacts when I tell her you're going to have to remain\" on the jury (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 13). At least at the time, Counsel for Mark Jordan found this to be a \"fair\" way to proceed and Counsel for Laura Jordan had \"no objection[s].\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 13). The Court then met with Juror No. 11 a second time, with a law clerk and court reporter present (the \"Second Meeting\"). When told she would not be released, Juror No. 11 said she understood, committed to \"go[ing] back\" and \"stay[ing] strong,\" and agreed when the Court said that she seemed better (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 14). The Court reiterated that jurors are to vote on their convictions, thanked her for her service, and apologized for her discomfort. This prompted Juror No. 11 to quip that this process had been \"torture\" and that she was \"a nice person.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 15). The Court replied that it \"[a]t least ... gave [her] sugar\"-referring to the pastries the Court baked for the jurors over the course of the month-before offering to purchase her lunch, as it had for the other jurors. But Juror No. 11 declined as she was unable to eat, and was \"trying to diet anyway[ ].\" (Dkt. #174 at p. 16). She then left chambers in \"much better\" spirits, as the Court reported to the Parties shortly afterward (Dkt. #174 at p. 16). At the recommendation of Counsel for Mark Jordan, the Court then responded to the Note by stating that \"Juror No. [11] will continue to deliberate with the panel.\" (Dkt. #174 at p. 17). This meant that an Allen charge would likely be necessary, the Court noted, just before dismissing the Parties for lunch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But an Allen charge was never read. Two-and-a-half hours after Juror No. 11 expressed her reluctance to convict, the jury reached a unanimous verdict. They\n   found the Jordans guilty on nearly all counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Jordans, a conversation between three of the Court's Law Clerks (the \"Law Clerks\") and a Court Security Officer (the \"Officer\") may provide insight into Juror No. 11's swift change of heart. The Law Clerks contend that the Officer told him that he had spoken with Juror No. 11 just thirty to forty-five minutes before a verdict was reached. Finding her in tears, which he seemingly attributed to her role as a dissenting voter, the Officer told Juror No. 11 to put her emotions aside, not worry about the sentence the Jordans might face, and decide the case solely on whether she believed they were guilty or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The morning after a verdict was reached, the Officer told one law clerk of another encounter he had with an unidentified juror (the \"Unidentified Juror\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This juror apparently shared that, when polled, she would tell the Court her vote was cast \"with reservation.\" (Dkt. #169 at p. 1). As before, the Officer told this juror \"that she should not be concerned about any punishment the defendants may receive.\" (Dkt. #169 at p. 2). If \"she did not believe the defendants were guilty, she should vote not guilty.\" (Dkt. #169 at p. 2). The Officer added that the juror could not state that her vote was \"with reservation\" since her vote would not be believed-though it is unclear whether the Officer was explaining his rationale for speaking to the juror to the law clerk, or whether he made this comment to the juror (Dkt. #169 at p. 2). The Court informed the Parties of both conversations within twenty-four hours, filed a memorandum on the Docket containing separate statements from the Law Clerks on these events (the \"Statements\" or \"Memorandum\"), and made the Officer available for examination, on request. Defense Counsel declined the Court's offer, despite their perplexing insistence that the offer was never made (Dkt. #180 at p. 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Jordans now move for a new trial and, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing to support this motion. They fault the Court for meeting with Juror No. 11 in chambers and not dismissing her from the panel-without referencing their encouragement of the meeting or their objections to excusing her (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #174).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   footnote 3. They also fault the Officer for speaking with Juror No. 11, especially in light of the topic of conversation: her hesitance to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 33 provides that, on request, \"the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 33(a). \"The decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial or remittitur rests in the\n   sound discretion of the trial judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland v. Westinghouse Elec.

This discretion allows the Court \" 'to set aside a jury verdict and order a new trial based on a \"miscarriage of justice\" to avert the perception of a miscarriage of justice,' \" which typically occurs in \"extraordinary\" circumstances.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Juror No. 11's Health\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Jordans fault the Court for requiring Juror No. 11 to stay on the panel after her reported health concerns. They note that, in the First Meeting, Juror No. 11 stated that she could not continue and was unable to eat. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24 provides that an alternate juror may \"replace any jurors who are unable to perform or who are disqualified from performing their duties.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 24(c)(1). The Court has broad discretion in deciding whether a person's \" 'ability to perform his duty as juror is impaired.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A defendant can meet this standard by establishing that the court lacked any sound basis to dismiss the seated juror in question, or not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913947\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/573/330/#p332\">\n    573 F.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing how the showing is met);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court did not keep Juror No. 11's symptoms a secret. While the Government sought Juror No. 11's release, Counsel for Mark Jordan insisted that she should continue deliberations, and Counsel for Laura Jordan urged that a dismissal was warranted only if Juror No. 11 was found to be \"incapacitated.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 12). The Court would then keep Juror No. 11 on the panel, as the Jordans requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20F.3d%20237\">\n    24 F.3d at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the defendant's failure to object to excusing a juror as a reason to affirm the juror's dismissal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court also had good reason to keep Juror No. 11 on the panel, separate and apart from the Jordans' objections. The Court assessed Juror No. 11's ability to continue deliberating in two meetings in which she seemed able to continue. The Jordans make much of Juror No. 11's remark in one meeting that this process had been \"torture.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at p. 15). But the remark was stated in jest, after Juror No. 11 seemed to accept the decision to keep her on the panel. This is evident from the transcript, which lacks Defense Counsel's flair for dramatization. Juror No. 11 explained that she \"unders[tood]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   why she had to remain on the jury, committed to \"go[ing] back\" and \"stay[ing] strong,\" agreed with the Court's assessment that she \"seemed better,\" and apologized for letting this process \"g[et] the best of [her].\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit 1 at pp. 14-15). It is only after the Court thanked her for her continued service that she quipped, \"It's just torture. You're torturing me. I'm a nice person.\" (Dkt. #174, Exhibit at p. 15). The Court countered that it had at least provided her and the other jurors baked goods during the month-long trial-before offering to purchase her lunch, as the Court had for the other jurors. She declined, citing her inability to eat before joking that she was on a diet anyway. The Court could not find her unable to perform her duties under these circumstances, especially given her status (at the time) as a holdout voter whom the Jordans objected to releasing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Meetings with Juror No. 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Jordans' challenge to the Court's ex parte meetings with Juror No. 11 is just as unpersuasive. The Jordans encouraged the Court to meet with Juror No. 11 to determine whether she could continue serving on the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They now fault the Court for having this conversation. When Juror No. 11 expressed concern over causing a mistrial, the Court told her that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   You can't worry about the consequences. Every juror should re-examine their own views is what I say in the charge, and if you have a firmly held conviction, whatever that conviction is, that's up to you to decide. You have to make your own decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Dkt. #174, Exhibit A at p. 7). The Jordans contend that, by telling Juror No. 11 that \"[e]very juror should re-examine their own views,\" the Court pressured Juror No. 11 into voting to convict by giving her an incomplete Allen charge (Dkt. #174 at p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court is unconvinced. An Allen charge refers to the supplemental jury instructions given to \"urge deadlocked juries to forego their differences in order to reach a unanimous verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414731\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/876/\">\n    45 F.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 878 n.1 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing\n   <em>\n    Allen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591459\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/164/492/#p501\">\n    164 U.S. 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591459\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/164/492/#p501\">\n    17 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591459\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/164/492/#p501\">\n    41 L.Ed. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1896) ) (emphasis added). This is accomplished by warning juries that \"should [they] fail to agree on a verdict, the case is left open and may be tried again;\" that \"[t]his is an important case;\" that there is no reason to believe \"that more or clearer evidence could be produced;\" and that jurors have a \"duty to agree upon a verdict if you can do so without surrendering your conscientious opinion.\" FIFTH CIRCUIT PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS (Criminal Cases) \u00a7 1.45 (2015). The Court is mindful of the dangers of reading an Allen charge inartfully, or under the wrong circumstances. A misreading could leave jurors with the impression that the Court was expecting some or all of the jurors \"to sacrifice their conscientious scruples for the sake of reaching agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Green v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"196948\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/309/852/#p854\">\n    309 F.2d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854-55 (5th Cir. 1962). After all, the Court is in a position of great authority and is rightfully seen as a neutral party charged with ensuring criminal defendants the fair trial the Constitution guarantees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But the Court struggles to see how the statements in question amounted to an Allen charge. Nothing the Court stated could have led Juror No. 11 to reasonably believe that it was urging her to work through her disagreements for the sake of a unanimous verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"841011\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/586/572/#p577\">\n    586 F.2d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577 (5th Cir. 1978) (finding it \"unfair to characterize [the Court's statements] as a traditional Allen charge\" where the \"judge merely asked each of the jurors to avoid announcing an emphatic opinion until listening to others\" and \"requested them to re-examine their views, while admonishing them not to surrender an honest conviction simply for the purpose of returning a verdict\"). This is evident when viewing the conversation in context, beyond over simplistic soundbites. The Court met with Juror No. 11 in response to her anxiety about continuing deliberations. When Juror No. 11 expressed concerns about being a holdout voter, the Court explained that dissenting is an expected part of the process. This meant telling her that the Final Jury Instructions state that \"every juror is to re-examine their own views,\" and emphasizing,\n   <em>\n    on several occasions\n   </em>\n   , that she\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   dissent if this was her honestly held belief, even if this caused a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Stated differently, the Court merely reminded Juror No. 11 of her right to disagree.\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   FIFTH CIRCUIT PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS (Criminal Cases) \u00a7 1.45 (2015) (expressly pressuring jurors to agree if they can, as summarized above).

The Statements reflect that the Officer engaged in at least two conversations with one or more jurors on the panel. In the first, the Officer saw Juror No. 11 in tears. Believing that she was struggling with how to cast her vote, he advised her to put her emotions aside, decide the case without considering the Jordans' potential sentences, and vote only on whether she believed they were guilty or not. The Jury reached guilty verdicts less than an hour later. In the second conversation, the Unidentified Juror told the Officer of her plans to tell the Court that her vote was made \"with reservation.\" As with the first, the Officer told this juror to disregard the sentences the Jordans may face, and \"that\n   if she did not believe the defendants were guilty, she should vote not guilty.\" (Dkt. #169 at p. 2). The Officer may have also told her that a vote cast \"with reservation\" would not be believed-though it is not clear if this was simply the Officer's commentary to the Law Clerk. Regardless, the Statements reflect that the Officer spoke with at least one weary juror about how her vote should be cast, and that a verdict was reached quickly after.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Government casts the Statements as unreliable \"triple hearsay\" since the Jordans' evidence consists of \"[1] a memorandum produced by the Court's law clerks relating to what a CSO had told them [2] about what he had purportedly told Juror No. 11 and [3] what Juror No. 11 had allegedly told him earlier that day.\" (Dkt. #178 at p. 11).

The Government dismisses the Officer's comments as innocuous remarks duplicative of the Court's Final Jury Instructions. The Court cannot agree. To be sure, one law clerk reports that the Officer told Juror No. 11 to vote her conscience. But the Officer also made statements that are either incorrect, ripe for misinterpretation, or prejudicial when considering the context of those conversations. For instance, two law clerks report that the Officer told Juror No. 11 to decide the case based on whether the Jordans were guilty or not. Yet, jurors are not supposed to convict defendants based on their personal beliefs as to whether they committed the criminal acts in question. They are to determine whether the Government has proven guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Winship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p371\">\n    397 U.S. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p371\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/#p371\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).

This is apparent from the context in which these comments were made. The Officer spoke with Juror No. 11 after seeing her emotional during deliberations. By telling a distraught, holdout voter to set her emotions aside and not consider the sentences the Jordans may face, the Officer could have reasonably left her with the impression that he viewed any doubts she had to convict as unfounded and that, if she looked at the evidence without undue sympathy for the Jordans, she would have found them guilty-just as her peers had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Rather than letting this situation play out, or seeking guidance from the Court, the Officer advised \"that she should not be concerned about any punishment the defendants may receive\" and vote based on her belief on whether the Jordans were guilty or not (Dkt. #169 at p. 2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at p. 719 (explaining that jurors are to vote based on whether the Government proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not based on their belief of guilt or innocence). The Officer was apparently concerned that the Unidentified Juror's vote would not be believed under these circumstances, and may have even advised her against expressing this sentiment to the Court-though the record is unclear on this point (Dkt. #169 at p. 2). Regardless, the Officer's second conversation was seemingly just as effective as the first. When asked to confirm that the verdict reflected their respective votes, not one juror stated that her vote was cast \"with reservation.\" If the Unidentified Juror had told the Court of her reservations when polled, as she had originally planned, the Court could have consulted with the Parties on whether to declare a mistrial; read an Allen charge before directing the jury to continue deliberations; confirm that the Unidentified Juror had, in fact, found the Jordans guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; or pursue another appropriate response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But this is not the point, or the standard governing this motion. Instead, when defendants can show that prejudice is likely, as they have here, justice requires that a new trial is granted unless the Government can prove that no prejudice occurred.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   footnote 9 (explaining why the Court assumes this standard applies on this motion).

Acting on its broad discretion, based on its experience presiding over eighty-six trials, the Court concludes that the Jordans\n   were denied the Sixth Amendment's promise of a fair trial decided solely by a jury of their peers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , 71 F.3d at 1154 (\"In granting broad discretion to the trial judge, we acknowledge and underscore the obvious, that the trial judge is in the best position to evaluate accurately the potential impact of the complained-of outside influence.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court is entrusted with the sacred responsibility of assuring that every person charged with a crime receives a fair trial. Upholding this duty is especially important at a time when many have lost faith in public institutions. After all, the legitimacy of the criminal justice system depends on the public's faith that, if they are charged with a criminal offense, they will be deprived of their freedoms only after a jury finds them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, based solely on the evidence before them. It is far from clear whether the Jordans were afforded such a trial. The Officer conversed with Juror No. 11 and the Unidentified Juror after perceiving their reluctance to convict. Sure enough, a jury that seemed deadlocked after more than a day of deliberations, rendered guilty verdicts thirty to forty-five minutes later. The Court has broad authority to decide whether to grant a new trial under these circumstances.
