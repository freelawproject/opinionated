On June 11, 2018, Lyft, Inc., Endor Car &amp; Driver, LLC, Tri-City, LLC, and Tri-State Care and Driver, LLC (collectively, \"Defendants\") moved to compel the arbitration of Mr. Camilo's claims and stay the litigation against Defendants pending the resolution of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As stated, Plaintiff filed this putative class action in New York state court on October 17, 2017.

That challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, because Plaintiff manifested his assent to an agreement with Lyft by clicking \"I Accept,\" and because\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems\n   </em>\n   states that a party may require individualized rather than class arbitration, this Court finds that Mr. Camilo entered into a valid and enforceable Arbitration Agreement with Lyft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Disputes At Issue Come Within The Scope Of The Arbitration Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Not only is the agreement to arbitrate valid and enforceable, but the dispute squarely fits within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Terms of Service. The Arbitration Agreement states that arbitration is required for \"ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Section 17(a). \"Us\" is defined as Lyft and its affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors, and assigns.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Disputes\" include those \"arising of or relating to\" Lyft's Terms of Services, the Lyft Platform, a user's relationship with Lyft, or any \"payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   More specifically, the Arbitration Agreement states that claims arising under \"state or federal wage-hour law,\" claims for \"breach of any express or implied contract,\" and \"all other federal and state statutory and common law claims,\" are subject to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiff alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraud, and a violation of New York Labor Law \u00a7 193. All of these claims are contemplated by the Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thus, because there is a valid and enforceable contract, and because the disputes fall within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement contained within that contract, the issues are fit to be resolved in accordance with the terms set forth in the Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the reasons set forth by the Court, Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Litigation in this case is hereby\n   <strong>\n    STAYED\n   </strong>\n   pending the resolution\n   of arbitration, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Users were also given the opportunity to opt out of the arbitration provisions within a 30-day period after assenting to the updated Terms of Service.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Terms of Service.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
