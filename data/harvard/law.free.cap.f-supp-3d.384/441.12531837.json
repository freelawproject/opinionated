Statement of Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs Maria Navarro Carrilo and Jose Garzon are the parents of M.G. (Decl. of Karl J. Ashanti (\"Ashanti Decl.\"), Dkt. No. 15, \u00b6 1.) M.G. is an 11-year-old girl, who is classified as a student with a disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.) She has a brain injury, which has caused her to experience global developmental impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) M.G. is non-verbal, non-ambulatory, has highly intensive management needs, and requires a high degree of individualized attention, instruction, and intervention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) M.G. has several impairments in cognition, language, memory, attention, reasoning, abstract thinking, judgment, problem solving, information processing, and speech, all of which affect her learning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (\"iHope IEP\") at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The 2017-2018 School Year: iHope\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The record lacks any details as to whether an IEP was ever finalized for M.G. for the 2017-18 school year. All that we know is that the district engaged in an \"IEP process\" that Plaintiffs later claimed was \"substantively and procedurally flawed.\" (Ashanti Decl. Ex. C (\"Apr. 27 FOFD\") at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs unilaterally enrolled M.G. at the International Academy of Hope (\"iHope\") for the 2017-18 school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) iHope is a private school that provides intensive services to children who have sustained brain injuries or have brain-based disorders; there, M.G. received academic and related services. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After enrolling M.G. at iHope, Plaintiffs filed a due process complaint alleging that the DOE failed to offer a FAPE to M.G. for the 2017-18 school year because \"the IEP process was substantively and procedurally flawed.\" (Apr. 27 FOFD at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While Plaintiffs' due process complaint was being litigated, M.G. remained at iHope, where she received academic and related services pursuant to an educational plan developed by iHope staff (\"iHope proposed IEP\"). (Ashanti Decl. Ex. A (\"iHope proposed IEP\").) She was enrolled in a twelve-month academic program with an extended school day. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 4.) Her iHope proposed IEP required that she be placed in a modified environment with reduced visual and sound distractions, in combination with individual and small group instruction. (iHope proposed IEP at 1.) Specifically, she was in a 6:1:1 class with a 1:1 paraprofessional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) M.G. also received additional related services. On a weekly basis, she required: (1) five one-hour individual sessions with physical\n   therapy; (2) two one-hour individual sessions with vision services; (3) three one-hour individual sessions with occupational therapy; (4) three one-hour individual sessions and two one-hour small group sessions with speech-language therapy; and (5) two one-hour individual sessions with assistive technology programming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) Finally, she required parent counseling and training group sessions once per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to her academic and related services, M.G. received special transportation services that consisted of a 1:1 transportation paraprofessional, a wheelchair accessible vehicle, air conditioning, porter service, and limited travel time of no more than 60 minutes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 5; iHope IEP at 38; Ashanti Decl. Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 27, 2018, IHO Suzanne Carter (\"IHO Carter\") issued a decision on Plaintiffs' due process complaint, finding that iHope was M.G.'s \"appropriate placement\" for the 2017-18 school year, as it provided an \"intensive education designed to serve [M.G.'s] intellectual and physical needs.\" (Apr. 27 FOFD at 3.) IHO Carter specifically pointed out that at iHope, M.G. had an extended school day, received extended related service sessions with rest breaks, and was taught using a \"direct one-on-one instruction model that include[d] pacing, frequent opportunity to respond, feedback and, and reinforcement to maintain student engagement and ensure learning,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) IHO Carter ordered the DOE to fund M.G.'s tuition and related services for the 2017-18 school year, despite the fact that M.G. had been enrolled without guarantee of district funding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) She also ordered that the \"CSE reconvene and draft an IEP that incorporates all items of the iHope proposed IEP dated February 23, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The DOE did not appeal this decision. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. M.G.'s 2018-2019 IEP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 19, 2018, prior to IHO Carter's decision that iHope was the appropriate placement for M.G., the DOE issued an IEP for M.G. for the 2018-2019 year (the year at issue in this case), recommending that M.G. be placed at \"the School of Science and Applied Learning,\" a New York City public school, in a 12:1+(3:1) classroom. (Ashanti Decl. Ex. H (\"2018-19 Due Process Compl.\") at 2.) Plaintiffs claim that the IEP review meeting was not at a time that was mutually agreeable with Plaintiffs, and that there were numerous other substantive and procedural errors in developing the IEP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite the fact that IHO Carter issued her decision on April 27, 2018 finding that iHope was M.G.'s appropriate placement and requiring the CSE to reconvene to draft a new IEP that incorporated the items in the iHope proposed IEP, the record suggests that the CSE never reconvened to reconsider the 2018-19 IEP it has issued a month earlier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, presumably, M.G.'s operative IEP for the 2018-19 school year is the IEP issued in March of 2018, recommending that she be placed in a public school in a 12:1+(3:1) classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. 2018-2019 School Year: Transfer to iBrain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On June 21, 2018, Plaintiffs sent the DOE a 10-day Notice letter indicating that they intended to unilaterally move M.G. from iHope to the International Institute for the Brain (\"iBrain\") for the 2018-19 school year, (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387708\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/751/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. D.) In this letter, Plaintiffs asserted that the DOE that had not offered M.G. an appropriate program or placement for the 2018-19 school year. (Ashanti Decl. Ex. D.) They further claimed that the DOE had not conducted an annual IEP for M.G., despite Plaintiffs' repeated request that the DOE Committee on Special Education (\"CSE\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   conduct a committee meeting to develop an appropriate and timely IEP for the upcoming school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The record contains no information as to why Plaintiffs decided to move M.G. from iHope to iBrain, which was a new school founded by the same individual who founded iHope and which contained many of the same students and staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On July 9, 2018, M.G. started attending iBrain. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That same day, Plaintiffs brought an administrative due process complaint against the DOE, requesting that the DOE recognize M.G.'s pendency placement at iBrain and find that iBrain is her appropriate placement. (2018-19 Due Process Compl.;\n   <em>\n    see also infra\n   </em>\n   I.D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   M.G. has remained at iBrain while her pendency and related due-process claim are being litigated. The district has refused to pay M.G.'s tuition and related expenses in the meantime, on the ground that iBrain is not her \"pendency\" placement - iHope is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1. M.G.'s Experience at iBrain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As at iHope, at iBrain, M.G. has an extended school day and is part of a twelve-month academic program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) She is enrolled in a 6:1:1 class. (Ashanti Decl. Ex. F. (\"iBrain IEP\") at 43.) The proposed educational plan developed for M.G. at iBrain (\"iBrain proposed IEP\") requires the same number of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and vision education services as her iHope proposed IEP from the previous year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) The iBrain proposed IEP differs from the iHope proposed IEP in that it requires four (rather than three) one-hour individual sessions with speech-language therapy per week (the number of group sessions remains the same) and one (rather than two) one-hour individual sessions with assistive technology per week. At iBrain, as at iHope, M.G. receives special transportation services consisting of a 1:1 transportation paraprofessional, a wheelchair accessible vehicle, air conditioning, porter services, and limited travel time of no more than one hour each way per day. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When M.G. started attending iBrain in July 2018, the school was not fully staffed. Relevant for M.G., there was no social worker for the first month, and there was no vision services specialist for the first two and a half months. (Ashanti Decl. Ex. K (\"March 5 IOP\") at 4-5.) As a result, M.G. missed one parent counseling session and about twenty individual vision services sessions, not an insignificant number. During the period in which it did not have a vision services provider, the school attempted to make up for the lack of services by \"strategically implementing [M.G.'s] IEP[ ] and presenting materials in a specific way throughout the school day\" to address the skills that would have been addressed in these sessions. (Ashanti Decl. Ex. J. (\"Jan. 14 Tr.\") 156:18-159:13 (testimony by iBrain's director of special education).) The vision services provider began in September 2018. Since the vision services provider was hired, M.G. has been given make up sessions during periods of time in her schedule that are for review or other non-required activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   165:17-20.) All sessions will be made up by the end of the school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   156:3-6.) The one missed parent counseling session has also been made up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130:3-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiffs' Due Process Complaint for 2018-19 School Year\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Due Process complaint for the 2018-19 school year on July 9, 2018. (2018-19 Due Process Compl.) The My 2018 Complaint alleges, among other things, that the DOE did not provide M.G. with a FAPE for the 2018-19 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Plaintiffs specifically argue that M.G.'s 2018-19 IEP - which was issued by the DOE one month\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the IHO's April 2018 decision that iHope was the proper placement for M.G. - did not provide for a FAPE, as it recommended placement at \"the school of Science and applied Learning in a 12:1 (+3:1) classroom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also reject this IEP because it was developed without Plaintiffs' participation, as required under the IDEA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs request the following relief: (1) payment by the School District directly to [iBrain] for the cost of Full Tuition for the 2018-2019 extended school year; (2) transportation costs including a 1:1 travel aide; (3) reconvention of an annual review meeting for M.G.; and (4) attorneys' fees and related fees and disbursements, should Plaintiffs' prevail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   IHO Carter - the same IHO who heard Plaintiffs' 2017-18 administrative Due Process complaint - was assigned to hear this case after another hearing officer recused. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 13.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The first matter for IHO Carter to determine was the proper pendency placement for M.G. while the due process complaint is being litigated. In their due process complaint, Plaintiffs requested a pendency order requiring the DOE to fund M.G.'s pendency placement at iBrain, including special transportation accommodations. (2018-19 Due Process Compl. at 1.) The DOE argued that the parents had no right to pendency once they removed the student from iHope to place her at iBrain, and further, that if the student was not permitted to re-enroll in iHope, the parent had the burden to establish why. (March 5 IOP at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On December 19, 2018 and January 14, 2019, IHO Carter heard evidence about M.G.'s pendency placement. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 15.) She focused the hearing on the question of whether iBrain was \"substantially similar\" to iHope, such that M.G.'s switch from iHope to iBrain did not constitute a \"change in her educational placement.\" (March 5 IOP at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs argued that M.G.'s pendency placement should be iBrain for the 2018-19 school year, based on the substantial similarity between her current educational program at iBrain and her educational program at iHope for the 2017-18 school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) iBrain's clinical director, Dr. Mensah, and its director of special education, Ms. Semm, testified for Plaintiffs; Plaintiffs also relied on an affidavit submitted by Dr. Mensah, in which she stated the educational programs offered to students at iBrain and iHope \"are essentially identical,\" and that many of the same students and staff who were at iHope had moved to iBrain upon iBrain's inception in 2018. (Ashanti Decl. Ex. I \u00b6 8; March 5 IOP at 3-5.) The DOE argued that because iBrain was not fully staffed at its inception, it failed to provide all of the \"related services\" that were provided at iHope and, therefore, was not a \"substantially similar\" program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On March 5, 2019, IHO Carter issued an Interim Order on Pendency (\"March 5 IOP\"), denying Plaintiffs' request for pendency at iBrain and finding that M.G.'s pendency placement is iHope. (March 5 IOP at 7.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, IHO Carter rejected the DOE's argument that Plaintiffs had to establish that the student was not permitted to re-enroll in iHope, finding that the reasoning for the decision to transfer a student from one nonpublic school to another \"may be relevant, it is unlikely to be determinative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Instead, she focused her inquiry on whether iHope and iBrain were \"substantially similar.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, IHO Carter found that the record did not establish that the \"program implemented at iBrain - at the time of the impartial hearing - was substantially similar to the pendency program provided at iHope during the 2017-18 school year as set forth in the unappealed April 2018 IHO decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) She relied on the fact that iBrain did not have a vision services specialist for its first two and a half months or a social worker for its first month, and had not demonstrated that it was going to make up services that M.G. had missed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs did not appeal this decision to the SRO. (Decl. of Brain Davenport in Opp. to Pls.' App. For an Order to Show Cause for a Prelim. Inj. and TRO (\"Davenport Decl.\"), Dkt. No. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The merits of Plaintiffs' underlying due process claim is currently being litigated. Neither party has provided any information on the positions that are being taken in these proceedings. The limited information provided to the Court is that on April 29, 2019, Plaintiffs and the DOE appeared for the first hearing on the substantive issues contained in the complaint. The next scheduled hearing date is June 13, 2019. (Davenport Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Plaintiffs' Financial Obligations to iBrain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs have placed M.G. at iBrain unilaterally; therefore, they are ultimately responsible for M.G.'s tuition up and until there is any decision that the tuition must be reimbursed and/or paid by the school district, as Plaintiffs have requested in their Due Process compliant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, pursuant to their contract with iBrain, Plaintiffs are not currently required to make any tuition payments - their payments are suspended pending resolution of their current due process complaint. Plaintiffs' contract with iBrain says, \"It is understood [that a parent] may seek public funding from the local school district to pay for Student's Full Tuition ... by asserting [the] Student's due process rights.\" (Ashanti Decl. Ex. E (\"iBrain Contract\") Addendum \u00a7 8.) As a result, when a parent is required to file a complaint against the local school district for an Order of Pendency and/or Findings of Fact and Decision for funding, \"the tuition payment obligations ... will be suspended, except those obligations outlined in section 8(a) [and] 8(b), until a final determination/decision is issued ... and then all monies then-due will become immediately due within thirty (30) days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Section 8(a) says that if a parent seeks and is granted an Order on Pendency, payment is due within 30 days and remain in effect until the Order on Pendency is no longer active. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Section 8(b) says that if the Order on Pendency is denied, the Parent may immediately withdraw the student from iBrain, \"but will be required to execute a payment schedule to comply with the contractual obligations based on the financial need of [the] parent for any balances due to iBrain on the date of withdrawal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   There is nothing in the contract that says if an order on pendency is denied, but the parent is still seeking funding pursuant to a due process complaint, the parent will be required to make payments until there is a resolution of the due process complaint. Indeed, the contract explains that while a parent is waiting for a final determination on the Findings of Fact and Decision for funding, no tuition is due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.) However, if a parent seeks a findings of fact and decision but is denied all or part of the full tuition funding, the parent remains responsible for any incurred tuition and fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On April 2, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the instant Complaint against the DOE, asking\n   for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction vacating IHO Carter's IOP dated March 5, 2019, and ordering the DOE to fund M.G.'s pendency placement at iBrain until a final adjudication on the due process complaint. (Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiffs argue that the IHO erred in finding that the iBrain educational programming was not substantially similar to the programing M.G. received at iHope or, alternatively, that the IHO erred in failing to grant M.G. pendency placement iBrain based on an alternative theory of operative placement in recognition of M.G.'s entitlement to pendency. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   iBrain proposed IEP.) The only differences between M.G.'s iHope proposed IEP and her iBrain proposed IEP are that her iBrain proposed IEP requires one more individual speech-language therapy session per week (the number of group sessions remains the same), and one fewer assistive technology session per week.

(March 5 IOP at 4, 6.) She wrote that the failure to provide vision services from July 2018 to September 2018 was a change affecting M.G.'s educational program because there was no information in the record indicating that the placement would have been appropriate for the student without a vision service provider from day one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, IHO Carter found that there was \"no concrete plan for these missed services to be made up,\" even though Dr. Mensah and Ms. Semm both testified that make-up sessions were in progress; she refused to rely on this testimony without documentary evidence.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) More generally, IHO Carter found that the testimony of both Ms. Semm and Dr. Mensah was \"conclusory rather than factual\" and that the record lacked documentary evidence and testimony from the vision services educator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   I cannot agree with IHO Carter's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   First of all, I find both witnesses' testimony credible.

But the fact that Dr. Mensah was consulting at iBrain in July of 2018 while on maternity leave from iHope does not mean that she was necessarily \"[ ]biased in her testimony,\" as IHO Carter suggests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) In fact, Dr. Mensah's testimony indicated no \"biases\" - she confirmed that the services provided at iHope and iBrain were essentially the same and she in no way implied that one school was superior to the other. Moreover, the transcript does not evidence that Dr. Mensah \"embellished\" her testimony at \"critical points.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Mensah said that she was at iBrain \"occasionally but ... wasn't there every day\" during the period she was consulting, prior to her official hire as clinical director, which she further specified meant she made weekly visits. (Jan. 14. Tr. 114:7-13.) This statement is not, as IHO Carter suggests, \"irreconcilable\" with her statement that she made \"countless\" visits to iBrain prior to her full-time employment. (March 5 IOP at 4; Jan. 14 Tr. 140:18-22.) At most, it is a minor discrepancy that certainly does not \"undercut her knowledge of how iBrain was operating before October 2018.\" (March 5 IOP at 3.) Finally, Dr. Mensah's deference to Ms. Semm with respect to the specifics of M.G.'s program was not inappropriate given Dr. Mensah's role as clinical director and Ms. Semm's role as the special education director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As for Ms. Semm, IHO Carter found that her testimony was \"conclusory rather than factual.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) However, Ms. Semm testified with specificity about the services that M.G. received, the existence of a plan to make up missed services, how these services are being made up, and how vision services were incorporated into the classroom when there was no vision specialist. (Jan. 14 Tr. 148:5-151:12, 155:18-160:3, 164:8-169:2.) These statements did not become conclusory simply because Ms. Semm did not provide the exact dates and times at which the sessions were made up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Second of all, I find that based on the testimony of Dr. Mensah and Ms. Semm, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the programs at iBrain and iHope are \"substantially similar\" such that iBrain is an appropriate pendency placement for M.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In her findings, IHO Carter relied on\n   <em>\n    Lunceford v. D.C. Bd. of Education,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805787,593139\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1577/\">\n    745 F.2d 1577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1984), which holds that the \"elimination of a basic element of the education program\" constitutes a change in educational placement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805787,593139\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1577/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805787,593139\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1577/\">\n    at 1582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying on the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Concerned Parents\n   </em>\n   ). But here, there was no\n   <em>\n    elimination\n   </em>\n   of any services previously enjoyed by M.G.; rather, the vision services and family counseling services were delayed - the vision services by three months and the family counseling services by one month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Jan. 14. Tr. 110:1-11; 130:10.) There is no dispute that the relevant services were available by August for parent counseling and mid-September for vision services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Based on my calculations, this means that M.G. missed one parent counseling session and about twenty vision services session. This former is insignificant. The latter is not. But the relevant question is twofold: (1) whether the makeup sessions actually occurred or are presently occurring and (2) whether makeup sessions later in the year are sufficient to ensure there was no elimination of a basic element of the education program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   M.G.'s parents missed one - and only one - parent counseling session in July 2018, when iBrain did not have a social worker on staff. The social worker was hired on August 1, 2018, so the parent counseling service was provided from the second month of operation and Dr. Mensah testified that the one missed parent counseling session was made up at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130:3-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The loss of this one session is\n   <em>\n    de minimus\n   </em>\n   loss of services. Eleven counseling sessions, rather than twelve, clearly meets the standard of \"substantially similar.\" Moreover, this service, while beneficial to M.G., is importantly only of secondary benefit, since it is provided to and for the parents, not the child. IHO Carter's concern that the social worker was not present at the beginning of the school year is understandable, but the fact that many of the staff at iBrain were already familiar to the student and family because they came from iHope, combined with the fact that the social worker started three weeks after M.G. arrived at the school, leads me to conclude that the absence of a social worker to work with the parents (not M.G.) for three weeks was not an elimination of services and does not mean that the schools were not \"substantially similar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The loss of twenty sessions of vision services over a two and a half month period is more troubling. And, if there were no plan to make up those services, then they would be effectively eliminated, which would render the educational program at iBrain not \"substantially similar\" to that at iHope. All of the evidence, however, is to the effect that M.G. is receiving make-up sessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Both Dr. Mensah and Ms. Semm testified that M.G. will have made up all twenty missed vision sessions by the end of the school year. Dr. Mensah testified: \"[T]here is a plan. The sessions have been calculated and already being - are in the process of being made up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   136:18-137:1) At least one session had already been made up at the time of the testimony, and Dr. Mensah estimated that the rest of the sessions would be completed within the next two months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   137:3-11,) Ms. Semm, who is the expert in M.G.'s programming, testified that iBrain is currently making up vision services that were missed between July 9 and the middle of September, and anticipates that they will all be made up by the end of the current school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   156:3-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Both Dr. Mensah and Ms. Semm also testified that M.G.'s vision goals were incorporated into the classroom setting during the time when a vision specialist was not available. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   141:14-16; 156:18-159:13.) Ms. Semm testified that during the time when there was no vision specialist at iBrain, the classroom teacher supported M.G.'s vision needs by \"strategically implementing the IEP[ ] and presenting materials in a specific way throughout the school day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   158:22-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The DOE argued that it would be difficult to implement make-up sessions in M.G.'s schedule without jeopardizing her other required services. (March 5 IOP at 4.) While M.G. is undoubtedly \"scheduled\" throughout the entire school day (given her high needs), it cannot be essential that she participate in every scheduled activity. Certainly, the fact that the daily schedule\n   does not\n   <em>\n    show\n   </em>\n   any available 60-minute sessions where make-up sessions could take place is not dispositive, especially since Ms. Semm explained that these sessions are being scheduled during M.G.'s \"free\" time, when she is not in another therapy or individual academics, but rather, is scheduled for non-essential group activities such as morning meeting, afternoon recap, or read-alouds (Jan. 14 Tr. 165:17-20; 166:17-167:4). Nothing in the record suggests that this testimony is not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   IHO Carter relied heavily on Plaintiffs' failure to provide through documentary evidence the exact dates when make-up sessions had taken or would take place. She found, for this reason, that there was \"no concrete plan for these services to be made up.\" (March 5 IOP at 4.) But the sworn testimony was unrebutted - significantly, the DOE did not introduce a scintilla of evidence that the child was not getting the services. In these circumstances, the IHO's requirement that the sworn, unrebutted testimony of the iBrain personnel be backed up with exact dates or some other form of confirmatory evidence was unreasonable, since the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   evidence in the record was to the effect that M.G. was receiving make up sessions (and IHO Carter never indicated that she thought the testimony of the two witnesses was \"incredible\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Accordingly, I cannot find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the failure to have a vision specialist on staff during the first two and a half months of the school year is an \"elimination\" of vision support services, such that iBrain was not \"substantially similar\" to iHope. This renders IHO Carter's opinion unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   This situation is clearly different from cases in which courts have found that two programs are not \"substantially similar.\" For example, in\n   <em>\n    S.Y. v.

These cases involved the permanent elimination of services - \"substantial\" changes that led to an \"outright denial of educational services.\" They were not cases where there was a delay, of a few days or weeks in the provision of a needed service, as is the case here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AW ex rel.

(iHope IEP at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Plaintiffs suggest that IHO Carter's March 5 IOP denied their daughter her required transportation services. But that argument is not supported by the record. IHO Carter's discussion of transportation in her March 5 IOP was focused on whether the location change from iBrain to iHope might have substantially changed M.G.'s transportation time, not whether M.G. still required transportation services. IHO Carter was concerned that the requirement that M.G. have limited travel time was no longer being met, and that, as a result, iBrain was not a \"substantially similar\" to iHope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As support for the assertion that transportation conditions might impact a student's educational placement, IHO Carter cited a Third Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    DeLeon v. Susquehanna Cmty. Sch.

In\n   <em>\n    DeLeon,\n   </em>\n   the court noted that \"[u]nder some circumstances, transportation may have a significant effect on a child's learning experience\" but that \"minor changes ... will not generally have such an impact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644106\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/149/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644106\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/149/\">\n    at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    DeLeon\n   </em>\n   court went on to find that when one-on-one transportation by a parent was replaced by transportation by a third-party with a group of children, and there was a slight increase in the length of time in transit, there was no change in \"educational placement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644106\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/149/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   IHO Carter pointed out that Plaintiffs failed to present any testimony about M.G.'s travel time to iBrain as compared to iHope, and that the only evidence about M.G.'s transportation was the father's oral confirmation that M.G. was receiving transportation to iBrain; no other details about this transportation were provided. IHO Carter was concerned that the travel did not meet the requirement of the iHope proposed IEP or the iBrain proposed IEP, which both mandate no more than sixty minutes of transportation time each way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   It is true that Plaintiffs did not submit testimony or evidence about travel time to the IHO. However, Plaintiffs contend that M.G.'s travel time to iBrain is no more than sixty minutes each way per day while at iBrain. (Ashanti Decl. \u00b6 11.) While Plaintiffs should have included in the record information about the distance from M.G.'s residence to iBrain for the Court, there is, alternatively, no evidence that iBrain is more than 60 minutes travel time from M.G.'s residence, nor is there any reason, based on the record, to believe that M.G. is not meeting the travel-related guidelines imposed by both the iHope and\n   iBrain proposed IEPs. Indeed, the Ashanti declaration confirms that M.G. is receiving the required special transportation services and meeting the time-limit on her travel time while at iBrain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Thus, I don't find that the possibility (which is contrary to statement in the Ashanti affidavit) that M.G. is not receiving the same transportation services to preclude by a preponderance of the evidence a finding that iBrain constitutes the same educational placement as iHope. M.G. should receive transportation services for iBrain, as she would have received had she been at iHope,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c) Plaintiffs' Alternative Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As an alternative argument, Plaintiffs contend that M.G. is entitled to pendency placement at iBrain because it is her \"operative placement.\" (Mem. of Law in Supp. of Order to Show Cause for TRO and Prelim. Inj. (\"Pls.' Br.\"), Dkt. No. 15, at 15.) The \"operative placement\" factor requires the Court to look at the \"operative placement actually functioning at the time when the stay put provision of the IDEA was invoked.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273770\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/440/#p452\">\n    790 F.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Courts tend to rely on the \"operative placement\" factor in circumstances in which there was no prior- implemented IEP that might guide a determination of a \"current educational placement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avaras,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204103494\">\n    2018 WL 4103494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (relying on \"operative placement\" to determine pendency when the \"first and third factors of the [\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ] test [were] equally inapplicable\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pardini v.

Plaintiffs have pointed to no case in which a Court has relied on the \"operative placement\" provision when there was a prior-approved and implemented IEP. Indeed, they seem to concede this fact, explaining that \"Courts have ordered pendency at the operative placement\n   <em>\n    when it is deemed necessary.\n   </em>\n   \" (Pls.' Br. at 15 (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   But here, reliance on the operative placement provision is not necessary. M.G. had an un-appealed decision that found that placement at iHope provided her with an appropriate education, that the DOE had to fund her tuition and related services at iHope for the 2017-18 school year, and that the iHope proposed IEP outlined the necessary requirements for her education. It follows that the appropriate analysis is to focus on the first and third factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    Murphy,\n   </em>\n   and the substantial similarity between iHope and iBrain, rather than the \"operative placement\" factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the DOE has failed to provide M.G. with a pendency placement, which is an \"impossible result.\"\n   <em>\n    Gabel ex rel.

Dist,\n   </em>\n   upon which Plaintiffs' rely, the court found that when the district was not recommending continuation of the placement in the student's last-agreed upon IEP and had provided no alternative placement for the student, there was essentially \"no pendency placement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8971177\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/368/313/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8971177\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/368/313/#p325\">\n    at 325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, the DOE does not appear to dispute that M.G.'s pendency should have been iHope. The fact that DOE did not contact iHope. to determine that a space was available does not necessarily mean that M.G. would not have any pendency placement there, had she requested one or had she attempted to switch placements at the time the IHO issued its decision. Plaintiffs further argue that even if DOE had no obligation to secure M.G. a seat for pendency purposes, without pendency at iBrain, M.G. will not have any pendency placement, but I cannot make this finding without a showing that iHope would not have been able to accept the student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The IHO decision dated March 5, 2019 is vacated, and Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is granted. The DOE must fund M.G.'s pendency placement at iBrain from the 2018-19 school year, until a final adjudication on the due process complaint is complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Counsel for the parents should submit a motion for attorneys' fees within ten days of the date of this decision.
