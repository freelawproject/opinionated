Complaint (\"Compl.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 1,5 [Dkt. No. 1]. Matco moves to dismiss or transfer this case pursuant to a forum selection clause contained in an agreement between it and Fleming. There is a state statute that would invalidate the forum selection clause contained in the agreement, but Matco argues that I must enforce the forum selection clause because the statute is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"). Fleming responds that the FAA does not apply because the arbitration agreement is void by its own terms and that I must apply the\n   state statute invalidating the forum selection clause. I agree with Fleming and will deny Matco's motion to dismiss or transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Matco manufactures and distributes mechanic's tools and service equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.

Defendants' Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, Transfer Venue to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (\"Reply\") at 1-3 [Dkt. No. 22]. But, as Fleming argues, this is not a typical situation. The only reason that the forum selection clause would not be invalidated by Section 20040.5 is the preemptive effect of the Distribution Agreement's arbitration provision. Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Motion to\n   Dismiss (\"Oppo.\") at 4-6 [Dkt. No. 21]. But because the arbitration provision is invalid, Fleming contends,\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   is not controlling and the arbitration provision in the Distribution Agreement cannot serve as a predicate to evade the reach of Section 20040.5.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He insists that I must go beyond the terms of the forum selection clause itself and first evaluate the validity of the arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I agree with Fleming that in order to rule on Matco's motion, I must make a threshold determination on the validity of the arbitration provision to determine if it preempts Section 20040.5. The analysis required here is less straightforward than in the typical motion to dismiss or transfer because the only reason that a directly on point state statute does not invalidate the Distribution Agreement's forum selection clause is the preemptive effect of an allegedly invalid arbitration provision. Put differently, but for the existence of the arbitration provision, Section 20040.5 would apply and the forum selection clause would be void. This motion hinges on the preemptive effect of the arbitration provision and I cannot turn a blind eye toward questions of its validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Matco's cited authority to the contrary does not apply because none of the cases involve similar state statutes or the preemptive effects of arbitration agreements under the FAA. Instead, each stands for the uncontroversial proposition that generally it is inappropriate to analyze the validity of the contract as a whole when determining the applicability of a forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.

Further, to the extent any provision of this Article is deemed unenforceable by virtue of its scope, the parties to this Agreement agree that the same will, nevertheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in such jurisdiction where enforcement is sought, and the scope in such a case will be determined by Arbitration as provided herein,\n   <strong>\n    provided, however that if the provision prohibiting classwide or private attorney general arbitration is deemed invalid, then the provision requiring arbitration of breaches between the parties shall be null and void and there shall be no obligation to arbitrate such breaches.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Distribution Agreement at \u00b6 12.12 (emphasis added).

Matco's second argument is not persuasive because the terms of the arbitration provision encapsulated in \u00b6\u00b6 12.1, 12.7, and 12.12 are clear and there is no indication that my interpretation of their plain terms would differ under either California or Ohio law. As to the third argument, the term \"breaches\" in the Distribution Agreement is defined to include \"all breaches, claims, causes of action, demands, disputes and controversies\" between Fleming and Matco. Distribution Agreement \u00b6 12.1.

This factor, which is seldom informative, is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Fleming argues that the public interest in adjudicating local controversies lies here because Matco presented Fleming the Distribution Agreement in California; Fleming worked for Matco solely in California; and Matco employs over a hundred of other drivers in California.
