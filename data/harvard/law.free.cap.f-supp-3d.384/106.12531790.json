Brock Hornby, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In securities cases, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) pre-empts civil relief for fraud that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) previously made available. As a result, a court confronted with a motion to dismiss a RICO fraud claim because of the PSLRA must parse the would-be RICO claim to determine whether it is covered by the PSLRA. The First Circuit calls this \"a sort of reverse Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry: we ask whether the conduct in question would be 'actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities,' in which case a RICO count based on such fraud as a predicate act is not actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Calderon Serra v.

Inasmuch as 'fraud in the sale of securities' was a predicate offense in both criminal and civil RICO actions, plaintiffs regularly elevated fraud to RICO violations because RICO offered the potential bonanza of recovering treble damages. However, in 1995, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\"). The PSLRA amended RICO by narrowing the kind of conduct that could qualify as a predicate act. Section 107 of the PSLRA (known as the \"RICO Amendment\") amended\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), to provide in relevant part as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States District Court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee,\n   <em>\n    except that no person may rely upon any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation of section 1962\n   </em>\n   [RICO's prohibited activities section].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Bald Eagle Area Sch.

The Complaint's introductory paragraphs say that the \"scheme to defraud Mr. Chase is part of a wider pattern and practice by Defendants that they have carried out on a nationwide scale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63 (\"part of a larger scheme,\" \"fraudulently inducing others to invest in purported standby letter of credit transactions\"). Paragraph 19 alleges that two of the defendants told the plaintiff that \"they had participated in such transactions numerous times before and had never lost money.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 19. One defendant \"expressed confidence about the deal and stated that he was willing to put up some of his own land to secure the deal for Mr. Chase.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nevertheless, it is true, as the plaintiff argues, that \"Defendants never claimed to be pooling Mr. Chase's money with that of other investors in such a manner that all would share in the profits and risks of the enterprise.\" Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 4 (ECF No. 91); Pl.'s Opp'n to Def. Roy's Mot. to Dismiss at 2 (ECF No. 106). Although I think it is a close call given all the other attributes of this investment transaction, I will assume that the First Circuit, under\n   <em>\n    SG Ltd\n   </em>\n   , would find that horizontal commonality was not satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I conclude, however, that the representations Chase says the defendants made satisfy both the broad and narrow vertical tests. As to the broad vertical test, Chase certainly depended on the promoters' expected expertise for any profits. For the narrow vertical test, Chase's profits and the profits of some defendants were directly related in the Irrevocable 17.5% Success Fee Participation Agreement, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-36, and in the $ 15 million in \"fees to participants\" that the SBLC Issuance and Delivery Agreement provided for upon the success of the transaction, Compl. Ex. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   If horizontal commonality is missing, I conclude that the First Circuit would approve at least the narrow vertical test as the Loss treatise has recommended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the language of\n   <em>\n    Landreth Timber Co.\n   </em>\n   , Chase was not purchasing a commodity for personal consumption; he parted with his money to reap profits from the efforts of others. The scheme he invested in fits within Congress's purpose in enacting the securities laws as described by\n   <em>\n    Reves\n   </em>\n   : \"to regulate\n   <em>\n    investments\n   </em>\n   , in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they\n   are called.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5393\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/56/#p61\">\n    494 U.S. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5393\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/56/#p61\">\n    110 S.Ct. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the end, like the\n   <em>\n    Howey\n   </em>\n   Court, I conclude that \"all the elements of a profit-seeking business venture are present here. The investors provide the capital and share in the earnings and profits; the promoters manage, control and operate the enterprise.
