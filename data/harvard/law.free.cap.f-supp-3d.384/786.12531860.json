Frazer, LLC, and Southern Aggregate Distributors, Inc., [DN 101], for Attorney Fees, Expenses, and Costs. Plaintiffs also filed a Brief Regarding Interest that is incorporated into Plaintiffs' motion. [DN 99]. Defendants, Warren Paving, Inc. and Slats Lucas, LLC have filed their response, [DN 105], and Plaintiffs' have replied. [DN 106]. Fully briefed, this matter is ripe for review, and for the following reasons is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises out of a contract between Heartland Materials, Inc. (\"Heartland\") and Warren Paving, Inc. (\"Warren Paving\"). Heartland and Warren Paving executed a contract for the assignment of an option to purchase real property with retained royalties (\"The Assignment Contract\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [DN 1 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DN 40-1 at 2; DN 1-5]. The property at issue (\"the Property\") consisted of \"approximately 339 acres of land on two contiguous tracts located in Livingston County, Kentucky.\" [DN 1 at 4]. The Assignment Contract assigned Heartland's option to purchase the property to Warren Paving. [DN 1 at 5-6]. As part of the Assignment Contract, Warren Paving agreed to pay royalties to Heartland on limestone mined from the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each party eventually sold or assigned portions of their interests to other parties. To reflect the resulting changes in royalty obligations, the parties executed an Amendment to Contract for the Assignment of an Option to Purchase Real Property with Retained Royalties (the \"Amended Assignment Contract\"). After paying royalties pursuant to the Amended Assignment Contract for about ten years, Warren Paving and Slats Lucas, LLC (\"Slats Lucas\") brought suit (the \"Prior Litigation\") against Heartland, William R. Frazer, LLC (\"WRF\"), and Southern Aggregate Distributors, Inc. (\"Southern Aggregate\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warren Paving, Inc. v.

July 6, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this Courts dismissal of the Prior Litigation, Warren Paving and Slats Lucas (collectively \"Defendants\") ceased making royalty payments to Heartland, WRF, and Southern Aggregate (collectively \"Plaintiffs\"). Plaintiffs then brought suit (the \"Current Litigation\") against Defendants for breach of contract and a declaration of their right to receive royalties under the Amended Assignment Contract. [DN 1 at 12-15]. More specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that (1) Defendants breached the contract by failing to pay the appropriate royalty amount because the tonnage of limestone produced from the Property had not been measured in compliance with the terms of the agreement, and (2) Defendants breached the contract by failing to tender royalty payments after entry of the Sixth Circuit's order on July 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the Current Litigation, this Court granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim with regard to the lack of royalty payments since June 2016. The Court also held that \"Warren Paving and Slats Lucas are contractually obligated to pay royalties for all limestone mined and shipped or loaded for transport from the Property pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Contract and the royalty obligation enumerated therein.\" [DN 67 at 28]. This Court did not grant summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants breached the contract by underpaying royalties prior to June 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26]. After this Court granted partial summary judgment, Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss their remaining claim for underpayment of royalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [DN 75]. This Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss. [DN 84].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs have filed three motions seeking compensatory damages, costs, and attorney's fees. [DN 69; DN 77; DN 101]. Defendants have responded to each of Plaintiffs' motions. [DN 88; DN 105]. On January 18, 2019, the parties filed a Stipulation whereby they agree that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the terms of the July 31, 2009 [Amendment to Contract] the Plaintiffs collectively would be entitled to compensatory damage for the limestone mined and shipped or loaded for transport from the Property during the months of June 2016 through November 2018 in the amount of one million six hundred seventy-one thousand two hundred fifty-eight dollars and sixty-four cents (\"$ 1,671,258.64\") (the \"Stipulated Compensatory Damages\") with said sum to be allocated as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-20\">- WRF $835,629.32 - Southern Aggregate $835,629.32</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [DN 96].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court held two telephonic conferences during which the parties discussed the issues of attorney's fees and interest rates. Following these conferences, the Court entered an order dismissing without prejudice Plaintiffs' First and Second Motions for Damages, Costs, Expenses, and Attorney's Fees. [DN 100]. The order instructed that \"Plaintiffs shall file their third motion for damages, costs, expenses, and attorney's fees by February 19, 2019.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Now before the Court are Plaintiffs' Third motion for Attorney's Fees, Expenses, and Costs [DN 101] and Plaintiffs' Brief Regarding Interest [DN 99]. Defendants have responded to both documents [DN 105] and Plaintiffs have filed their reply [DN 106].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees and costs is based in contract. The Amended Assignment Contract contains the following provision (\"Paragraph 10\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In the event of a breach of any term hereof by a party hereto, then each other affected party shall have all rights and remedies hereunder, and at law or in equity including, without limitations, the right of specific performance and the recovery of damages, reasonable legal fees, reasonable appellate legal fees and costs incurred by the non-defaulting part[y] [sic] in pursuing any remedy available to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [DN 101 at 2; DN 105 at 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs claim they are entitled to $ 704,045.44\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in attorney's fees, $ 2,300.00 in expenses, and $ 662.79 in costs. [DN 101-13]. Plaintiffs and their attorney (\"Mr. Arnett\") entered into a hybrid fee agreement whereby Plaintiffs agreed to pay Mr. Arnett a reduced fee of $ 200.00 per hour for legal services performed and agreed that: \"Attorney is assigned a thirty percent (30%) contingency fee upon all recoveries, however denominated ... whether obtained by settlement or by judgment or otherwise and whether denominated actual damages, costs, attorneys' fees, punitive damages or other recover, and in whatever form they may take.\" [DN 101-6]. Before entering into the hybrid fee agreement with Mr. Arnett, Plaintiffs were represented by Wyatt, Tarrant &amp; Combs, LLP (\"Wyatt\"). [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DN 101-3]. Plaintiffs seek to recover from Defendants all fees arising\n   from Wyatt's legal representation including fees incurred during the Prior Litigation. Plaintiffs also seek to recover $ 2,300.00 that was paid to Mark G. Enderle, CPA/CFF (\"Enderle\"), and $ 622.79 for unspecified costs. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that pre-judgment interest in this case should be assessed at the rate of 8% per annum. Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs are requesting unreasonable attorney's fees, that Plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney's fees and expenses that were incurred during the Prior Litigation, and that the $ 622.79 in unspecified costs are unrecoverable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Attorney's Fees.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pursuant to the Amended Assignment Contract, the parties agree that any breaching party shall pay the non-breaching party \"damages, reasonable legal fees, reasonable appellate legal fees and costs incurred by the non-defaulting part[y] in pursuing any remedy available to it.\" [DN 101 at 2]. Plaintiffs argue that \"[a]s the [Amended Assignment Contract] provides for recovery of reasonable attorney fees from the non-defaulting party, and the Defendants having been found to have defaulted, the Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs\" for the Current and Prior Litigations. [DN 101-1 at 3]. Defendants do not dispute that a breaching party must pay reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and costs under the Amended Assignment Contract. Defendants argue, however, that Plaintiffs are requesting an unreasonable amount of attorney's fees and that Plaintiffs are not entitled to legal fees from the Prior Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims for legal fees, expenses, and costs arise from Paragraph 10 of the Amended Assignment Contract. Paragraph 10 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    In the event of a breach\n   </strong>\n   of any term hereof by a party hereto, then each other affected party shall have all rights and remedies hereunder, and at law or in equity including, without limitations, the right of specific performance and the recovery of damages, reasonable legal fees, reasonable appellate legal fees and costs incurred by the non-defaulting part[y] [sic] in pursuing any remedy available to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [DN 101 at 2] (emphasis added). Paragraph 10 is only triggered if a party breaches the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that they did not breach the contract until they stopped making royalty payments after the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the Prior Litigation on July 6, 2016 and therefore are not obligated to pay legal fees, costs, or expenses to Plaintiffs arising from the Prior Litigation. Plaintiffs apparently do not disagree that Defendants first breached the contract when they ceased making royalty payments in July 2016 because they do not address Defendants' argument in their reply. In fact, Plaintiffs base their argument for legal fees on the \"Defendants' decision to cease making royalty payments pursuant to the Assignment Contract almost immediately following the Sixth Circuit's\" affirmance of this Court's dismissal of the Prior Litigation. [DN 101-1 at 4] (citation omitted). Because neither party argues that a breach occurred prior to July 2016, when Defendants ceased making royalty payments pursuant to the contract, the Court holds that Plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney's fees incurred during the Prior Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants also argue that the amount of attorney's fees that Plaintiffs requests in unreasonable. The Court agrees. Plaintiffs request a total of $ 704,045.44 in attorney's\n   fees. $ 193,103.04 of these fees arise out of Wyatt's representation of Plaintiffs. However, Plaintiffs do not apportion the fees sought between the Current and Prior Litigation. Plaintiffs are only entitled to an award of legal fees incurred after Defendants' breach. Therefore, the Court will only award fees for legal services performed after the Sixth Circuit's affirmance of this Court's dismissal of the Prior litigation on July 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   An examination of the Wyatt invoice and accompanying documents reveals that nine individuals provided legal services during the relevant time period. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DN 108 and exhibits thereto]. Four Wyatt Partners provided services to Plaintiffs. \"GLS\" performed 52.25 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 400 per hour. \"JWR\" performed 10.75 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 315 per hour. \"KJG\" performed .75 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 510 per hour. And \"MTW\" performed .50 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 375 per hour. Two Wyatt associates provided services to Plaintiffs. \"CRS\" performed 44.25 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 250 per hour. \"AGB\" performed .25 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 230 per hour. Finally, three Wyatt paralegals provided services to Plaintiffs. \"SV\" performed .25 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 240 per hour. \"PS\" performed 5.75 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 200 per hour. And \"DW\" performed .50 hours of work and charged a rate of $ 220 per hour. From the Court's experience in reviewing hourly rates of many lawyers in Louisville and other cities in Kentucky, the Court finds the hours performed and rates charged to be reasonable for each individual. Thus, Defendants must pay Plaintiffs $ 37,296.25 in legal fees for services Wyatt provided in the Current Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The remaining $ 510,942.40 of the fees Plaintiffs seek arise from Mr. Arnett's representation. Plaintiffs agreed to pay Mr. Arnett a reduced hourly rate of $ 200.00 plus a contingency fee of 30% of all recoveries. Defendants do not dispute that $ 200.00 is a reasonable hourly rate. [DN 105 at 8]. In fact, Defendants acknowledge that a rate of $ 235.00 per hour is reasonable. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Instead, Defendants argue that the contingency fee agreement renders the requested fees unreasonable. Mr. Arnett performed 56.7 hours of work. [DN 105-1]. Therefore, Plaintiffs seek attorney's fees equivalent to $ 9,011.33 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs are requesting the Court to award them attorney's fees based on the hybrid fee agreement consisting of an hourly rate in addition to a contingency fee. Plaintiffs argue that \"[w]hile the Sixth Circuit has not addressed such hybrid fee agreements directly, it should be noted that in other circuits,\" courts have upheld them. [DN 101-1 at 5].

Ariz. May 6, 2013) to support their argument. In other words, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants must pay them attorney's fees equal to the amount due under the contract Plaintiffs entered into with their attorney because hybrid fee agreements are not unenforceable as a matter of law. The Court disagrees, and will not enforce an unreasonable contingency or hybrid fee contract onto Defendants who never agreed to be bound by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court is persuaded by the following four cases. First, in\n   <em>\n    City of Burlington v. Dague\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a court tasked with determining an award of reasonable attorney's fees under \u00a7 702(e) of the Solid Waste\n   Disposal Act or \u00a7 505(d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act may enhance the fee award above the lodestar figure to reflect the fact that the prevailing party's attorneys were retained on a contingent fee basis and therefore assumed the risk of receiving no payment at all for their services.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p559\">\n    505 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p559\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p559\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The Court held that enhancement of the lodestar amount for contingency is impermissible under the fee-shifting statutes at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p559\">\n    at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p559\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 09-13512,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204950552\">\n    2009 WL 4950552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Dec. 16, 2009). The contract between the parties in\n   <em>\n    Quain\n   </em>\n   included a fee shifting provision and the prevailing party's attorney was retained on a contingency fee basis. The district court declined to award attorney's fees based on the contingency agreement to the prevailing party because \"the matter was resolved by a default judgment; the issues were not particularly difficult as reflected by the amount of time expended by Plaintiff's counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Furthermore, the district court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, the Court cannot ignore the fact that Plaintiff's counsel spent a mere 29.1 hours on this matter.

The parties agree that the litigation was highly important to Plaintiffs, that Mr. Arnett was responsible for zealously representing his client, the parties stipulated to the amount of damages, that this action involved skill and experience in contract litigation, and that Mr. Arnett is an established attorney in Western Kentucky who is well regarded by members of the bar. The importance of the litigation to Plaintiffs and the amount of damages in controversy suggest that the fee is reasonable. However, the skill and experience required in this case suggests that the fee is unreasonable. Although Plaintiffs state that Mr. Arnett \"is an attorney with thirty-eight years of experience in contract litigation,\" they do not dispute Defendants' characterization that \"[a]s a breach of contract case applying Kentucky law, no specialized skill or experience was required to represent Plaintiffs.\" [DN 101-1 at 6; DN 105 at 12]. The parties disagree regarding the remaining three factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, Plaintiffs argue under the first factor that \"The services provided by [Mr. Arnett] was the assumption of representing the Plaintiffs when they could no longer afford to pay counsel by an hourly arrangement in a breach of contract matter.\" [DN 101-1 at 6]. However, plaintiffs did not retain Mr. Arnett solely on a contingency fee basis but instead paid Arnett a $ 200 hourly rate. And Mr. Arnett testified that $ 200 is a reasonable rate. Therefore it is disingenuous to claim that Plaintiffs could no longer afford counsel for the matter. Furthermore, Defendants argue that this action is a commercial breach of contract case that required no specialized knowledge or expertise, that most of the research was performed by prior counsel, and that the case involved limited discovery. Considering the foregoing, the first\n   <em>\n    Axton\n   </em>\n   factor suggests the fee is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that \"[t]here was extensive research performed by [Mr. Arnett] and staff regarding the issues of asserting time barred affirmative defenses and that of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"the matter was prolonged as well by opposing counsel not negotiating in good faith.\" [DN 101-1 at 6]. Defendants argue that Wyatt\n   performed substantially more work on this case than Mr. Arnett. Wyatt worked approximately twice as many hours on the current litigation than Mr. Arnett did, but would receive approximately $ 470,000 less than Mr. Arnett under the hybrid fee agreement. Defendants also assert that \"Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment was largely comprised of excerpts of prior rulings, pleadings, and arguments that were researched and briefed by the Wyatt firm.\" [DN 105 at 11]. Considering the foregoing, the second\n   <em>\n    Axton\n   </em>\n   factor strongly suggests the fee is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Arnett was \"able to secure a very favorable outcome for his clients by the successful advocacy of a summary judgment. By moving for [Summary Judgment] and not being mired in extensive discovery, as it was unwarranted (though longed for by Defendants' counsel), [Mr. Arnett] was able to save resources for both his clients and the Court.\" [DN 101-1 at 6-7]. Defendants argue that they did not want to be mired in extensive discovery and that they also filed a motion for summary judgment to prevent it. [DN 105 at 12-13]. Defendants also argue that \"[a]lthough Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment was granted, in part, as noted above, it regurgitated a number of arguments researched and raised by prior counsel and quoted extensively from prior pleadings and rulings. In other words, current counsel did not have to 're-invent the wheel.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13]. Considering the foregoing, the eighth\n   <em>\n    Axton\n   </em>\n   factor suggests that the fee is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Considering all the factors, the Court finds $ 510,942.40 to be an unreasonable fee for Defendants to pay. The award sought by Plaintiff equates to a billable rate of about $ 9,000 per hour. This rate is forty-times higher than the $ 200 rate Mr. Arnett testified is within the range of reasonable rates that are charged in Western Kentucky by attorneys with similar experience. This case is like\n   <em>\n    Quain\n   </em>\n   because the contingency arrangement has inflated the attorney fees to an extent that they are unjustified considering the limited hours worked.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204950552\">\n    2009 WL 4950552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the attorney in\n   <em>\n    Quain\n   </em>\n   , however, Mr. Arnett did not \"undertake the risk of litigation and advance the costs of litigation\" because he was paid a reasonable $ 200 fee for his services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Thus, the Court holds that $ 510,942.40 is an unreasonable fee to require Defendants to pay pursuant to the fee-shifting contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is important to acknowledge that the Court's holding is limited to the attorney's fee award Defendants are required to pay Plaintiffs pursuant to the Amended Assignment Contract. The Court does not offer an opinion on what fee the Plaintiffs are bound to pay their own attorney. \"What a plaintiff may be bound to pay and what an attorney is free to collect under a fee agreement are not necessarily measured by the 'reasonable attorney's fee' that a defendant must pay pursuant to a court order.\"\n   <em>\n    Venegas v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634237\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/82/#p90\">\n    495 U.S. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634237\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/82/#p90\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634237\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/82/#p90\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Plaintiffs reached an agreement through arm's length negotiations with Mr. Arnett to provide legal services in exchange for $ 200 per hour and 30% of the total award received by Plaintiffs. Defendants were not a party to these negotiations, and it is unreasonable to enforce the agreement against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although Defendants are not required to pay Plaintiffs pursuant to the hybrid fee agreement, they are required by Paragraph 10 of the Amended Assignment Contract to pay \"reasonable legal fees.\" Therefore, the Court must determine what fee Defendants owe to Plaintiffs.

Mr. Arnett worked 56.7 hours on the current litigation. Mr. Arnett charged Plaintiffs a reduced rate of $ 200.00 per hour for his legal services in addition to a contingency fee. Plaintiffs have not informed the Court of Mr. Arnett's regular hourly rate. Defendants acknowledge that a rate of $ 235.00 per hour-the rate they have agreed to pay their counsel-is a reasonable rate. [DN 105 at 8, n. 16]. Plaintiffs do not dispute the reasonableness of this rate and, in fact, Mr. Arnett attests in his affidavit that a \"two hundred dollar ($ 200.00) rate is reasonable and falls squarely within the range of market rates that are charged in Western Kentucky by attorneys with similar experience.\" [DN 101-7]; [\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   DN 101-9; DN 101-10]. Because Defendants acknowledge that $ 235.00 is a reasonable rate and because the rate is greater than the $ 200.00 that Mr. Arnett testified was reasonable and within the range of similarly situated attorneys, the Court finds that $ 235.00 is a reasonable rate for Mr. Arnett's services in this case. Multiplying this reasonable rate by the 56.7 hours-which Defendants do not argue is an unreasonable amount of hours-produces a lodestar figure of $ 13,324.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on the\n   <em>\n    Boden\n   </em>\n   factors, it is inappropriate to make a departure from the lodestar figure in this case. The\n   <em>\n    Boden\n   </em>\n   factors are equivalent to the\n   <em>\n    Axton\n   </em>\n   factors discussed above and the analysis in this case is the same. Although this case involved a substantial amount of money, Mr. Arnett provided a relatively small amount of services in the litigation. Further, this action did not require special skill or experience. Minimal labor, time, and trouble was involved in litigating this action. Mr. Arnett only worked 56.7 hours on the action. Finally, the responsibility imposed and professional character and standing of the attorneys involved in this litigation do\n   not suggest that a departure from the lodestar figure is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants shall pay Plaintiffs $ 13,324.50 for services performed by Mr. Arnett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Expenses.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs are not entitled to recover $ 2,300.00 paid to Mark Enderle, a Certified Public Accountant, for an investigation into the underpayment of royalties. Plaintiffs argue they \"retained an expert for analysis of certain documents submitted by the Defendants during discover in the amount of $ 2,300.00.\" [DN 101-1 at 7]. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs employed Mr. Enderle to investigate their claim for underpayment of royalties prior to the July 2016 Sixth Circuit decision. [DN 105 at 22]. Defendants direct the Court to Mr. Enderle's work product affidavit and accompanying documents, which evince that Mr. Enderle only investigated tax returns for the years of 2012 through 2016, which reflect reported limestone for the years 2011 through 2015. Because this Court has not found that Defendants breached the Amended Assignment Contract before July 2016 and because the fee-shifting provision of the contract is not triggered absent a breach, Plaintiffs are not entitled to payment for these services. Furthermore, Plaintiffs do not dispute Defendants' arguments in their motion or reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In this case, Judgment was entered on May 22, 2018. [DN 67].

The Court disagrees. More specifically, Defendants argue that KRS \u00a7 360.040(1) prescribes the six percent rate for prejudgment interest. In relevant part, KRS \u00a7 360.040(1) says: \"a judgment,\n   <em>\n    including a judgment for prejudgment interest\n   </em>\n   , shall bear six percent (6%) interest compounded annually from the date the judgment is entered.\" (emphasis added). KRS \u00a7 360.040 prescribes the post-judgment interest rate that must be assessed under Kentucky law. The statute does not influence the rate at which prejudgment interest accrues. Instead it sets the rate the judgment for prejudgment interest shall accrue interest after the judgment is entered.

First, post-judgment interest began to accrue on the compensatory damages when the Court granted Plaintiffs partial summary judgment on their breach of contract claims. [DN 67]. This judgment was entered on May 22, 2018. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has \"applied\n   <em>\n    Kaiser\n   </em>\n   to hold that post-judgment interest runs from the date of any judgment that is not entirely set aside.\"\n   <em>\n    Skalka v.

In\n   <em>\n    Skalka\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals held that post-judgment interest begins to accrue from the date of the initial judgment entitling the prevailing party to damages, even if that judgment is not an appealable final order and even if it is a partial judgment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577807\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/414/#p429\">\n    178 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the compensatory damages in the case before this Court are liquidated, they were \" 'ascertained' in a meaningful way\" when this Court granted summary judgment on the breach of contract claims for failure to make royalty payments.\n   <em>\n    Kaiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5295\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/827/#p835\">\n    494 U.S. at 835-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5295\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/827/#p835\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The compensatory damages in this case are capable of ascertainment through mere computation. And in fact, the parties have computed and stipulated to the damages in this case. Therefore, post-judgment interest began to accrue on the compensatory damages on May 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, post-judgment interest on the judgment awarding prejudgment interest will begin to accrue on the date this judgment is entered. In this case, the prejudgment interest award has not been \"sufficiently ascertained\" until now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coal Res. Inc. v. Gulf &amp; W. Indus.

Although the compensatory damages in the case before this Court are liquidated, the rate at which prejudgment interest would accrue was uncertain until now and required additional briefing by the parties. Therefore, post-judgment interest shall begin to accrue on all prejudgment interest pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   upon entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, post-judgment interest on legal fees will begin to accrue on the date this judgment is entered. In\n   <em>\n    Drabik\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the question of \"[w]hether an award of attorney fees accrues interest, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , from the date of the judgment that unconditionally entitled the prevailing party to reasonable attorney fees or the date of the judgment quantifying that fee award.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098425\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/482/#p491\">\n    250 F.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (6th Cir. 2001). The Court of Appeals held that interest on attorney's fees begins to accrue on the date of the award unconditionally entitling the prevailing party to fees, even if the fees have not been reduced to a sum certain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098425\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/482/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098425\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/482/#p491\">\n    at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the case before this Court, the date of the award entitling Plaintiffs to fees and the date the fees are quantified into a precise sum are the same; It is the date upon which this judgment is entered. As part of Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys Fees, Expenses, and Costs, Plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to fees. Defendants objected to the award of these fees in their response. Ultimately, this Court decided that Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of fees. But prior to the entry of this judgment, it was uncertain whether Plaintiffs were entitled to an award of fees. Therefore, the entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order marks the date upon which post-judgment interest shall accrue on the award of legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, post-judgment interest-assessed at the rate prescribed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -began to accrue upon the award for compensatory damages on May 22, 2018 and shall begin to accrue on all other damage awards upon the entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,\n   </strong>\n   Defendants must pay Plaintiffs the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   Compensatory damages as stipulated to by the parties [DN 96].
