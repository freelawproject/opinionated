(ECF No. 24). Plaintiff has filed a Response in Opposition to Summary Judgment (ECF No. 26) and Defendant replied (ECF No. 27). For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant's Motion (ECF No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Pamela Sue Mason (\"Ms. Mason\" or \"Plaintiff\") has filed suit alleging that Ohio CVS Stores, LLC (\"CVS\" or \"Defendant\") has violated Ohio's negligence and products liability laws. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. [ECF No. 2] ). Plaintiff's claims stem from the alleged wrongful distribution of prescription medication to the Plaintiff, the facts of this case are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 24, 2015, an employee of CVS store number 3174, located in Newark, Ohio, filled a prescription for Amitriptyline HCL 150 mg tablets for another patient. On that same day, CVS filled several prescriptions for Plaintiff, to include: Januvia 100 mg tablets, Ropinirole HCL 1 mg tablets, and Gabapentin 600 mg tablets; a licensed pharmacist verified these prescriptions. (Homan Affidavit \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 7) [ECF No. 24-1, Ex. A].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 28, 2015, an individual on behalf of the Plaintiff retrieved Plaintiff's prescription\n   medications from CVS. (Homan Affidavit \u00b6 6). Plaintiff submits that CVS dispensed a bottle of Amitriptyline HCL that was prescribed to another individual and was inadvertently mixed in with her prescription medications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mason Dep. 18:3-7 [ECF No. 24-1, Ex. B] ). The prescription bottle containing the Amitriptyline was appropriately marked and detailed that the medication within the bottle was 150mg Amitriptyline HCL tablets and that the prescription was for an individual other than the Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Photographs A1-A3 [ECF No. 24-1, Ex. E] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It was Plaintiff's practice to place her medication into a weekly pillbox that was divided into sections for each day of the week. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mason Dep. 20:21-21:14). Plaintiff would refill the pillbox whenever it was empty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   21:1-11). When refilling her pillbox, Plaintiff would not typically look at the labels on the prescription bottles because she knew when she was to take her medication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20:21-25, 22:6-22). Plaintiff claims that she took two tablets of the Amitriptyline, believing that the tablets were part of her prescribed medication. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   19:4-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 9, 2015, Plaintiff's niece was visiting and noticed that she was acting abnormally. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   52:1-7, 52:14-53:3). Plaintiff was \"picking at the air\" and \"slapping [her]self,\" so her niece called an ambulance, which transported Plaintiff to the Licking Memorial Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   52:1-7, 52:17-53:3). Plaintiff was transferred from the Licking Memorial Hospital to the Ohio State Medical Center, where she stayed for three days. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   54:14-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 3, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this lawsuit by filing a Complaint in a Licking County Court of Common Pleas asserting Ohio products liability and negligence claims against CVS. CVS removed the case to this Court on September 6, 2017. CVS has now moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. That motion is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is proper when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Products Liability Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CVS asserts that summary judgment in favor of Defendant as to Plaintiff's Ohio products liability claim is proper for four reasons: 1) the claim is untimely; 2) CVS is not a \"supplier\" under Ohio law; 3) the medication allegedly provided to Plaintiff was not defective; and 4) Plaintiff's expert is not qualified, as a matter of law, to render an expert opinion on whether Plaintiff's ingestion of Amitriptyline HCL was the proximate cause of her injuries. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J.). Plaintiff responds that: 1) the Complaint was filed within the applicable statute of limitations; 2) CVS fits within Ohio's definition of \"supplier;\" and 3) Dr. McDonnell, Pharm.D. is a qualified expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under Ohio products liability law, there are four ways in which a product can be defective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2307.73(A)(1). In order to succeed on a products liability claim, a plaintiff must prove that the \"product in question was defective in manufacture or construction as described in section 2307.74 of the Revised Code, was defective in design or formulation as described in section 2307.75 of the Revised Code, was defective due to inadequate warning or instruction as described in section 2307.76 of the Revised Code, or was defective because it did not conform to a representation made by its manufacturer as described in section 2307.77 of the Revised Code[.]\" Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2307.73(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CVS argues that the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the defective nature of the Amitriptyline HCL that CVS allegedly distributed to Plaintiff. Instead, CVS asserts, Plaintiff has only produced evidence that could support a finding that she was supplied the wrong medicine, not a defective medicine. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 13). In her responsive briefing, Plaintiff failed to address CVS's argument that the Amitriptyline HCL tablets allegedly supplied to Plaintiff by CVS were not defective. Additionally, Plaintiff neither: 1) cites to record evidence that demonstrates that the Amitriptyline HCL was defective; nor 2) indicates how the medication was defective under the Ohio Revised Code. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp'n 7-10 [ECF No. 27] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When read in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, the facts currently before the Court indicate that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Amitriptyline HCL that CVS allegedly supplied Plaintiff was defective. Plaintiff has not drawn the Court's attention to record evidence that demonstrates there remains a genuine issue of material fact on this matter. Rather, the Court's review of the evidence shows that the record is devoid of such facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Establishing that a product is actually defective is an essential element of a products liability claim under Ohio law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2307.73(A)(1). And Defendant has met its burden of showing that no reasonable jury could find in favor of Plaintiff on this element of Plaintiff's claim. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted as to Plaintiff's state-law products liability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Negligence Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On July 28, 2015, CVS distributed to Plaintiff medication not intended or prescribed for her. On August 9, 2015, Plaintiff was hospitalized for injuries she claims arose from taking this medication. Plaintiff filed this action on August 3, 2017. CVS argues that Plaintiff's claim is time-barred because it is a medical claim that is subject to a one-year statute of limitations. Alternatively,\n   CVS argues that even under the two-year statute of limitations, Plaintiff's negligence claim was filed six days late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    a. One-Year Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under Ohio's Medical Malpractice statute, \"an action upon a medical, dental, optometric, or chiropractic claim shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ohio%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202305.113\">\n    Ohio Rev.

Defendant bases its conclusion on the following proposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   R.C. 2305.113(E) provides that medical claims include those claims against employers or agents of a hospital, home, or residential facility. There are numerous hospital systems and nursing home facilities in Ohio that provide pharmacy services to their patients, thereby employing pharmacists that would clearly fall within the definition of R.C. 2305.113(E).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Under the clear statutory language, it cannot reasonably be disputed in a claim against a pharmacist that is an \"employee or agent of a ... hospital, home, or residential facility,\" would be treated as a \"medical claim,\" and therefore subject to the statutory provisions applicable to a \"medical claim\" including the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In order to find that Plaintiff's claims against CVS are not a \"medical claim\" in\n   this case, the Court would have to conclude that a pharmacist employed in a retail setting should somehow be viewed differently than a pharmacist employed in a hospital setting under R.C. 2305.113(E)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 8-9.) This Court, however, disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Contrary to CVS's position, it can, and actually has been in this case, reasonably disputed that a claim against a pharmacist is a medical claim. Where the provider is employed is of no moment under the statute's requirement that the claim arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person. That is, regardless of whether the pharmacist is employed by a hospital, home, or residential facility or whether a pharmacist is employed by a pharmacy such as CVS, the claim must still arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As stated above, the statute requires not only that the medical provider be one enumerated in the statute, but also that the claim arises out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person. Consequently, there is no need to treat any pharmacist differently based on where they work-indeed Defendant cites no case where this hypothetical situation occurred even though some cases have dealt with pharmacists who work in and out of hospitals, homes, or residential facilities. Thus, while it is unnecessary to this Court's determination, it appears that courts have concluded that the work of pharmacists in dispensing a prescribed medication, regardless of where they work, does not \"arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that because a pharmacist does not fall within the statutorily-enumerated categories in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2305.113, a claim of negligence against a pharmacist is not a \"medical claim\" as that term is defined under Ohio's Malpractice Statute, Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2305.113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

What impact, if any, that reliance on law under a different statute has on the Court's instant analysis however is of no moment. This is because, even under the law set out in these medical malpractice cases, an injured party must have actually been injured before the statute begins to run. That is, the case cited by CVS does not state that the cognizable event is \"the occurrence of facts and circumstances which lead, or should lead,\n   <em>\n    the patient to investigate the existence of a claim\n   </em>\n   ,\" as CVS contends. (Def.'s Reply at 6.) But rather, the case upon which CVS relies states that a \" 'cognizable event' is the occurrence of facts and circumstances which lead, or should lead,\n   <em>\n    the patient to believe that the physical condition or injury of which she complains\n   </em>\n   is related to a medical diagnosis, treatment, or procedure that the patient previously received.\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers v.

Consequently, even under the medical malpractice cases upon which CVS relies, a plaintiff must have a physical condition or injury before the statute commences. In the instant action, there is no dispute that Plaintiff's physical condition or injury occurred on August 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, Ohio's Bodily Injury Statute that governs Plaintiff's claim also requires the plaintiff to suffer a bodily injury. Specifically, the two-year statute of limitation is triggered on either (1) the date she was \"informed by competent medical authority that [she] has an injury that is related to the exposure\" to the\n   ethical drug, or (2) \"upon the date on which by the exercise of reasonable diligence [she] should have known that [she] has an injury that is related to the exposure, whichever date occurs first.\" Ohio Rev.

I will let physician experts opine on this more permanent and sustained harm if they are involved in this review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (McDonnell Rep. at 7). Reading Dr. McDonnell's comment cited to by CVS in context demonstrates that Dr. McDonnell-based on his knowledge, skills, and experience-concluded that Plaintiff's injuries were proximately caused by Amitriptyline ingestion. That Dr. McDonnell relegates to other medical professionals whether the ingestion of such medication continued to affect Plaintiff's pulmonary health in May 2016 does not contravene his conclusions. Plaintiff represents that a treating physician will opine on causation and injury, meaning that Dr. McDonnell will provide testimony on pharmacology. (Pl. Opp'n at 14). Second, this goes to the weight of Dr. McDonnell's testimony not to the admissibility and can appropriately be addressed through cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant has failed to meet its burden in demonstrating that Dr. McDonnell is unqualified to render an expert opinion in this matter. And Plaintiff has demonstrated that there remains a genuine issue of material facts on the issue of proximate causation. Therefore, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's negligence claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Defendant CVS's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    CVS does not directly challenge the constitutionality of Ohio's Malpractice Statute, and indeed could not do so at this juncture.
