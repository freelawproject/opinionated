INTRODUCTION\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Facebook, Inc. (\"Facebook\") is a global social media and networking company. It owns and operates a website and smartphone applications for Android and iOS such as Facebook Messenger and Facebook Lite. In March 2018, the news website Ars Technica reported Facebook apps for Android were programmed to scrape user call and text data to monetize the information for advertising purposes. Facebook allegedly scraped data by exploiting a software vulnerability in the permission settings of older versions of the Android OS. When users installed older versions of Facebook Messenger or Facebook Lite on their Android smartphones a contact upload prompt to grant Facebook access to contact lists surreptitiously also granted access to user call and text logs. Facebook stopped data scraping once the Android OS eventually closed the vulnerability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs are consumers from the states of California, Florida, Kansas, New York and Texas who bring claims for violations of California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201750\">\n    Cal.

Bus. Law \u00a7 349; and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs' theory of liability is Facebook failed to represent accurately or disclose it was collecting user data in violation of user privacy, and deprived users of any income generated from the use or sale of the data. Facebook's present motion seeks to dismiss all the claims without leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because plaintiffs do not identify in the complaint an omission or a specific misleading\n   contact upload prompt, they fail to state their fraud-based claims with sufficient particularity. The complaint also lacks factual averments supporting an injury in fact to establish standing for the CDAFA and GBL \u00a7 349 claims. Furthermore, the GBL claim is barred by Facebook's enforceable choice of law provision. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is granted and plaintiffs are given 21 days leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2018, Ars Technica reported Facebook was discretely collecting call and text data by exploiting a vulnerability in prior versions of the Android OS permission settings. Facebook Messenger and Facebook Lite users would receive a prompt during installation requesting permission to access their contact list. Prior to Android version 4.1, granting Facebook such access also surreptitiously granted the apps access to the user's call and text logs by default. Call logs appear to show years of incoming, outgoing, or missed calls, the date and time of each call, the number dialed, the individual called, and the duration of each call. Text logs contain similar sorts of data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs aver Facebook failed to disclose its data scraping practices. Rather than granting the access solely for its friend recommendation algorithm, as a Facebook spokesperson represented, plaintiffs aver Facebook incorporated call and text logs into its user profiles to be monetized for advertising purposes. The advertising space on Facebook platforms attracts potential advertisers with the possibility to target specific demographic and interest groups based in part on the user data Facebook collects. Additionally, Facebook has entered agreements to share its user data with 61 different entities including Apple, UPS, Microsoft, Blackberry, and Samsung.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Even as the vulnerability was identified and patched in later Android versions, applications like Facebook Messenger and Facebook Lite could bypass the patch by specifying they were using an older pre-patched version of the Android Software Development Kit. It was not until October 2017 that the Android operating system fully deprecated this function in all its versions, which coincided with Facebook ceasing this means of data scraping. Recently, the Open Handset Alliance, the group responsible for developing the Android OS, also announced plans to change the permission settings in the next Android version so users will need to opt-in to share their call and text logs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Facebook seeks to dismiss the first amended consolidated class action complaint (hereafter \"FACC\" or \"complaint\") in its entirety without leave to amend. It makes two threshold challenges: (1) there is no injury in fact to confer standing; and (2) the contact upload prompt demonstrates Facebook users allowed it to collect call and text logs. In addition to these threshold challenges, Facebook raises separate arguments for the dismissal of each individual claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Facebook contests the sufficiency of plaintiffs' injury in fact. First, it asserts plaintiffs lack a particularized injury because the FACC offers only conclusory claims of a deprivation of income and an invasion of privacy without identifying injury to the plaintiffs themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Google, Inc. Priv.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Policy Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-01382-PSG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206248499\">\n    2013 WL 6248499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 3, 2013) (\"a plaintiff must do more than point to the dollars in a defendant's pocket; he must sufficient[ly] allege that in the process he lost dollars of his own.\"). Second, Facebook challenges the concreteness of the injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Google, Inc. Privacy Policy Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-01382-PSG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206738343\">\n    2012 WL 6738343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal.

These averments include Facebook's duopoly with Google in the online advertising space, FACC \u00b6 16, its \"over $ 10 billion of annual advertising sales,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, and the monetization of \"User Data by selling advertising space on its platforms and services,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Although the complaint suggests Facebook profits off the advertisements targeting its users, which use the information Facebook collects, none of its averments offer a particularized or concrete harm related to the individual plaintiffs' deprivation of any income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs also aver an invasion of privacy theory conferring standing, which is particularized. Plaintiffs Olin, Nyamjom, Smith-Jackson, and Vega-Latker, were able to download the scraped data and confirm Facebook was in possession of their private call and text logs without their consent.

Plaintiffs' argument that Facebook used a \"standard Android prompt\" to obtain user data falls short of the requisite specific wording of the misrepresentation, and there is no such averment or explanation in the complaint.

Only Section 502(c)(1) requires plaintiffs to aver Facebook \"altered, damaged, destroyed, or otherwise used any data...,\" while Sections 502(c)(2),(3), and (7) focus on access and use. Plaintiffs aver Facebook scraped call and text data from the Android device such as the type of call, the time of each call, the number dialed, the individual called, and the duration of each call. FACC \u00b6 1. The lack of a disclosure, combined with Facebook's averred exploitation of the permission setting on older Android OS devices, is enough to plead Facebook circumvented technical barriers in violation of the CDAFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The complaint also adequately avers how Facebook used \"computer services\" under Section 502(c)(3). Facebook allegedly exploited \"a software vulnerability in the permission settings of older versions of the Android OS,\" particularly prior to Android version 4.1. FACC \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. In the opposition, plaintiffs argue their general accusation of data scraping Android smartphones necessarily implies the use of \"storage functions\" and \"Internet services\" such as CPU and RAM, storage space on the device, and Wi-Fi and 4G to transmit data to Facebook.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oppo. at 15:20-24.
