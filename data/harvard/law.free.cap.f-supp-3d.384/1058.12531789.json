Wal-Mart generates a daily Meal Exception Report at each store. The Meal Exception Report identifies all employees who had a meal exception as determined by the employee's time punches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   17. The Meal Exception Report reflects a meal exception irrespective of whether the associate voluntarily or involuntarily skipped their lunch, voluntarily or involuntarily took a less-than-30-minute break, voluntarily or involuntarily took a late meal period, or actually took a full, compliant meal period but merely forgot to clock in or out for lunch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   18. All employees who appear on the final weekly Meal Exception Report, for whatever reason, receive a meal period premium payment equivalent to one hour of compensation at the employee's base rate of pay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   19.

As described above, EMS code 1 means a meal exception resulting from \"associate initiated customer support\"; EMS code 5 means a meal exception that was management directed because of no coverage for customer support; and code 12 means a meal exception that was management directed.

This testimony was unrebutted. Therefore, for EMS code 1, trial testimony established that the employee\n   <em>\n    chose\n   </em>\n   to engage in customer support despite it being their meal period. As\n   <em>\n    McLeod\n   </em>\n   held, Wal-Mart had already relinquished control over the employee for their meal period. It is up to the employee to decide what to do with his or her time. If the employee chose to engage in customer support even though it was the employee's meal period, Wal-Mart cannot force that employee to take a compliant meal period. There is no evidence here that Wal-Mart ordered the employee to engage in customer service activities. Thus, the Court finds that EMS code 1 does not reflect a violation of \u00a7 226.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   On the other hand, Moore testified that EMS codes 5 and 12 show that management directed the employee to take a noncompliant meal break:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. And the third code you mentioned this morning was management directed, no customer support. What does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A. The associate is - that code means it was - the meal exception was manager directed. No coverage or for customer support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q.

Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Q. Is that the same thing basically as management directed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265:20-266:6. Thus, because codes 5 and 12 reflect a Wal-Mart management decision not to let the employee take a compliant meal break, these codes reflect a violation of \u00a7 226.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Wal-Mart argues that the EMS codes do not show who was actually denied a meal break. Rather, they only show what Wal-Mart employees\n   <em>\n    allege\n   </em>\n   to be the reason a meal exception occurred. However, Wal-Mart's attempt to discredit its own process for investigating and classifying meal exceptions in the EMS is unpersuasive. Testimony by Todd Stokes, Wal-Mart's divisional human resources director, demonstrated that Wal-Mart itself relies on this investigation and classification process for identifying problems with employees' behaviors relating to meal periods:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Q. And this investigation would ultimately, the purpose of that investigation is to end up determining who is accountable for that meal violation, whether it's management or the associate; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   A. So one of the outcomes from that is that we can sometimes determine the associate worked too long and didn't take it, or sometimes we may learn that a manager pulled an associate away and didn't let them take it. So those are the two general outcomes that can come from that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Q. And those outcomes, as a matter of practice, should be recorded down somewhere; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   A. So, yes, there's a form that's filled out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Q. And part of the reason for this investigation process is to determine who was accountable and have a discussion with them to make sure that it doesn't happen again, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   A. That is - I would say that's a good classification. We want to make sure that we address the behavior that needs to change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146:9-147:3. As Wal-Mart conducts an investigation, assigns a code to each meal period exception as a result of Wal-Mart's investigation, and relies upon the results of Wal-Mart's investigation, Wal-Mart cannot turn around and repudiate the results of the investigation and associated EMS entry to avoid liability. As such, the Court finds that the EMS codes are reliable indicators of the reason why a meal exception occurred, because they are encoded as to the reason a meal exception occurred after an investigation conducted by Wal-Mart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In sum, the Court holds that Wal-Mart violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226.7\">\n    Cal.

The Court bases this conclusion on the fact that the California Supreme Court has linked the knowing and intentional standard to a willfulness standard; that the majority of state appellate and federal trial courts have done the same; that linking the knowing and intentional standard to willfulness is consistent with another \u00a7 226 provision; and that the commonly-understood meanings of knowing and intentional support linking knowing and intentional to willfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   First, the California Supreme Court has linked the \"knowing and intentional\" standard in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    Cal.

Code \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) governs the information required on \"accurate itemized statement[s]\" (e.g., wage statements) that an employer issues. Specifically, \u00a7 226(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   An employer, semimonthly or at the time of each payment of wages, shall furnish to his or her employee, either as a detachable part of the check, draft, or voucher paying the employee's wages, or separately if wages are paid by personal check or cash, an accurate itemized statement in writing showing (1) gross wages earned, (2) total hours worked by the employee, except as provided in subdivision (j), (3) the number of piece-rate units earned and any applicable piece rate if the employee is paid on a piece-rate basis, (4) all deductions, provided that all deductions made on written orders of the employee may be aggregated and shown as one item, (5) net wages earned, (6) the inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid, (7) the name of the employee and only the last four digits of his or her social security number or an employee identification number other than a social security number, (8) the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer and, if the employer is a farm labor contractor, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1682, the name and address of the legal entity that secured the services of the employer, and (9) all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee and, beginning July 1, 2013, if the employer is a temporary services employer as defined in Section 201.3, the rate of pay and the total hours worked for each temporary services assignment.

Courts have held that it is especially vital that the employee receive an accurate itemized statement in writing at the time of termination to avoid \"employee confusion over whether they received all wages owed them, difficulty and expense involved in reconstructing pay records, and forcing employees to make mathematical computations to analyze whether the wages paid in fact compensated them for all hours worked.\"\n   <em>\n    Elliot v.

Here, the Court sits in diversity.\n   <em>\n    Soto\n   </em>\n   is the only published, extant California case this Court found that discusses when employers must meet the requirements under \u00a7 226(a).

Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 10. An employee's final wage statement is issued on this biweekly pay schedule; it is not issued on the day an employee is terminated and paid final wages unless an employee happens to be terminated on the day biweekly wages are paid and a biweekly wage statement is issued. Thus, Wal-Mart's issuance of a final wage statement could be delayed by up to 14 days after an employee is terminated, paid his or her final wages, and given the statement of final pay (which does not identify the pay period for which the final wages are paid). This exacerbates the problems an employee faces in determining whether or not his or her final wages are correct. These problems an employee faces inform courts' interpretations of California Labor Code provisions such as \u00a7 226 because the California Supreme Court has held that \"the state's labor laws are to be liberally construed in favor of worker protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v. Dart Container Corp. of California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514255\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/347/12514255/#p561\">\n    4 Cal. 5th 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561-62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514256,12514255\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/347/\">\n    229 Cal.Rptr.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514255\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/347/12514255/#p561\">\n    411 P.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Furthermore, because the statement of final pay is issued and given to the employee on the day of termination, it is likely the only chance an employee has to access his or her Wal-Mart supervisor to discuss or dispute, outside of litigation, the accuracy of the wages received. Thus, as per\n   <em>\n    Alvarado\n   </em>\n   's concern for worker protection, it is critical that the statement of final pay identify the paid period for final wages paid to allow an employee to evaluate whether he or she has been correctly paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Also, Wal-Mart provides computer terminals in its stores for employees to access and print their wage statements. Tr. at 162:15-20. Terminated employees lose access to Wal-Mart's computer terminals. Because the date an employee is terminated does not necessarily fall on the same date the final wage statement is issued, employees could lose access to their final wage statements. For instance, Magadia testified that after he was terminated, he could not log in to Wal-Mart's computer terminals to look at his wage statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117:11-16 (\"Q. And after your termination, was your access to Walmart's intranet terminated? A. Yes. Q. So after your access to Walmart's intranet was terminated, were you able to log in to look at your pay stubs at all? A. No.\"). Moreover, there was testimony indicating that Magadia did not even receive his final wage statement because his Wal-Mart intranet access was terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:5-8 (\"Q. So in other words, if your access to Walmart's\n   intranet was already terminated, you couldn't have logged on to look at this [final wage] statement; correct? A. Yes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   In sum,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) requires: \"[a]n employer, semimonthly or\n   <em>\n    at the time of each payment of wages\n   </em>\n   , shall furnish to his or her employee...an accurate itemized statement in writing....\" (emphasis added). The \"accurate itemized wage statement\" must be compliant with all the requirements of \u00a7 226(a). Here, the itemized statement must include the \"inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid\" pursuant to \u00a7 226(a)(6). It is undisputed that at the time of termination, a Wal-Mart employee receives by check all wages earned through the date of termination. Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 13. Thus, at the time of termination (i.e., a time when wages are paid), a Wal-Mart employee must receive an itemized statement that includes the dates for which the employee is being paid. That itemized statement takes the form of Wal-Mart's statement of final pay. The statement of final pay, as discussed above, does not contain the dates for which the employee is being paid. Therefore, in view of the principles behind \u00a7 226(a), the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order held that Wal-Mart's statement of final pay must comply with \u00a7 226(a)(6) by disclosing the dates for which the employee is being paid. Critically, the summary judgment order is consistent with the California Supreme Court's statement that \"the state's labor laws are to be liberally construed in favor of worker protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Alvarado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514255\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/347/12514255/#p561\">\n    4 Cal. 5th at 561-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514256,12514255\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/347/\">\n    229 Cal.Rptr.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514255\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/347/12514255/#p561\">\n    411 P.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   ii.

Wal-Mart contends that its final wage statement, not the statement of final pay, must comply with \u00a7 226(a)(6). ECF No. 86 at 5. The Court finds that under\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   , there was uncertainty in the law allowing Wal-Mart to claim there was a good faith dispute prior to the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order. 23 Cal. App. 5th at 868,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514556\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/233/524/#p868\">\n    233 Cal.Rptr.3d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \u00a7 226(a) provides: \"[a]n employer, semimonthly\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   at the time of each payment of wages, shall furnish to his or her employee...an accurate itemized statement in writing....\" (emphasis added). The statute uses the disjunctive \"or,\" implying that the provision of \"an accurate itemized statement\" could take place\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   semimonthly\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   at the time wages were paid. By using the disjunctive \"or,\" \u00a7 226(a) implied that employers could be in compliance with the law so long as a compliant wage statement was issued semimonthly, and not necessarily at the time of the payment of any wages. Wal-Mart did issue such a semimonthly pay statement in the form of the final wage statement after the employee's termination and receipt of his or her statement of final pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Before this Court issued its May 11, 2018 summary judgment order, ECF No. 121, there was no case law holding that Wal-Mart's statements of final pay must comply with \u00a7 226(a). There was also no case law holding that the statute required issuance of a statement of final pay compliant with \u00a7 226(a)(6) regardless of whether a compliant semimonthly wage statement was also issued. Thus, Wal-Mart's mistaken belief that its statements of final pay were not wage statements that needed to comply with \u00a7 226(a) was in good faith because Wal-Mart issued a terminated employee a final wage statement on Wal-Mart's semimonthly on-cycle pay period schedule in compliance with \u00a7 226(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Therefore, Wal-Mart designed a payment system that, under Wal-Mart's interpretation, was in compliance with \u00a7 226(a)(6). The Court finds that Wal-Mart, owing to its good faith belief, did not knowingly and intentionally violate \u00a7 226(a)(6) by issuing deficient statements of final pay before the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   iii. Whether Wal-Mart Knowingly and Intentionally Violated \u00a7 226(a)(6) Regarding the Statement of Final Pay After the May 11, 2018 Summary Judgment Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The Court next addresses whether Wal-Mart had a good faith belief that Wal-Mart was in compliance with \u00a7 226(a)(6) after the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   First, the May 11, 2018 summary judgment order stated in no uncertain terms: \"the Court finds that the Statement of Final Pay violates \u00a7 226(a)(6) because it does not include the pay period start and end dates.\" ECF No. 121 at 16. Wal-Mart could no longer have a good faith belief undergirded by uncertainty in the law because at that point, the law of the case was clear: Wal-Mart's statements of final pay needed to comply with\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the requirements of \u00a7 226(a). Thus, Wal-Mart should have taken immediate steps to fix the deficient statements of final pay. Yet, Wal-Mart did nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Wal-Mart is still issuing deficient statements of final pay, Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 14, and belatedly began to inquire about solutions to the problem sometime during the week before Thanksgiving, on the eve of the November 30, 2018 trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 389:16-391:2 (\"A. The payroll information systems department was asked to estimate what kind of effort they thought it might be with what they knew about the ask [to fix Wal-Mart's deficient statements of final pay and wage statements]. The Court: And what was the date of that request?....A. I believe the week before Thanksgiving.\"). Although fact discovery closed on May 1, 2018, ECF No. 27 at 2, Plaintiffs did not object to Wal-Mart's trial testimony about Wal-Mart's belated remedial inquires to comply with this Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order on the eve of the November 30, 2018 trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Despite the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order, Wal-Mart has not asked any employee to change Wal-Mart's deficient statements of final pay. Moreover, Michael Baran, Wal-Mart's technical expert in the people systems payroll area, testified that no change has been made to Wal-Mart's statements of final pay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   Q. Okay. And in Mr. Winn's cross-examination of you, you testified that you were asked by Walmart to make a change as to Walmart's wage statements regarding the OVERTIME/INCT and statements of final pay.

The payroll information systems department was merely asked to \"estimate\" the effort needed to make changes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   So, for 6 months after the Court's May 11, 2018\n   summary judgment order issued, Wal-Mart took no steps to remedy the problem. Wal-Mart's belated and half-hearted remedial inquiries on the eve of trial appeared to be motivated by a desire to create evidence for trial rather than a sincere effort to correct the deficient statements of final pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Second, Wal-Mart did not have a good faith mistaken belief that its statement of final pay complied with \u00a7 226(a)(6). The two pieces of evidence of good faith upon which Wal-Mart relies are that Wal-Mart's statement of final pay identifies the date on which the statement is issued, and that Wal-Mart conducts exit interviews. However, the fact that the statement of final pay includes its issuance date does not demonstrate that Wal-Mart attempted in good faith to comply with \u00a7 226(a)(6). After the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order, Wal-Mart knew that its statement of final pay violated \u00a7 226(a)(6), but Wal-Mart still failed to add the pay period start and end dates for final wages paid to the statement of final pay. Wal-Mart's inaction despite being on notice of the illegality of its practice of omitting the pay period dates from its statement of final pay belies Wal-Mart's purported good faith mistaken belief that Wal-Mart was in compliance with \u00a7 226(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Moreover, Wal-Mart's \"evidence\" of good faith actually acknowledges that Wal-Mart\n   <em>\n    fails\n   </em>\n   to comply with \u00a7 226(a)(6). Wal-Mart is essentially saying that employees might be able to get the information required under \u00a7 226(a)(6) from their exit interview. However, the California Labor Code does not excuse a violation of \u00a7 226(a)(6) simply because an employee might get the information required under \u00a7 226(a)(6) from other sources. Thus, there is no evidence, factually or legally, of a good faith mistaken belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds Wal-Mart liable for violating \u00a7 226(a)(6) after May 11, 2018 because it knowingly and intentionally issued deficient statements of final pay without a good faith dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   b.

Lab. Code \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9) requires wage statements to contain \"all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee.\" Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that Wal-Mart knowingly and intentionally failed to include the applicable hourly rates and corresponding hours worked for the OVERTIME/INCT line item. Like for Plaintiffs' \u00a7 226(a)(6) claim above, Wal-Mart admits that \"it is aware of the law.\" ECF No. 215 at 9. Yet, Wal-Mart issued and continues to issue deficient wage statements omitting the required hours and hourly rate for the OVERTIME/INCT line item.

Yet Wal-Mart is still issuing deficient wage statements and belatedly began to inquire about solutions to the problem sometime during the week before Thanksgiving, on the eve of the November 30, 2018 trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 369:14-19;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 389:16-391:2. Michael Baran, Wal-Mart's technical expert in the people systems payroll area, testified that no change has been made to Wal-Mart's wage statements regarding the OVERTIME/INCT line item and that Wal-Mart has not requested anyone at Wal-Mart to make any such change:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   Q.

No, we have not.\" Tr. at 369:14-19. So, for 6 months after the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order issued, Wal-Mart\n   took no steps to remedy the problem. Wal-Mart's belated and half-hearted remedial inquiries on the eve of trial appeared to be motivated by a desire to create evidence for trial rather than a sincere effort to correct the deficient statements of final pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Second, Wal-Mart has not demonstrated a good faith mistaken belief that it complied with \u00a7 226(a)(9) under the third prong of the good faith analysis (an employer's good faith mistaken belief grounded in a good faith dispute). \u00a7 226(a)(9) requires that wage statements contain \"all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee.\" Wal-Mart's argument that as evidence of its good faith, it informed associates that \"[e]arned MyShare Incentive Awards will be included in the regular rate of pay when calculating overtime for the incentive quarter\" and \"flags this for associates in its written MyShare Quarterly Incentive Plan Program,\" Ex. 125-7; ECF No. 215 at 10, is unpersuasive and does not implicate a good faith dispute. Wal-Mart's MyShare Quarterly Incentive Plan Program (Exhibit 125) states that \"[q]ualifying participants employed in an eligible facility may receive a MyShare incentive award.\" This statement is emblematic of the very high level of generality the MyShare Quarterly Incentive Plan Program describes how the OVERTIME/INCT line item is calculated. In other words, Wal-Mart's MyShare Quarterly Incentive Plan Program fails to disclose employees' hourly rates and corresponding hours worked for the OVERTIME/INCT line item, as required by \u00a7 226(a)(9). The purpose behind enforcing \u00a7 226(a)(9) is so \"that employees are adequately informed of compensation received and are not shortchanged by their employers.\"\n   <em>\n    Soto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440858\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/4/385/#p392\">\n    4 Cal.

Yet, Wal-Mart's MyShare Quarterly Incentive Plan Program does not come close to satisfying the purpose of \u00a7 226(a)(9), which is to give employees\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   information about line items in wage statements so that employees have sufficient information to identify potential issues with the paid wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that Wal-Mart is liable for violating \u00a7 226(a)(9) because it knowingly and intentionally issued wage statements with the OVERTIME/INCT line item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Having found that Wal-Mart knowingly and intentionally violated both \u00a7 226(a)(6) (regarding the statement of final pay claim) after the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order, and \u00a7 226(a)(9) (regarding the OVERTIME/INCT claim), the Court turns to the third prong of the inquiry: whether the Plaintiffs suffered injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Magadia also admitted that he\n   did not know of anyone else who was confused by any of Wal-Mart's pay statements: \"Q.

The Court addresses each inquiry in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   First, the statutory provisions were established to protect the concrete interests of employees who have a legitimate right of access to their pay information to protect their interests. These are real rights, rather than purely legal or procedural rights. As an example, in amending \u00a7 226(a) to include \u00a7 226(a)(9), the provision implicated by Plaintiffs' claim regarding the OVERTIME/INCT line item, the California Senate bill analysis incorporated comments that employees \"are often provided little information about their wages,\" and that \"this bill will remedy that problem.\"\n   <em>\n    York v. Starbucks Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%208617536\">\n    2009 WL 8617536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 3, 2009) (quoting California Senate Judiciary Committee, Bill Analysis, A.B. 2509 (Steinberg), August 8, 2000). The\n   <em>\n    York\n   </em>\n   court described the purpose behind the addition of \u00a7 226(a)(9) as \"requiring more information and disclosure to employees, not less\" to avoid employers cheating their employees out of legitimately-earned wages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%208617536\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Analogously, the same can be said of \u00a7 226(a)(6), implicated by Plaintiffs' statement of final pay claim, which requires more information disclosed to employees, not less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   In sum, it seems the animating purpose behind \u00a7 226(a), with all its provisions regarding what must be disclosed on wage statements, is employee protection. Intertwined with this purpose is an element of deterrence, as \"California employers are 'chronic violators of wage and hour, safety, and tax laws.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%208617536\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting California Assembly Committee on Labor &amp; Employment,\n   Bill Analysis, A.B. 2509 (Steinberg), April 12, 2000). Similar sentiments were echoed when the California Legislature amended \u00a7 226(a) to require \"accurate\" itemized wage statements: \"During oversight hearings conducted by the Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment in 2001, the Committee learned that labor law violations are rampant in the underground economy, and that state labor law enforcement is minimal.\" California Assembly Committee on Labor &amp; Employment, Bill Analysis, A.B. 276 (Koretz), March 13, 2003. Given more wage information, employees would be more able to identify any violation of wage and hour laws, so California employers would be less likely to attempt to cheat employees. In this context, it makes sense that the California legislature might protect against such harms without requiring a higher threshold showing of injury to the employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Analogously, in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   , the Fair Credit Reporting Act's (\"FCRA\") provisions were at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1113\">\n    867 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both the FCRA and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal. Lab.

In\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit noted that the plaintiff's credit report \"falsely reported that he is married with children, that he is in his 50s, that he is employed in a professional or technical field, that he has a graduate degree, and that his wealth level is higher than it is.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1113\">\n    867 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was \"clear\" to the\n   <em>\n    Spokeo II\n   </em>\n   court that these facts \"are substantially more likely to harm [plaintiff's] concrete interests than the Supreme Court's example of an incorrect zip code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, omissions of pay period dates and the number of hours worked and at what rates, as is the case here, strike at the heart of the intent behind the California Legislature's efforts to protect employees. The Court first discusses the harm to Plaintiffs' concrete interests under \u00a7 226(a)(6) (regarding the statement of final pay claim), then under \u00a7 226(a)(9) (regarding the OVERTIME/INCT claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   i. Harm to Plaintiffs' Concrete Interests under \u00a7 226(a)(6) (regarding the statement of final pay claim)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   In relation to Plaintiffs' claim under \u00a7 226(a)(6), it is critical that the statement of final pay contain accurate information regarding \"the inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid\" because the statement is issued on the day the employee is terminated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). The omission of the dates from the statements of final pay may make it more difficult for employees to determine the accuracy of the information presented. Other such injuries might include \"employee confusion over whether they received all wages owed them, difficulty and expense involved in reconstructing pay records, and\n   forcing employees to make mathematical computations to analyze whether the wages paid in fact compensated them for all hours worked.\"\n   <em>\n    Elliot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3773269\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/572/1169/#p1181\">\n    572 F. Supp. 2d at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, after employees are terminated, it presumably becomes more difficult for employees to correct incorrect information on their wage statements or challenge their final wages outside the context of litigation. Thus, it is important that the dates of pay appear on the statement of final pay, so employees can raise any issues during their exit interviews or with their supervisor on the employees' last day of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Even Wal-Mart's own witness, Todd Stokes, concedes that Wal-Mart employees suffer the statutorily-defined injury by being unable to determine from the face of the statement of final pay the pay period for which employees are being paid. The California Labor Code statutorily defines injury as the inability to \"promptly and easily determine from the wage statement alone\" items required to be disclosed on a wage statement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal.

A. They cannot determine the pay period specifically off this document.\" Tr. at 140:16-21. Magadia also testified as to his confusion stemming from his inability to determine the start and end dates from the statement of final pay. Magadia stated: \"Q. Okay.

This is especially important given that Wal-Mart employees' OVERTIME/INCT line item is calculated over a\n   <em>\n    quarterly\n   </em>\n   basis, meaning that many months elapse until employees are able to see the line item on their wage statements. Without the requisite \"applicable hourly rates in effect...and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee,\" it is especially difficult for employees to assess whether they have been paid correctly.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal.

The amount of PAGA penalties awarded to the OVERTIME/INCT Wage Statement class would therefore match 100% the amount of \u00a7 226(e) statutory damages awarded, and is approximately 36% of the original amount of PAGA penalties Plaintiffs requested.

Guided by the\n   <em>\n    Aguirre\n   </em>\n   court's logic in reducing the PAGA penalties, this Court reduces the PAGA penalties awarded to the OVERTIME/INCT Wage Statement\n   class to $ 48,046,000, which matches 100% the amount awarded in \u00a7 226(e) statutory damages awarded for Wal-Mart's underlying statutory violation.

The Court has not found any case awarding a PAGA penalty as high as $ 131,427,750. PAGA penalties are paid 75% to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency and 25% to aggrieved employees. Thus, in wage and hour class action cases that settle, which are the overwhelming majority of such cases, very little of the total settlement is paid to PAGA penalties in order to maximize payments to class members.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ceja-Corona v.

To penalize Wal-Mart so disproportionately relative to statutory\n   damages by awarding the maximum PAGA penalty of $ 131,427,750 for conduct that ultimately results in a net positive for employees-the award of discretionary bonuses-would not make sense in the overall scheme of California's Labor Code, which \"should be interpreted broadly to protect workers.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

A highly disproportionate PAGA penalty relative to statutory damages may deter employers from paying discretionary bonuses to employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Additionally, the Court recognizes the difficulty in calculating the OVERTIME/INCT line item. As aforementioned, the OVERTIME/INCT line item is predicated on the award of a MyShare discretionary bonus, which is awarded quarterly. Once the quarterly MyShare bonus is awarded, Tr. at 158:4-7, Wal-Mart adjusts the base rate of pay as well as any overtime accrued\n   <em>\n    over the entire quarter\n   </em>\n   by the employee to account for the additional MyShare bonus that has been paid,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 158:11-17. In essence, the OVERTIME/INCT line item is \"an additional amount of overtime dollars that [employees have] earned based on the fact that the regular rate of pay needs to be adjusted up\" to take into account the MyShare discretionary bonus award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158:18-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   However, as discussed above, Wal-Mart's on-cycle wage statements are biweekly, and every time an employee accrues overtime, the overtime is listed on the employee's biweekly wage statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159:2-3. Thus, in order for Wal-Mart to calculate the OVERTIME/INCT line item, Wal-Mart must add together all the hours of overtime an employee worked over the quarter that the MyShare bonus is paid, prorate the MyShare bonus to account for the number of overtime hours worked in the quarter, then adjust the overtime hourly rate for overtime already paid upward based on the prorated amount of the MyShare bonus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394:14-25. Admittedly, the Court has difficulty in understanding how this calculation works, as it was not explained in any amount of detail at trial or in any evidence. Thus, this calculation is not a simple matter of multiplying an hourly wage by the number of hours worked. However, this also underscores the importance of Wal-Mart providing the hours and rate on the wage statements. As discussed above, employees cannot calculate the hours and rate from the face of the wage statements, which makes challenging the accuracy of the wage statements difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Because the Court recognizes the challenges Wal-Mart faces in calculating and displaying the OVERTIME/INCT line item, the Court believes that a decrease in the amount of PAGA penalties awarded for Wal-Mart's failure to display the hours worked and rate paid for the OVERTIME/INCT line item is warranted. However, that does not excuse Wal-Mart's failure to comply with the Labor Code. Wal-Mart admits that the OVERTIME/INCT line item is representable by an hourly rate multiplied by the hours worked.

The Court notes that the award of any PAGA penalties here is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   limited to the period of time after May 11, 2018. Because a PAGA claim seeks penalties on the LWDA's behalf, plaintiffs \"seeking civil penalties under PAGA for a violation of section 226(a) do[ ] not have to satisfy the 'injury' and 'knowing and intentional' requirements of section 226(e)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Therefore, per California labor\n   law, PAGA penalties here are not limited to the period of time when Wal-Mart's violations are knowing and intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   However, as the Court discussed above, the court has discretion to reduce the amount of PAGA penalties awarded if, \"based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 2699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). For the following two reasons, the Court reduces the amount of PAGA penalties awarded the Final Wage Statement Class to 20% of Plaintiffs' original request of $ 28,928,500 in PAGA penalties. Thus, the Court awards $ 5,785,700 in PAGA penalties to the Final Wage Statement Class for Wal-Mart's violations of \u00a7 226(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   First, the Court found there was uncertainty in the law allowing Wal-Mart to claim there was a good faith dispute from December 2, 2015 to the Court's May 11, 2018 summary judgment order. Specifically, \u00a7 226(a)(6) provides: \"[a]n employer, semimonthly\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   at the time of each payment of wages, shall furnish to his or her employee...an accurate itemized statement in writing....\" (emphasis added). The statute uses the disjunctive \"or,\" implying that the provision of \"an accurate itemized statement\" could take place\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   semimonthly\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   at the time wages were paid. By using the disjunctive \"or,\" \u00a7 226(a)(6) implied that employers could be in compliance with the law so long as a compliant wage statement was issued semimonthly, and not necessarily at the time of the payment of any wages. Thus, Wal-Mart had a good faith belief that its final wage statements complied with \u00a7 226(a)(6) from December 2, 2015, to May 11, 2018, approximately two and a half years. Wal-Mart did not have a good faith belief of its compliance with \u00a7 226(a)(6) only from the May 11, 2018 summary judgment order to the November 30, 2018 trial, which is approximately 6 months. Because Wal-Mart had a good faith belief for such an extended period of time, the Court finds that awarding the full $ 28,928,500 in PAGA penalties requested by the Plaintiffs would be unjust and oppressive, and that a significant reduction is appropriate. California courts have held that a defendant's attempt to comply with the law is a basis for reduction in a PAGA penalties award.\n   <em>\n    Thurman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248873\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/203/1112/#p1136\">\n    203 Cal.

For instance, the\n   <em>\n    Aguirre\n   </em>\n   court reduced PAGA penalties from $ 1.8 million to $ 500,000 so that the PAGA penalty would be proportional to the amount of \u00a7 226(e) statutory damages awarded.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2010936035\">\n    2013 WL 10936035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Here, no statutory damages are being awarded. Thus, a $ 28,928,500 PAGA penalties award would be unjust and oppressive, and a significant reduction is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Accordingly, the Court awards $ 5,785,700 in PAGA penalties to the Final Wage Statement Class for Wal-Mart's violations of \u00a7 226(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   c. Wal-Mart's Additional Arguments for Why Recovery Should be Reduced or Eliminated\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Additionally, Wal-Mart advances six main arguments for why any recovery should be reduced or eliminated. First, Wal-Mart claimed at trial that damages should terminate at the date of class certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:23-59:10. Second, Wal-Mart argues that recovery under PAGA along with \u00a7 226(e) penalties would constitute\n   impermissible double recovery of the same underlying violations. ECF No. 215 at 15. Third, Wal-Mart asserts that awarding PAGA penalties here would violate due process and the Excessive Fines Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Fourth, Wal-Mart claims that PAGA penalties should be limited to past Labor Code violations for which the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (\"LWDA\") has been provided notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fifth, Wal-Mart believes that PAGA's \"default\" civil penalties are applicable here as opposed to the penalties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226.3\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ECF No. 198 at 15. Finally, Wal-Mart argues that Dr. Kriegler's calculations are unreliable. ECF No. 215 at 16-18. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   i. Whether Damages Terminate at the Date of Class Certification\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Wal-Mart provides no support for its assertion that damages must terminate at the date of class certification. In fact, no less an authority than the United States Supreme Court has held this is not so. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the legality of \"front pay\" in the context of labor actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n   <em>\n    Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302425\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/843/#p845\">\n    532 U.S. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845, 854,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302425\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/843/#p845\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302425\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/843/#p845\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). \"[F]ront pay is simply money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement [of a job] or in lieu of reinstatement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302425\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/843/#p845\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302425\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/843/#p845\">\n    at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302425\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/843/#p845\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So in essence, front pay is an award for damages\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   judgment has been entered. The United States Supreme Court has also held that \"full relief under Title VII may be awarded on a class basis.\"\n   <em>\n    United Airlines, Inc. v.

Combining the decision in\n   <em>\n    United Airlines\n   </em>\n   with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Pollard\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court has therefore upheld the legality of a post-judgment award of damages in a class action setting. Thus, damages in a class action do not have to terminate at the date of class certification.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pitre v.

The California Court of Appeal has held that for violations of \u00a7 226(a), \"[t]here are three different potential remedies available...(1) actual damages or statutory penalties; (2) injunctive relief;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    civil penalties\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Raines v.

Thus, because PAGA damages are civil penalties and are of a different nature than the statutory penalties provided for in \u00a7 226(e), recovering both civil penalties and statutory penalties would not constitute impermissible double recovery for the same underlying violation of the California Labor Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   This interpretation of California law is reinforced by PAGA's statutory text, which provides that \"nothing in this part shall operate to limit an employee's right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699\">\n    Cal.

First, the Court finds that under current law, the Eight Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is inapplicable here. The United States Supreme Court has held: \"[w]hile we agree with petitioners that punitive damages advance the interests of punishment and deterrence, which are also among the interests advanced by the criminal law,\n   <em>\n    we fail to see how this overlap requires us to apply the Excessive Fines Clause in a case between private parties\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vermont, Inc. v.

ECF No. 215 at 16. The Court rejects this argument. PAGA is expressly premised on punishing employers for underlying violations of the California Labor Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699.3\">\n    Cal.

PAGA penalties only apply when there is an underlying violation of the California Labor Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   In sum, the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause does not apply here because the instant case only involves private parties. Moreover, there is a nexus between PAGA penalties awarded and the harm suffered via an underlying violation of the Labor Code because a PAGA cause of action is available for litigants to vindicate their rights under the Labor Code. Thus, awarding PAGA penalties does not violate due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   iv. Whether PAGA Penalties Should be Limited to Past Labor Code Violations for which the LWDA has been Provided Notice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   California law requires that an aggrieved employee first give notice to the LWDA identifying the Labor Code provisions alleged to have been violated by an employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If and only if the LWDA provides notice that it does not intend to investigate the alleged Labor Code violation does a private right of action under PAGA arise.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699.3\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 2699.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). Wal-Mart cites no authority, and the Court has found none, that stands for the proposition that PAGA penalties are limited to redressing past violations of the California Labor Code for which the LWDA has been provided notice. Wal-Mart claims that PAGA penalties for continuing violations of the Labor Code are available only after additional letters to the LWDA are sent notifying the LWDA of these continuing violations. Tr. at 59:14-21. In essence, Wal-Mart argues that LWDA notification letters are retroactive and only permit the retroactive award of damages stopping on the date of the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   The Court has found case law supporting the proposition that Labor Code violations taking place\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the LWDA notice can be the foundation for PAGA penalties. In\n   <em>\n    Fleming v. Covidien Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court awarded PAGA penalties for a period of time after the LWDA letter was sent; in other words, the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   court did not cut off PAGA penalties at the date of the LWDA letter. The LWDA was provided notice on July 29, 2010 that the wage statements an employer was issuing violated \u00a7 226.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207563047\">\n    2011 WL 7563047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Nevertheless, the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   court awarded PAGA penalties for the period between July 29, 2009 and September 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. Under California law, a PAGA claim is subject to a 1-year statute of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20340\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Because the LWDA letter in\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   was sent on July 29, 2010, the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   court interpreted the statute of limitations as restricting PAGA penalties to the period after July 29, 2009.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207563047\">\n    2011 WL 7563047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   court stopped calculating PAGA damages on September 1, 2010 because that was the end date of the certified class period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    Schiller v.

There, the court estimated PAGA penalties for the purpose of calculating the amount in controversy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202793650\">\n    2010 WL 2793650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (E.D. Cal. July 14, 2010). Even though the LWDA notice was allegedly sent on January 14, 2010,\n   <em>\n    Schiller v. David's Bridal, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-616, ECF No. 1-1 at Ex. A p. 8, the\n   <em>\n    Schiller\n   </em>\n   court calculated PAGA penalties from January 15, 2009 to April 2010.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202793650\">\n    2010 WL 2793650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The\n   <em>\n    Schiller\n   </em>\n   court differed from the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   court in interpreting the PAGA statute of limitations. The\n   <em>\n    Schiller\n   </em>\n   court interpreted the 1-year statute of limitations as beginning on when the complaint was filed, instead of when the LWDA letter was submitted as in\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Nonetheless, the\n   <em>\n    Schiller\n   </em>\n   court calculated PAGA penalties to April 2010, past the LWDA letter's mailing date of January 14, 2010, because April 2010 was when the defendant filed its notice of removal (and the\n   <em>\n    Schiller\n   </em>\n   court was trying to determine whether the amount in controversy was enough to remove the case to federal court).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   The Court's interpretation of the PAGA statute is also supported by the legislative history. In allowing for the private right of action if the LWDA declined to investigate an alleged violation of the Labor Code, the bill sponsors noted that \"private actions to enforce the Labor Code are needed because [the] LWDA simply does not have the resources to pursue all of the labor violations occurring in the garment industry, agriculture, and other industries.\" California Assembly Committee on Judiciary, Bill Analysis, S.B. 796 (Dunn), June 26, 2003;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896184\" index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/46/969/#p980\">\n    46 Cal. 4th at 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20588\">\n    95 Cal.Rptr.3d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20P.3d%20923\">\n    209 P.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The act's declared purpose is to supplement enforcement actions by public agencies, which lack adequate resources to bring all such actions themselves....In a lawsuit brought under the act, the employee plaintiff represents the same legal right and interest as state labor law enforcement agencies....\"). As exemplified by the\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schiller\n   </em>\n   cases above, Labor Code violations do not simply cease once an LWDA letter has been filed; rather, an employer may continue to flagrantly violate the law. In order for the PAGA statute to have any teeth, litigants should be able to seek relief for violations after an LWDA notice letter has been sent because as the bill sponsors mentioned, the LWDA simply does not have the resources to pursue all violations of the Labor Code. Once the LWDA declines to pursue an alleged violation, it is up to the aggrieved employee to take action. It makes no sense to\n   require an aggrieved litigant to repeatedly submit letters to the LWDA once the LWDA has already declined to investigate an alleged Labor Code violation. To impose such a requirement would be contrary to the legislative intent embodied in PAGA, which is to allow private actions to remedy Labor Code violations once the LWDA is unable or unwilling to pursue an alleged violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Wal-Mart argues that the statutory text supports its argument that PAGA is limited to only redressing violations of the Labor Code prior to the LWDA notice letter. PAGA requires that an aggrieved employee provide notice to the LWDA for \"specific provisions of this code\n   <em>\n    alleged to have been violated\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699.3\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 2699.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). However, the statute does not preclude a private litigant from suing to redress violations of the Labor Code after the LWDA notice letter is sent. Obviously, the LWDA notice letter can only include provisions of the Labor Code\n   <em>\n    alleged\n   </em>\n   to have been violated because the aggrieved employee does not know at the time whether the employer will continue to violate the Labor Code after the LWDA notice letter is sent. If an employer continues to violate the Labor Code after the LWDA notice letter date, nothing in the statute precludes the aggrieved employee from seeking redress for those continuing violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   In sum, the Court holds that PAGA penalties are not limited to redressing past violations of the California Labor Code for which the LWDA has been provided notice. Rather, parties may seek to recover PAGA penalties on continuing violations of the Labor Code even after the LWDA notice letter is sent. This conclusion is buttressed by prior case law and legislative intent, which indicate that the LWDA does not have the capacity to pursue all violations of the Labor Code, so PAGA empowers employee plaintiffs to seek redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   v.

A court \"may take notice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Robinson Rancheria Citizens Council v. Borneo, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514089,10514151\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/244/\">\n    971 F.2d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (9th Cir. 1992). A court may also take judicial notice of the existence of matters of public record, such as a prior order or\n   decision, but not the truth of the disputed facts cited therein.\n   <em>\n    Lee v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p689\">\n    250 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001). Because the documents Wal-Mart supplied bear on the question of the retroactivity of the LWDA notice, the Court GRANTS Wal-Mart's request for judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   In response to Wal-Mart's request for judicial notice, Plaintiffs submit a request to address the documents Wal-Mart provided. ECF No. 216 at 3. This request is DENIED. Also in response to Wal-Mart's request for judicial notice, Plaintiffs submit their own request for judicial notice of the settlement in\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Wal-Mart Store, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-3339-EJD, \"which further supports Defendants' ability to pay the PAGA penalties.\" ECF No. 216 at 3. The proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   do not have a direct relation to matters at issue in this case as required under\n   <em>\n    Robinson Rancheria Citizens Council\n   </em>\n   -the question of Wal-Mart's\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to pay any PAGA penalties has never been litigated in the instant case-so Plaintiffs' request for judicial notice is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court decertifies the Meal Period Regular Rate Class, and denies Magadia's individual claim for Wal-Mart's violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226.7\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the Court finds that Wal-Mart violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226.7\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for failure to pay adequate compensation for missed meal breaks, and awards $ 70,000 in PAGA penalties to Wal-Mart employees who had meal exceptions coded in the EMS system under codes 5 or 12 since October 4, 2015. Thus, the total award for Plaintiffs' \u00a7 226.7 claim is $ 70,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Moreover, the Court awards Plaintiffs statutory damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) to the OVERTIME/INCT Wage Statement Class for Wal-Mart's violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9) in the amount of $ 48,046,000. In addition, the Court awards $ 48,046,000 in PAGA penalties to the OVERTIME/INCT Wage Statement Class. Thus, the total award for Plaintiffs' \u00a7 226(a)(9) claim is $ 96,092,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   As aforementioned, Plaintiffs did not calculate the damages amount for Wal-Mart's violations of \u00a7 226(a)(6) (regarding the statement of final pay claim) occurring after May 11, 2018, and thus did not meet their burden of proof on damages for the statement of final pay claim. Therefore, the Court does not award \u00a7 226(e) statutory damages to the Final Wage Statement Class. However, the Court awards $ 5,785,700 in PAGA penalties to the Final Wage Statement Class for Wal-Mart's violations of \u00a7 226(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs are awarded $ 48,046,000 in total \u00a7 226(e) statutory damages, and $ 53,901,700 in total PAGA penalties for an overall total of $ 101,947,700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-336\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that if the Court were to find that Magadia lacks Article III standing, the Court should remand the matter to state court. Here, the Court has not found a lack of Article III standing, so the Court declines to remand the instant action to state court. Furthermore, remand is only required if the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    claims in the matter.\n    <em>\n     Lee v. American Nat'l Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498897\" index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/997/#p1008\">\n     260 F.3d 997\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1008 (9th Cir. 2001). Such is not the case here as evidenced by this Court's jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' second cause of action, discussed below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-337\">\n    Courts have interchangeably used a good faith exemption, a good faith defense, and a good faith dispute when analyzing claims under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n     Cal.

All three phrases mean the same thing. As explained above, \u00a7 203 's good faith dispute is applied to \u00a7 226 's good faith dispute, and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8 \u00a7 13520 interprets \u00a7 203 's good faith dispute. This Court chooses to use the phrase \"good faith dispute\" to be consistent with the Regulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-338\">\n    Because the unpublished portion of\n    <em>\n     Canales\n    </em>\n    is available neither on Westlaw nor LexisNexis, the Court relies on the document Wal-Mart submitted in its request for judicial notice, ECF No. 131-1, which was granted, ECF No. 157 at 4 n.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-339\">\n    December 2, 2015 is the statute of limitations date for Plaintiffs' actions brought under \u00a7 226.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-340\">\n    For context, the full quote is: \"Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant's action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202453202\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
