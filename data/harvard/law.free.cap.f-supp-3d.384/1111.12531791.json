Consequently, the parties agree that FEMA needed to analyze and document ESA compliance for NFIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The problem with the Evaluation is that, after committing to Section 7 review, it arbitrarily and capriciously carved out floodplain development from scrutiny. Nothing in the Evaluation or the administrative\n   record provides a reasoned or reasonable basis for this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   FEMA sought to justify the exclusion by stating it has \"no role\" in issuing or denying local permits for floodplain development, so no federal action could be present to trigger Section 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FEMA-BE-0027703. But that reasoning simply turned an intentionally blind eye toward the broad scope of FEMA's floodplain management authority. The Evaluation expressly acknowledged FEMA's broad and deep role in establishing detailed floodplain management criteria and practices, policing participation in NFIP and access to federal insurance based on community adoption and enforcement of the criteria, adjusting insurance premiums under the CRS in light of compliance, and several other measures that directly affect how floodplains are managed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FEMA-BE-0027678-85. The Evaluation also expressly stated that FEMA enjoys discretion in formulating and implementing floodplain criteria and practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FEMA-BE-0027702, 0027877. Indeed, federal regulatory discretion over floodplain management is one of Congress's express goals in NFIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Evaluation also recognized the environmental aspects of floodplain management and development. The Evaluation described floodplains as \"hydrologically important, environmentally sensitive, and ecologically productive areas.\" FEMA-BE-0027707. It recognized that they \"perform a variety of essential functions\" such as \"maintain[ing] biodiversity,\" \"provid[ing] breeding and feeding grounds\" for fish and wildlife, protecting \"habitats for ESA species,\" and furnishing \"aesthetic pleasure\" from recreational opportunities. FEMA-BE-0027710-0027711. Insurance premiums may be adjusted under the CRS to \"protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions.\" FEMA-BE-0027681. And FEMA requires \"compliance with the ESA as a condition of the community's issuance of a floodplain development permit.\" Dkt. No. 41 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   FEMA's effort to pigeonhole floodplain development solely as a matter of state and local permits is untenable in light of these factors. The requirement of a permit from a local land use authority for development in a floodplain in no way detracts from or displaces FEMA's discretion over floodplain management. Its denial of any meaningful involvement flies in the face of the record and artificially truncates the scope of its actions for Section 7(a)(2)'s purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conner v.

FEMA suggests that even if federal agency action was involved, Section 7 would still not apply because NFIP \"does not cause development to occur\" as a direct or indirect effect. FEMA-BE-0027741.

The discussion of this complex issue ran all of three pages, and relied on an extremely limited selection of sources. FEMA-BE-0027741-43. FEMA cited data indicating that flood insurance may be underutilized, from which it inferred that factors other than NFIP must be driving any floodplain development that occurs. FEMA-BE-0027741. But even if that broad inference were accepted without reservation, it was far too slender a reed on which to base the sweeping conclusion that NFIP does not encourage development anywhere in the United States, particularly in light of the other portions of the Evaluation that explain FEMA's extensive role in floodplain management. At best, the insurance utilization figures merely beg the question of whether NFIP affects development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   FEMA's reliance on two other studies did not provide any additional evidentiary support. The GAO study it cited was published in 1982 and used data from 1960 to 1980. FEMA-BE-0027743. How this might be useful or relevant to evaluating floodplain development in 2016, 34 years after publication, was left unsaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Other weaknesses further undermined the GAO report. It was based on a review of six \"coastal barrier islands\" and similar communities that certainly would not adequately represent conditions and development factors in the more than 22,000 communities covered by the Evaluation. FEMA-BE-0022459. The study was done at a time when 1.9 million flood insurance policies were in effect, compared to 5.6 million today, and before the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 directed lenders in flood-prone zones to require borrowers to purchase flood insurance on their property. The study was based on interviews of only 115 people familiar with the flood insurance program, and even then, 98 of the interviewees \"thought that flood insurance aided development.\" FEMA-BE-0022465. And far from definitively concluding that flood insurance did not cause development, the report found that it offered a \"marginal added incentive to development in the coastal and barrier island communities.\" FEMA-BE-0022467.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The citation to the American Institutes for Research study published in 2006 was equally unavailing. This study compared rates of development in areas covered by NFIP to those in areas outside the program, and reached conflicting conclusions. One the one hand, it stated that NFIP \"can have varying direct and indirect impacts on the amount of development that occurs in floodplains. Some components of the NFIP have the affect [sic] of discouraging development while other components of the program act to remove barriers to that development.\" FEMA-BE-0023441. On the other, it said that NFIP did not cause floodplain development because \"market forces,\" rather than flood insurance, are a potent source of development. FEMA-BE-0027662. In addition to suffering from these ambiguities, the report used data collected in or before 1997, 19 years before the Evaluation was published. FEMA-BE-0027743.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   FEMA made matters worse by simply ignoring evidence that NFIP was, in fact, likely to jeopardize endangered species and habitats. In April 2016, NMFS determined that NFIP in Oregon would \"directly and indirectly affect anadromous species and their designated critical habitat, and that the effects would be predominantly adverse.\" FEMA-BE-0031958. In 2008, NMFS concluded that NFIP \"is likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of several endangered species in the Puget Sound in Washington State. FEMA-BE-0031572. Similarly, FWS had made a jeopardy determination in 2010 for several endangered species in the Florida Keys. FEMA-BE-0030552. All of these biological opinions pre-dated the Evaluation, yet it had nothing substantive to say about them on the way to making the no effect determination. That was a substantial and damaging omission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of Santa Clara River v.

Even if they were considered, they would not save the cause for FEMA. One of its criticisms is that the Services wrongly treated floodplain development as an agency action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28 at 7-8. That is not a fair point. The Services defined the \"proposed action\" as the provision of flood insurance, flood mapping, and floodplain management -- much as the Evaluation did -- and evaluated floodplain development as a possible effect of NFIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FEMA-BE-0031579; FEMA-BE-0031830. That is entirely consistent with Section 7 and its implementing regulations, and something FEMA should have done here, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Other aspects of the Evaluation raise serious concerns as well. The use of a single evaluation to cover the entire United States is problematic. FEMA defined a national \"action area\" for the Evaluation, and determined that the \"vast geographic extent\" of this area would permit only \"a broad approach\" to assessing ESA effects. FEMA-BE-0027748. This wide-angle perspective unduly obscured important local variables in listed species and critical habitats, floodplain development practices, and other factors that should have been taken into account. Given the extraordinary diversity of flora and fauna throughout the United States, it is hard to see how a single national biological evaluation could ever hope to be genuinely useful or true to Congress's mandate to protect species and habitats in their local environments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Evaluation's treatment of NFIP's potential beneficial effects on protected species and habitats was also questionable. As the Evaluation observed at several points, NFIP presents an opportunity to preserve or even enhance floodplain environments to the benefit of their plant and animal life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FEMA-BE-0027881 (CRS incentivizes \"good floodplain management practices that protect the habitat of ESA species\"); FEMA-BE-0027875 (rate of floodplain construction has \"if anything, decreased in recent years due to\" NFIP). This accords with FEMA's mandate to \"encourage adoption of more effective measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204022\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). FEMA should have taken potential benefits into account because the \"any possible effect\" test for triggering consultations includes beneficial effects.\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886234\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1006/#p1027\">\n    681 F.3d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As a closing observation, the Evaluation did not give appropriate attention to NFIP's effects on how floodplain development actually takes place. NFIP regulations address a wide array of development modalities, from structural elevation and drainage to the construction of levees. Yet the Evaluation dedicated no more than a footnote to these regulations, and presented no meaningful analysis of FEMA's discretion, through the floodplain management criteria, to minimize harm to ESA-listed species and habitats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Consequently, the \"no effect\" determination in the Evaluation was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).
