(ECF 23, \"MTD.\") Lontex's request to amend the FAC, to which Nike has objected, is also pending. In the Response in opposition to the Motion, Lontex\n   argues that the Court should permit Lontex to amend the FAC. (ECF 24, \"Resp.\" at 21-22.) At oral argument on the Motion, the Court raised the possibility of amending the FAC to remove allegations of counterfeiting in Counts I and III and add a separate claim for counterfeiting as Count VI. (ECF 32, 33.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following oral argument, the parties filed a Joint Submission in which Lontex agreed to the Court's proposal, Nike objected, and Lontex attached a proposed counterfeiting claim as Exhibit 1 (\"Proposed Claim\"). (ECF 34;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court reaches the following conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The Partial Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED, with prejudice; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Lontex's request to amend the FAC is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Taking Lontex's allegations as true, the factual background is as follows. Lontex, a Pennsylvania corporation, has been providing professional and collegiate sports teams with athletic apparel since 1989. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10.) By 2006, Lontex was well-regarded, including amongst the National Football League, collegiate sports teams, and sports medicine doctors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) As early as June 18, 2007, Lontex launched its COOL COMPRESSION line of clothing, including compression shirts, shorts, tights, and socks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 22, 2008, Lontex's \"COOL COMPRESSION\" trademark was registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") for a variety of men's, women's, and children's clothing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trademark consisted of \"standard characters without claim to any particular font, style, size, or color.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the same day, the USPTO registered Lontex's design mark, below, for the same category of clothing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The following year, on April 28, 2009, the USPTO registered Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION trademark for compression supports for medical use, including compression sleeves, tights, and leggings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the trademarks gave Lontex the exclusive right to use \"Compression\" apart from \"COOL COMPRESSION.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Lontex has since sold millions of dollars of COOL COMPRESSION apparel and compression supports across the United States, representing over 40,000 COOL COMPRESSION goods covered by the trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION line is popular throughout the country among customers, including professional sports teams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) COOL COMPRESSION goods have been promoted through a variety of distribution channels, including direct-to-consumer websites, doctor and medical referrals, sports organizations, and speaking engagements by Lontex staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nike is an Oregon corporation with its principal place of business in Beaverton, Oregon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) On or about January 2016, Lontex discovered that Nike had been selling apparel under the COOL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   COMPRESSION trademark since at least October 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nike has been using COOL COMPRESSION as its product mark next to its separate house mark \"NIKE PRO.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) For example, a sample Nike catalogue listed six COOL COMPRESSION clothing items, including \"728044 NIKE PRO COOL COMPRESSION SLEEVELESS TOP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nike's products have also been advertised, promoted, and sold using the COOL COMPRESSION product mark without \"NIKE PRO\" or any other Nike house mark near or next to it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nike's COOL COMPRESSION items were placed in Nike catalogues, including baseball, basketball, football, and training catalogues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) In addition to selling COOL COMPRESSION products direct-to-consumers, Nike has sold and distributed this allegedly infringing athletic apparel to its authorized distributors, resellers, and retailers, including REI, Target, Macy's Zappos, Dick's Sporting Goods, East Bay, Foot Locker, and Amazon (hereinafter, \"Prohibited Intermediaries\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) Nike has also monitored promotional advertising with respect to its use of COOL COMPRESSION. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Neither Nike nor these Prohibited Intermediaries have authorization or approval to sell COOL COMPRESSION products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 34.) Though Nike \"indicated\" that it would cease use of the COOL COMPRESSION mark after a \"demand letter identifying the infringement of the registered COOL COMPRESSION mark was sent,\" Nike's catalogues and sales through the Prohibited Intermediaries continued to make use of the COOL COMPRESSION mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 47.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nike has made over $ 40 million in estimated profits on its COOL COMPRESSION line of products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nike's use of the COOL COMPRESSION mark has created confusion amongst consumers by indicating that Nike is affiliated with Lontex and obtained access to Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lontex has received reports from its professional sports team clients that Nike's compression products are substantially inferior in performance to Lontex's products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The original Complaint was filed in this Court on December 31, 2018, setting forth four Counts: (1) direct trademark infringement under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) direct trademark infringement under \u00a7 1125(a) ; (3) contributory trademark infringement under \u00a7\u00a7 1114 and 1125(a) ; and (4) unfair competition under state statutory and common law (ECF 1). On February 19, 2019 Nike filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss Count I to the extent it asserted a claim for federal trademark counterfeiting and Count IV in its entirety (ECF 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The FAC was filed on March 12, 2019 (ECF 20), rendering Nike's Partial Motion to Dismiss moot (ECF 22). On March 26, 2019, Nike filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss Counts I and III of the FAC to the extent that they assert claims for trademark counterfeiting (ECF 23). Nike does not move to dismiss Lontex's claims for trademark infringement in Counts I or III. There is also no Motion to Dismiss Counts II, IV, or V.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lontex filed a Response in opposition on April 8, 2019 (ECF 24), and Nike filed a Reply on April 15, 2019 (ECF 25, \"Rep.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 30, 2019, following a Rule 16 pretrial conference on that date, the Court issued a scheduling order for discovery, dispositive motions, and additional pretrial and trial procedures (ECF 28, 29). On May 23, 2019, the Court held oral argument on the Partial Motion to Dismiss and discovery issues (ECF 32, 33). Following oral argument, and pursuant to the Court's orders, the parties submitted a Joint Submission regarding the Partial Motion to Dismiss (ECF 34). Attached to the submission was Lontex's Proposed Claim of counterfeiting, as well as exhibits depicting Lontex and Nike's compression products (ECF 34 Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nike contends that Counts I and III must be dismissed to the extent that Lontex\n   is claiming counterfeiting. (MTD at 2.) Nike argues that Lontex's conclusory allegations that Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION mark is \"identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from\" Nike's allegedly infringing COOL COMPRESSION mark is not sufficient to withstand dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Similarly, Nike contends that Lontex's allegations that Nike used the mark COOL COMPRESSION by itself as well as in direct proximity to \"NIKE PRO\" are conclusory. (Rep. at 8.) According to Nike, Lontex must allege that Nike placed the COOL COMPRESSION mark on products covered by Lontex's trademarks, and Lontex has failed to do so. (MTD at 4.) In other words, Nike argues that the counterfeiting allegations must be dismissed because Lontex has failed to allege that it would appear to consumers in the marketplace that Nike's COOL COMPRESSION athletic apparel was Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION apparel, as required to state a counterfeiting claim. (Rep. at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the Response, Lontex argues that the counterfeiting claims in Counts I and III should not be dismissed because counterfeiting is a finding in a trademark infringement claim that allows for enhanced remedies, not a separate claim subject to dismissal. (Resp. at 5, 8.) Alternatively, Lontex contends that Counts I and III state plausible counterfeiting claims because the COOL COMPRESSION mark does not need to appear on Nike's compression products, nor must Nike's products be identical to Lontex's products, to establish trademark counterfeiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43.) Count III-the contributory trademark infringement claim under \u00a7\u00a7 1114 and 1125(a) -alleges that Nike had knowledge of and encouraged distributors', resellers', and retailers' counterfeiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60, 65); (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Prayer for Relief \u00b6 10) (alleging that Nike used a willful counterfeit of Lontex's mark).) Neither Count in the FAC expressly alleges counterfeiting as a separate claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted above, Nike contends that Lontex's trademark counterfeiting \"claims\" in Counts I and III of the FAC must be dismissed because Lontex fails to plausibly allege that Nike's COOL COMPRESSION mark is a counterfeit of Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION mark. (MTD at 10- 11.) Nike does not distinguish between the allegations in Counts I and III. Nike further contends in the Joint Submission that Lontex should not be permitted to amend the FAC to remove the word \"counterfeiting\" from Counts I and III and add the Proposed Claim as Count VI because Lontex cannot allege any facts to sustain a plausible counterfeiting claim.

The FAC does not allege how Lontex's use of its mark appears to consumers. However, Lontex argues that the Lanham Act only requires that a word mark itself, not the product using the mark, be a counterfeit. (Resp. at 10-12.) According to Lontex, Nike's COOL COMPRESSION mark is a counterfeit of Lontex's mark because Nike used the mark in connection with sale of the same type of apparel covered by Lontex's trademark registrations.

Lontex argues that because its word mark registrations consist of \"standard characters without claim to any particular font, style, size, or color,\" they are \"are not limited to any particular presentation.\" (FAC Ex.

However, \"[t]o establish counterfeiting in the case of a word mark, it cannot be enough that one word used in the allegedly offending mark is the same, with no reference to...context.\"\n   <em>\n    GMA Accessories, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191919\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/765/457/#p471\">\n    765 F.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp. at 17) (citing\n   <em>\n    Astrazeneca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272429\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/744/\">\n    209 F.

In fact, Lontex alleges that it \"has received reports by its professional sports team clients that the [sic] Nike's compression products are substantially inferior in performance than Lontex's products.\" (FAC \u00b6 33.) The reasonable inference is that customers distinguished between Nike and Lontex's uses of the COOL COMPRESSION mark on compression products. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rep. at 9-10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Lontex has failed to allege that an observer seeing Nike's COOL COMPRESSION mark would believe it to be Lontex's mark.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sunny Merch.

Supp. 3d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Proposed Claim adds allegations that Nike intentionally co-opted Lontex's mark, leaving the consuming public to believe that Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION products were produced by Nike. For example, Lontex alleges that an employee of Dick's Sporting Goods directed a customer to Nike's compression products when the customer asked where to locate \"COOL COMPRESSION\" products. (Proposed Claim \u00b6 96.) However, Lontex does not cite, nor is this Court aware of, any precedential judicial decisions suggesting that an allegation that one individual associated a company's registered mark with another company establishes counterfeiting. Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether an \"\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   purchaser\" would view a mark to be \"identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from\" a registered mark \"as it appears on actual merchandise.\"\n   <em>\n    Colgate-Palmolive\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083838\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/486/286/#p289\">\n    486 F. Supp. 2d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This allegation does not undermine the allegation in the FAC that Lontex's customers were able to differentiate between Lontex and Nike's compression products. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Proposed Claim also alleges that Nike COOL COMPRESSION products appear to be \"stich-for-stitch\" copies of Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION products, particularly where the parties' compression garments in the same style and color are placed side-by-side. (Proposed Claim \u00b6 101;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083838\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/486/286/#p289\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. E.) This allegation does not affect the Court's analysis. At issue is whether Lontex has plausibly alleged that an average purchaser would view Nike's mark to be \"identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from\" Lontex's mark on the same products, not whether two compression garments in the same color and style appear similar. As Lontex concedes, \"because of the nature of compression garments, the products themselves appear visually homogenous[.]\" (Proposed Claim \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In support of Lontex's allegations that it is \"impossible\" for consumers to \"perceive differences\" between Lontex and Nike's COOL COMPRESSION products, Lontex attaches several Exhibits depicting Lontex and Nike's COOL COMPRESSION products and product descriptions. Exhibit A includes a brochure of Lontex's \"SWEAT IT OUT\" \"COOL COMPRESSION\" products as well as tags of Lontex's products bearing the \"COOL COMPRESSION\" mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A.) Lontex provides three examples of Nike COOL COMPRESSION product descriptions that do not include images of Nike house marks: (1) an excerpt from a French Nike catalogue dated July 1, 2015 through March 19, 2017, bearing the words \"Nike Pro\" on the left hand side, and providing pictures of the \"COOL COMPRESSION LONG SLEEVE TOP\" in several available colors; (2) an incomplete screenshot of Macy's online store featuring a Men's \"Cool Compression Shirt\" without a photograph of the product or product description; and (3) an invoice dated March 3, 2016 for a purchase by Lontex from Nike.com that includes a product description of \"COOL COMP[ ]SS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C.) These exhibits fail to support Lontex's allegations that\n   consumers viewing Nike and Lontex's merchandise would perceive Nike's COOL COMPRESSION products to be Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nike also includes photographs of Lontex and Nike's men's long-sleeved and sleeveless compression shirts in black, which bear the companies' respective logos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. E.) As noted above, these photographs do not affect the Court's analysis of whether Nike's alleged use of Lontex's word mark amounts to counterfeiting. To conclude otherwise would permit Lontex to plausibly claim that any men's compression shirt, or any other compression product covered by Lontex's trademark registrations, is a counterfeit of Lontex's products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, neither the additional allegations included in the Proposed Claim, nor the attached Exhibits, substantiate Lontex's claim that an average consumer in the marketplace would view Nike's COOL COMPRESSION products to be \"identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from\" Lontex's COOL COMPRESSION products. As the Proposed Claim fails to state a plausible counterfeiting claim, the Court concludes that leave to amend the FAC to include the Proposed Claim would be futile and grants the Partial Motion to Dismiss with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
