Doc. 27)\n   </strong>\n   filed by Defendant, WLAJ-TV. At the direction of the Court, Defendant clarified in a pocket brief (Rec. Doc. 30) that it believed that this matter could be disposed of via 12(b)(6), because cited to exhibits were referenced implicitly in the Complaint. Plaintiff filed an opposition (Rec. Doc. 32), to which Defendant replied (Rec. Doc. 34). Having considered the Motion and legal memoranda, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion should be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, DISH Network L.LC., is a major subscription-television provider in the United States, which delivers its services to its customers via satellite transmissions. In order to provide content to its subscribers, DISH contracts with local television stations. On August 31, 2012, DISH executed a re-transmission consent agreement (the \"Sinclair Agreement\") with the Sinclair Broadcast Group for re-transmission of content produced by 82 of Sinclair's TV stations. (Rec. Doc. 27-6). Among the stations was WLAJ-TV, a station assigned to the Lansing, Michigan market area. WLAJ is currently owned by Defendant, WLAJ-TV, LLC. (Rec. Doc. 15 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Sinclair Agreement was deemed to be effective on August 16, 2012. (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 1). Per its terms, DISH agreed to pay Sinclair a fee for each of the stations that it would rebroadcast. The fee was on a per subscriber basis and would depend on the affiliated network. Also, among the Sinclair Agreement's terms was a \"More Favorable Fee\" provision, which acted as a \"most favored nation\" (\"MFN\") clause. (Rec. Doc. 15 at 2). In section 22 of the Sinclair Agreement, Sinclair promised that if it granted a re-transmission fee more favorable to certain re-transmitter-competitors of DISH, by more than half a cent per subscriber than that paid by DISH,\n   Sinclair would offer DISH the benefit of the more favorable fee. The Sinclair Agreement was set to expire on August 15, 2015. However, section 23 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Audit Right.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   During the term and for one (1) year thereafter, each party will have the right, upon reasonable, prior notice, to conduct an audit of the other party's books and records that are reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the Re-transmission Fees paid by DISH and/or verify Operator's compliance with its obligations under Section 22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 14). Additionally, section 24 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Survival.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Any provision of this Agreement which logically would be expected to survive termination or expiration of the Agreement shall survive termination or expiration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 14). On November 13, 2012, Sinclair sent a notice to DISH indicating that Sinclair intended to sell WLAJ-TV to Defendant, with an assurance that Defendant would \"assume all of Sinclair's obligations under the Agreement as they relate to WLAJ-TV.\" (Rec. Doc. 39-4 at 2). The Sinclair Agreement states that subject to such notice, \"DISH hereby consents ... in the case of assignment or transfer of control of one or more, but less than all of the Stations then operated by [Sinclair], to the assignment of such portion of this Agreement as may then be applicable to such Station.\" In April of 2013, Defendant's parent company notified DISH that it had acquired substantially all of the assets to WLAJ and that Defendant had \"assumed certain Station contracts, including the [Sinclair] Agreement.\" (Rec. Doc. 39-5 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, Defendant claims that when it gave notice it was assuming the Sinclair Agreement, Sinclair had presented Defendant only with a redacted version of the Sinclair Agreement (the \"Redacted Sinclair Agreement\"), which lists a section 22 among its numbered items, but omits its content. (Rec. Doc. 27-4 at 13). While the substance of section 22 has been whited out, the Redacted Sinclair Agreement does not in any way obscure the audit right described in section 23. (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 12-13). Rather, the Redacted Sinclair Agreement clearly states that DISH may employ an audit to \"verify Operator's compliance with its obligations in section 22 hereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 29, 2015-after the expiration of the Sinclair Agreement, but during the 1-year grace period-DISH notified Defendant that it intended to conduct an audit to ensure compliance with the MFN clause. Defendant refused to comply with the audit. On December 7, 2015, DISH gave notice of breach of contract and on June 22, 2016, DISH filed suit against Defendant, alleging breach of the Sinclair Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 8, 2016, DISH and Defendant entered into a new re-transmission broadcast agreement (the \"WLAJ Agreement\") (Rec. Doc. 27-7). The agreement was made retroactively effective as of August 16, 2015. Notably, the WLAJ Agreement includes the following passage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Integration.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   This Agreement, together with any documents and exhibits specifically referred to in this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties to this Agreement.... Upon execution of this Agreement, all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties related to the Stations will be null and void. Each of the Parties specifically acknowledges that there are no unwritten side agreements or oral agreements between the Parties that alter, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Rec. Doc. 27-7 at 20). In April of 2018, Defendant filed its Motion. On July 26, 2018, this matter was transferred to the undersigned judge. The Court heard oral argument on the matter on October 24, 2018 and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues it is entitled to dismissal or summary judgment on three grounds: \"[1] The assigned re-transmission agreement on which DISH bases its case is now null and void; [2] The more favorable fee provisions of the null and void re-transmission agreement were never assigned to WLAJ anyway; and, [3] Even if the agreement were not null and void, and even if the 'more favorable' fee provision had been part of the assigned agreement, it would not be applicable here, where DISH seeks to apply it to WLAJ on a station-by-station basis in conflict with the averaging language of the Sinclair agreement.\" (Rec. Doc. 27-1 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff counters that the WLAJ agreement did not extinguish Plaintiff's right to enforce the Sinclair Agreement. (Rec. Doc 32-1 at 16-19). Plaintiff argues that the \"null and void\" language is nothing more than a merger provision, which seeks to make clear that there are no other oral or written agreements binding the Parties. In other words, the language is intended to require a court to enforce the parol evidence rule. Plaintiff argues that the words \"null and void\" at most\n   <em>\n    terminated\n   </em>\n   the Sinclair Agreement, but did not rescind it. The distinction being that plaintiffs can seek to enforce prior breaches of a terminated contract, but not a rescinded contract. Further, Plaintiff argues that the audit provision survived termination pursuant to the to the survival provision of the Sinclair Agreement. Thus, Plaintiff had a right to audit Defendant in order to determine whether Defendant had complied with the MFN provision prior to contract termination. To the extent that \"null and void\" is ambiguous, Plaintiff offers evidence that Parties had considered but ultimately did not agree to a \"clean slate\" provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant explicitly agreed to assume the Sinclair Agreement and did so without reservation. (Rec. Doc. 32-1 at 4). Plaintiff argues that Sinclair's alleged redaction of a provision had no effect on Defendant's assumption of the entire agreement, and that Defendant failed to do due diligence before assuming the Sinclair Agreement. Finally, Plaintiff argues that summary judgment is improper, because discovery might reveal facts that contradict Defendant's deposition evidence. (Rec. Doc. 32-1 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     THE PROPER LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant primarily frames its Motion as a request for dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). According to the Rules, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).

The Sinclair Agreement is incorporated by reference in the Complaint, so consideration of this evidence will not render this Court's decision a summary judgment. In attaching the Sinclair Agreement to its Motion, \"defendant merely assist[ed] the plaintiff in establishing the basis of the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

However, the WLAJ Agreement cannot be said to be referenced in the Complaint, because it was drafted only after the Complaint was filed. Nor does this Court believe the WLAJ Agreement to be \"central\" to Plaintiff's claim; Plaintiff could certainly prevail without this evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236663\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/496/#p498\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Court finds that by considering the WLAJ Agreement, the Court would necessarily convert Defendant's Motion to one for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court notes that \"conversion by the district judge should be exercised with great caution and attention to the parties' procedural rights,\" 5C C.

A termination differs from a rescission in that, \"[o]n 'termination' all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.\" UNIF. COMMERCIAL CODE \u00a7 2-106. Does that distinction matter here? Plaintiff argues it does. According to section 23 of the Sinclair Agreement, the right to audit survives one year past expiration of the term of the Sinclair Agreement. (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 14). The Sinclair Agreement not only expired, it was at the least terminated, but section 24 of the Sinclair Agreement states that, \"Any provision of this Agreement which logically would be expected to survive termination or expiration of the Agreement shall survive termination or expiration.\" (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 14). Thus, according to Plaintiff, \"DISH continues to have the right to seek remedies for breaches of the prior Agreement even as the parties agree their current and future conduct will be governed by the New Agreement.\" (Rec.

As the small sample of cases cited above demonstrates, both courts and parties acting pursuant to New York law have used \"null and void\" as a synonym for \"terminated,\" \"cancelled,\" \"extinguished,\" and \"rescinded.\" It is clear that where a provision is invoked rendering a contract \"null and void,\" the agreement is rendered ineffective. What is unclear is whether this ineffectiveness bars recovery for prior breaches of the contract; this more subtle question would appear to depend on the context in which the phrase occurs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indovision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=354%20N.Y.S.2d%20113\">\n    354 N.Y.S.2d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163438\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/803/109/#p124\">\n    803 F.

On the one hand, if the Parties intended the term \"null and void\" to have the effect of merely terminating the contract, then it is curious that the parties did not use the word \"terminate\" as they do elsewhere in the contract. (Rec. Doc. 27-7 at 3). On the other, it would be very strange for the Parties to waive substantive claims against each other for prior breaches of other agreements pursuant to three words tucked under a paragraph marked \"Integration\" in the back of the contract. (Rec. Doc. 27-7 at 20). Neither reading would render the words \"null and void\" superfluous; Parties have not pointed to any other language in the contract effecting a termination or a rescission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the\n   WLAJ Agreement specifically states that no inference is to be taken against the drafter. (Rec. Doc. 27-7 at 19). As the court in\n   <em>\n    Indovision\n   </em>\n   held, given the context of the entire WLAJ Agreement, this Court finds that reasonable minds could differ whether the Parties intended the \"null and void\" language to waive any and all claims available to the Parties for breach of prior agreements or to merely terminate the executory obligations of agreements superseded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because the contract ambiguous, consideration of parol evidence is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    JA Apparel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655278\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/390/#p396\">\n    568 F.3d at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff filed suit for Defendant's failure to comply with the audit provision in the Sinclair Agreement before the Parties entered into the WLAJ Agreement on July 8, 2016. Plaintiff has attached as evidence an e-mail chain indicating the Parties were considering waiving all claims against one another by use of a \"clean slate\" provision, but ultimately decided against a \"clean slate\" on the same day the WLAJ Agreement was ratified. (Rec. Doc. 32-7). Defendant counters that the clean slate provision was necessary to waive non-contractual claims. Thus, Defendant argues, the parol evidence does not indicate \"null and void\" was not intended to waive DISH's breach of contract claims. (Rec. Doc. 34-2 at 4). To what extent this evidence, and whatever else is garnered during discovery, says about the intent of the Parties in using the phrase \"null and void\" is for the trier of fact to decide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Wilson v.

Defendant admits that it notified DISH in writing that it would be assuming the Sinclair agreement. However, Defendant alleges the version of the Sinclair Agreement that Defendant received from Sinclair had section 22-the MFN clause-redacted. Thus, Defendant did not assume this part of the Sinclair Agreement, because there was no \"meeting of the minds\" regarding this particular contractual provision. (Rec. Doc. 27-1 at 9-10). Defendant provides no case law beyond that establishing this basic principle of contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff counters that it agreed to allow Sinclair to assign the Sinclair Agreement to Defendant only in its entirety and that when Defendant gave notice to Plaintiff it was assuming the Sinclair Agreement, it did so without reservation. Moreover, Plaintiff argues that Plaintiff had notice of the MFN provision by virtue of the unredacted audit provision, which explicitly states the audit right is designed so that DISH may check for compliance with section 22. According to Plaintiff, Defendant had a duty to investigate the Sinclair Agreement before it agreed to assume it. (Rec. Doc. 32-1 at 20) (citing\n   <em>\n    Sitar v. Sitar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919601\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/739/#p742\">\n    61 A.D. 3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919601\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/739/#p742\">\n    878 N.Y.S.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.Y. App. Div. 2009) ) (granting summary\n   judgment on plaintiff's fraud claims, because plaintiff failed \"exercise ordinary diligence\" in reviewing the books of an entity plaintiff purchased).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant failed to satisfy its duty to investigate the contract that it agreed to assume. When this Court asked defense counsel at oral argument why Defendant didn't inquire into what obligations it was agreeing to assume under section 22, defense counsel's only response was that the purchase of a television station is a complicated business, requiring review of many contracts. That may be so, but that is no reason for this Court to strike provisions of an agreement that the Defendant agreed to assume without exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that dismissal or summary judgment is appropriate because the \" 'more favorable fee' applied only on an aggregate basis to all 82 stations listed in Exhibit A of Sinclair's re-transmission agreement. (Rec. Doc. 27-1 at 11). In other words, regardless of this Court's finding that Defendant agreed to assume the entire Sinclair Agreement, Defendant argues that the MFN provision simply cannot be applied as written now that WLAJ has been sold to a single-station operator. Defendant quotes language from the Sinclair Agreement, which purportedly suggests that the original signatories only contemplated applying the MFN provision where an operator, such as Sinclair, owns many stations in contract with DISH:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   For clarity ... [Sinclair] and DISH expressly acknowledge and agree that \"Net Fee\" means the net effective per subscriber rate ... based on all ... economic outlays ... payable to Operator by DISH ... on an aggregate (rather than on a station-by-station) basis for all Stations carried by DISH or the MFN Other Distributor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Rec. Doc. 27-6 at 13). Thus, Defendant argues Plaintiff has no basis for auditing a single station, because compliance with the MFN clause can only be adjudged when an aggregate re-transmission fee is calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the use of the word \"aggregate\" does not preclude application of the MFN provision to a single-station operator, such as WLAJ. Rather, in the case of a single-station operator, the aggregate fee is calculated in the same way it would be if the provision were to be applied to Sinclair. Here, it so happens that the re-transmission fees collected by WLAJ are the only re-transmission fees collected by Defendant, so the \"aggregate re-transmission fee\" or \"net fee\" is equal to that of WLAJ's re-transmission fees standing alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that use of the word \"aggregate\" does not preclude application of the MFN provision to a single-station operator, such as Defendant. An \"aggregate\" is simply a \"sum total.\" MERIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (10th ed. 1999). Whether the sum total is the fee of one station, or two stations, or eighty-two stations, that number is calculable within the contemplation of the Sinclair Agreement. The MFN formula is easily applied in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant's contention is not really that the formula cannot be applied mathematically. Rather, it is that applying the MFN provision as written creates an absurd result. Defendant provides a hypothetical. If one of Sinclair's station, such as WLAJ, had negotiated fees more favorable to DISH's competitors, that would not necessarily render Sinclair, as the operator of 82 stations, in breach of the Sinclair Agreement, because the fees charged by WLAJ would be averaged with the fees charged\n   by the other 81 stations. It is presumed that some of Sinclair's stations charge fees more favorable to rival re-transmitters and others charge fees that are less favorable. Sinclair's only concern as a multi-station operator is to ensure that on average, its stations are not violating the MFN provision. However, by removing a station from multi-station-operator Sinclair, to a single-station operator, such as Defendant, the inputs of the formula change significantly. The single-station operator of a station charging more favorable fees to other re-transmitters is now in breach of the MFN provision, not because its fees have changed, but because the \"net fee\" has changed now that the other station's fees are not included in the aggregate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court does not think this result is absurd. DISH contracted with the operator of WLAJ in a manner that ensured it would never receive a worse deal than its re-transmitter competitors. The sale of WLAJ to Defendant does not deprive DISH of that benefit it contracted for. Quite to the contrary, as the Court found above, Defendant agreed to assume the contract in its entirety. It would have been foreseeable to a party that performed its due diligence that purchase of WLAJ by a single-station-operator could create a breach of the Sinclair Agreement. The MFN formula is not a difficult one to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With the benefit of adequate inquiry into the terms of the Sinclair Agreement, Defendant could have availed itself to several options before it purchased WLAJ. Defendant could have negotiated a better price from Sinclair for the station to compensate for the anticipated breach or refused to adopt the entirety of the Sinclair agreement. Defendant failed to ask what it was agreeing to undertake pursuant to section 22, and now must bear the consequences of that lapse-assuming that the trier of fact finds that the Parties did not agree to rescind the Sinclair Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    (Rec.
