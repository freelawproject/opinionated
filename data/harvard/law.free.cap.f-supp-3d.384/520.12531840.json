Scanlan has worked as a pilot for AAI since October 1999 and participated in the AAG's Global Profit Sharing Plan (the \"Plan\") in 2016 and 2017. He has also served in the armed forces since 1985 and is currently a Major General in the United States Air Force Reserve. Throughout his employment with AAI and while he has participated in the\n   Plan, Scanlan has taken short-term periods of leave to perform his Air Force Reserve obligations. While he was on military leave for a total of 128 days in 2016 and for 132 days in 2017, most of the periods of leave were for only a few days at a time although some extended up to fourteen days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   AAI does not pay employees who are out on short-term military leave but does pay employees when they take other forms of short-term leave, such as jury duty, sick leave, and union leave. If employees are on jury duty, they receive the differential between their regular compensation and their payment as jurors. They obtain their full pay when on short-term sick leave or union leave. Union leave may be short-term but up to three pilots will be paid while serving full time on union business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AAG is the parent company not only of AAI, but also of Envoy Airlines, Inc., Piedmont Airlines, Inc, and PSA Airlines. AAG adopted the Plan effective January 1, 2016 to share AAG's profits with employees of AAI and other subsidiary airlines. Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan include pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and passenger service employees as well as non-union-represented management and non-management employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   AAG is obligated under the Plan to pay profit sharing awards annually in the early part of each year to the Plan's participants that total five percent of AAG's pre-tax earnings for the preceding year. Participants receive their award as a lump sum cash payment subject to any withholding for tax purposes and may contribute all or part of the award to their retirement plans, pursuant to the terms of those plans. AAG calculates each participant's individual award by dividing the five percent of AAG's pre-tax earnings by the aggregate amount of all participants' earnings and multiplying this value by that participant's \"eligible earnings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   AAG does not credit AAI employees under the Plan with wages they would have otherwise earned had they not been on short-term military leave. However, it does include the compensation of employees for the periods when they are on jury duty, sick leave, and union leave. As a result of AAG's failure to include as eligible earnings their imputed income while on periods of short-term military leave, Scanlan and other similarly situated employees received lower profit sharing awards in 2016 and 2017 than they would have otherwise received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   USERRA is the latest in a series of laws, such as the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (\"VEVRAA\"), and its amendment the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act of 1974 (\"VRRA\"), that Congress has enacted to protect the rights of military service members who take leaves of absence from their employers to perform military service.\n   <em>\n    Crews v.

Scanlan alleges that AAI's policy of not paying employees out on short-term military leave while paying employees for comparable forms of short-term leave, such as for jury duty, sick leave, and union leave, violates \u00a7 4316(b)(1) of USERRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This section of USERRA provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b)(1) ... a person who is absent from a position of employment by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (A) deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence while performing such service; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (B) entitled to such other\n   <em>\n    rights and benefits\n   </em>\n   not determined by seniority as are generally provided by the employer of the person to employees having similar seniority, status, and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence under a contract, agreement, policy, practice, or plan in effect at the commencement of such service or established while such person performs such service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204316\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 4303 defines \"rights and benefits\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) ... \"rights and benefits\" means terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (including wages or salary for work performed) that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan, a health plan, an employee stock ownership plan, insurance coverage and awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacations, and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   AAI, at the pleading stage, does not contest Scanlan's allegations that it pays its employees on jury duty, sick leave, and union leave, and does not pay those on short-term military leave. Nor does AAI at this time challenge Scanlan's assertion in the amended complaint that short-term military leave is comparable to absence from work for jury duty, sick leave or union leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brill v. AK Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:09-CV-534,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20893902\">\n    2012 WL 893902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-7 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 14, 2012). AAI simply argues that USERRA does not require employers to pay its employees wages for periods when they are on military leave. Ordinary wages for work not performed while on military leave, AAI contends, are not \"rights and benefits\" under \u00a7 4316(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In opposition to AAI's motion to dismiss, Scanlan relies heavily on the decision of our Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Waltermyer v.

Defendants rely on a Department of Labor regulation which states in part, \"although USERRA does not require an employer to pay an employee for time away from work performing service, an employer policy, plan, or practice that provides such a benefit is permissible under USERRA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.7\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' citation of this regulation does not present the complete picture. Scanlan calls our attention to another Department of Labor regulation under USERRA which mirrors what he alleges here and requires payment to those on short-term military duty when paid non-military leave is granted in comparable situations. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (b) If the non-seniority benefits to which employees on furlough or leave of absence are entitled vary according to the type of leave, the employee must be given the most favorable treatment accorded to any comparable form of leave when he or she performs service in the uniformed services. In order to determine whether any two types of leave are comparable, the duration of the leave may be the most significant factor to compare. For instance, a two-day funeral leave will not be \"comparable\" to an\n   <em>\n    extended leave\n   </em>\n   for service in the uniformed service. In addition to comparing the duration of the absences, other factors such as the purpose of the leave and the ability of the employee to choose when to take the leave should be considered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.150\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   AAI also focuses on the specific words of \u00a7 4316(b)(1) to support its argument that Scanlan has not stated a claim for relief under USERRA. Specifically, it maintains that the phrase \"rights and benefits\" as defined in \u00a7 4303 and used in \u00a7 4316(b)(1) does not encompass the relief Scanlan seeks. According to AAI, \"rights and benefits\" to which an employee in uniformed service is entitled while on leave does not include wages for work not performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We turn to the words used by Congress in USERRA. The definition of \"rights and benefits\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) is extremely broad. It means \"the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (including wages or salary for work performed) ... and includes ... bonuses,\n   <em>\n    severance pay\n   </em>\n   , supplemental unemployment benefits, [and]\n   <em>\n    vacations\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204303\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (emphasis added). Section 4303(2) was amended in 2010 to change the parenthetical from \"other than wages or salary for work performed\" to the more inclusive language stated above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gross v. PPG Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103931\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/884/\">\n    636 F.3d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 n.3 (7th Cir. 2011). The definition of rights and benefits, of course, embraces not only wages or salary for work performed but much more. Because the definition uses the words \"including\" and \"includes,\" the words following \"including\" and \"includes\" are simply illustrative of the expansive language \"the terms, conditions or privileges of employment\" which precedes the illustrations. The examples mentioned are not exclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Land Bank of St. Paul v.

If compensation for holidays in\n   <em>\n    Waltermyer\n   </em>\n   and for severance pay and vacations explicitly referenced in \u00a7 4316(b)(1) are merely illustrations of the definition of rights and benefits and involve pay for work not performed, we are hard pressed to understand why compensation for time on military leave for work not performed would not also fit within the definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 4316(b)(1), of course, only requires employees on military leave to be provided with comparable rights and benefits to which those on non-military absences are entitled. If a right and benefit is not provided to an employee on a non-military related absence, the right or benefit is not due the employee on military leave. As noted above, AAI concedes for present purposes that short-term military leave is comparable to leave for jury duty, sickness or union responsibilities. While compensation for time on military leave is not required when it would be preferential treatment, \u00a7 4316(b)(1) mandates payment when failure to pay such compensation constitutes unequal treatment for those on reserve duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   AAI points to the use of the word \"accrues\" in the definition of rights and benefits under \u00a7 4303 to negate Scanlon's claim. It argues that rights and benefits does not include wages paid to an employee on military leave because such wages are not a term, condition, or privilege of employment in the language of \u00a7 4303 that \"accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employee policy plan or practice.\" Instead, AAI contends that wages, including wages for work not performed, do not accrue but are earned. AAI, in support, cites the second definition of \"accrue\" in\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed. 2019): \"To accumulate periodically, to increase over a period of time.\" AAI overlooks, however, the first definition in\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   : \"To come into existence as an enforceable claim or right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1662731\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/804/821/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The right to be paid for work not performed while on military leave comes into existence and thus accrues as an enforceable claim in the exact same way as the right to holiday pay, severance pay, or vacation pay, all for time periods when no work is performed. AAI's argument based on the definition of \"accrues\" fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   AAI further maintains that \u00a7 4316(b)(1) applies in favor of an employee on short-term military leave only when other employees have \"a leave of absence under a contract, agreement, policy, practice or plan.\" AAI contends that Scanlan has no claim here because the pilots' collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") does not consider jury duty, sick leave, and union leave to be \"leaves of absence.\" This argument, too, is without merit. First, \u00a7 4316(b)(1) defines a person to be on a leave of absence who is \"absent from a position of employment by reason of service in the uniformed services.\" Thus, \"leave of absence\" is not a technical term under USERRA but simply means an absence from work. Moreover, an employer's or a union's different definition of leave of absence in a CBA or otherwise cannot undermine the requirements of USERRA. As the Supreme Court has explained in\n   <em>\n    Accardi v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.\n   </em>\n   regarding a statute granting employment benefits to service members, \"employers and unions are [not] empowered by the use of transparent labels and definitions to deprive a veteran of substantial rights guaranteed by the Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169050\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/225/#p229\">\n    383 U.S. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169050\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/225/#p229\">\n    86 S.Ct. 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169050\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/225/#p229\">\n    15 L.Ed.2d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, AAI contends that a ruling in favor of plaintiff would have negative or unintended consequences. It raises the specter, for example, that employers would no longer pay employees for jury service or sick leave in order to avoid paying reservists on military duty while away from work. While we doubt this would occur, we must read the unambiguous text of USERRA as written by Congress without engaging in speculation about any collateral consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We return to the purposes of USERRA \"to encourage noncareer service in the uniform services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and\n   employment which can result from such service\" and \"to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204301\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The words of USERRA must be construed liberally in favor of those in the uniformed services.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146416\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/78/#p81\">\n    388 F.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress, we agree, did not impose a requirement in USERRA that employers in all instances provide differential pay to employees while on military leave. Nonetheless, \u00a7 4316(b)(1) clearly mandates that employees on military leave be treated equally with other employees with respect to their terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. As our Court of Appeals stated in\n   <em>\n    Waltermyer\n   </em>\n   in connection with USERRA's predecessor, \"the statute establishes equality as the test.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1662731\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/804/821/\">\n    804 F.2d at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is likewise true here. Equal treatment exists only if those employees on short-term military leave have the same rights and benefits as other employees in comparable situations. Scanlan has plausibly alleged that he and those similarly situated have not been afforded equal treatment with other employees in comparable situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20893902\">\n    2012 WL 893902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We see no material difference between the allegations here and those in\n   <em>\n    Waltermyer\n   </em>\n   . Count III of the amended complaint states a viable claim for relief under \u00a7 4316(b)(1) of USERRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Scanlan alleges in count I of the amended complaint that AAG violated \u00a7 4316(b)(1) of USERRA by not crediting participants who took short-term military leave with imputed earnings for those periods when calculating their profit sharing awards, while crediting participants with their full earnings while on jury duty, sick leave, and union leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, he asserts that participants who took short-term military leave had lower \"eligible earnings,\" and received lower profit sharing awards, than provided to employees who take comparable forms of leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Our analysis with respect to count III likewise applies with respect to count I. Scanlan has plausibly alleged a claim under \u00a7 4316(b)(1) that AAG has not provided equal rights and benefits under its profit sharing Plan to employees on short-term military leave. Scanlan's claim under count I survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, AAG moves to dismiss count II which alleges that AAG's calculation of profit sharing awards under its Plan violates \u00a7 4318(b)(1) of USERRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Pursuant to the Plan, as noted above, AAG sets aside five percent of its pre-tax earnings each plan year for participating employees. Employees receive their awards as a lump sum payment in the beginning of the following year, and may elect to deposit all or part of their award in their retirement plans if the plan so permits. AAG calculates each employee's award by dividing this total by the aggregate amount of all participating employee's earnings and multiplying that value by that employee's eligible earnings that year. AAG does not credit military leave in an employee's eligible earnings but does so for jury duty, sick leave, and union leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 4318 of USERRA governs the right of employees to benefits under \"employee benefit pension plans, (including those described in sections 3(2) and 3(33)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974),\" (\"ERISA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204318\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).

Instead, the Court reasoned that this plan was a bonus plan that did not systemically defer income toward retirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Our Court of Appeals relied on the\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   analysis to determine whether agreements that allowed plaintiff to purchase certain shares of stock of his employer were \"incentive bonuses\" or deferred compensation agreements covered by ERISA.\n   <em>\n    Oatway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344406\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/184/#p187\">\n    325 F.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that an ERISA plan is only a plan 'designed for the purpose of paying retirement income whether as a result of [its] express terms or surrounding circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344406\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/184/#p187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 188 (citing\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470049\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/570/\">\n    611 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   575-76 ). The Court agreed with the district court's characterization of the plan as \"an incentive plan designed to provide a financial incentive for employees to remain\" with the employer. Post-retirement income was only incidental to the goal of providing current compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189. The Court also observed that the stock options were discretionary, given in recognition of special service, and awarded in addition to regular compensation. Moreover, they did not result in the deferral of income even though they could be exercised after plaintiff retired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because of these characteristics, the Court concluded that the stock options were not ERISA plans and affirmed the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To sustain count II, plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Tolbert v.

There, plaintiffs participated in a wealth accumulation plan where funds were funneled into either \"Voluntary Deferred Compensation,\" \"Mandatory Deferred Compensation\" or \"Company Contribution\" categories.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157874\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/619/\">\n    758 F.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the Fifth Circuit emphasized that the plan in issue described itself as a deferred compensation plan allowing employees \"to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation to be earned with respect to the upcoming Plan Year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157874\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/619/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157874\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/619/\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties did not argue, nor did the record indicate, that the plan was a bonus program under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We find this case to be inapposite. In any event, we are bound by our Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Oatway\n   </em>\n   , which adopted the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Plan presently before the court is designed to provide current rather than retirement income. It is analogous to those\n   plans in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Oatway\n   </em>\n   . The Purpose section of the Plan itself states that it \"rewards eligible Employees ... for their efforts in helping achieve the strategic, financial, and operating objectives of ... AAG for a designated Plan Year by providing such eligible Employees with an opportunity to share in AAG's profits for such year.\" Under the Plan, AAG pays participating employees their share of the total profit sharing award for the previous year in the form of a lump-sum cash payment within the first few months of the following year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While the employees participating in the Plan may place the lump sum payments in their retirement plans, the Plan in essence is an extra compensation or bonus plan where payments are awarded in addition to regular compensation. It is not a deferred compensation plan. The Plan specifically states that it is intended to be exempt from regulation under ERISA as a \"bonus program\" as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and \"payroll practice\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) which governs employee welfare benefit plans. Of course, this language does not guarantee the Plan is in fact exempt from ERISA, but\n   <em>\n    Oatway\n   </em>\n   directs us to consider it because it reflects employer intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oatway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344406\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/184/#p187\">\n    325 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   186 ;\n   <em>\n    Tolbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157874\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/619/\">\n    758 F.3d at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a bonus plan, the Plan could meet ERISA's definition if it systematically deferred payments to the termination of employment or so as to provide retirement income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"470049\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/611/570/\">\n    611 F.2d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plan does not do so. The mere option to deposit the lump sum payments into employees' retirement funds does not bring the Plan within the embrace of ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Scanlan further argues that even if it is not an employee benefit pension plan under ERISA, it is still covered by USERRA. According to USERRA regulations published by the Department of Labor, \"USERRA also covers certain pension plans not covered by ERISA, such as those sponsored by a State, government entity, or church for its employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.260\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). We reject Scanlan's contention that this regulation applies to the Plan at issue. The Plan certainly is not \"sponsored by a State, government entity, or church\" and is not otherwise similar to any such plan. Moreover, we read this regulation as more likely clarifying that USERRA incorporates ERISA's general definition of employee benefit pension plan but does not contain the same express exclusions listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), such as plans administered by the government and churches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Plan is neither an employee benefit pension plan under ERISA nor a plan exempted from ERISA but covered by USERRA. Scanlan has not stated a claim for relief in count II under \u00a7 4318(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   AND NOW, this 18th day of June, 2019, for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (1) the motion of defendant American Airlines Group, Inc. to dismiss count I of the amended complaint is DENIED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (2) the motion of defendant American Airlines Group, Inc. to dismiss count II of the amended complaint is GRANTED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (3) the motion of defendant American Airlines, Inc. to dismiss count III of the amended complaint is DENIED; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (4) the defendants shall file and serve an answer to counts I and III of the amended complaint on or before July 2, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Plaintiff maintains that AAG as well as AAI is an employer under USERRA because \u00a7 4303(4) states that \"employer means any person ... or entity that pays salary or wages for work performed or that has control over employment opportunities.\" AAG has not challenged its status as an employer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
