(Second Superseding Indictment (\"Indictment\") (Dkt. 430) \u00b6\u00b6 1-49.) These organizations included Nxivm, which purported to offer self-help courses, and \"DOS,\" a secret society that purported to be a women's empowerment group. (Compl. (Dkt. 1) \u00b6 17; Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 42.) The Indictment charges him with racketeering (or \"RICO\") conspiracy, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (\"Count One\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-26); and with racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) (\"Count Two\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-40).

The court DENIES Raniere's motions for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Government's Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Nxivm and DOS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government alleges in its complaint that, in or about 1998, Raniere founded Executive Success Programs, Inc. (\"ESP\"), a series of workshops designed (according to its promotional literature) to \"actualize human potential.\" (Compl. \u00b6 3.) In or about 2003, Raniere founded an organization called Nxivm, which served as an umbrella organization for ESP and other affiliated entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nxivm promoted itself as a \"professional business providing educational tools, coaching and trainings to corporations and people from all walks of life,\" and described its philosophy as \"a new ethical understanding\" that allows \"humanity to rise to its noble possibility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nxivm was headquartered in Albany, New York, and recruited members from around the world, including from the Eastern District of New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) It offered classes in various cities within the\n   United States and abroad, which cost up to $ 5,000 for a five-day workshop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Nxivm encouraged its participants to continue attending classes and to recruit others into Nxivm in order to be promoted within the organization and thereby reach certain \"goal levels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Nxivm curriculum allegedly taught, among other things, that women had inherent weaknesses including \"overemotional\" natures,\" an inability to keep promises, and embracing the role of victim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, Raniere created a secret society called \"DOS,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is structured like a pyramid with levels of \"slaves\" headed by \"masters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13.) DOS slaves were expected to recruit slaves of their own, who in turn would owe service to their own masters and to masters above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) All DOS participants were women except for Raniere, whose status as the highest DOS master was allegedly concealed from newly recruited slaves, other than those directly under Raniere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DOS masters recruited slaves mostly from Nxivm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Masters targeted dissatisfied women by telling them that DOS would change their lives and that, to join DOS, they would need to provide \"collateral\" to ensure they would not leave the group or tell others about it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.) Collateral included sexually explicit photographs and videos; rights to financial assets; videos made to look to look candid in which the prospective slaves told damning stories (true or untrue) about themselves, friends, or family members; and letters making damaging accusations (true or untrue) about friends and family members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After joining DOS, slaves were required to provide additional collateral every month; all DOS slaves were ultimately made to provide more collateral than had initially been described to them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Slaves were also obligated to perform \"acts of care\" for and pay \"tribute\" to their masters by bringing them coffee, buying them groceries, making them lunch, carrying their luggage, cleaning their houses, and retrieving lost items for them, among other things.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Allegedly, DOS members understood that the slaves' acts of care should amount to the master having the work of at least one full-time employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Beyond acts of care, slaves were regularly given assignments by their masters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Some masters allegedly gave their slaves assignments that either directly or implicitly required them to have sex with Raniere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Other assignments required slaves to adhere to extremely low-calorie diets and to document the food they ate, which was meant to accommodate Raniere's sexual preference for thin women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Other women were assigned to periods of celibacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Slaves who were assigned to have sex with Raniere believed that not doing so would risk release of their collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Allegedly, DOS masters profited from directing slaves to have sex with Raniere by receiving the acts of care that came with continued status and participation in DOS, and by receiving increased status and financial opportunities within Nxivm more broadly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6 4.) Additionally, Raniere promised career opportunities to the slaves who had sex with him and with whom he wanted to have sex. (Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Government's complaint further alleges in detail that Raniere and co-conspirators engaged in sex trafficking and a forced-labor conspiracy with respect to Jane Doe 1 between February 2016 and May 2017 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-51), and sex trafficking with respect to Jane Doe 2 between November 2016 and May 2017\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Alleged Enterprise\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to the Indictment, in leading Nxivm, DOS, and other affiliated pyramid-structured entities (the \"Pyramid Organizations\"), Raniere relied on an inner circle of individuals who carried out his directives and held high positions in the Pyramid Organizations. (Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) This inner circle (the \"Enterprise\") was allegedly a criminal enterprise, as defined in the RICO statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Enterprise operated within the Eastern and Northern Districts of New York and elsewhere, including overseas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Its alleged purpose was to obtain financial and personal benefits for its members, including increased power and status within the Enterprise, by promoting Raniere and recruiting others into the Pyramid Organizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Its members accomplished this by, among other things, \"[p]romoting, enhancing and protecting the Enterprise by committing, attempting and conspiring to commit crimes, including but not limited to visa fraud, identity theft, extortion, forced labor, sex trafficking, money laundering, wire fraud, tax evasion, and obstruction of justice\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(a)); \"[d]emanding absolute commitment to Raniere,\" including by \"exalting\" his teachings and ideology and not tolerating dissent (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(b)); \"[i]nducing shame and guilt\" to influence members and associates of the Enterprise (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(c)); \"[o]btaining sensitive information about members and associates of the Enterprise\" to control them (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(d)); \"[r]ecruiting and grooming sexual partners for Raniere\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(e)); \"[i]solating associates and others from friends and family and making them dependent on the Enterprise for their financial well-being and legal status in the United States\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(f)); \"[p]rotecting and attempting to protect Raniere and the Enterprise by ... gaining political influence and evading regulatory agencies\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(g)); \"[u]sing harassment, coercion and abusive litigation to intimidate and attack perceived enemies and critics of Raniere\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(h)); and \"[e]ncouraging associates and others to take expensive Nxivm courses, and incur debt to do so, as a means of exerting control over them and to obtain financial benefits for the members of the Enterprise\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6(i)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

When the Indictment was filed on March 13, 2019, Raniere, Bronfman, Mack, Russell, and Lauren Salzman were joined in a single count charging a racketeering conspiracy in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), predicated on acts indictable under thirteen criminal statutes (twelve of them federal), spanning from approximately 2003 to March 2018 (\"Count\n   One\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.) Count One does not specify who agreed to commit which acts, or when each act, was committed, but does state that each Defendant agreed that a conspirator would commit at least two predicate acts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Raniere, Bronfman, Mack, and Lauren Salzman were also charged with racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) (\"Count Two\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-40). This count is predicated on fourteen acts spanning from roughly to 2003 and March 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) There appears to be substantial overlap between the predicate acts alleged in Counts One and Two. Below is a chart depicting Bronfman, Raniere, Mack, and Lauren Salzman's alleged participation in the fourteen predicate acts of racketeering (some of which the Indictment divides into sub-acts). As illustrated below, Bronfman is not alleged to have committed any predicate acts with Mack and Lauren Salzman (the \"DOS Defendants\"):\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-29\">DOS Defendants RICO Acts Description Bronfman Ramere Mack L.

(Bronfman Second Mem. at 2, 7.) Raniere maintains that Count One violates this rule in three ways.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , it lists categories of predicate acts, not specific acts that violate specific statutory provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , some of the predicate-act categories depend on underlying offenses, which Count One does not specify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Count One does not plead\n   <em>\n    each element\n   </em>\n   of the predicate acts or the elements of their underlying offenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) For example, Count One alleges violations of \"Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028 (identification document fraud and identification document fraud conspiracy, and identity theft and identity theft conspiracy).\" (Indictment \u00b6 15(a).) That statute lists at least eight different crimes, none of which are specified in the Indictment. (Bronfman Second Mem. at 3 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201028\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(8), (f).) Further, two of the crimes listed in the statute depend on another underlying offense.

The Government is correct that, \"to satisfy Rule 7(c) as to a RICO conspiracy charge,\" \"it is not required to identify specific predicate acts\" nor \"prove at trial that any of the racketeering acts were committed\"-let alone specify underlying offenses that are elements of predicate acts or those underlying offenses' elements.

In sum, considering \"the record as a whole\" and not just the Indictment,\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   , 194 F.3d at 45, Raniere appears to know the specific facts that are most \"importan[t] to the fairness of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Stringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702802\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/120/#p124\">\n    730 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   126 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    b.

(Raniere Second Mem. at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mack First Mem. at 6-11; L. Salzman First Mem. at 17-19; L. Salzman Second Mem. at 4-5.) According to Raniere, charges involving threats, like \u00a7 1589(a), must identify specific victims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sira v.

Further, he states, Count Six is deficient because it merely recites three of the four means of illegally compelling forced labor that \u00a7 1589(a) lists, without specifying which means were used by Defendants.

(Mack First Mem. at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Essentially, Raniere complains of a lack of notice as to the accusations against him. If the Indictment were the only notice that he had received as to Count Two, he might have a good argument. But, as the Government notes (Gov't First Mem. at 49), the complaint and the Raniere detention letter contain significant detail as to the forced-labor charges, including reference to particular victims, statements by witnesses, and specific electronic communications. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-21, 25-29, 36-39, 42-51; Raniere Detention Letter at 1-3.) Additionally, the Government represents that it has provided ample discovery relating to Count Six, such as the names of victims and conspirators. (Gov't First Mem. at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Raniere does not dispute that he has received this information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mack Reply (Dkt. 254) at 3.) Nor does he claim to be unaware of the names of the \"lower-ranking DOS members\" that Count Six references or of the Government's theory of the forced-labor conspiracy. Indeed, despite complaining of a lack of notice, he simultaneously argues that-based on the forced labor and the threats alleged in the complaint-Count Two fails to state a forced-labor offense, suggesting that he\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   in fact have notice of the Government's theory.

Considering \"the record as a whole\" and not just the Indictment,\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   , 194 F.3d at 45, Raniere appears to know the specific facts that are most \"importan[t] to the fairness\n   of the proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Stringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702802\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/120/#p124\">\n    730 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   126 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702802\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/120/#p124\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702802\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/120/#p124\">\n    at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an indictment need not include the name of an identity-theft victim, so long as the Government provides the name at the defendant's request);\n   <em>\n    Stavroulakis\n   </em>\n   , 952 F.2d at 693 (\"When an indictment delineates the elements of a charged offense, however concisely, the underlying concerns of proper pleading-notice of the charge to be met and protection against double jeopardy-may be further promoted by a bill of particulars or pre-trial discovery.\" (citation omitted)).

The \"labor and services\" referred to in the Indictment were, Raniere argues, \" 'acts of care' and 'tribute' largely in the form of various personal favors and errands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) He claims that these acts fall outside the \"paradigmatic forced labor\" situation because they do not constitute activities that were \"onerous, required, and taxing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Mack Reply at 4.)

(Raniere Second Mem. at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   L. Salzman First Mem. at 10-17, 19-22; L.

Lack of Specificity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Raniere argues that Act Ten is subject to a heightened pleading standard because, under New York State law, counts charging extortion-related offenses must describe the alleged threats in detail. (L. Salzman First Mem. at 12.) Specifically, he contends that the Indictment must allege a nexus between a threat and the taking of property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Act Ten does not do this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33.) It does not provide the specific identities of the alleged victims, the location within the Eastern District of New York where these extortionate acts occurred, the dates and times of the offenses, the nature of the threats allegedly employed, or the secret that Defendants threatened to expose. (L. Salzman First Mem. at 14.) Accordingly, Raniere argues, Act Ten should be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But he has not cited, and the court is not aware of, any case in which a court dismissed any RICO act for failing to allege the specifics he requests here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 51:22-52:8 (where Lauren Salzman's counsel states that the case that comes closest to indicating that the Government must allege specifics of RICO acts is\n   <em>\n    Yannotti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752843\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/112/#p126\">\n    541 F.3d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the Second Circuit upheld the denial of a motion to dismiss a racketeering act for lack of specificity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Government's argument on the extortion racketeering acts in the First Superseding Indictment focused on the fact that extortion was previously alleged as\n   part of a RICO conspiracy. (Gov't First Mem. at 30-34.) Specifically, the Government contended that it need not plead predicate acts of a RICO conspiracy with the specificity sought by Raniere because the charged crime is the RICO conspiracy, not the predicate acts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Applins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197736\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/59/#p81\">\n    637 F.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Neither overt acts, nor specific predicate acts that the defendant agreed personally to commit, need be alleged or proved for a section 1962(d) offense.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Glecier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543404\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/496/#p500\">\n    923 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   500 )). The Government has not updated its argument to reflect that Act Ten is now alleged as part of a substantive RICO charge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Second Mem. (not addressing Lauren Salzman's arguments regarding extortion).) It is not clear to the court whether a heightened pleading requirement may apply to a predicate act of a substantive RICO charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Nevertheless, Raniere appears to have sufficient notice of what is alleged in Act Ten. The Government represents that it has disclosed the victims' names to him (Gov't Second Mem. at 26) and that its complaint, letters concerning bail and detention, and discovery provide ample information about the alleged extortion (Gov't First Mem. at 34). Raniere has not shown that the Indictment's failure to identify specific victims or provide greater detail as to the alleged extortion prejudices him in any way or somehow affects \"the fairness of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Stringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702802\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/120/#p124\">\n    730 F.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    b. Multiplicity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Raniere also adopted Lauren Salzman's arguments that the two extortion racketeering acts in the First Superseding Indictment were multiplicitous. (Raniere Second Mem. at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   L. Salzman Mem. at 19-22.) Count Two in the new Indictment alleges only one extortion racketeering act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6 34.) Accordingly, Raniere's multiplicity arguments are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

(Raniere Second Mem. at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mack First Mem. at 17-27.) He asserts that Counts Eight, Nine, and Ten should be dismissed because they lack specificity, they fail to state a claim, they are unconstitutionally vague as applied, and they are duplicitous. (Raniere First Mem. at 14-17; Raniere Reply at 4-6; Mack\n   First Mem. at 10-11, 17-30; Mack Reply at 1-3, 5-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    a. Specificity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Raniere argues that Counts Eight, Nine, and Ten lack specificity because they rely on \"unspecified threats of force, fraud and coercion.\" (Mack Mem. at 10; Mack Reply at 2.) As with the forced labor count, he contends that Count Eight is deficient because it fails to identify with specificity victims or \"lower-ranking DOS members.\" (Mack Mem. at 10.) He also argues that Counts Eight, Nine, and Ten are deficient because they provide no specificity as to the nature of the threats or how, when, and by whom they were communicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, he asserts that the Government must provide more detail about the location of the alleged acts beyond that they occurred \"within the Eastern District of New York and elsewhere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, he maintains that these counts are insufficient because they fail to provide specifics regarding the nature of the alleged commercial sex acts, who performed them and when and where they did so, or what value was exchanged on their account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He insists that the lack of specificity is compounded by the fact that these counts do not specify whether defendants violated the first or second paragraph of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"each of which exposes a defendant to liability under different types of conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Finally, he contends that the problems with the Indictment are not cured by the complaint because \"the undisputed facts, for purposes of this motion, contained within the complaint are also deficient.\" (Mack Reply at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Essentially, as with the forced labor count, Raniere complains of a lack of notice as to the accusations against him. As the Government notes, however, the complaint and detention letters set out in detail the factual basis for the allegations relating to trafficking. (Gov't Mem. at 49;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-24, 39-57; Raniere Detention Letter at 1-4.) In addition, he has been provided with \"ample discovery,\" including the names of victims and co-conspirators. (Gov't Mem. at 49.) Raniere does not dispute he has received this information, and, as with the forced labor count, his briefing suggests that he does in fact have notice of the Government's theory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mack Reply at 3; Mack Mem. at 11-17.) For the same reason articulated with respect to the forced labor count, therefore, the court denies Raniere's motion to dismiss Counts Eight, Nine, and Ten for lack of specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    b.

He maintains that the Government cannot make out a claim under \u00a7 1591 because the Complaint's allegations \"show that Ms. Mack did not receive anything of value\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   anyone had sex with Mr. Raniere.\" (Mack Mem. at 20.) A \"commercial sex act\" is defined as \"any sex act, on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.\" 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1591. The phrase \"on account of\" means that there must be \"a causal relationship between the sex act and an exchange of an item of value.\" (Mack Mem. at 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Marcus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079802\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/487/289/#p300\">\n    487 F.

Raniere contends that the Indictment fails to allege this requisite causal relationship because all it shows is that Mack belonged to the same organization as did the person who committed the alleged sex acts, and that as a result of this membership, Mack received benefits that were unrelated to the sex acts.

The Government outlined the topics of his proposed testimony, including \"[h]ow the actions of the alleged perpetrators within Nxivm and\n   DOS compare to traits and practices of certain of the comparative groups and how such action can facilitate financial and sexual exploitation,\" \"[h]ow families who are invested in the belief system of a group are affected and may lose their independence,\" and \"[h]ow abuse of the dynamics of relationships of supervisor-supervisee, teacher-student and other relationships of authority facilitate financial and sexual exploitation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)

The Government stated that it was still evaluating who it will offer to testify regarding the health effects of extreme calorie restriction and sleep deprivation.

(Raniere Second Mem. at 12-15; Mack Second Mem. at 11-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Raniere Second Mem. at 1 (joining Mack's motion).) He correctly notes that the court has \"broad discretion in fashioning a remedy\" for the Government's violation of its Rule 16 disclosure obligations, \"including ordering the exclusion of evidence.\" (Raniere Second Mem. at 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Raniere has not shown that the extreme remedy of preclusion is warranted here, where the Government disclosed two experts and disclosed the topic of its third expert's testimony nearly two months before the trial (see Gov't Mar. 15, 2019 Expert Disclosures). In the cases Raniere cites in which courts have precluded expert testimony due to untimely disclosures, the testimony was disclosed on the first day of trial or later.

Further, the court recognizes that the truncated pretrial schedule and the various motions that have been filed in this case have placed great burdens on the parties' counsel. That is why the court has liberally granted deadline extensions to all parties throughout this case. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Apr. 19, 2019 Order Granting Raniere an Extension to File Mots.\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 571).) In light of the burdens on the parties' counsel, the court declines to exercise its discretion under Rule 16 to preclude the Government's experts. Raniere's motion is denied without prejudice to its renewal when the Government has completed its expert disclosures. Additionally, the Government is directed to inform the court and Raniere of any experts it seeks to have testify by no later than Thursday, May 2, 2019, to give Raniere enough time to object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Trial Testimony of Foreign Witnesses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Finally, Raniere moves for an order allowing foreign witnesses to testify via live videoconferencing. (Raniere First Mem. at 22; Raniere Second Mem. at 15.) Since filing this motion, however, Raniere's counsel has stated that he does not expect to request live videoconferencing, and will instead ask the Government to allow his foreign witnesses to travel safely to this district so that they can testify in person. (Apr. 24, 2019 Hr'g Tr. (undocketed) at 396:1-17.) Accordingly, the court denies this motion without prejudice to Raniere renewing his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
