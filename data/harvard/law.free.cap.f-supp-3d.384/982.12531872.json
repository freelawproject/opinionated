CONLEY, District Judge\n   Plaintiff Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, Inc., and four of its health care providers bring this lawsuit against Wisconsin Attorney General Joshua Kaul, the District Attorney for Dane County Ismael Ozanne, in his official capacity and as a representative of a defendant class of District Attorneys, the Secretary of the Department of Safety and Professional Services Dawn Crim and members of the Medical Examining Board and the Board of Nursing. Plaintiffs claim that various laws and regulations unnecessarily require the participation of a physician (and at times the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   physician) at various stages of the abortion services in violation of their rights, as well as the rights of their patients. (Compl. (dkt. #1).) In answering the complaint, defendants deny that these requirements violate the constitutional rights of plaintiffs or their patients. (Answ. (dkt. #20).) Presently before the court is a motion by the Wisconsin legislature that seeks to intervene in this ongoing lawsuit, either as a matter of right or by permission under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. (Dkt. #21.) All the parties to this lawsuit oppose the motion. (Dkt. ##27, 28.) Having reviewed the parties' submissions, as well as the proposed intervenor's unsolicited reply brief (dkt. #30), the court will deny the motion for the reasons set forth below, principal of which is the failure of the proposed intervenor to distinguish controlling Seventh Circuit case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their complaint on January 16, 2019, seeking a declaratory judgment that the following abortion-related regulations violate the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20940.15\">\n    Wis.

As the Seventh Circuit has explained, however, establishing standing is not a sufficient basis to seek intervention as of right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flying J, Inc. v. Van Hollen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048160\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/578/569/#p571\">\n    578 F.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (7th Cir. 2009) (\"The interest required by Article III is not enough by itself to allow a person to intervene in a federal suit and thus become a party to it. There must be more.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nothing in the earlier decisions by the United States Supreme Court cited by the proposed intervenor suggests otherwise. In\n   <em>\n    Arizonans for Official English\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that its earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    Karcher\n   </em>\n   recognized that \"state legislators have standing to contest a decision holding a state statute unconstitutional if state law authorizes legislators to represent the State's interests,\" but concluded that the coalition seeking to intervene on appeal was not a legislative body, and therefore its standing was in doubt.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651034\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/43/#p65\">\n    520 U.S. at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651034\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/43/#p65\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Supreme Court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consider whether the motion to intervene satisfied the requirements of Rule 24. Like the Seventh Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Flying J\n   </em>\n   decision, the other two Supreme Court cases concerned proposed intervention because the state attorney general or other state entities decided\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to defend the challenged statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601323\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/72/#p75\">\n    484 U.S. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601323\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/72/#p75\">\n    108 S.Ct. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing intervention after \"it became apparent that neither the Attorney General nor the named defendants would defend the statute\");\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/\">\n    462 U.S. at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress is the proper party to defend the validity of a statute when an agency of government, as a defendant charged with enforcing the statute, agrees with plaintiffs that the statute is inapplicable or unconstitutional.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Flying J\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit followed this approach, granting an association of Wisconsin gasoline dealer's motion to intervene on appeal because the Wisconsin attorney general opted\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to appeal an adverse decision by the district court. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Had the association sought to intervene earlier, its motion would doubtless (and properly) have been denied on the ground that the state's attorney general was defending the statute and that adding another defendant would simply complicate the litigation. For there was nothing to indicate that the attorney general was planning to throw the case-until he did so by failing to appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048160\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/578/569/#p571\">\n    578 F.3d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   So, too, here. A state statute purporting to provide the Wisconsin legislature with the authority under state law to defend the State in federal court, arguably satisfying the\n   <em>\n    standing\n   </em>\n   requirements under Article III, does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relieve the legislature from satisfying the requirements for intervening under a federal rule. Even if it did impact the calculus, the statute certainly does not automatically satisfy the requirements for intervention as of right under Rule 24(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Putting aside this state statutory hook, the Seventh Circuit has instructed that the intervenor's \"interest must be\n   <em>\n    unique\n   </em>\n   to the proposed intervenor.\"\n   <em>\n    WEAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659005\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/640/#p657\">\n    705 F.3d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"378196\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/764/1265/#p1268\">\n    764 F.2d at 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The interest must be based on a right that belongs to the proposed intervenor rather than to an existing party in the suit.\"). Here, the Wisconsin legislature's interest -- defending the constitutionality of the challenged statutes and regulations -- is the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   as that of the defendants. As this court previously explained in denying a similar motion to intervene in an earlier case, \"a legislator's personal support does not give him or her an interest sufficient to support intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    One Wis.

However, the proposed intervenor's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   is also flawed.

Once again, there is no argument or basis to argue that the parties to this lawsuit are stripping powers from the legislative branch or otherwise nullifying their votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Even if the cases cited by the proposed intervenor could be read as allowing intervention of a state legislature (or individual legislators) to defend their vote, the 2018-2019 Wisconsin legislature's interest in the legislation at issue in this case is far less clear than the interests at stake in the standing cases cited above, where the challenged legislation was enacted or up for passage in the current term. The challenged statutes and regulations implicated in this lawsuit are not new. The requirement that abortions \"must be performed by physicians duly licensed by the medial examining board,\" now codified in Wisconsin Administrative Code \u00a7 MED 11.03, was adopted in January 1974 in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Roe v.
