For the reasons stated below, Tough Mudder's motion (Docket No. 18) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on breach of the settlement agreement (Count V).

Just days before the event, Tough Mudder moved the location to Westbrook, Maine. Plaintiffs were unable to attend, and Tough Mudder refused to refund their registration fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When registering for the Mudderella Boston event on the Tough Mudder website, each of the Plaintiffs agreed to the \"Participant Assumption of Risk, Waiver of Liability, and Indemnity Agreement.\" (Docket No. 10-3, at 6-12). That agreement contained an agreement to arbitrate claims, reading in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Mediation and Arbitration: In the event of a legal issue, I agree to engage in good faith efforts to mediate any dispute that might arise. Any agreement reached will be formalized by a written contractual agreement at that time. Should the issue not be resolved by mediation, I agree that all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of my participation in the Mudderella event shall be submitted to binding arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2014, Plaintiffs served their complaint on Tough Mudder.

Tough Mudder agreed to pay Plaintiffs $ 225,000,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56, and the parties agreed the settlement \"completely resolve[d] any claims and disputes\n   regarding the Event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. Tough Mudder concedes that it breached the Settlement Agreement, but the parties disagree about the proper remedy. Tough Mudder believes that Plaintiffs' remedy is simply to enforce the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs argue that Tough Mudder forfeited its right to enforce the arbitration agreement because it failed to satisfy the necessary precondition to mediate in good faith and that they should therefore be allowed to pursue the underlying claims in court as a class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under Massachusetts law, \"[e]very contract implies good faith and fair dealing between the parties to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Warner Ins.
