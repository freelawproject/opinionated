No. 18). That Motion has been fully briefed by the parties (Doc. Nos. 19, 22 &amp; 23), and, for the following reasons, will be granted in part and denied in part. Also pending is a Motion to Dismiss for improper venue or alternatively\n   to transfer (Doc. No. 5). That motion, too, has been fully briefed by the parties (Doc. Nos. 6, 8, 12, 14-1) and will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Eliminating some of the legal conclusions (of which there are many), and toning down the hyperbole a tad, the Amended Complaint alleges the following relevant facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Robyn and Roger dated in high school and had a brief romantic relationship. Decades later, they reconnected on Facebook and arranged a meeting in Las Vegas. Robyn and her husband Padiac Kelly met Roger there in January 2013. The trio met again in Las Vegas in January 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the January 2014 meeting, Robyn and Roger never met again. They did, however, correspond for several months in 2014, and discussed rekindling their decades-old high school relationship. By September 2014, however, Roger decided that it was wrong for him to engage in such communications, and he informed Robyn that he did not wish to communicate with her further. This did not go over well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December of 2014, Robyn, utilizing a fake Facebook account, began sharing personal messages with Kerry that she had received from Roger. This prompted Kerry to block Robyn on Facebook. Thwarted, Robyn changed tactics by \"leaving lengthy voicemails and sending literally hundreds of emails to Roger,\" that included \"threats of public disclosure of private facts\" and \"contained vitriolic attacks on Roger and vicious and frightening attacks on his wife, Kerry.\" (Doc. No. 9, Am. Cmpt. \u00b6 15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Roger, too, was forced to shut down his personal Facebook account, but could not change his work email. He tried to block messages from Robyn, but she would circumvent this by creating a \"myriad [of] new email accounts,\" through which she sent \"messages several times per week to his work email system from late 2014 into the late spring or 2018.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). Some emails threatened to get Roger fired from his job, while others referred to him by \"a string of defamatory invective[s] such as, 'sociopath,' 'abuser,' 'monster' and (in just one notable email) as 'a lunatic, psycho, loser, creep.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Some emails suggested that Roger was physically and/or emotionally abusive towards Robyn and other women, that he had mental health problems, and problems with alcohol abuse. Other emails attacked Kerry, suggesting that she, too, was abusive, and was \"evil,\" even though Robyn had never met Kerry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Robyn routinely threatened to \" 'expose\" Roger to a 'larger audience' and made other clear threats that she would inform third parties of her 'beliefs' about Roger -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the ... false assertions that Roger is an abusive romantic partner and a belligerent alcoholic, and his wife Kerry has physically threatened her - and provide those individuals with copies of the messages sent privately by Roger to Robyn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   . Robyn made good on those threats when, utilizing the \"handle Grace Squad,\" she created a Facebook account and uploaded a 79-page \"Document\" that included private exchanges and photos between her and Roger. The Document was prefaced with an introductory 15-page, single spaced narrative that contained many of the same \"salacious\" claims, \"accusations,\" and \"vitriolic attacks\" she had unleashed before in her private communications with Roger and Kerry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b622-24). The Document was sent to at least 18 individuals, some of whom were Plaintiffs' family members and personal friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to repeating a lot of what had been said earlier, the narrative portion of the Document \"describes Roger as 'a psycho and pathological liar,\" \"obsessive,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"an abuser,\" and \"a \"stalker\" who purportedly \"mistreated\" and \"threatened Robyn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). The Document also states that Roger was \"a drunk,\" \"mentally unhealthy,\" and that a psychologist friend of Robyn's indicated that Roger's behavior \"fit every definition and description of a sociopath.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). The Document also attacks Kerry, claiming that the Finley's had \"an abusive relationship,\" and that Kerry was belligerent, threatening and \"abus[ive] to Roger.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). The Document continues in the same vein, but this is more than enough to describe its essence and place the parties' arguments in context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss For Improper Venue or Alternatively to Transfer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to the initial Complaint, Robyn filed a combined Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and a Motion to Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b), or alternatively transfer venue pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Doc. No. 5). In response to the Amended Complaint, however, Robyn filed only a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, but stated in a footnote in her accompanying Memorandum that \"she maintains her arguments that venue is improper that were raised in her first motion and developed in subsequent filings.\" (Doc. No. 19 at 1, n.1). The record would have been less confusing if Robyn had simply renewed her venue/transfer motion in response to the Amended Complaint. Regardless, to the extent Robyn is still pursing this motion, it will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relying on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Robyn asserts that venue is improper in this Court because none of the provisions of subsection (b) of that statute apply. She is, after all, a resident of California, not Tennessee, a substantial part of the events did not occur in this state, and the action could have been brought in the Northern District of California. All of this may be true, but this action was removed from state court and \"venue in removed actions is governed solely by \u00a7 1441(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Kerobo v. Sw.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Generally, one of the most significant factors in considering whether venue should be transferred is the plaintiff's choice of forum,\" and, therefore, \" 'plaintiff's choice of forum is usually entitled to 'substantial consideration' in balancing the \u00a7 1404(a) factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

While Robyn cites a couple of district court cases for the proposition that \" '[a] plaintiff's choice of forum is entitled to somewhat less weight when the case is removed to federal court because the plaintiff is no longer in his or her chosen forum,\" (Doc.

The plaintiff estimates that the most\n   calls received from the defendants in a one-day time period was around 40. He estimates that the fewest number of calls received from the defendants in any one day was two. The plaintiff frequently chose not to answer the phone when he received a call from the defendants, thereby permitting the phone to ring until the other party hung up. The plaintiff claims that the longest continuous period of time that the phone rang was \"[w]ell past an hour.\" He states that when he tired of hearing the phone ring, he picked up the receiver and laid it down on a table or chair. He also states that he frequently picked up the receiver and listened to the caller without saying a word. Sometimes, he heard a radio playing and a whistle sound. Other times, he heard an individual making threats and remarks similar to those made by Mr. Holland in his initial call to the plaintiff and similar to the content of the messages recorded by his brother. The plaintiff identified the voice on the other end of the line as Mr. Holland's voice. Due to the defendants' constant calls, the plaintiff was forced to unplug the phone each night and plug it back in the next morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The communications in this case do not rise to the level of the outrageous conduct found to exist in\n   <em>\n    Nairon\n   </em>\n   , nor is it alleged that Robyn held some sort of actual or apparent authority over Roger.

Emails are obviously easier to ignore than the incessant ringing of a phone, and a couple a week pales in comparison to up to 40 a day.
