Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This suit arises out of Mark Roshawn Adkins's (\"Adkins\") death in Lemon Grove, California on May 20, 2017. That morning, at approximately 8:16 a.m., Corporal Armin Vianzon and Deputy Jeffrey Perine of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department responded to a trespassing call. (Doc. Nos. 52-2, Ex. A Perine Depo. at 138:3-18, 145:3-6.; 52-8 \u00b6 2, 3; 52-9 \u00b6 2, 4; 49-2 at 9.) En route, the officers received updates that the trespassing individual was scaling walls, sweating profusely, possibly under the influence of PCP, and was pulling on door handles. (Doc. No. 52-2, Ex. A Perine Depo. at 138:9-25, 139:20-140:8.) At the scene, the officers encountered Adkins by the door of a townhome, near his mother's residence. (Doc. Nos. 52-2, Ex. A Perine Depo. at 148:2-7; 49-2 at 8-9.) The door was on the second level of the complex, on an elevated patio, and Deputy Perine was concerned that Adkins might try to take one of the officers over the balcony. (Doc. Nos. 52-2, Ex. A Perine Depo. at 168:16-169:17; 170:1-171:9; 52-9 \u00b6 4.) Adkins was sweating profusely, breathing heavily, and flexing his arms and muscles. (Doc. No. 52-9 \u00b6 6.) The officers drew their tasers and ordered Adkins to get on the ground multiple times. (Doc. No. 52-9 \u00b6 11, 13.) Adkins ignored their commands, growled intensely at them, intermittently clenched his fists, and knelt down and assumed a charging position against Deputy Perine. (Doc. Nos. 52-2 at 168:16-169:19; 52-9 \u00b6 12.) Adkins stood up and took a step toward Deputy Perine. (Doc. Nos. 52-2 at 169:10-17; 52-9 \u00b6 13.) At this point, Deputy Perine deployed his electronic control device (\"taser\"). (Doc. Nos. 52-2 at 169:10-19; 52-9 \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the encounter that followed, each officer deployed his taser twice against Adkins. (Doc. Nos. 52-8 at 2; 52-9 at 4; 49-2 at 14-15.) Although the parties dispute the effect of Deputy Perine's two deployments and Corporal Vianzon's first deployment, Corporal Vianzon's second deployment was effective enough to cause Adkins to lower to the ground. (Doc. No. 52-9 at 4.) The officers repeatedly ordered him to roll over onto his stomach and put both hands behind his back, but Adkins did not comply. (Doc. No. 52-9 \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 49-3 Exhibit N.) Deputy Perine attempted to handcuff Adkins, who struggled. (Doc. Nos. 52-2 at 52:10-53:23; 52-9 at 4-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   49-3 Exhibit N.) Two additional officers arrived on scene before Adkins was handcuffed, one of whom assisted in restraining Adkins's legs and attempting to secure Adkins's right arm from under Adkins's body. (Doc. Nos. 52-9 \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   49-3 Exhibit N.) Corporal Vianzon cycled his taser multiple times before the officers were able to handcuff Adkins. (Doc. Nos. 52-9 at 4-5; 52-9 \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   49-3 Exhibit N.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once Adkins was handcuffed, Corporal Vinazon immediately requested paramedics. (Doc. No. 52-9 \u00b6 23.) At approximately 8:48 a.m., Adkins became pulseless and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. (Doc. No. 52-2 at 130, Exhibit G.) He was transported by ambulance to a hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not contend that Adkins's death was caused by the tasings.

Plaintiff argues that once Adkins was on the ground and outnumbered by police officers, subsequent tasing cycles constituted excessive force. (Doc. No. 49-1 at 15-17.) Defendants argue that Adkins continued to fight the deputies, attempting to kick and stand up, and he pulled his hands away from the deputies creating a security threat. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 10-11.) Given the factual disputes, whether Adkins posed an immediate threat to the deputies is a question of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to whether Adkins was resisting arrest, the Court concludes that triable issues of fact remain. Plaintiffs argue that, although Adkins was resisting arrest, he was not exhibiting assaultive behavior that would have injured the officers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 49-1 at 17.) Defendants argue that Adkins was resisting arrest and potentially attempting to escape. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 52-2 at 10-11.)

Accordingly, the Court denies both Defendants' and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether Corporal Vianzon's use of the taser was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, the Court concludes that Deputy Perine is entitled to qualified immunity.

The Court concludes that, even assuming that Corporal Vianzon's use of the taser violated Adkins' Fourth Amendment rights, Deputy Perine did not have a realistic opportunity to intervene given that the alleged violation occurred within a matter of seconds and while Deputy Perine was occupied with handcuffing Adkins, who himself was struggling against the arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

In\n   <em>\n    S.B.\n   </em>\n   , the district court determined that inconsistencies in officer testimony created a triable dispute over whether the officer's conduct violated clearly established law, but the court did not identify a clear precedent barring the officer from using deadly force under the circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275952,12275951\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/1010/\">\n    864 F.3d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, because the Court concludes that Deputy Perine could not have intervened under the circumstances for the purposes of Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim, he is also entitled to summary judgment on the battery and Bane Act claims. Thus, the Court denies summary judgment as to Corporal Vianzon and grants summary judgment as to Deputy Perine with respect to Plaintiff's battery claim and Bane Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Negligence Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants argue that because the officers' conduct was objectively reasonable with respect to Plaintiff's federal claim, Plaintiff's state law claim for negligence fails for the same reason. (Doc. No. 52-1 at 25.) Plaintiff concedes that they must prove their excessive force claims to have any other subsidiary claim based on any negligence theory. (Doc. No. 61 at 23.) The Court concludes above that genuine issues of material fact remain on the objective reasonableness of the uses of force by Corporal Vianzon and that Deputy Perine could not have intervened under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Therefore, the Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's negligence claim against Corporal Vianzon and grants the motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's negligence claim against Deputy Perine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

(Doc. No. 52-1 at 29-30.) Plaintiff argues that she has not sued on the first tasings, so there is no claim to rule upon. (Doc. No. 61 at 24.) Given that Plaintiff concedes that she has not sued on the first tasings and given that excessive force cases require an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, the Court declines to grant summary adjudication as to the first tasings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604325\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1539/#p1546\">\n    137 S.

The Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's claims against Corporal Vianzon and Defendant County of San Diego, and the Court declines to grant summary adjudication as to the first tasings.

Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's citations to\n    <em>\n     Gravelet-Blondin\n    </em>\n    are not applicable to the issues raised in Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Moreover, with respect to\n    <em>\n     Beaver\n    </em>\n    , the Court may \"look to whatever decisional law is available to ascertain whether the law is clearly established for qualified immunity purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     Boyd v.

However, given the binding precedent discussed above and that Plaintiff does not provide other examples of decisional law in addition to\n    <em>\n     Beaver\n    </em>\n    , the Court does not find that\n    <em>\n     Beaver\n    </em>\n    represents clearly established law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Ciampi v.
