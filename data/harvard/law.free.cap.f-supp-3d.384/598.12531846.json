Initially, plaintiffs argue that the proceeding before the state court was a petition under Virginia Code \u00a7 22-1.87, not a \"claim for relief\"; however, a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia has held that a petition under that same section of the Virginia Code was clearly a \"civil proceeding\" and thus was covered by Rule 1:6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davison v.

When they moved to stay the state court proceeding while they prosecuted this federal lawsuit, defendant essentially contradicted its preclusion argument by opposing plaintiffs' motion to stay on the grounds that collateral estoppel would not apply because \"[n]o factual issue yet to be litigated in the federal lawsuit will be 'litigated' in this appeal.\" Dkt. No. 79-1 at 4. The state court was confined to the record before the School Board and could only overturn decisions that were arbitrary and capricious, whereas the review available in this federal litigation is necessarily broader and involves more than just a due process claim.

Although\n   <em>\n    Goss\n   </em>\n   provided articulable procedural requirements for a suspension of ten\n   days or less, no court has yet \"prescribed a precise procedural paradigm that is required\" when a student is removed from a particular school,\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit has held that transfer to an alternative program did not constitute a denial of access to public education, \"not even temporarily,\" because the student remained in a public school, albeit an \"alternative\" one.\n   <em>\n    Nevares v. San Marcos Consol. Indep. Sch.

Plaintiffs presented a psychosexual risk assessment showing the Student posed a minimal risk, two polygraph reports indicating the Student was truthful, and character reference letters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. Both the Student and his father testified at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. On March 23, 2018, a decision finding that the Student had violated School Board policy was issued, and he was reassigned to an \"alternative educational setting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-32. The Student appealed that decision to the School Board, which denied the appeal on April 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. These facts, which are not disputed, establish that the Student was afforded the notice and opportunity to be heard which are required for due process. His allegation that he was \"cut off\" or that the hearing was ended abruptly are insufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether there was a due process violation. John Doe 2 Dep. at 104:17-19; John Doe 1 Decl. \u00b6 18. Further undercutting any due process claim is that the Student was transferred to another educational setting, rather than being expelled. Although the Student has described many deficiencies in the School Board's procedures, these flaws do not rise to the level of a denial of due process. Therefore, the defendant will be granted summary judgment as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    5.
