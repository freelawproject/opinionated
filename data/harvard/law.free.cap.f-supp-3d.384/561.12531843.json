We did not initially address the investors' alternative unjust enrichment claim as we found the contract claim warranted judgment. Our Court of Appeals directed us to consider whether the investors could recover on an unjust enrichment claim in the first instance. Following discovery and with both parties agreeing the issue is ripe as a matter of law, we today analyze whether the investors can recover their investment in the fraudulent annuity from the broker based on unjust enrichment. Under the governing New Jersey law, there can be no unjust enrichment claim in the existence of a valid contract. Our Court of Appeals found a valid contract but found the broker had not breached the contract and entered judgment for the broker on the contract claim. Consistent with New Jersey law, we today grant the broker's motion for summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim. As difficult as this decision is for disappointed and possibly defrauded investors, they do not have a claim against the broker for unjust enrichment in the face of a valid contract governing the entirety of their relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In April 2013, Kenneth Stevens, represented by counsel, moved to vacate the March 2012 order approving the annuity transfer. Mr. Stevens argued he \"was never made a party to [the] proceeding,\" \"did not sign any of the documents submitted to this Court in support of the petition,\" and \"was not served with a copy of the petition,\" as a result of \"a fraud ... committed upon the Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Morley granted Mr. Stevens's motion on April 15, 2014, vacating the March 2012 order nunc pro tunc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Morley directed all payments on the annuity be sent to Mr. Stevens's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is not disputed the Walls tendered $152,833.37 in total to Altium Group under the parties' Master Agreement and Addendum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also not disputed the Walls did not receive payments under Kenneth Stevens' annuity or a refund of the $152,833.37. Altium Group's President and sole member, William D. Coluccio, swears in a written declaration Altium Group profited little from the Walls' payments on the Stevens annuity. He swears Altium Group forwarded $138,198.91 of the Walls' $152,833.37 \"to Corona pursuant to the Structured Settlement Receivable Purchase and Sale Agreement between Altium and Corona,\" leaving a balance of $14,634.46.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Altium then allocated much of that remaining amount as follows: \"Altium paid (i) $4,585.00 to [financial advisor] D'Alessandro as a commission, (ii) $4,875.00 in direct transactional costs and fees for administrative staff, and (iii) $300.00 in legal fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the end, the Walls paid Altium Group $4,874.46 on Kenneth Stevens' annuity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Walls do not accept Altium Group's accounting-arguing \"[t]here is nothing in the record to show that Altium informed the Walls that th[ese] transfer[s] took place\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   -they adduce no evidence contradicting Altium's accounting. Linda Wall swore she does not believe Altium Group was complicit in any fraud, nor did Altium Group, to her knowledge, have reason to know of the underlying fraud before the Walls invested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed the Walls paid the $4,874.46 under a contract; nobody can argue this payment is gratuitous or otherwise volunteered by the Walls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Walls sue Altium Group and Corona Capital.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Walls sued Altium Group and Corona Capital in June 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Altium\n   Group and Corona Capital timely removed this case, the Walls filed an Amended Complaint alleging against Altium Group claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of the Uniform Commercial Code's transfer warranties. Against Corona Capital, the Walls alleged claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, negligence, and breach of the Uniform Commercial Code's transfer warranties. We subsequently granted Corona Capital's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, leaving Altium Group as the remaining defendant in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, in January 2017 we granted Altium Group's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Walls' claims for breach of the Uniform Commercial Code's transfer warranties, but otherwise denied Altium Group's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Walls' claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment proceeded through discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. We entered summary judgment for the Walls on the contract claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on the Walls' claim for breach of contract claim against Altium. On March 28, 2017, we granted the Walls' motion and denied Altium's cross-motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   We found, \"as a matter of law, the Walls and Altium ha[d] a contract,\" and \"Altium breached its duty under the Agreement because the Walls never received the 60 monthly payments or their $152,833.37 returned from Altium.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although \"the supervening event of underlying fraud in Stevens'[s] Annuity transfer rendered Altium's performance impossible,\" such an event \"does not excuse Altium from restitution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"We dismiss[ed] the Walls' unjust enrichment [claim] as mooted by [our] finding a contract existed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 10, 2017, we entered judgment in favor the Walls and against Altium in the amount of $156,078.06. Altium appealed from our judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Our Court of Appeals remands for further proceedings on the Walls' unjust enrichment claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our Court of Appeals \"reverse[d] [our] order of March 28, 2017, granting the Walls' motion for summary judgment and denying Altium's motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although affirming our fact findings, our Court of Appeals found we \"misconstrued the transaction between Altium and the Walls.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Altium, our Court of Appeals held, \"merely sold\n   <em>\n    the rights\n   </em>\n   to the underlying financial asset, a structured settlement annuity providing for a stream of payments, to the Walls.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   It \"did not make any promise or guarantee of the future performance of the financial asset,\n   and, indeed, in our review of the Altium-Walls documents we could not find any such promise or guarantee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals found Altium \"fulfilled the terms of its contract, the delivery to the Walls of the rights to the annuity payments guaranteed by New York Life.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As we originally found the existence of a contract mooted the Walls' unjust enrichment claim, our Court of Appeals remanded \"for further proceedings on the Walls' unjust enrichment claim,\" without expressing an opinion on its merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the parties agree the Walls' unjust enrichment claim is the only claim remaining and the issue is ripe for decision as a matter of law on cross-motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Walls argue recovery for unjust enrichment is necessary to remedy the unfairness the Walls suffered in receiving nothing in return for the $152,833.37 they paid to Altium. The Walls also emphasize the parties did not contemplate the fraud undermining the original transfer order. Altium Group argues the Walls cannot recover for unjust enrichment because Altium Group satisfied its contractual obligations to sell its rights to the stream of payments, and \"there are no allegations ... that the Walls and Altium had any dealings outside the scope of the Master Agreement or that Altium engaged in any sort of wrongful conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   After careful study of the record and our Court of Appeals' November 2018 decision holding Altium fulfilled its obligations under the parties' contract, we grant summary judgment to Altium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consistent with the Master Agreement's choice of law provision, we apply New Jersey law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Under New Jersey law, '[t]he constructive or\n   <em>\n    quasi\n   </em>\n   -contract [doctrine] ... prevent[s] unjust enrichment or unconscionable benefit or advantage.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   But while we may impose quasi-contractual obligations for the important \"purpose of bringing about justice,\" we may not impose quasi-contract liability \"if an express contract exists concerning the identical subject matter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals, applying New Jersey law, has made clear \"as long as a valid unrescinded contract governs the rights of the parties,\" we lack a \"ground for implying a promise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not disputed\n   a valid, unrescinded contract governs the parties' relationship on the identical subject matter. The parties agreed to govern their relationship under the Master Agreement (as modified by the subsequent Addendum). Our Court of Appeals found \"Altium did not breach a contract with the Walls because it fulfilled the terms of its contract, the delivery to the Walls of the rights to the annuity payments guaranteed by New York Life.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Walls argue they can still alternatively pursue unjust enrichment notwithstanding the parties' contract, relying substantially on cases describing the right to alternatively plead claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. To the extent cases arising at the motion to dismiss stage inform our summary judgment analysis today, these cases support our application of the principle \"recovery under quasi-contractual or other equitable claims is precluded in the presence of a valid contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Walls, for example, emphasize Judge Brown's statement in\n   <em>\n    Titan Stone, Tile &amp; Masonry, Inc. v. Hunt Construction Group\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] plaintiff may ... put forth contractual, quasi-contractual and other equitable claims for relief in its complaint, even if the plaintiff has not sought rescission of the contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Judge Brown explained this rule in the context of a motion to dismiss. He also acknowledged \"the uncontested truth that\n   <em>\n    recovery\n   </em>\n   under quasi-contractual or other equitable claims is precluded\n   <em>\n    in the presence of a valid contract.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Permitting alternative pleading, however, in no way undermines our finding Altium Group's performance in full compliance with its contractual obligations precludes recovery for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We find support as well in\n   <em>\n    Dykstra v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , from which the Walls extract the following quotation: \"[i]t is a determination of the trial court whether plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law. Should the court decide that the plaintiff is not entitled to recovery pursuant to a contractual theory, then it may in turn deal with one equitable theory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Dykstra\n   </em>\n   also involved a motion to dismiss, and we must consider the quoted sentence in context. Judge Ackerman explained, in the sentence immediately preceding the ones the Walls emphasize, \"\n   <em>\n    alternative pleading\n   </em>\n   of contract and quasi-contract claims is permissible.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not dealing with alternative pleading at this juncture, as our Court of Appeals has already found a valid, unrescinded contract governs the parties' relationship as to Kenneth Stevens' structured settlement annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Yet seeking to distance themselves from the rule a valid, unrescinded contract precludes recovery for unjust enrichment, the Walls argue their agreement with Altium Group \"did not contemplate the Parties' obligations to each other if underlying fraud was discovered after the purported transfer, making the contract impractical.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   This uncontemplated circumstance, the Walls argue, means their unjust enrichment\n   claim \"falls outside the scope of the agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even if this somehow does not preclude consideration of the unjust enrichment claim on the merits-a dubious interpretation of the contract, we believe-the Walls' unjust enrichment claim must still fail on the merits because Altium Group obtained no benefit beyond the one expressly permitted under the parties' contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Under New Jersey law, to prove a claim for unjust enrichment, 'a party must demonstrate that the opposing party received a benefit and that retention of that benefit without payment would be unjust.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recovery under the doctrine of quasi-contract requires the plaintiff \"show that it expected remuneration from the defendant at the time it performed or conferred a benefit on defendant and that the failure of remuneration\n   <em>\n    enriched defendant beyond its contractual rights.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undisputed facts in this case reveal no such enrichment beyond Altium Group's rights under the Master Agreement (as modified by the Addendum). While we initially found Altium Group breached its contractual obligation, our Court of Appeals reversed our order, holding \"Altium did not breach a contract with the Walls because it fulfilled the terms of its contract, the delivery to the Walls of the rights to the annuity payments guaranteed by New York Life.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Altium, our Court of Appeals held, agreed \"to sell a stream of payments,\" not \"to make a stream of payments\"-and these two are \"not the same thing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our Court of Appeals emphasized Altium Group's adherence to the terms of the contract, undermining the Walls' pled characterization of the transaction as the Walls' \"conferr[al] [of] a benefit upon Defendant Altium Group by paying $152,833.37 and receiving nothing in return.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals held \"Altium sold a structured settlement annuity to the Walls in a contract without a provision by which Altium promised or guaranteed that the annuity payments would be made.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   No extra-contractual benefit or enrichment flowed to Altium Group. Linda Wall admitted she and her husband \"never discussed risk,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   she does not believe Altium Group was complicit in any fraud, and Altium Group, to her knowledge, never had any reason to know of the underlying fraud before the Walls invested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Unfortunate though it may be for the Walls, we have no mandate to transform New Jersey's doctrine of quasi-contract into a blanket insurance policy against risky investments governed by written contract. Altium Group \"has not received any benefit it was not entitled to under the terms of the agreement,\" and \"[t]hus the 'essential requirement of unjust enrichment of defendant does not appear.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   We express here no opinion on a timely claim the Walls may assert against Corona Capital\n   or another party in an appropriate forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
