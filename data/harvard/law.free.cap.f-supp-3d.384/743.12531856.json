Austin on December 12, 2018. (Dkts. ## 240, 241.) Pursuant to Local Rule CV-7(h), the Court finds this matter suitable for disposition without a hearing. After careful consideration and review, the Court-for the reasons that follow-(1)\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   the Report and Recommendations (Dkts. ## 240, 241); (2)\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Grande's DMCA safe harbor defense (Dkt. # 127); (3)\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Grande's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 140); (4)\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Grande's Motion for Sanctions (Dkt. # 156); and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Liability (Dkt. # 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are record companies that produce commercial sound recordings and distribute them throughout the United States. (Dkt. # 1 at 2.) Remaining Defendant Grande Communications Networks, LLC (\"Grande\") is an internet service provider (\"ISP\"), providing internet access to customers in Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   Former Defendant Patriot Media Consulting, LLC (\"Patriot\") provided and continues to provide various management services to Grande. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiffs originally filed suit against both Grande and Patriot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants received over one million notices of direct copyright infringement allegedly committed by Grande's customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 11-12.) Plaintiffs allege that these customers directly infringed on Plaintiffs' copyrights through the use of various of file sharing applications, including BitTorrent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 8-12.) Plaintiffs' complaint asserted claims for secondary copyright infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. against both defendants, alleging Defendants continued to provide infringing customers with internet access after\n   receiving the notices of infringement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 15, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 19, 2017, Defendants filed separate motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkts. ## 28, 29.) On March 26, 2018, the Court adopted a Report and Recommendation from Magistrate Judge Austin recommending Patriot's motion be granted in its entirety and Grande's motion be granted as to Plaintiffs' claims for vicarious secondary infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkts. ## 72 at 21; 77 at 3.) Patriot was thus dismissed as a defendant from this action.

(Dkt. # 80.) Among other affirmative defense, Grande pled the safe harbor provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). \u00a7 512(i) protects ISPs like Grande from liability for the copyright infringement of their customers if the ISP \"has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or network of, a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or network who are repeat infringers[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 8, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as to Grande's affirmative defense of the DMCA safe harbor provision. (Dkt. # 127.) On December 18, 2018, Judge Austin issued a Report and Recommendation (the \"Safe Harbor Report\") recommending Plaintiffs' motion be granted as to the safe harbor issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. # 241.) On January 23, 2019, Grande filed written objections. (Dkt. # 251.) On January 23, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a response to Grande's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, on August 18, 2018, Grande filed a motion for summary judgment as to the issues of liability and damages. (Dkt. # 140.) On September 11, 2018, in their response in opposition to Grande's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs cross moved for summary judgment as to liability. (Dkt. # 172.) On December 18, 2018, Judge Austin issued a Report and Recommendation (the \"Liability Report\") recommending Grande's motion for summary judgment be granted as to Grande's alleged liability for infringing Plaintiffs' reproduction rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) and public performance rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). (Dkt. # 240.) The Liability Report also recommends denying Grande's motion in all other respects and denying Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in its entirety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   Both Plaintiffs and Grande filed objections to the Liability Report on January 9, 2019. (Dkts. ## 250, 252.) Plaintiffs filed a response to Grande's objections on January 23, 2019. (Dkt. # 257.) Grande filed a response to Plaintiffs' objections on the same day. (Dkt. # 258.) On January 30, 2019, Plaintiffs\n   filed a reply in support of their objections. (Dkt. # 259.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Safe Harbor Report and the Liability Report and the parties' objections thereto are currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Review of the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Any party who desires to object to a Magistrate Judge's findings and recommendations must serve and file written objections within 14 days after being served with a copy of the findings and recommendation.

C at 12.) However, beginning in October 2010, Grande's practice of terminating customers ceased (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.), and Grande did not terminate a single infringing customer from October 2010 until May 2017 (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex. G at 6). Yet during that period Grande received over a million copyright infringement notices, it was tracking over 9,000 customers on its DMCA \"Excessive Violations Report\" by late 2016, and it specifically tracked users by the number of notices it received about them. (Dkts. ## 127-9, Ex. I at 5; 127-3, Ex. C at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In internal emails, Grande employees recognized that \"we have some customers that are up to their 54th notice[,]\" yet \"there is no 'three strikes' law or anything that we follow like some ISPs.\" (Dkt. # 127-22, Ex D.) Grande's corporate representative further admitted that until 2017 it would not terminate a user for infringement \"regardless of the source of any notice,\" regardless of the content of any notice,\" and \"regardless of the volume of notices ... for a given customer.\" (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex.

(Dkt. # 127-24, Ex.

(Dkt. # 251 at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n    881 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   293 ).) In this case, in contrast, Grande argues, \"there is no evidence that Grande ever internally concluded that a particular subscriber should be terminated pursuant to Grande's public-facing policies, and then nevertheless declined to enforce that policy and terminate the subscriber's account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But in\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   , Cox at least had internal procedures that in theory could lead to the termination of a customer, even if they were laxly enforced and often circumvented. In this case, the evidence is clear that from at least 2011 until 2016 Grande had no internal policy or procedures whatsoever to enforce their forward-facing statement that they would terminate customers for repeat infringements. (Dkt. # 127-21, Ex. B at 8-9.) Grande admitted that until 2017 it would not terminate a user for infringement \"regardless of the source of any notice,\" regardless of the content of any notice,\" and \"regardless of the volume of notices ... for a given customer.\" (Dkt. # 127-7 at 6-7.) And in fact Grande did not terminate a single infringing customer from October 2010 until May 2017 (Dkt. # 127-7 at 6.) Unlike Cox, Grande did not even have a policy or procedures in the first place for them to laxly enforce or frequently circumvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Grande thus did even less than Cox to \"reasonably implement\" the kind of policy required for the protections of DMCA's safe harbor. If lax enforcement and frequent circumvention of existent procedures disqualifies a defendant from the safe harbor's protections, the complete nonexistence of such procedures surely must do likewise. Such a complete abdication of their responsibilities to implement and enforce a policy terminating repeat copyright infringers requires the Court to conclude that Grande is not entitled, as a matter of law, to the safe harbor provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v.

Grande argues that because these notices were \"incapable of identifying or giving notice of actual copyright infringement, there are questions of fact as to whether it reasonably implemented a termination policy in spite of never terminating any customers from 2010 to 2016.\" (Dkt. # 251 at 3-7.) Grande also argues, again because of the supposed flaws in these notices, that there are triable questions of fact whether appropriate\n   circumstances existed warranting termination of any customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, these arguments are unpersuasive for several reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   also involved the same notices, generated by a company called Rightscorp, that Grande objects to in this case. Cox argued that these notices \"do not necessarily\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   actual knowledge of repeat infringement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n    881 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). But the Fourth Circuit held that \"Cox's decision to categorically disregard all notices from Rightscorp provides further evidence that Cox did not reasonably implement a repeat infringer policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fourth Circuit explained that Cox's argument was misplaced because \"Cox bears the burden of proof on the DCMA safe harbor defense; thus, Cox had to point to evidence showing that it reasonably implemented a repeat infringer policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n    at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Grande is similarly unable to show such reasonable implementation, because the evidence is undisputed that it failed to terminate any customers from 2010 through 2016, despite receiving over a million infringement notices and tracking more than 9,000 customers as repeat infringers. (Dkts. ## 127-9 at 5; 127-3 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Grande's argument that the Rightscorp notices failed to demonstrate appropriate circumstances justifying termination is similarly unpersuasive. This argument was also made by the defendant in\n   <em>\n    BMG.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n    881 F.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But just as Cox did in\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   , Grande has:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   failed to provide evidence that a determination of \"appropriate circumstances\" played any role in its decisions to terminate (or not to terminate). [Grande] did not, for example, point to any criteria that its employees used to determine whether \"appropriate circumstances\" for termination existed. Instead, the evidence shows that [Grande's] decisions not to terminate had nothing to do with \"appropriate circumstances\" ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Grande admitted that it had no procedure in place from 2010 through 2016 providing for how it would actually go about terminating infringing customers. (Dkt. # 127-21, Ex. B at 8-9.) Grande also admitted that until 2017 it would not terminate a user for infringement \"regardless of the source of any notice,\" regardless of the content of any notice,\" and \"regardless of the volume of notices ... for a given customer.\" (Dkt. # 127-7 at 6-7.) And Grande did not terminate a single infringing customer from October 2010 until May 2017 (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex. G at 6.) This evidence indisputably shows that Grande's \"decisions not to terminate had nothing to do with 'appropriate circumstances' ....\"\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275165\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/293/#p303\">\n    881 F.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, Grande's own documents in the record reflect, contrary to the arguments it now advances, that it took the Rightscorp and other notice as affirmative evidence of infringement. In one April 2013 email exchange, a senior Grande official stated that \"we have some customers who are up to their 54th notice ... [yet] there is no 'three strikes' law or anything that we follow like some ISPs.\" (Dkt. # 127-22, Ex. D.) As a result, the same official then asked, in the same email: \"Question - we have users who are racking up DMCA take down requests and no process for remedy in place. I don't know if I'm seeing a broken process or compliance with the letter of the law. Do you guys have insight or knowledge on this?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   In the ensuing conversation, another Grande manager reported the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Who is responsible for the DCMA notification process? Do we call customers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Bartlett just answered my email, and, as you said, they contact the customer and let them know they will disconnect them if they continue to receive those notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   If we do nothing more tha[n] emails (as I think you mentioned) we might lose our safe harbor status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Dkt. # 128-28, Ex. M at 2.) Other internal emails also demonstrate that Grande viewed the notices as evidence that a customer had infringed a copyright. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. ## 127-17, Ex. Q; 127-30, Ex. R; 127-31, Ex. S.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Grande's arguments related to the Rightscorp notices ignores the hundreds of thousands, out of roughly 1.2 million notices of infringement Grande received between 2011 and 2016 (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex. G at 10), came from entities other than Rightscorp. In 2015, for example, out of 365,569 infringement notices received, 119,247, roughly one third, were received from other sources. (Dkt. # 172-18, Ex. R at 2.) Grande has presented no summary judgment evidence that these other notices are in any way unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even if the Court were to accept Grande's arguments related to the Rightscorp notices, the summary judgment evidence shows that Grande failed to terminate a single customer despite the receipt of several hundred thousand other copyright infringement notices. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs' on this issue is still be appropriate because, as the DMCA safe harbor is an affirmative defense, Grande carries the burden of demonstrating it is entitled to raising it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325389\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/78/#p94\">\n    826 F.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (2d Cir. 2016) (holding that defendant \"bears the burden of raising entitlement to the safe harbor and of demonstrating that it has ... taken the steps necessary for eligibility\"). Even ignoring the Rightscorp notices, with no evidence undermining these hundreds of thousands of other notices, Grande has failed to carry this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   the Safe Harbor Report.

In opposing Grande's motion, Plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment in their own favor on the issue of liability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 172.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Magistrate Judge's Liability Report recommends granting Grande summary judgment as to whether Grande's customers violated Plaintiffs reproduction or public performance rights, and thus whether Grande could be held contributorily liable for such infringement. (Dkt. # 240 at 4 n.1.) In all other respects, the Liability Report recommends denying both parties' motions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.) Grande objects on all six issues to the Liability Report's recommendations denying the motions. (Dkt. # 252.) Plaintiffs object to the Liability Report's recommendations denying their\n   cross motion on direct and contributory infringement. (Dkt. # 250.) Plaintiffs also object to the Liability Report's recommendation to grant Grande summary judgment on their claim for Grande's contributory liability for violating their reproduction rights.

Plaintiffs argue that they stated in their combined opposition and cross motion for summary judgment that their claims involve both uploading and downloading of copyrighted music, the latter of which would constitute an infringement of the reproduction right. (Dkt. # 250 at 3.) However, a review of Plaintiffs' argument in which the referenced language is found makes it clear that their argument is directed solely towards Grande's argument related to violations of the right of distribution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 172 at 16-23.) The language in the motion Plaintiffs now attempt to rely on is merely their introductory statement of the law and is then followed only by argument related to distribution. Plaintiffs' motion does not reference or respond to Grande's argument related to reproduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs' objections fail to respond to the substance of Grande's summary judgment argument. In this context, violation of a copyright holder's right to reproduction involves downloading copyrighted material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maverick Recording Co. v.

But Plaintiffs' claims are based on notices and evidence that Grande subscribers made copyrighted material available for download by others. Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence, either on summary judgment or in their objections to the Liability Report, that Grande subscribers downloaded or otherwise acquired the copyrighted materials through Grande's network, as opposed to any other of a number of plausible-including some legal-means. There is no evidence at all concerning the origin of the songs at issue. Without evidence of the origin of the infringing music, there is no evidence the music was obtained in violation of Plaintiffs' right of reproduction, and thus no evidence of direct infringement through illegal reproduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Similarity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Grande argues that proving a copyright infringement claim \"requires a\n   side-by-side comparison of the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work, so that the factfinder can assess whether they are 'substantially similar.' \" (Dkt. # 140 at 8.) The necessary implication of this argument is that to prove its case Plaintiffs would have to play every song at issue for the jury, alongside the allegedly identical copy or copies found on Grande's customers' computers. Grande relies for this premise on language found in various decisions of the Fifth Circuit. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Bridgmon v.

In\n   <em>\n    Creations Unlimited, Inc. v.

First, the three cases relied on by Grande are factually distinct from the instant case. In\n   <em>\n    Bridgmon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , the only admitted evidence of substantial similarity asserted by the plaintiffs was their own oral testimony of similarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridgmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346668\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/572/#p577\">\n    325 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   576 ;\n   <em>\n    King, on Behalf of Estate of King v.

June 4, 1997). This reliance purely on oral testimony is what\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   means by \"copying is an issue to be determined by comparison of works, not credibility.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844316\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/370/#p376\">\n    179 F.3d at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Bridgmon\n   </em>\n   also expressly quotes this language from\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   in explaining its conclusion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346668\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/572/#p577\">\n    325 F.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Creations Unlimited\n   </em>\n   involved an allegation that the defendant sold t-shirts with images modelled off of a series of black and white drawings that the plaintiff held copyrights in.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854722\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/814/#p816\">\n    112 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the Fifth Circuit upheld a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because a side-by-side comparison revealed the defendant's \"tee-shirts differed from [Plaintiff's] line drawings in too many respects for a layman to conclude that the works were substantially similar.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854722\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/814/#p816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854722\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/814/#p816\">\n    at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the allegation is not that Grande's customers infringed Plaintiffs' copyrights by creating substantially similar, but not identical, derivative works, which might raise a question of substantial similarity about which a side-by-side comparison might be probative. Instead, Plaintiffs are asserting Grande's customers infringed their copyrights by distributing exact copies of works covered by Plaintiffs' copyrights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But perhaps more importantly, these cases do not appear to stand for the proposition that a side-by-side comparison of the original and allegedly infringing works must be made in front of the jury, something that would prove beyond impractical in a case of this sort. Nothing in these cases state or imply a comparison must be made directly to a jury. Instead, there simply must be evidence, beyond mere oral testimony, resulting from such a comparison that would permit a layman to view the two works as substantially similar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridgmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346668\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/572/#p577\">\n    325 F.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he law of this circuit prohibits finding copyright infringement without a side-by-side comparison of the works.\");\n   <em>\n    Creations Unlimited, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854722\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/814/#p816\">\n    112 F.3d at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To determine whether an instance of copying is\n   <em>\n    legally actionable\n   </em>\n   , a side-by-side comparison must be made between the original and the copy to determine whether a layman\n   would view the two works as \"substantially similar.' \")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs' evidence of substantial similarity comes in the form of \"audio fingerprinting\" provided by a company called Audible Magic and a similar matching process performed by Rightscorp.

(Dkt. # 140 at 12.) However, for the reasons previously stated, the Court concludes a theory of direct liability properly applies to Grande's customers, either through making infringing materials available, or through actual dissemination of infringing materials. Therefore, by providing the services permitting their customers' alleged direct infringement, Grande is potentially liable as a secondary infringer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   iv.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of Direct Infringement with Respect to Each Asserted Copyright\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Grande argues that Plaintiffs cannot show direct infringement with respect to each asserted copyright. (Dkt. # 140 at 13.) However, as previously discussed, the court concludes the Rightcorp notices and analysis and the Audible Magic analysis constitute sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact to survive summary judgment. The Rightscorp system receives a list of copyrighted works, obtains infringing files allegedly matching those works, forensically scrubs these torrent files to confirm a digital match, discards any non-matching allegedly infringing files, manually checks the match results, and then monitors BitTorrent Networks for infringement of these files. (Dkts. ## 173-78 at 19-33; 173-79 at 3.) Further, the Audible Magic digital fingerprinting technology \"scans the perceptual characteristics of a sound recording[, ...] compares the characteristics of the sound recording to the content that has been registered in Audible Magic's database[, and i]f the tool returns a 'match' condition, that indicates that the sound recording contains copyrighted content that has been registered with Audible Magic.\" (Dkt. # 172-12, Ex. L at 3.) Plaintiffs have also provided evidence that they \"ran the mp3 audio files RIAA received from Rightscorp through Audible Magic[,\n   and] Audible Magic returned a \"match\" condition for ... the works ... the Plaintiffs are suing over (the \"works in suit\"), attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiffs' Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (attaching as an exhibit \"a chart setting forth each work in suit listed in Exhibit A to the Complaint, along with the corresponding .mp3 audio files that Rightscorp downloaded and the \"match\" output files from Audible Magic.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For these reasons, Grande is entitled to summary judgment as to direct infringement by Grande's customers of Plaintiffs' rights to reproduction and public performance. But there remain genuine issues of material fact as to direct infringement by Grande's Customers of Plaintiffs' distribution right related to all of the asserted copyrights. Summary judgment on this issue is therefore inappropriate and denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Contributory Infringement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   After the Supreme Court's decision is\n   <em>\n    MGM\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Studios Inc. v.

Grande argues it is entitled to summary judgment on this issue because: (1) there is no evidence it induced the direct infringement committed by its customers; (2) there is no recognized independent contributory liability theory of \"material contribution\"; (3) that even if there is, there is no evidence Grande's conduct materially contributed to direct infringement; and (4) there is no evidence Grande had actual knowledge of direct infringement by its customers. (Dkt. # 140 at 11-20.) However, for the following reasons, the Court disagrees with Grande's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Within the general rule of contributory liability announced by\n   <em>\n    Grokster\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has identified two categories of contributory liability: \"actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts ... or ... distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of 'substantial' or 'commercially significant' noninfringing uses.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n    545 U.S. at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsberg, J., concurring). It is beyond dispute that the provision of internet services to customers is capable of substantial and commercially significant noninfringing uses. Contributory liability against Grande must therefore be predicated on \"actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In expositing these principles of contributory liability, the\n   <em>\n    Grokster\n   </em>\n   Court expressly relied on those \"doctrines of secondary liability [that] emerged from common law principles and are well established at law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n    at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The black letter expression of such contributory liability in the common law, directly cited by the\n   <em>\n    Grokster\n   </em>\n   Court in regard to this point, is that \"one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another, may be held liable as a 'contributory' infringer.\"\n   <em>\n    Gershwin Pub.

Federal courts are generally in accord on this conclusion that contributory liability for copyright infringement can be premised on material contribution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v.

Finally, it is beyond debate that Grande's continuing provision of internet services to customers who engage in repeated copyright infringement substantially facilitates access to and the distribution of infringing materials.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1171\">\n    508 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Distilling these principles into a rule of liability, service providers like Grande \"can be held contributorily liable if [they] ha[ve]\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   infringing material is available using its system, and can take simple measures to prevent further damages to copyrighted works, yet continue[ ] to provide access to infringing works.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1171\">\n    at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Turning to the summary judgment evidence, it is clear that Grande has at least one simple measure at its disposal-terminating the internet services of repeat infringers-to prevent further damages to copyrighted works. It is also clear that for the period in question, 2011 through 2016, Grande continued to provide access to the infringing works by continuing to provide internet service to such customers. (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex. G at 6.) The question therefore is whether Grande had actual knowledge of specific infringement on the part of specific customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court concludes that the summary judgment evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on that question. Between 2011 and 2016, Grande received over a million copyright infringement notices, it was tracking over 9,000 customers on its DMCA \"Excessive Violations Report\" by late 2016, and it specifically tracked users by the number of notices it received about them. (Dkts. ## 127-9, Ex. I at 5; 127-3, Ex. C at 9.) Further, in internal emails, Grande employees recognized that \"we have users who are racking up DMCA take down requests\" and that \"some customers ... are up to their 54th notice\" (Dkt. # 127-22, Ex D).

Among other facts, Plaintiffs pleaded that their claims were: (1) based on notices Grande received from Rightscorp; (2) Grande had been informed of more than one million infringements; and (3) Grande ignored the infringement notices and refused to take action-including termination of service-against users who repeated infringed Plaintiffs copyrights. (Dkt. # 1 at 11-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The summary judgment evidence indicates that Grande received 1.2 million notices of infringement, including from Rightscorp, between 2011 and 2016 (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex. G at 10) and that Grande refused to terminate any subscribers between October 2010 and May 2017 (Dkt. # 127-7, Ex. G at 6). Since Grande was aware of when it received such a volume of notices, and over what time period it failed or refused to terminate any subscribers or take any action based on such notices, Plaintiffs' pleading of such facts are sufficient to put Grande on notice that Plaintiffs were asserting claims based on conduct dating back to 2010 and thus that Plaintiffs' might assert that the discovery rule applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TIG Ins.

(Dkt. # 136 at 16.) In response, Grande presented evidence that Rightscorp marketed its services to Plaintiff Sony in 2012 and that Plaintiff UMG had meetings related to Rightscorp in late 2011. (Dkts. ## 201-5, 201-4.) However, the witness testimony on this issue is vague and does not indicate conclusively that Plaintiffs' were made aware of infringement on Grande's network through these meetings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736897\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/351/#p357\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) This evidence also says nothing about Plaintiffs' knowledge of Grande's policy of refusal to take action in the face of such infringement by its customers, which is central to Plaintiffs' contributory liability theory against Grande. The evidence before the Court thus raises a genuine issue of material fact as to when Plaintiffs became aware, or through reasonable diligence could have become aware, of a cause of action against Grande for contributory liability. Therefore, Grande is not entitled to summary\n   judgment on the issue of the application of the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides in the alternative-as damages for copyright infringement-either the copyright owner's actual damages and disgorgement of profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement, or statutory damages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (c).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. ## 173-74, 173-81.) The Bardwell report applies probability analysis to the infringement data collected by Rightscorp to determine the probability that sequential infringements-including of the copyrights asserted in this case-are attributable to individual Grande subscribers. (Dkt. # 173-81 at 6.) The Lehr report estimates Grande's average monthly gross margin per customer, for all services a customer purchases from Grande, which can include voice and television services, in addition to high-speed internet. (Dkt. # 173-74 at 13-15.) The Lehr report also estimates the average tenure for a Grande subscriber. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Taking these two numbers together, and after accounting for net present value, the Lehr report arrives at an estimated lifetime net present value to Grande per subscriber. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) The report also derives an alternative net present value amount per customer based on the price paid by TPG Capital to acquire Grande in 2017, and what it implies about the expected value per customer TPG had formed in paying that price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   The Court concludes this evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact about Grande's revenues reasonably related to infringing customers to defeat summary judgment on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Copyright Ownership\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In order to prove copyright infringement, one of the things a plaintiff must prove is ownership of the asserted copyright.\n   <em>\n    BWP Media USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277372\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/436/#p439\">\n    852 F.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs responded with declarations from executives employed by each Plaintiff, with voluminous attachments, that they claim proves their ownership of these 361 copyrights.

Second, Grande has presented no evidence that Rightscorp destroyed these \"originals\" at the behest of Plaintiff.

Instead, the defendant's \"only action was his failure to secure, police and protect the connection.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518297\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/1142/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Further, the evidence in Cobbler Nevada indicated that after the defendant learned of the infringement, he and his staff attempted to identify the infringer and instructed everyone living in home to stop infringing.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518297\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/1142/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1145 n.1.

In this case in contrast, the allegation is that Grande took affirmative steps to foster infringement by continuing to provide internet service to specific customers about whom it had actual knowledge of repeated infringement. This case, therefore, fits more appropriately into a corollary principle announced in\n    <em>\n     Grokster\n    </em>\n    , that \"where evidence goes beyond ... the knowledge that [a product or service] may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement,\" liability may attach.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n     at 935\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210147\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/913/#p930\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Willful blindness can also satisfy the requirement of actual knowledge.\n    <em>\n     Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.

While the calculations in the Lehr report are not limited to the specific customers who allegedly infringed the copyrights asserted in this case, requiring such an exacting and specified showing would go far beyond the requirement of merely showing a \"reasonable relationship.\" The average value Grande receives from any given customer is certainly reasonably related to the value Grande received from a specific infringing customer. Grande receives more value from some customers and less value from others, and this includes infringing customers. Without some showing that infringing customers are somehow different or unique in their purchase patterns from noninfringing customers, an average value for all customers is certainly sufficient to reasonably demonstrate the average value received by Grande from infringing customers. Further, the argument that Dr. Lehr's calculations assume that every customer accused of infringement would have otherwise never become a customer in the first place misstates the question. Whether they would or would not have become a customer is beside the point. The fact is that they did become customers, and Grande received revenues from their being and continuing to be customers. Finally, that the lifetime value includes revenues from unrelated services like phones and cable TV is similarly beside the point. The fact is that Grande received that revenue from those allegedly infringing customers. That revenue would therefore be reasonably related to Grande's asserted contributory liability in not terminating the service of such customers. If Grande had terminated the internet service of those customers, it is reasonable to conclude they would have found a new service provider, for all services purchased from Grande, and Grande would have lost all revenues from such customers, including those not directly derived from the provision of internet services.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
