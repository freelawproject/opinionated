In the absence of such a filing, this Court entered an order on November 23, 2018, conditionally dismissing the case for failure to prosecute unless plaintiff showed good cause within 28 days of that order why the action should be reopened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 18, 2018, rather than demonstrating why the case should be reopened, plaintiff filed an amended complaint that simply repeated most of the allegations of the original dismissed complaint. Plaintiff did, however, add a new claim against defendants Universal Wilde, Jennifer McAskill and Shawn Gill for interference with a federal investigation but cited no federal law in support of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 2, 2019, this Court entered an order allowing defendants' motion to strike the amended complaint (Docket No. 75) because 1) plaintiff failed to comply with the Court Order entered November 23, 2018, and 2) the amended complaint simply repeated the substantive allegations of the original complaint. This Court did, however, permit plaintiff to file a second amended complaint with respect to his new claim of interference with a federal investigation against defendants Universal Wilde, Jennifer McAskill and Shawn Green by February 1, 2019. The Court specifically directed plaintiff to identify the federal statute under which that claim is being brought or else the case would be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 1, 2019, plaintiff filed his second amended complaint identifying the following federal statutes: 1) Section 5 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\"OSHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20654\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 2)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 3)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 4) \"U.S. Code S 670\"; 5)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and 6)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He also asserts a claim for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 11, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file an addendum to the amended complaint (Docket No. 77) in order to add a count under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202340\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A few days later, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's second amended complaint (Docket No. 78) in response to which plaintiff filed a \"motion to deny dismissal against defendants\" (Docket No. 84). The Court will treat that pleading as plaintiff's opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court has already held that OSHA does not provide a private cause of action and thus plaintiff has not stated a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20654\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, that claim will also be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, to the extent that plaintiff now asserts a claim for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Court lacks jurisdiction over that claim. That claim, which sounds in tort, does not involve a federal question nor has plaintiff shown that there is complete diversity of citizenship among the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casas Office Machs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mita Copystar Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416428\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/668/#p673\">\n    42 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (1st Cir. 1994). In fact, he alleges in his second amended complaint that Universal Wilde is incorporated and located in Massachusetts and presumably both Jennifer McAskill and Shawn Gill are also residents of Massachusetts.
