INTRODUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Fredrick R. Honig bought land on Maui zoned for agricultural use and leased that land to Plaintiff Spirit of Aloha Temple, which, among other things, conducted a commercial wedding operation on the agricultural land until the County of Maui told it to stop. Thereafter, Plaintiffs applied for a Special Use Permit to build a church and hold religious events, including weddings, on the agriculture land, uses not allowed without a Special Use Permit. After the requested Special Use Permit was denied, Plaintiffs filed this action, asserting federal and state claims against the Maui Planning Commission and the County of Maui.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 27, 2016, this court dismissed the Planning Commission as a party and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Count X, which asked this court to resolve an appeal from the Planning Commission's denial of the Special Use Permit. This court stayed the remaining claims as a matter of\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention, allowing Plaintiffs to appeal the denial of the Special Use Permit through the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the state court, Plaintiffs reserved their right to have their federal claims decided by this court, informing the state trial court that the only claim before the state court involved the appeal of the Planning Commission's decision. On November 17, 2016, the state trial court affirmed the Planning Commission's decision. No further appeal was filed. This court subsequently dissolved the stay so that the remaining claims could be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State of Hawaii, which intervened in this action, now moves for summary judgment, arguing that res judicata bars the prior restraint claim asserted in Count V and that, even if res judicata does not apply, there was no impermissible prior restraint as a matter of law. Plaintiffs filed a counter motion for summary judgment with respect to the prior restraint claim. This court rules that res judicata does not bar the prior restraint claim and turns to the merits of that claim, granting the State of Hawaii's motion and the County of Maui's Joinder therein with respect to the merits of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The state also seeks partial summary judgment with respect to Counts I, II, IV, VI, VII, VIII, and IX (no Count III is asserted in the Complaint), arguing that Plaintiffs are only asserting as applied challenges in those counts, not facial challenges. Plaintiffs do not oppose this part of the motion, and this court therefore rules that only as applied challenges are pled in those counts. The court leaves the merits of those challenges for later proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The factual background for this case was set forth in this court's Order Denying Motions for Summary Judgment of July 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526362\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/1051/\">\n    322 F.

Honig and Spirit of Aloha Temple practice \"Integral Yoga.\" For purposes of these motions, no party contests the validity of Honig's religion or the sincerity of his beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 12, 2007, Spirit of Aloha Temple, through Honig, applied for a Special Use Permit for the property to be used for a \"Church, church operated bed and breakfast establishment, weddings, special events, day seminars, and helicopter landing pad.\" ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2592. On June 30, 2008, Spirit of Aloha Temple amended the Special Use Permit application to define Spirit of Aloha Temple's activities as including \"a weekly service, classes, special events, day programs and weddings.\" ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2593.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 30, 2010, the Planning Commission for the County of Maui held a hearing on the Special Use Permit application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order of Maui Planning Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-3, PageID # 2583.

The County of Maui ordered Honig to cease and desist the conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 183-8, PageID #s 2877-78.

The commission finds that granting the Application would adversely affect the health and safety of residents who use the roadway, including endangering human life. The Commission finds that the health and safety of the residents' and public's use of Haumana Road is a compelling government interest and that there is no less restrictive means of ensuring the public's safety while granting the uses requested in the Application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ECF No. 185-9, PageID # 3288-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Maui Planning Commission noted that section 205-6 of Hawaii Revised Statutes allows certain \"unusual and reasonable uses\" within agricultural and rural\n   districts, in addition to uses for which the property is classified.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526362\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/1051/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3289. The Maui Planning Commission stated that, to determine whether a proposed use is an \"unusual and reasonable use,\" section 15-15-95 of Hawaii Administrative Rules sets forth \"guidelines\" for the granting of an exception to agricultural restrictions. It was the Maui Planning Commission's understanding that a Special Use Permit application could be denied if any of those \"guidelines\" was not satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Depo. of William Spence at 31 (Feb. 5, 2018), ECF No. 215-18, PageID # 4649.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In allowing \"[c]ertain 'unusual and reasonable' uses within agricultural ... districts other than those for which the district is classified ...,\"\n   <em>\n    http://luc.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LUC-Admin-Rules_Chapter15-15_2013.pdf\n   </em>\n   (Nov. 2, 2013), section 15-15-95(c) provides five \"guidelines\" for determining uses that \"may\" be permitted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) The use shall not be contrary to the objectives sought to be accomplished by chapters 205 and 205A, HRS, and the rules of the commission;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) The proposed use would not adversely affect surrounding property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) The proposed use would not unreasonably burden public agencies to provide roads and streets, sewers, water drainage and school improvements, and police and fire protection;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) Unusual conditions, trends, and needs have arisen since the district boundaries and rules were established; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (5) The land upon which the proposed use is sought is unsuited for the uses permitted within the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747582\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1231/#p1240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These \"guidelines\" are at the heart of the parties' dispute in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Commission concluded that subsections 15-15-95(c)(2) and (3) were not satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to subsection 15-15-95(c)(2), the Commission concluded that the proposed uses \"would adversely affect the surrounding properties\" given concerns about the safety of Haumana Road.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526362\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/1051/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3290.

As discussed in the following pages, the State of Hawaii's motion with respect to Count V and the County of Maui's joinder therein are granted, and Plaintiffs' counter motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Because Plaintiffs Reserved Their Right to Have This Court Adjudicate The Prior Restraint Claim Asserted in Count V, the State of Hawaii's Res Judicata Argument is Unpersuasive.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The State of Hawaii seeks summary judgment with respect to the prior restraint claim asserted in Count V, arguing that the state court judgment with respect to the agency appeal should have res judicata effect and thus bars Count V. This court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the outset, this court notes that it stayed this case pending the state court's determination of Count X, in which Plaintiffs challenged the Planning Commission's denial of the permit application. This court did not direct Plaintiffs to seek a state court determination of any other count pled in this case, and Plaintiffs filed an administrative appeal in state court limited to the matters raised in Count X.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 215-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nor does the doctrine of res judicata operate to bar litigation of counts other than Count X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The res judicata doctrine precludes parties or their privies from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in an earlier action in which there is a final judgment on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Here, while the state court has issued a final judgment with respect to the agency appeal, that final judgment has no res judicata effect with respect to the federal claims originally asserted in this court. The federal claims were stayed pursuant to this court's exercise of\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention, and Plaintiffs specifically told the state court they were reserving those federal claims for this court to adjudicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that the \"right of a party plaintiff to choose a Federal court where there is a choice cannot be properly denied.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720386\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/411/\">\n    375 U.S. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720386\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/411/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720386\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/411/\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964) (quotation marks and citation omitted).

The court notes that Plaintiffs are not challenging subsection 15-15-95(c)(5) in this action. See ECF No. 225, PageID #s 4876-77 (indicating that Plaintiffs are only challenging subsections 15-15-95(c)(1) through (4)). This court notes that the Planning Commission made no findings with respect to subsections (1) and (4) and does not appear to have considered them in denying Plaintiff the requested permit. Having suffered no injury tied to subsections (1) and (4), Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to challenge those subsections. More fundamentally, Plaintiffs appear to have misapplied the very concept of a facial challenge in the context of a challenge to all or any part of section 15-15-95(c). As explained in the following paragraphs, section 15-15-95(c), by its terms, speaks to the Planning Commission's discretion in granting a Special Use Permit, which is not the act Plaintiffs complain about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Section 15-15-95(c)'s Statement of When the Maui Planning Commission \"May\" Grant a Special Use Permit Does Not Vest the Commission With Unbridled Discretion to Deny a Permit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Section 15-15-95(c) provides, \"Certain 'unusual and reasonable' uses within agricultural and rural districts other than those for which the district is classified may be permitted.\" (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue that the word \"may\" impermissibly vests the Maui Planning Commission with unbridled discretion to decline\n   to issue a Special Use Permit. This purported facial challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On its face, section 15-15-95(c) speaks to the Planning Commission's ability to deviate from the overarching restriction on nonagricultural uses in an agricultural district. Any discretion articulated by section 15-15-95(c) is thus the discretion to grant an exception to or variance from the \"default\" prohibition on nonagricultural issues. If this discretion could be viewed as unbridled, as Plaintiffs allege, any facial challenge should come in the context of the\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   of a variance. Thus, for example, a person purporting to be aggrieved by the granting of a Special Use Permit to a neighboring business might bring a facial challenge to section 15-15-95(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs instead bring a purported facial challenge to section 15-15-95(c) in the context of the\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of a permit application.

Plaintiffs have not claimed that nonsatisfaction of more than one guideline was required to deny a permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Maui Planning Commission's belief that section 15-15-95(c) was instructive as to the\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of a permit actually involves an extrapolation from the language of section 15-15-95(c). Section 15-15-95(c) speaks to guidelines for the\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   of a Special Use Permit. Plaintiffs appear to agree with this extrapolation. In any event, the court sees no reason to conclude that the invalidation of one of the \"guidelines\" would necessarily invalidate the whole permitting scheme. As the Ninth Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    City of Moreno\n   </em>\n   , \"[g]enerally, only that part of an ordinance that is constitutionally infirm will be invalidated, leaving the rest intact.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1056\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/814/#p817\">\n    103 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   821 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Oakland\n   </em>\n   , 506 F.3d at 802 (\"we are obligated to interpret a statute, if it is fairly possible, in a manner that renders it constitutionally valid\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The guideline in subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) for determining whether a Special Use Permit should be granted for an \"unusual and reasonable\" use points to consideration of the proposed use as \"not unreasonably burden[ing] public agencies to provide roads and streets, sewers, water drainage and school improvements, and police and fire protection.\" The required examination of the burden on agencies with respect to \"roads and streets, sewers, water drainage and school improvements, and police and fire protection\" provides a sufficiently specific, narrow, objective, and definite standard for the Maui Planning Commission to consider. Comparing this standard to those examined in\n   <em>\n    City of Moreno\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    G.K. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , this court concludes that subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) is much more like the provision in\n   <em>\n    G.K. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , which found no First Amendment violation with respect to a sign ordinance that regulated the type, size, and design of signs--a limited and objective set of criteria going to \"form, proportion, scale, color, materials, surface treatment, overall sign size and the size and style of lettering.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939890\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/1064/#p1082\">\n    436 F.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In trying to frame its challenge as a facial one, Plaintiffs seek to steer this court away from considering the factual context of this case. The record indicates that the road leading to Plaintiffs' property, Haumana Road, is so narrow in many spots that two cars cannot pass each other unless one pulls off the road. If cars park on the side of the road, emergency vehicles cannot get through. The Maui Police Department recommended that the road be widened if Plaintiffs were going to be allowed to conduct religious activities, including wedding ceremonies, at their property, given the anticipated increase in traffic on the road. With the road as is,\n   Plaintiffs appear to be in a position similar to that of Get Outdoors II, whose proposed billboards exceeded the allowable number, height, and size. If Plaintiffs' proposed use exceeds the allowable use of the road, that may well place an unreasonable burden on the County of Maui.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Subsection 15-15-95(c)(3)'s requirement that the Maui Planning Commission examine whether an \"unreasonable burden\" would be placed on agencies to provide \"roads and streets, sewers, water drainage and school improvements, and police and fire protection\" is a limit on the Maui Planning Commission's discretion. In\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that the permissive nature of an ordinance furthered, rather than constricted, free speech.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/\">\n    534 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsection 15-15-95(c)(3)'s use of the word \"unreasonably\" similarly furthers free speech. Had subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) only required the Maui Planning Commission to examine whether any burden at all was placed on agencies providing \"roads and streets, sewers, water drainage and school improvements, and police and fire protection,\" the Maui Planning Commission could have ruled on a Special Use Permit application based on even a miniscule burden on those agencies. This would have removed the Maui Planning Commission's discretion to grant an application. As written, subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) allows the granting of a permit when the burden on the items is not \"unreasonable.\" This standard provides the Maui Planning Commission with some, but not unbridled, discretion to grant a permit, thus furthering free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    Trewhella v.

Wis. 2003), is instructive on this point.\n   <em>\n    Trewhella\n   </em>\n   examined a challenge to supposedly \"unfettered power to deny a permit\" unless the permit granter found that \"The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays in route.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344621\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/249/1057/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344621\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/249/1057/\">\n    at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trewhella argued that \"delays in route\" gave the permit granters unbridled discretion to grant or deny a permit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344621\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/249/1057/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court disagreed, ruling that \"delays in route\" was modified by the word \"unreasonable,\" which limited the permit granter's discretion. As in\n   <em>\n    Trewhella\n   </em>\n   , the use of \"unreasonable\" in subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) places a limit on the Maui Planning Commission's exercise of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Section 15-15-95(c)(3)'s \"unreasonable burden\" language is distinguishable from the \"without unreasonable delay\" language invalidated in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Frandsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747582\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1231/#p1240\">\n    212 F.3d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (11th Cir. 2000). In\n   <em>\n    Frandsen\n   </em>\n   , a superintendent was required to issue a permit \"without unreasonable delay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747582\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1231/#p1240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eleventh Circuit stated that \"without unreasonable delay\" did not put a real time limit on the decision maker, noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   A park superintendent could receive a permit request well in advance of a planned political demonstration and then fail to act on the permit request until after the date of the demonstration, deciding on his own that he was acting \"without unreasonable delay.\" A park superintendent who does not agree with the political message to be espoused could allow the permit request to sit on his desk for an indefinite period of time--resulting in speech being silenced by inaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747582\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1231/#p1240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Subsection 15-15-95(c)(3)'s \"unreasonable burden\" language does not allow the same potential abuse by the Maui Planning Commission. The language is more akin to that in\n   <em>\n    Trewhella\n   </em>\n   in that it actually places a limit on the Planning Commission's exercise of discretion and furthers free speech by allowing the issuance of a Special Use Permit when it would not \"unreasonably\" burden certain objective items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   At the hearing on the motions, Plaintiffs argued that the Maui Planning Commission did not actually find an \"unreasonable burden\" in this case. This argument fails for a number of reasons. To the extent Plaintiffs bring a facial challenge to the provision, this court does not examine whether the ordinance, as applied, passes constitutional muster. More importantly, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that the Maui Planning Commission's ruling did not satisfy the requirements of the provision, that argument should have been made to the Hawaii Circuit Court in Plaintiffs' agency appeal. In determining that the Maui Planning Commission properly denied the requested Special Use Permit, the Hawaii Circuit Court necessarily decided that the regulatory requirements for denying the permit had been satisfied. This court does not sit in review of a state court determination that there was sufficient evidence in the record before the Maui Planning Commission supporting its determination with respect to the \"unreasonable burden\" on agencies providing \"roads and streets, sewers, water drainage and school improvements, and police and fire protection.\" Plaintiffs may not relitigate here the matter of whether there were sufficient facts to support \"unreasonable burden\" requirement of subsection 15-15-95(c)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p94\">\n    449 U.S. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p94\">\n    101 S.Ct. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (res judicata doctrine precludes parties or their privies from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in an earlier action in which there is a final judgment on the merits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    6. If a Permit Denial Under Subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) is Not an Unconstitutional Prior Restraint, Plaintiffs Were Not Constitutionally Entitled to a Permit Even if Subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) is Defective.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) is facially invalid. That provision includes a guideline for granting a Special Use Permit going to whether the proposed use would not adversely affect surrounding property. Assuming that Plaintiffs may bring a facial challenge to this guideline notwithstanding its express focus on guidelines for the\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   of a Special Use Permit, this court recognizes that this subsection presents a closer call than subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) as to whether the challenged language vests the Maui Planning Commission with unbridled discretion. But even if subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) does run afoul of the First Amendment (something this court is expressly not ruling on), that would not give Plaintiffs an entitlement to receive the requested permit because subsection 15-15-95(c)(3) would still present an impediment to such a grant.\n   <em>\n    Get Outdoors II\n   </em>\n   is instructive here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <em>\n    Get Outdoors II\n   </em>\n   noted that \"an unfavorable decision on the merits of one claim may well defeat standing on another claim if it defeats the plaintiff's ability to seek redress.\" 506 F.3d at 893. In this case, assuming the Special Use Permit application could have been denied based on any one of the guidelines in section 15-15-95(c), a judicial invalidation of subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) would not address the constitutionality of any other subsection. Given that circumstance, this court sees no need to address the constitutionality of subsection 15-15-95(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   This court has carefully examined the decision of the Maui Planning Commission and the appeal of its decision. The Maui Planning Commission's Conclusions of Law state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   The Commission found that granting the uses would increase traffic and burden public agencies providing roads and streets, police, and fire protection, in\n   conflict with 15-15-95(3), HAR,\n   <strong>\n    and gave the following reasons for a denial of the Application on that basis\n   </strong>\n   : significant concerns about the narrowness of Haumana Road and vehicle and pedestrian safety both of potential visitors to the Property and property owners along Haumana Road and the fact that the Property is at the terminus of Haumana Road and therefore traffic to the Property would negatively impact resident's safety and use of Haumana Road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   ECF No. 185-9, PageID # 3290 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   In concluding that the proposed uses would adversely affect surrounding properties in conflict with subsection 15-15-95(c)(2), the Commission appears to have been focused on how the proposed uses would increase traffic and pose a safety hazard without road mitigation. These concerns caused the Commission to determine that the proposed uses would burden public agencies providing roads and streets, police, and fire protection in conflict with subsection 15-15-95(c)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 185-9, PageID # 3290. The Commission concluded that the proposed uses \"did not constitute an 'unusual and reasonable' use in the Agricultural district.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is not at all clear that the Commission's reliance on subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) was anything more than a reiteration of its concerns under subsection 15-15-95(c)(3). That is, this court cannot conclude from the record that subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) was a necessary component of the denial such that, without subsection 15-15-95(c)(2), the Commission would have granted the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In any event, as\n   <em>\n    Get Outdoors II\n   </em>\n   notes, to comport with the required \"constitutional standing\" principles, Plaintiffs must have had a possibility of getting a permit for the asking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   506 F.3d at 895. If Plaintiffs could be denied a permit under subsection 15-15-95(c)(3), the court questions their standing to challenge subsection 15-15-95(c)(2), as any ruling favorable to them on subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) would not redress any injury they suffered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Get Outdoors II\n   </em>\n   , 506 F.3d at 895 (discussing the need for a plaintiff to have been eligible to get a permit \"for the asking\" to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional provision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Brockett v.

This court is performing the corollary task of determining whether provisions are valid. The parties have not explained why, if even one of the provisions relied on by the Commission is valid, this court must analyze whether other provisions are unconstitutional even if invalidation of those other provisions would not entitle Plaintiffs to the requested permit. That is, absent evidence that the Commission deemed subsection 15-15-95(c)(2) as necessary to its denial (as opposed to, for example, just an additional ground for reiterating concerns raised under subsection 15-15-95(c)(3)), this court does not rule on the purported facial challenge to subsection 15-15-95(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs Do Not Oppose the State of Hawaii's Motion to the Extent it Argues that the Remaining Claims are Factual, Rather than Facial, Challenges.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The State of Hawaii seeks summary judgment with respect to whether the remaining\n   counts assert factual challenges for which the State of Hawaii need not participate in this lawsuit. Plaintiffs do not oppose this part of the motion. Accordingly, the court rules that the remaining counts assert only factual challenges. Whether the State of Hawaii participates further involves the scope of its intervention. The State may refrain from participating if it so chooses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the court grants the State of Hawaii's motion for summary judgment and the County of Maui's joinder therein and denies Plaintiffs' counter motion for summary judgment. That is, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to the prior restraint claim asserted in Count V. With respect to the remaining counts, only factual challenges remain. The State of Hawaii is, of course, free to limit its intervention to defending against facial challenges only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    The Commission did not specifically discuss subsection 15-15-95(c)(1)--whether the use was contrary to the objectives sought to be accomplished by chapters 205 and 205A of Hawaii Revised Statutes and the rules of the Land Use Commission. It noted that it had received no evidence with respect to subsection 15-15-95(c)(4)--whether there were unusual conditions, trends, and needs that had arisen since the State Land Use district boundaries and rules were established. It also determined that subsection 15-15-95(c)(5) supported the issuance of the permit in that \"the land which the proposed use is sought is suitable for the uses allowed in the Agricultural District.\" ECF No. 185-9, PageID # 3291.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Plaintiffs also have pled in the present case state constitutional claims.
