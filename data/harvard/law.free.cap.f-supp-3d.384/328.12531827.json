VITALIANO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Vivienne Culwick, as administratrix of the estate of Steven Eliot Wood\n   (the \"Estate\"), commenced this action on October 13, 2015. ( Compl., ECF No. 1 ). After twice amending it, the complaint presents claims for breach of contract, conversion, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment arising from the distribution of the proceeds of the decedent's annuity fund and pension plan. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-79, ECF No. 67 ). Counterposed are counterclaims asserted by defendant Andrae E. Wood, for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference with contract. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 99-129, ECF No. 68 ). The parties have cross-moved for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, the motions are granted in part and denied in part, and the matter is respectfully referred to Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold for a report and recommendation on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Divorce\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Steven Eliot Wood married Andrae E. Wood on September 24, 1984. (Def.'s Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 6, ECF No. 94-21 (\"Def.'s 56.1\") ). About 12 years later, in 1996, the decedent became romantically involved with Culwick. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Once Andrae Wood discovered the affair, her relationship with her husband became strained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). With his marriage disintegrating, the decedent and Culwick would begin living together full time in 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). By 2004, the decedent and Wood were completely separated, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16), and, in April 2006, Wood was granted a divorce, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about June 26, 2006, the Woods executed a property settlement agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Property Settlement Agreement, Decl. of Anthony J. Proscia, Ex. G, ECF No. 94-8 (\"Agreement\") ). This agreement was incorporated into the final judgment of divorce, entered on or about July 28, 2006. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 26). Three provisions of the property settlement agreement are relevant to this action. First, the agreement provides that \"nothing herein contained shall require either party to renounce or disclaim any gift, devise or bequest which he or she may be given by the other's Will, Trust, or other document.\" (Agreement \u00b6 B(2)). Second, it states, \"[T]he Wife agrees that the Husband shall otherwise retain all pensions and annuities acquired by him at any time, including during the term of the marriage.... The Wife waives any claims she might have in and to these benefits including the right to be named as a survivor beneficiary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D(3)). Finally, it provides that \"[e]xcept as herein otherwise provided, each party may dispose of his or her property in any way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B(3)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Pension &amp; Annuity Funds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The decedent's life work was as a stagehand, and he was a member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Local Union No. 1. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 40). As a union member, he received a variety of benefits, including an annuity fund and a pension plan, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43), governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1461 (\"ERISA\"). He had designated Andrae Wood as the primary beneficiary of the annuity and pension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 48). He also had designated his father as the contingent beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 49). Even after the divorce, the decedent did not change the primary beneficiary from Andrae Wood to anyone else. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59). Defendant contends that this was despite the fact that union members are frequently reminded to keep their benefit forms up to date and the forms are widely available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-58, 60-62). Culwick responds that these facts are immaterial and unsupported by documentary evidence. (Pl.'s\n   Rule 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6\u00b6 53-58, 60-62, ECF No. 94-36 (\"Pl.'s 56.1\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Steven Wood's Death\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about December 30, 2012, death would find Steven Wood. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 34). He died without a will, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35), and unmarried, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). He was survived by his father, the sole beneficiary of his estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). In mid-February 2013, Andrae Wood learned of her former husband's death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). She was contacted by someone from the annuity and pension fund, who advised her that she was designated as the primary beneficiary of the decedent's funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64). She completed the forms necessary to transfer the benefits to her name, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66), and began receiving benefits in March 2013, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The decedent's father and the Estate also submitted claims to the fund. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). The fund denied these claims because Steven Wood had designated Andrae Wood as the primary beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69). Despite receiving several demand letters, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-71), Andrae Wood did not relinquish the benefits to the decedent's father or the Estate, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72). Later came a change in the\n   <em>\n    dramatis personae\n   </em>\n   . By a document executed on February 17, 2017, the decedent's father assigned to Culwick, as administratrix of the Estate, his claims against Andrae Wood arising out of her claim to the pension and annuity fund benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A district court must grant summary judgment to the movant if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

It is undisputed that the decedent's father was designated as the contingent beneficiary of the fund benefits. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 45, 49). As a result, had Andrae Wood waived her contractual entitlement to the benefits, as Culwick argues she was obliged to do, the benefits would have\n   passed to the decedent's father, rather than the Estate, upon his death. Defendant contends that the Estate has not suffered an injury-in-fact because, even if she did breach the property settlement agreement, it is the decedent's father, rather than the Estate, who would have been entitled to the pension benefits. Contract remedies are designed to place the contracting parties in the position they would have occupied had each party performed, and the Estate is now in that position. On defendant's account, it is the estate of the decedent's father that might present a justiciable claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Interpretation of the Third Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Kensinger v. URL Pharma, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3747072\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/131/\">\n    674 F.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2012) is the legal ground zero for much of what the parties dispute. In\n   <em>\n    Kensinger\n   </em>\n   , the proceeds of an ERISA-governed 401(k) plan were paid to the late member's designated beneficiary. However, as here, the designated beneficiary had divorced the decedent. The Third Circuit held that, although payment had already been made to the decedent's ex-wife, the decedent's estate had standing to seek recovery of the funds and to enforce a waiver of her right to payment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3747072\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/131/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3747072\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/131/\">\n    at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, as defendant correctly highlights,\n   <em>\n    Kensinger\n   </em>\n   is inapposite here. Specifically, the decedent in\n   <em>\n    Kensinger\n   </em>\n   had not designated a contingent beneficiary to receive survivor benefits from his 401(k) should his ex-wife predecease him. Therefore, no one stood between the ex-wife and the estate in the line of entitlements to the 401(k). Here, the decedent, at some point, had designated his father as a contingent beneficiary, and his father, or his father's estate, would be entitled to the benefits Andrae Wood received had she waived her entitlement to payment. Consequently,\n   <em>\n    Kensinger\n   </em>\n   does not, without more, establish the Estate's standing here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With no guidance to be found in ERISA-specific cases, ordinary Article III standing doctrine must be deemed controlling. The present case turns on the first prong of that standard: injury in fact. To that end, defendant appears to argue that the Estate has not suffered a concrete injury. She contends that, even if she breached the terms of the property settlement agreement, the Estate would lack standing unless the breach caused it to suffer a concrete harm. In Andrae Wood's account, the Estate has not suffered such harm because it was not deprived of any pension or annuity proceeds to which it was entitled.

He offered the insight that the Court's holding was limited primarily to the public rights context and that courts could find injury more liberally when plaintiffs assert longstanding private rights. Whereas courts \"have required a further showing of injury for violations of 'public rights,' \" they have historically \"possessed broad power to adjudicate suits involving the alleged violation of private rights, even when plaintiffs alleged only the violation of those rights and nothing more.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    at 1551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thomas, J., concurring).

As a result, \"[i]n a suit for the violation of a private right, courts [have] historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   injury merely from having his personal, legal rights invaded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20689\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, the Court must, as part of its jurisdictional analysis, determine precisely what rights were invaded and to whom those rights belonged. More pointedly, if the decedent or his Estate's rights were violated, then plaintiff has standing to sue, despite the designation of the decedent's father as the contingent beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In base form, Culwick's claims sound in contract, conversion, or unjust enrichment. It is undisputed that the decedent and defendant entered a contract settling their property rights upon divorce. As a contracting party, the decedent's legal rights were violated if Andrae Wood breached that contract. Although the contract may have incidentally benefited the decedent's father, given his status as a contingent beneficiary of the pension and annuity, contracting parties are entitled to the benefit of their bargain, and Andrae Wood's alleged breach was a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   invasion of the decedent's contractual rights directly relevant to her ability to claim under the pension and annuity. By way of illustration, if the decedent were still alive, he would unquestionably be able to enforce any contract with his ex-wife. The Estate simply stands in the decedent's shoes,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Barriger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5723913\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/699/612/#p620\">\n    699 F. Supp. 2d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and derivatively possesses the same right of enforcement. Unlike the\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   nature of the right at issue in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , contract rights are\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   , and their invasion creates standing to sue, as courts have recognized for generations. Consequently, to the extent plaintiff pursues contract claims, plaintiff has standing as administratrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Culwick's next claim is for conversion. She claims that defendant unlawfully converted the proceeds of the decedent's annuity fund. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-52). Had Andrae Wood disclaimed her interest in the annuity fund, however, the proceeds of the fund would have passed to the decedent's father or the father's\n   estate. The Estate was not deprived of any property interest. Culwick attempts to bootstrap standing, arguing that defendant's failure to waive her interest in the funds deprived the decedent's father of his right to the funds and, therefore, rendered the Estate the proper plaintiff. This argument is unpersuasive. If defendant deprived the decedent's father of his right to the funds, then the father would be the proper plaintiff here. Simply, there would be no need for the Estate to assert his rights for him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Analytically, a claim for conversion under New York law\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires that a defendant take property belonging to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Colavito v.

Yet, even on plaintiff's account, Andrae Wood took property belonging not to her or the Estate but rather to the decedent's father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Estate, therefore, lacks standing to bring an action for conversion in such circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Culwick brings a claim for unjust enrichment. As explained in Justice Thomas's\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   concurrence, courts have historically allowed unjust enrichment claims to proceed without a heightened\n   showing of concrete injury. Succinctly put, there was an agreement between the decedent and Andrae Wood. If she derived a benefit from the decedent's pension plan and annuity fund in contravention of that agreement, she violated the decedent's legal right to direct the proceeds of those funds, and the Court may presume injury in fact in assessing the availability of standing for an unjust enrichment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Probate Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant next argues that this Court lacks the power to adjudicate this case, since it falls within the probate exception to federal subject matter jurisdiction. This argument is without merit. The probate exception is extraordinarily narrow, and this controversy lies beyond its borders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 3610.

However, she cites no law in support of such an exception to the economic loss rule.

Here, there is no dispute as to whether the parties entered into a valid contract. Plaintiff contends that Wood breached the property settlement agreement by accepting the proceeds of the decedent's pension plan and annuity fund. Specifically, she argues that Wood breached the provision stating that \"the Wife agrees that the Husband shall otherwise retain all pensions and annuities acquired by him at any time, including during the term of the marriage.... The Wife waives any claims she might have in and to these benefits including the right to be named as a survivor beneficiary,\" (Agreement \u00b6 D(3)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Plan Documents Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To begin, it would appear helpful to consider what plaintiff emphatically does not argue: namely, plaintiff does not contend that the plan administrator should have paid the benefits to anyone other than Andrae Wood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the plan documents rule, an ERISA plan administrator must pay benefits to the person named on a beneficiary designation form or other documents and instruments governing the plan.\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , 555 U.S. at 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent further\n   <em>\n    inter vivos\n   </em>\n   action by the decedent, the property settlement agreement could not itself change the beneficiary of the pension and annuity, all of which is beside the point since what is at stake here is whether defendant was obliged to waive her entitlement to the benefits or to pay them over to another party upon receipt. Although the decedent's failure to update his beneficiary designation form following the divorce would be fatal to any claim against the plan administrator, it is not dispositive here because the instant action arises from a contractual arrangement between a plan participant and his ex-wife, rather than the terms of the ERISA plan or any controversy with the plan administrator. To the extent that Andrae Wood invokes the decedent's failure to update the plan documents, her argument misses the mark. Although this fact might be relevant extrinsic evidence of the property settlement agreement's meaning, the Court is able to interpret the agreement on its express terms and, therefore, need not, and\n   must not, look to extrinsic evidence of this stripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Revocation by Divorce\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Seeking another shield, Andrae Wood contends that she is not liable because ERISA preempts New York's revocation-by-divorce statute. The state statute provides that divorce revokes any \"revocable ... disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to, or for the benefit of, the former spouse, including ... beneficiary designation ... in a pension or retirement benefits plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20E.P.T.L.%20%C2%A7%205-1.4\">\n    N.Y. E.P.T.L. \u00a7 5-1.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). It is a red herring, however, because Culwick's claim is for breach of the property settlement agreement. It was not brought pursuant to the revocation-by-divorce statute, given Culwick's contention that Wood\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   waived her rights on the pension plan and annuity fund. That is, Culwick argues that Wood's rights were waived by contract, not by operation of statute. Since this last grasp shield does not withstand the claim, it is now appropriate to turn to the text of the agreement, to construe it, and to determine whether Culwick can establish its breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Contractual Text\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The first relevant provision of the agreement states that \"the Husband shall otherwise retain all pensions and annuities acquired by him at any time, including during the time of the marriage.\" (Agreement \u00b6 D(3)). This language does not bolster Culwick's cause. First, the verb \"retain\" suggests a preservation of the status quo. Pursuant to the agreement, the husband could keep what he had and was not obliged to cede any pensions or annuities to his former wife. However, the status quo included her designation as a beneficiary, and the language does not indicate that she was required to divest any rights in such pensions or annuities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, ownership or control of the pension and annuity does not entail a particular designation of a beneficiary. Although the decedent retained his pension and annuity, such retention meant that he had the right to designate whomever he wished as the beneficiary. It would be consistent with this provision for the decedent to designate his ex-wife as the beneficiary, which means that the provision did not automatically revoke such a designation. The best reading of this provision is that the husband was to have full control of the pension and annuity, and to receive benefits during his lifetime. He was also to retain authority to select the beneficiary. None of this entails that defendant's designation was revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The next relevant provision indicates that \"[t]he Wife waives any claims she might have in and to these benefits including the right to be named as a survivor beneficiary.\" (Agreement \u00b6 D(3)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is decisive. Claiming benefits as a designated survivor beneficiary is unquestionably a claim to the pension and annuity benefits. Resultingly, defendant clearly breached the contract by claiming the benefits for herself. The Court is mindful that the property settlement was rather poorly drafted, notwithstanding that the parties were represented by counsel, (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 20). In particular, by including the phrase \"including the\n   <em>\n    right to be named\n   </em>\n   as a survivor beneficiary,\" (Agreement \u00b6 D(3) (emphasis added)), the agreement invited the interpretation that Andrae Wood\n   merely gave up the ability to compel the decedent to name her as a beneficiary and did not give up her existing designation as a beneficiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, this interpretation would be difficult to square with the preceding phrase, in which she \"waive[d] any claims she might have in and to [the pension and annuity],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). The latter phrase is best understood as clarifying that her waiver extended to the explicit survivor benefits offered by the decedent's annuity and pension. Under ERISA, the spouse of a participant in any covered plan is entitled to a statutory spousal share on the participant's death. By including a reference to defendant's explicit designation as a survivor beneficiary, the agreement clarified that it covered not only this statutory spousal share but also the explicit designation as a survivor beneficiary. Therefore, Andrae Wood breached the agreement by staking a claim to the benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Naturally, the touchstone of contract interpretation is the intent of the parties,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pacifico v.

Therefore, had the agreement simply given the decedent the right to change the designated beneficiary, it would have awarded him only what he already had. The parties could not have intended such a result. Although it is conceivable that state law provisions on the disposition of marital property might purport to limit the decedent's ability to change the beneficiary after divorce, ERISA would preempt such provisions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Egelhoff v.

The pension and annuity benefits were clearly not a devise or bequest, given that the decedent died intestate. Wood contends, instead, that the benefits were a gift and that the pension and annuity designation forms fall within the definition of \"other document.\" In response, Culwick argues that the benefits were not a gift because the designation forms were executed prior to the divorce. No law is cited in support of this claim. Plaintiff seems to argue that because the property settlement agreement waived Wood's right to the benefits, the decedent would have had to give her those benefits again for her to be entitled to them. This argument is question begging because it assumes its conclusion: in attempting to argue that the property settlement agreement was a waiver, Culwick begins from the premise\n   that it was a waiver. Therefore, this contention offers no support to Culwick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nonetheless, this provision of the agreement offers no lifeline to Andrae Wood either because the pension and annuity proceeds were not a gift.

There is no sense in which defendant had dominion over the pension and annuity, and the benefits were certainly not irrevocable. Upon the decedent's death, defendant gained dominion over the payments she received, and the benefits became irrevocable, but the law requires that a donative act and donative intent coincide.

Here, no difficult issues of conflicting state law are presented by allowing the parties to make contractual arrangements to dispose of ERISA benefits after payment. The parties agree that New Jersey law applies, and although New York arguably has an interest in this controversy, relevant provisions of its law are identical to New Jersey law. Moreover, the property settlement agreement does not place any obligation on the plan administrator to discern a beneficiary other than the one listed on the plan documents. Even on plaintiff's account, the plan administrator rightly offered benefits to defendant, and it was her obligation to waive payment and to remit payment to the contingent beneficiary. Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Egelhoff\n   </em>\n   case, the plan administrator here did not need to refer to state domestic relations law to determine the beneficiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plan documents indisputably determined who the plan administrator should pay, and only the parties needed to consult the property settlement agreement to resolve their lingering dispute.

Defendant has produced nothing probative of plaintiff's motives.

As discussed above, although defendant breached the property settlement agreement, the Estate is not entitled to the proceeds of the pension and annuity. Nonetheless, even if Culwick incorrectly interpreted the agreement as entitling the Estate to the proceeds, her interpretation is as consistent with a good-faith mistake as with a bad-faith attempt to undermine defendant's now determined to be unjustified expectations. Moreover, defendant concedes that her ex-husband retained the right to change the designated beneficiary and to deprive her of the benefits. Therefore, she cannot maintain that this lawsuit is an attempt to recapture what, she meritlessly contends, the decedent bargained away under the property settlement agreement.
