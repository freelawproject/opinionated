Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, Roma Concrete Corporation (\"Roma\") and Robert D. Scarduzio (\"Scarduzio\"), one of Roma's owners, allege that Defendant Pension Associates is liable for failing to lawfully fulfill its role as the Third Party Administrator (\"TPA\") and actuary for Roma's Defined Benefit Plan (\"DB Plan\"). Plaintiffs' Complaint arises from Defendant's alleged material misrepresentations and calculation errors in reports and accountings regarding the DB Plan, which allegedly caused a shortfall in benefits in excess of $ 400,000. (ECF 1, Notice of Removal Ex. B, \"Compl.\" \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 28.) The Complaint alleges three Counts: (1) professional negligence; (2) breach of contract; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before this Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss all Counts of the Complaint. For the reasons discussed below, the Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true, the factual background is as follows. Roma is a corporation incorporated in Pennsylvania that maintains a place of business in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. (Compl. \u00b6 2.) Scarduzio, a co-owner of Roma, is an individual who maintains a place of business at Roma in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Defendant, which provides actuarial and third party administrative services throughout the United States, is a limited liability company incorporated in Connecticut and located in Stamford, Connecticut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant advertised itself as a \"highly skilled actuarial firm\" that \"specialize [sic] in maximizing pension deductions for business executives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) In or about January 2007, Roma \"retained or engaged\" Defendant to design and serve as the TPA and actuary for its DB Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) In accordance with the parties' contract (\"2007 Contract\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , as of January 1, 2007\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ,\n   Roma implemented the DB Plan to provide retirement benefits for its employees and owners, including Scarduzio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) The DB Plan identifies Roma as \"the Employer\" and Scarduzio as a \"Trustee.\" (DB Plan at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The DB Plan had an expected investment horizon of ten years and designated Roma as \"Plan Administrator\" whose role was to \"administer the [DB] Plan for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries.\" (Compl. \u00b6 16) (quoting DB Plan \u00b6 3.3.1.) The \"Plan Administrator\" was also required to \"compute, certify, and direct the Trustee with respect to the amount and kind of benefits to which any Participant is entitled.\" (Compl. \u00b6 17) (quoting DB Plan \u00b6 3.3.1(a)(2)).) It is standard practice for the \"Plan Administrator\" to engage an Enrolled Actuary, referred to as the \"[TPA] and Actuary,\" to complete such computations. (Compl. \u00b6 18.) Pursuant to the parties' contract, Defendant, the \"[TPA] and Actuary\" for the DB Plan, agreed to provide thorough and accurate actuarial details regarding the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over the course of several years, Defendant issued \"numerous\" reports, summaries, and accountings related to its administration of and Roma's contributions to the DB Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) These documents included \"numerous material misrepresentations\" regarding the DB Plan formula and the allocation of DB Plan benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, Roma's new TPA, the MandMarblestone Group, LLC (\"MMG\"), \"recently discovered\" that Defendant used improper interest and mortality assumptions in calculating lump sum values in one report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Further, Defendant prepared a DB Plan Report for the year December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016 that included a lump sum calculation for Scarduzio that was approximately $ 600,000 higher than \"the correct calculation permits under the law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's summaries and allocations of the DB Plan's funding represented to Plaintiffs that one of Roma's employees, Kathleen Spera, would be entitled to 3-7% of the contribution made by Roma, while the remainder would primarily benefit Roma's owners, including Scarduzio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) MMG's correct calculation, however, revealed that Spera's accrued lump sum represented 27% of the DB Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Indeed, when Plaintiffs' counsel sent Defendant a letter dated June 13, 2018 to ask about the \"newly discovered miscalculations\" involving Spera, Defendant stated that \"[i]t appears that an error was made in the computer benefits for Kathleen Spera and [another Roma employee].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B.) Defendant explained that \"[t]he consultant misinterpreted the meaning of the phrase of actuarial equivalent of 15.7% of annual compensation.\" (Compl. Ex. B.) Defendant's miscalculations resulted in the loss of Scarduzio's expected pension benefits in an amount exceeding $ 400,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the Complaint against Defendant in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County on October 10, 2018. (ECF 1, Notice of Removal.) On March 18, 2019, Defendant filed a Notice of Removal in this Court, alleging diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (ECF 1).

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendant contends that the Complaint must be dismissed for three reasons. First, Defendant argues that the parties' dispute must be resolved through arbitration because Plaintiffs' claims fall within the scope of the arbitration provision in the parties' January 6, 2017 contract (\"2017 Contract\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (MTD at 4.) Second, Defendant contends that Scarduzio's claims against Defendant are preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). (MTD at 9-12.) Defendant does not argue that Roma's claims in the same Counts are preempted. Third, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' tort claims-Counts I and III-should be dismissed pursuant to the \"gist of the action\" doctrine, as Plaintiffs' allegations underlying these claims arise from the terms of the parties' contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the Response, Plaintiffs argue that the 2017 Contract does not govern this action because the misconduct alleged took place over a ten-year period prior to the execution of that contract. (Resp. at 6.) In other words, the 2007 Contract, which Plaintiffs reference in the Complaint but neither party has located, governs Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Plaintiffs make no allegations regarding whether the 2007 Contract contained an arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs seek to undermine Defendant's contention that Scarduzio's claims are preempted by ERISA, arguing that because Scarduzio could not have brought his claims under ERISA, they are not preempted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Scarduzio is not seeking to recover plan benefits, but rather economic damages relating to funds diverted into the DB Plan as a result of Defendant's alleged misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that Plaintiffs' professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims-Counts I and III-are not barred by the \"gist of the action\" doctrine because both claims are based on \"broader social duties owned by Defendant\" to Plaintiffs as the TPA and actuary of the DB Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As discussed above, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' Complaint must be dismissed for three reasons: (1) Plaintiffs' claims fall within the purview of the arbitration clause in the 2017 Contract; (2) Scarduzio's claims in Counts I, II, and III are preempted by ERISA; and (3) Plaintiffs' professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims-Counts I and III-are barred by the \"gist of the action\" doctrine. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' claims fall within the purview of the arbitration clause in the 2017 Contract. However, Defendant concedes that the Complaint is not based on the 2017 Contract, but rather on the 2007 Contract that neither party has been able to locate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 2 n.2.) As Plaintiffs do not allege that the 2007 Contract on which Plaintiffs' claims are based included an arbitration provision, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs' claims are subject to arbitration at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. ERISA Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that Scarduzio's claims are preempted by ERISA because Scarduzio was a DB Plan participant, and pursuant to the terms of the DB Plan, the \"provisions of [the DB] Plan and Trust shall be construed, administered and enforced in accordance with the provisions of [ERISA].\" (MTD at 9 n.3) (quoting Compl. Ex. A.) Defendant does not argue that Roma's claims are preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"ERISA provides for uniform federal regulation of pension benefit plans and welfare benefit plans.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.

(MTD at 9-10.) Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that Scarduzio could not have brought his claims under \u00a7 502(a) because Scarduzio is not seeking benefits under the DB Plan. (Resp. at 9.) Rather, Plaintiffs contend that Scarduzio is seeking economic damages relating to funds that Scarduzio diverted into the DB Plan as a result of Defendant's alleged misrepresentations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) Scarduzio funded the DB Plan, Plaintiffs assert, with money to which he may have otherwise been entitled as an owner of Roma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court finds Defendant's argument persuasive. Plaintiffs seek to distinguish between Scarduzio's claims for \"economic damages\" from claims by a plan participant or beneficiary \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of the plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10); \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). However, the Complaint undermines Plaintiffs' argument that Scarduzio is not seeking plan benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Complaint alleges that \"Defendant's numerous errors led to a shortfall in benefits allocated to one of the DB Plan's beneficiaries in an amount in excess of $ 400,000.\" (Compl. \u00b6 24.) The Court may reasonably infer that that beneficiary was Scarduzio, as the Complaint alleges that Defendant's miscalculations \"resulted in a loss of the value of Scarduzio's expected benefit in an amount in excess of $ 400,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Plaintiffs seek to recover the same amount of \"economic losses\" in all three Counts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 43, 47.) Though Scarduzio, along with Roma, alleges that he is seeking \"economic losses in an amount in excess of $ 400,000,\" the use of the term \"economic losses\" to refer to Scarduzio's damages does not negate the fact that Scarduzio is seeking to recover expected benefits under the DB Plan. Even viewing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as the Court must at this stage, the Court concludes that Scarduzio's claims fall within the scope of \u00a7 502(a) and proceeds to the next step in the preemption analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The Complaint alleges that Defendant's duties to Plaintiffs\n   arose from the 2007 Contract \"between Plaintiffs and Defendant,\" suggesting that Scarduzio was a party to the contract. (Compl. \u00b6 13.) As a result, Plaintiffs argue, without citing any judicial authority, that \"Scarduzio clearly has privity of contract with Defendant as a 50% owner of Roma and as a trustee for the DB Plan who contracted with Defendant[.]\" (Resp. at 10.)

For example, with respect to the June 13, 2018 email acknowledging Defendant's miscalculation of Spera's benefits, the Complaint alleges, \"[B]ecause rank and file plan participants' benefits are legally required to be satisfied prior to satisfaction of an owner's benefit, this miscalculation resulted in a loss of the value of Scarduzio's expected benefit in an amount in excess of $ 400,000.\" (Compl. \u00b6 28.)
