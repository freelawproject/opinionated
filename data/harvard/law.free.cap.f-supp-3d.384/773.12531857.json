J.A. has since turned 18 years old. Before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion to appoint Alvarez as J.A.'s next friend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17, alleging that J.A. is mentally incapable of representing his own interests in this lawsuit. D.E. 48; D.E. 49. Defendant CCISD filed a response (D.E. 51), arguing that there is no evidence that J.A. has been declared incompetent or that Alvarez has been appointed J.A.'s legal guardian. Plaintiffs replied (D.E. 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2) provides that \"[a]n incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend.\" Individuals are deemed incompetent for purposes of Rule 17 if they lack \"capacity to litigate under the law of their domicile.\"\n   <em>\n    Magallon v.

In Texas, \"all that is necessary to be represented by a next friend is that the party merely be incapable, by reason of mental or bodily infirmity, of properly caring for his or her own interests in the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

According to Plaintiffs, J.A. functions at the level of a first or second grade child. CCISD does not dispute this evidence and there is no indication that a conflict of interest exists between J.A. and Alvarez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CCISD argues that only a state-appointed guardian may sue in federal court on behalf of an incapacitated adult, citing to\n   <em>\n    Rideau v. Keller Indep. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253723\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/155/#p163\">\n    819 F.3d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163-64 (5th Cir. 2016). However, in\n   <em>\n    Rideau\n   </em>\n   , the minor had a legally appointed guardian.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253723\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/155/#p163\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253723\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/155/#p163\">\n    at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit held that the minor's parents could not circumvent the guardian by filing suit on the minor's behalf absent a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253723\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/155/#p163\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, J.A. does not have a state appointed representative and therefore, may sue by a next friend under Rule 17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on J.A.'s lack of capacity, by reason of mental infirmity, to properly care for his own interests and the fact that\n   Alvarez is J.A's father, who has been involved in this litigation since its initiation, the Court APPOINTS Alfredo Alvarez as J.A's next friend in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ORDERED this 11th day of June, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
