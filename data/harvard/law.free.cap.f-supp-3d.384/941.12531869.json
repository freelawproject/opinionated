For the reasons stated herein, Defendants' Motions to Terminate Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. Nos. 78, 79) are denied, and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 86) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Entertainment One UK Ltd. is a company organized under the laws of the\n   United Kingdom. (Pl.'s Statement of Facts (\"SOF\") \u00b6 1, Dkt. No. 88.) Plaintiff develops, produces, and distributes entertainment content, including the \"Peppa Pig\" brand. (SOF \u00b6 2.) Peppa Pig is a popular animated television series aimed at preschoolers. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11.) Plaintiff owns several U.S. federal trademark registrations for its Peppa Pig property; two are relevant in this case. The first is U.S.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C872%2C348\">\n    Registration No. 4,872,348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '348 mark\") for the word mark \"PEPPA PIG.\" (SOF \u00b6 14.) The second is U.S.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C783%2C931\">\n    Registration No. 4,783,931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '931 mark\"), a design mark of Peppa Pig herself-a stylized pig wearing a dress. (SOF \u00b6 15.) The Court will refer to the trademarks collectively as the \"Peppa Pig trademarks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this case in 2018 by suing over 400 online retail stores. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedule A Defendants, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 10-2.) Plaintiff alleged that those 400 Defendants were willfully manufacturing, distributing, and selling counterfeit versions of Peppa Pig trademarked and/or copyrighted designs. The Court entered a temporary restraining order, prohibiting all Defendants from using, reproducing, selling, and shipping Plaintiff's trademark and copyright material. The Court later converted the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction, which is still in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has since entered default judgment against most Defendants, and others have been voluntarily dismissed. The case remains pending against only two Defendants: an eBay store named \"luckyjerryxiang,\" and an eBay store named \"6guys9\" (collectively herein after, \"Defendants\"). Defendants both sold a product that they named \"Peppa Pig Head Cookie Cutter,\" which is, as the name implies, a cookie cutter shaped in the outline of Peppa Pig's head. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 27-28.) Both Defendants accepted payment for the Peppa Pig cookie cutter via PayPal and shipped the product to Illinois. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 30-31.) Defendants are not authorized retailers of Peppa Pig products. (SOF \u00b6 36.) Defendants have filed nearly identical pleadings to date, but it appears that each store is operated by a separate person. 6guys9 is operated by HaiJie Lin, and luckyjerryxiang is operated by Jian Feng; both individuals are located in the People's Republic of China. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment against Defendants for: (1) willful federal trademark infringement and counterfeiting under Section 32 of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) false designation of origin under Section 43 of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) violation of the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 815 ILCS 510/2(a). Plaintiff further requests a statutory damages award of at least $ 100,000 from each Defendant; attorneys' fees and costs; and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from violating Plaintiff's rights in the Peppa Pig trademarks. Defendants move to terminate the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A district court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court will address Plaintiff's Statement of Facts and Defendants' response, or lack thereof. The Local Rules of the Northern District of Illinois require the party moving for summary judgment to submit a statement of undisputed material facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Ill. L. R. 56.1. When the opposing party fails to controvert the moving party's statement in the manner dictated by Local Rule 56.1, those facts are deemed admitted for the purpose of the summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Lamz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9363248\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/680/#p683\">\n    321 F.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 683 (7th Cir. 2003). Plaintiff submitted a proposed list of 54 undisputed material facts, each supported by citation to the record, in accordance with Rule 56.1. In response, Defendants filed documents titled \"Defendant Statement of Material Facts\" that each contained two brief factual assertions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 94, 98.) Defendants did not, as the Local Rules require, respond to each numbered paragraph in Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants are representing themselves\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   and the Court therefore construes their pleadings liberally.\n   <em>\n    Hudson v. McHugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288191\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/859/#p864\">\n    148 F.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 864 (7th Cir. 1998). However, the Seventh Circuit has \"consistently held that a failure to respond by the nonmovant as mandated by the local rules results in an admission.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9363248\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/680/#p683\">\n    321 F.3d at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court cannot excuse the fact that Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greer v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499388\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/723/#p727\">\n    267 F.3d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 727 (7th Cir. 2001). Merely setting forth their own factual assertions does not constitute a rebuttal of Plaintiff's facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499388\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/723/#p727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Court will treat Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts as admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Trademark Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court turns to the merits of Plaintiff's summary judgment motion. Plaintiff argues that Defendants violated Sections 32 and 43 of the Lanham Act, as well as the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"UDTPA\"). Defendants are liable for trademark infringement and counterfeiting under Section 32 of the Lanham Act if they, \"without the consent of the registrant, use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale ... of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). A defendant is liable for false designation of origin under Section 43 if it, \"on or in connection with any goods or services ... uses in commerce any ... false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading misrepresentation of fact, which is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the ... origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods ... by another person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The UDTPA prohibits the following activities, among others, as deceptive trade practices: (1) passing off goods as those of another; (2) causing likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods; and (3) causing likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to affiliation, connection, or association with another. 815 ILCS 510/2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff must establish the same two elements for all of its Lanham Act and UDTPA claims: (1) that it has a protectable\n   trademark; and (2) that Defendants' use of the trademark is likely to cause confusion among consumers.\n   <em>\n    Packman v. Chicago Tribune Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499220\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/628/\">\n    267 F.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638 n.8 (7th Cir. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    Monster Energy Co. v. Zheng Peng\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-414,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204772769\">\n    2017 WL 4772769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2017) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Plaintiff owns protectable trademarks. Both the '348 and '931 marks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.) Such registry constitutes\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of the validity of Plaintiff's registered trademarks and of Plaintiff's exclusive right to use the trademarks.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201057\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Defendants do not contest the registration of Plaintiff's trademarks, nor the validity of such marks. Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue regarding the fact that Plaintiff's Peppa Pig trademarks are protectable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monster Energy Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204772769\">\n    2017 WL 4772769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Plaintiff must establish that Defendants' use of the Peppa Pig trademarks is likely to cause confusion among consumers. The Seventh Circuit has set forth seven factors to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AutoZone, Inc. v. Strick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824364\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/923/#p929\">\n    543 F.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 929 (7th Cir. 2008). However, the Seventh Circuit also held, in a non-precedential opinion, that courts can presume likelihood of confusion where a defendant \"produces counterfeit goods in an apparent attempt to capitalize upon the popularity of, and demand for, another's product.\"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v. Rechanik\n   </em>\n   , 249 Fed. App'x. 476, 479 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Craftex, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1678161\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/145/#p148\">\n    816 F.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (4th Cir. 1987) ). Given that the Seventh Circuit established the presumption in a non-precedential opinion, the Court will first analyze the facts under the presumption, and then under the full seven factor test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coach, Inc. v. Treasure Box, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:11 CV 468,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202402922\">\n    2013 WL 2402922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (N.D. Ind. May 31, 2013) (\"This ... is plainly a case for presuming likelihood of confusion. But in an abundance of caution, [the Court] will take a belt-and-suspenders approach ... and proceed with the seven-factor analysis to determine whether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Likelihood of Confusion: Presumption Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under the shortened test, a court presumes likelihood of confusion when a defendant has produced counterfeit goods in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of another's product.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   , 249 Fed. App'x. at 479. In order to be \"counterfeit,\" the goods must have been produced by an entity that was not authorized to use the mark at the time the goods were manufactured.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201116\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B). Plaintiff never authorized Defendants to use Peppa Pig trademarks. (SOF \u00b6 36.) Additionally, counterfeit goods must bear \"a spurious mark which is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The PEPPA PIG word mark was not imprinted directly on the cookie cutters at issue; however, Defendants used that exact mark in the product's name: \"Peppa Pig Head Cookie Cutter.\" (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 22, 27.) And a protected mark need not appear\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   an item to render it counterfeit; rather, the Lanham Act only requires that the protected mark be used \"in connection with\" the sale.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chloe SAS v.

Cal.

Apart from conclusory statements denying liability (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. at 6-7 (\"The peppa pig head cookie cutter I made ... did not infringe Peppa Pig trade mark.\")), Defendants do not contest the similarity between their products and Plaintiff's trademarks. Indeed, Defendants repeatedly refer to their product as \"the peppa pig head cookie cutter.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Opp. at 6.) Defendants used the precise '348 word mark on the product listing and used the '931 mark's likeness on the product itself. Accordingly, the Court finds as a matter of law that Defendant's cookie cutters are counterfeit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court further finds that Defendants produced these counterfeit goods in an attempt to capitalize upon the popularity of Plaintiff's Peppa Pig product. Peppa Pig is a globally recognizable brand that includes a wide variety of licensed Peppa Pig products, from video games to kitchen utensils-the latter of which Defendants chose to manufacture. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.) Defendants offered the following explanation of their motivation for selling the cookie cutters: \"When [we] created the peppa pig head cookie cutter, [we] just thought it was a lovely design, and the customer should be very happy if they could make peppa pig head cookies.\" (Def.'s Opp. to Summ. J. at 6, Dkt. No. 97.) As Defendants were well aware, consumers seek out the Peppa Pig brand, and Defendants created a product designed to profit from that demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202402922\">\n    2013 WL 2402922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

The third factor favors Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The fourth factor involves examining the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers of Plaintiff's authentic Peppa Pig merchandise and by purchasers of Defendants' counterfeit products, to determine whether either group would be confused by Defendants' cookie cutters.\n   <em>\n    CAE, Inc. v. Clean Air Eng'g, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499316\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/660/#p682\">\n    267 F.3d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (7th Cir. 2001).

Luckyjerryxiang sold its cookie cutter for approximately $ 5; 6guys9 for approximately $ 7.55. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 24, 29.) Because the products were widely accessible for anyone to purchase on eBay, and sold at a low price point, this factor weighs in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under the fifth factor, \"[t]he stronger the mark, the more likely it is that encroachment on it will produce confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824364\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/923/#p929\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824364\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/923/#p929\">\n    at 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The Peppa Pig brand is globally recognized. The television show first aired in 2004 and has since been translated into 40 languages and broadcast around the world. (SOF \u00b6 11-13.) Plaintiff has established that its marks are strong, as evidenced by the fact that it spends millions of dollars annually in advertising, marketing, and promoting its goods bearing the marks. (SOF \u00b6 20.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202402922\">\n    2013 WL 2402922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Defendants do not dispute the strength of Plaintiff's marks. This factor favors Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The sixth factor assesses whether there is any evidence of actual consumer confusion. Defendants dispute that actual confusion exists, pointing out that the same or similar cookie cutters (likely counterfeit) are listed for sale in other eBay shops. They contend that their cookie cutters do not create a likelihood of confusion among consumers because the market is\n   full of other fakes. However, the prevalence of other counterfeit Peppa Pig products for sale online increases, not decreases, the odds of actual consumer confusion. Defendants further argue that the other counterfeit cookie cutters do not have online reviews that indicate consumers are confused about the origins of the product. But a lack of customer feedback questioning whether the products are counterfeit may support the existence of actual consumer confusion, if consumers believe the counterfeit products are genuine. Although Defendants arguments are unavailing, Plaintiff does not present any evidence of actual confusion. Therefore, this factor weighs in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The seventh and final factor focuses on evidence that a defendant attempted to pass off its product as having come from the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Sorensen v. WD-40 Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276326\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/712/#p731\">\n    792 F.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (7th Cir. 2015). Evidence of \"bad faith intent\" to confuse is particularly relevant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276326\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/712/#p731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Court can infer that Defendants intended to pass off their products as coming from Plaintiff because they named their product \"Peppa Pig Head Cookie Cutter.\" The Court further infers an intent to confuse because the PEPPA PIG word mark that Defendants used is a senior mark that has attained great notoriety.\n   <em>\n    AutoZone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824364\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/923/#p929\">\n    543 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   934 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co. v.

Thus, the Court finds that the seventh factor supports Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, of the seven factors, only one-actual consumer confusion-is lacking. Although evidence of actual confusion, if available, is entitled to substantial weight in the likelihood of confusion analysis, \"this evidence is not required to prove that a likelihood of confusion exists.\"\n   <em>\n    CAE\n   </em>\n   , 267 F.3d at 685.

As the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1). The Lanham Act allows for attorneys' fees in \"exceptional\" cases,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which encompasses cases in which the acts of infringement are \"malicious, fraudulent, deliberate or willful.\"\n   <em>\n    BASF Corp. v.

Preliminary and Permanent Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants have moved to terminate the preliminary injunction. The Court has already dispatched most of the arguments that Defendant used against the preliminary injunction, including conclusory statements denying counterfeiting, only having sold one cookie cutter each, and never having damaged Plaintiff's business. However, Defendants also object to the preliminary injunction's asset freeze, which the Court will address. The preliminary injunction ordered all third-party providers to restrain \"all accounts and funds connected to Defendants or Defendants' Online Marketplace Accounts ... that are not U.S. based\" from transferring money until further ordered by the Court. (Preliminary Injunction Order \u00b6 5, Dkt. No. 39.) PayPal froze Defendants' accounts, for a combined restrained balance of approximately $ 400. (SOF \u00b6 54.) It appears to the Court that this is the extent of Defendants' accounts that have been frozen thus far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants argue that the asset freeze is damaging their online business and ask the Court to lift it. To exempt assets from an asset freeze, \"[t]he burden is on the party seeking relief to present\n   documentary proof that particular assets [are] not the proceeds of counterfeiting activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Luxottica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203818622\">\n    2015 WL 3818622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    N.

Mar. 30, 2006) ). Defendants have provided no such proof, other than asserting that they each sold only one cookie cutter. Such a conclusory statement \"plainly does not qualify as documentary proof\" that Defendants' PayPal accounts contain no proceeds from their counterfeiting activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H-D U.S.A., LLC v.

A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must show that: (1) it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) legal remedies, such as monetary damages, cannot adequately compensate for that injury; (3) the balance of hardships between the parties warrants an equitable remedy; and (4) a permanent injunction would not harm the public interest.\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.
