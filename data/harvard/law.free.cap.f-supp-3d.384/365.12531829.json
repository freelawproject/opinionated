Brooks, Sr. (\"plaintiff\" or \"Brooks\") commenced this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   civil rights action on December 12, 2016. In the original complaint, Brooks asserted claims against several Buffalo, New York police officers and a civilian, Talia Singletary, arising out of his arrest on November 24, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On initial review, the Court granted plaintiff's request for leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , but held that plaintiff's false-arrest and malicious-prosecution claims would be dismissed with prejudice, unless plaintiff filed an amended complaint correcting certain deficiencies in the original pleading. (Dkt. #7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brooks filed an amended complaint (Dkt. #8) on October 3, 2017. In the amended complaint, plaintiff sought to add claims against two new defendants, the City of Buffalo and former Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By Order entered on April 25, 2018 (Dkt. #10), the Court dismissed with prejudice the claims against Singletary, Sedita,\n   and the City of Buffalo. The Court permitted plaintiff's claims for false arrest, malicious prosecution and excessive force to proceed against the remaining five defendants, all of whom are members of the Buffalo Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants have filed a motion (Dkt. #24) for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has filed a response in opposition. (Dkt. #29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The underlying facts are summarized in the Court's prior orders (Dkt. #7, #10). As fleshed out by the documentary evidence submitted by defendants in support of their summary judgment motion, the record shows the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 23, 2013, plaintiff went to the home of his ex-girlfriend, Talia Singletary, in Buffalo. They began arguing, and Singletary placed a 911 call to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Buffalo Police Officers Andrew Whiteford, Charles Miller, Robert Danner and James McMahon responded to the call. After the officers spoke to both plaintiff and Singletary, they arrested plaintiff and took him to the police station. According to defendants, they arrested Brooks based on Singletary's statements that he had tried to enter her home without her consent, and based on an open, outstanding report by Singletary relating to an incident on June 9, 2013, when plaintiff allegedly kicked the front door of Singletary's residence and threatened to shoot her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #24-4 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff was subsequently charged with Harassment in the Second Degree and Aggravated Harassment in the Second Degree (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20L.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20240.26\">\n    N.Y.

(Dkt. #24-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears that the charges were based on the June 9 incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #24-4 at 11. In satisfaction of the charges against him, plaintiff pleaded guilty to one charge of second-degree harassment. (Dkt. #24-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his amended complaint, plaintiff has not set out separate causes of action, but has set forth a narrative of events, and claims that as a result of defendants' actions, he has suffered damages due to defendants' violations of his constitutional rights, as discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Aug. 3, 2018) (\"A conviction is conclusive evidence that probable cause existed for an arrest even if the conviction is the result of a guilty plea to or conviction of a lesser charge than that for which plaintiff was arrested\");\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528461\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/347/169/#p174\">\n    347 F.Supp.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"Plaintiff's conviction, based on his guilty plea, shows that there was probable cause for his arrest and prosecution,\" and granting defendants summary judgment on plaintiff's claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the case at bar, plaintiff admits in his complaint that he was convicted of a charge that was brought pursuant to his arrest. (Dkt. #8 \u00b6 64.) Defendants have also presented evidence that on December 12, 2003, Brooks was convicted of second-degree harassment, in connection with the June 9, 2013 incident. (Dkt. #24-5.) Defendants state that the June 9 report, which was still \"open\" as of November 24,\n   formed part of the basis for Brooks's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the amended complaint, plaintiff states that he was eventually \"forced to plead guilty,\" Dkt. #8 \u00b6 64, and he states in his affidavit in opposition to defendants' motion, \"[A]fter remaining incarcerated for 19 days, ... I cop-out to the charge,\" Dkt. #29 \u00b6 14, but he has not presented any evidence that would tend to call into question the voluntariness or validity of his plea. Brooks asserts that he was under \"mental duress\" at the time, but undoubtedly almost everyone facing criminal charges, and deciding whether to enter a guilty plea, undergoes some degree of stress or anguish. There is nothing in the record that Brooks was subjected to any unusually coercive circumstances that might have rendered his plea anything less than knowing and voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff has also alleged that he was \"illegally charged\" because plaintiff's \"name was altered in the computer by Police Officer McMahon, where the name was change [sic] from Larry E. Brooks to Larry Boyd.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The record shows that when plaintiff was \"booked\" on November 24, 2013, the Information listed his name as Larry Boyd. (Dkt. #24-4 at 11.) The Buffalo City Court's Certificate of Disposition certifying plaintiff's conviction pursuant to his guilty plea also names him as Larry Boyd. (Dkt. #24-5 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The reason for this discrepancy is not apparent from the record. Defendant Joseph Lynch states that he has no recollection or knowledge concerning this matter, Dkt. #24-9 \u00b6 9, and defendant McMahon denies plaintiff's allegation that he changed plaintiff's surname in any documents or database from \"Brooks\" to \"Boyd.\" (Dkt. #24-10 \u00b6 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In any event, there appears to be no dispute that with respect to the various charges and papers filed in connection with the underlying events, \"Larry Brooks\" and \"Larry Boyd\" were one and the same person. The facts as recited in the documents obviously relate to the same events, on the same date, involving the same people. Plaintiff does not deny that he is the person named in all these documents, and he has not explained how he was prejudiced by the use of those names or what reason defendants would have had for deliberately altering his name. Nor does it appear that he ever raised any challenges in state court concerning these matters, which are of no federal constitutional dimension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff's remaining allegations require little comment. He has alleged that the officers \"somehow\" forced or persuaded Singletary to make false accusations against him,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #29 \u00b6 24, but that naked allegation is not enough to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact. His amended complaint also purports to assert claims for due process and equal protection violations, but he has not even alleged the elements of such claims, much less presented evidence in support of them. In short, his claims are entirely without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. #24) is granted, and the complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Although the motion is styled a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or in the alternative for summary judgment, the Court treats it as a motion for summary judgment, since the moving defendants have all answered the complaint, Dkt. #11.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ortiz v.
