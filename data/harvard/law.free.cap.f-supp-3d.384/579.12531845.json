Appropriate responses and replies have been filed, and the time for further filing has expired. The following additional motions are also ripe for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (1) Motion to Strike Answer to Amended Complaint [DE #200];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (2) Motion to Stay Motion to Strike [DE #203];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (3) Motion for Extension of Time to File Response to Motion to Strike [DE # 203]; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (4) Motion for an Advisory Jury [DE #208].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs Bonnie Peltier, as Guardian of A.P., a minor child; Erika Booth, as Guardian of I.B., a minor child; and Patricia Brown, as Guardian of K.B., a minor child; by and through counsel filed the complaint in this matter on February 29, 2016 and an amended complaint on March 11, 2016. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied by this court. The parties were ordered to attend a court-hosted settlement conference as to all claims in this matter. The parties did not reach a settlement. Also, during the discovery period, plaintiffs filed a motion for appropriate relief, which was granted on September 29, 2017 [DE #136]. In that order, United States Magistrate Judge Kimberly A. Swank found misconduct by defendants' counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ordered that portions of the January 13, 2017, Psychological Report authored by defendants' experts Wells Hively, Ph.D., and Ann Duncan-Hively, Ph.D., J.D., be stricken from the records, specifically, any and all portions which reference or rely upon classroom observations of the minor plaintiffs or other students of Charter Day School or teacher interviews conducted by defendants' experts. The defendants were ordered to submit a revised expert report. Further, defendants are barred from offering, eliciting, presenting or otherwise relying upon any testimony, statements or opinions of their experts concerning their classroom observations of the minor plaintiffs or the teacher interviews. The order allowed further briefing on the amount of sanctions; however, the parties agreed upon an amount of sanctions prior to entry of any order by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Now before the court are the above-listed motions. These motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs are current or former students of Charter Day School, a co-educational, K-8 public charter school in Brunswick County, North Carolina. They brought this action challenging the school's uniform policy, which requires female students to wear \"skirts, skorts, or jumpers\" (\"the skirts requirement\") and male students to wear shorts or pants. Plaintiffs do not contest defendants' authority to impose a school uniform policy in general, but only the skirts requirement. They argue the skirts requirement forces them to wear clothing that is less warm and comfortable than the pants their male classmates are permitted to wear and, more importantly, restricts plaintiffs' physical activity, distracts from their learning, and limits their educational opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs claim the uniform policy violates federal and state law. Specifically, plaintiffs assert the following causes of action: (1) sex-based discrimination in violation\n   of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, brought via\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) sex-based discrimination in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. and implementing regulations; (3) sex-based discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause in Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution ; (4) breach of the Charter Agreement between the State Board of Education and Charter Day School, Inc.; and (5) breach of the management agreement between Charter Day School, Inc., and The Roger Bacon Academy, Inc. (\"RBA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The North Carolina General Assembly passed the Charter Schools Act in the mid-1990s. The Act states its purpose as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The purpose of this Article is to authorize a system of charter schools to provide opportunities for teachers, parents, pupils, and community members to establish and maintain schools that operate independently of existing schools, as a method to accomplish all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) Improve student learning;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) Increase learning opportunities for all students, with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identified as at risk of academic failure or academically gifted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (3) Encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (4) Create new professional opportunities for teachers, including the opportunities to be responsible for the learning program at the school site;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (5) Provide parents and students with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available within the public school system; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (6) Hold the schools established under this Article accountable for meeting measurable student achievement results, and provide the schools with a method to change from rule-based to performance-based accountability systems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-218.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Charter Schools are operated by private, nonprofit corporations. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-15(b). The board of directors of the school decides \"matters related to the operation of the school, including budgeting, curriculum, and operating procedures.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-15(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, the nonprofit corporation which holds the charter for the School is defendant Charter Day School, Inc. (\"CDS, Inc.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   CDS, Inc. also holds charters for three other charter schools, South Brunswick Charter School, Douglass Academy, and Columbus Charter School. [DE #160 \u00b610]. CDS, Inc. was incorporated by Baker Mitchell in 1999. [DE #160 \u00b62]. Mr. Mitchell served on the original CDS, Inc. Board of Trustees and currently serves as Board Secretary, a non-voting position. [DE #160 \u00b622]. After the formation of CDS, Inc., it applied to open a charter school, which was approved for an initial five-year term. The School began operations for the 2000-2001 academic year. The State renewed the charter of CDS, Inc. to operate the School for ten years in 2005, with another ten-year renewal in 2015. When the School first opened, it had 53 students; it has since grown to over 900\n   students in elementary and middle school campuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The individual defendants, Robert Spencer, Chad Adams, Suzanne West, Colleen Combs, Ted Bodenschatz, and Melissa Gott (collectively \"the Board\" or \"the Board members\") comprise the Board of Trustees of CDS, Inc. and adopt the disciplinary rules, regulations, policies and procedures for the School. [DE #160 \u00b6\u00b611, 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The original charter application filed by CDS, Inc. notified the State that it intended to enter into an \"educational management contract\" with defendant RBA. [DE #160 \u00b619]. RBA is a for-profit corporation and a legal entity separate from CDS, Inc. [DE #160 \u00b620]. Mr. Mitchell is the founder, president, and sole shareholder of RBA. [DE #160 \u00b621]. RBA's Chief Financial Officer, Mark Dudeck, serves at the treasurer of CDS, Inc., but is not part of the Board. [DE #160 \u00b623]. The charter agreement between CDS, Inc. and the State bars RBA employees from serving on the Board. RBA manages the day-to-day operations of the four charter schools chartered under CDS, Inc., undertaking various functions including leasing land and school buildings to the School, acquiring materials, etc. [See DE #160 \u00b6\u00b625-26].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The School is a \"traditional values\" charter school. [DE #160 154, 55]. The four sections of the School's pledge are \"to keep myself healthy in body, mind and spirit,\" \"to be truthful in all my works,\" \"to be virtuous in all my deeds,\" and \"to be obedient and loyal to those in authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The School uses the direct instruction method and a classical curriculum to fulfill the School's mission. [DE #160 \u00b6\u00b654, 59].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Since the School's original charter, it has required students to adhere to a uniform policy for the following purpose: \"to instill discipline and keep order\" so that \"student learning is not impeded.\" Use of uniforms also \"helps promote a sense of pride and of team spirit, as every student is a member of the academic team.\" [DE #160 \u00b6\u00b668, 119-121.] Plaintiffs do not dispute the authority of CDS, Inc. and the School to establish and enforce a uniform policy in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   All students must wear white or navy blue tops, tucked into khaki or blue bottoms. Boys may wear pants or knee-length shorts with a belt, while girls may wear knee-length or longer jumpers, skirts or skorts but may not wear pants or knee-length shorts. Girls may wear, but are not required to wear, socks, stockings or leggings. Boys must wear socks. All students must wear closed-toe/closed-heel shoes; flip flops, Crocs and sandals are prohibited. [DE #13-2]. In addition to the required uniform, the school also has grooming standards in place which regulate jewelry, hair length and color, as well as makeup and facial hair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [DE #13-4 at 29-30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs are challenging the skirts requirement only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to the uniform policy, students at the School are permitted to wear a separate physical education (\"PE\") uniform on days they are scheduled to have PE class, which consists of a School approved t-shirt or sweatshirt and sweatpants or shorts. [DE #151 \u00b6\u00b650-51]. Because students in different classes are scheduled to have PE on different days, some percentage of the School's students wear the PE uniform on any given school day. [DE #151 \u00b6\u00b649-51]. Additionally, the uniform policy is suspended for various reasons on specific days, including certain field trip days, special events such as health, archery or girls' sports; when students achieve certain academic benchmarks; when students make donations to non-school-related charity organizations; or for celebrations or special events at the school. [DE #151 \u00b6\u00b652-59],\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Violation of the uniform policy may result in disciplinary action. The uniform policy is primarily enforced by the School's teachers. [DE #160 \u00b675]. When a student is out of compliance, a standardized, written notification is sent home to the student's parents. [DE #160 \u00b676]. Repeated noncompliance results in a phone call to the parents. [DE #160 \u00b679]. Sometimes items are loaned to students who cannot afford or do not have a particular item. [DE #160 \u00b681]. A student who is out of compliance may be removed from class and sent to the School office or his or her parents may be called and asked to pick up the child. Additionally, the student could be excluded from class for the day and could be expelled; however, no child has ever been expelled for a uniform policy violation. [Answer, DE #94 \u00b649].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs and their parents/guardians ad litem have testified that plaintiffs find skirts less comfortable on a daily basis and less warm in the wintertime than pants. [DE #151 \u00b6\u00b6123-126, 154-64, and 179-257.] The skirts requirement forces them to pay constant attention to the positioning of their legs during class, distracting them from learning, and has led them to avoid certain activities altogether, such as climbing or playing sports during recess, all for fear of exposing their undergarments and being reprimanded by teachers or teased by boys. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6123-153, 179-257.] They claim the skirts requirement sends a message that their comfort and freedom to engage in physical activity are less important than those of their male classmates. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 165-258.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Board has the authority to establish and alter the uniform policy's specific requirements. The Board believes the uniform policy's current requirements inextricably support the School's broader, traditional-values educational model. One Board member stated that the requirements of the uniform policy, including its sex-differentiated requirements, \"work seamlessly together in a coordinated fashion in a disciplined environment that has mutual respect between boys and girls and between each other as students.\" [Adams Dep. 134:1-15, DE #161-1]. The Board members focus on the uniform policy as a whole and not on the specific gender-based requirements, noting it is part of the overall design of the School to instill discipline, order, and mutual respect. However, the Board members in their depositions all seemed to be unable to answer whether it would disrupt discipline if girls were allowed to wear pants (leaving in place the rest of the uniform policy). Furthermore, they often relied on the School's high enrollment and the parents' apparently satisfaction with the policy. They note that the uniform policy is part of the School's traditional values education, and that changing any of the specific\n   requirements risks inadvertently changing the broader goal. [DE #160 \u00b6\u00b6 118-121, 124-128].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants make much of the test scores and achievements of their students, comparing both the success of the students at the School versus students in traditional public schools within the county, as well as the girls in the School versus the boys in the school. There is no dispute among the parties that the test scores of the School are high compared to traditional public schools in the areas. Nor is there any dispute that plaintiffs chose to send their children to the School, in part, because of the high test scores. Defendants attempt to tie this success to the uniform policy; however, they do not bring forth any facts showing specifically how the skirts requirement furthers this success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     COURT'S DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific\n   issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created ... program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Morton v.

Such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.

Here, then, the precise question before the court is \"Whether a nonprofit board and its members who are all private individuals (not state officials or employees) but operate a public charter school in North Carolina act under color of state law when they promulgate and enforce a uniform policy/dress code which is incorporated into the discipline policy of the charter school.?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     \"Public School\"-How the State Views the Entity\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under this analytical framework, plaintiffs first argue that defendants are state actors simply because North Carolina statutory law designates charter schools as public schools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

Stat. \u00a7 115C-218.45, \u00a7 115C-218.50(b). It also requires charter schools to comply with instructional standards adopted by the State Board of Education, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115C-218.85, and prohibits charter schools from sectarianism or discrimination, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 115C-218.50(a), 115C-218.55 (\"A charter school shall not discriminate against any student on the basis of ethnicity, national origin, gender, or disability.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   State law also requires public schools, including charter schools, to establish a student code of conduct and discipline.

Further, defendants admit that violations may result in disciplinary action. [DE #94 \u00b649]. The court need not decide whether every dress code or uniform policy of a charter school is extensively regulated by the State because, in this matter, CDS, Inc. has brought the uniform policy under extensive regulation of the State by making violations of the uniform policy a disciplinary violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This case presents a multi-faceted analysis regarding whether the actions of defendants constitute state action. However, this is the analysis the court must conduct based on the statutory scheme established by the North Carolina General Assembly - a scheme which attempts to contract out and fully fund an historical, traditional and exclusively state function, namely free public education, to private corporations and individuals. Answering the precise question before the court, the court finds that under the facts and circumstances presented here, CDS, Inc. and its board members acted under color of state law when they incorporated into the disciplinary code of the School a uniform policy the violation of which could subject students to discipline. The undersigned notes this finding does not equate to a finding that North Carolina charter schools and their board members are state actors for all purposes, only that the action complained of here occurred under color of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   b. Defendant RBA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants argue the lack of state action is even clearer with respect to RBA. RBA holds no direct contract with the State and receives no direct public funding but rather contracts with CDS, Inc. to provide \"necessary educational facilities and management services.\" Perhaps even more important, RBA has no direct authority to change the uniform policy. The uniform policy is set by the Board, and RBA's officers are not members of the Board of CDS, Inc. Plaintiffs argue that RBA was equally subject to the delegation of authority by the State for the education of students at the School, and has played a principal role in the creation, governance, and operation of the School from its inception. Plaintiff notes that the Charter Application was filed by CDS, Inc., \"in conjunction with\" RBA; the logo on the application is that of RBA, and the header on each page lists both CDS, Inc. and RBA. Mr. Mitchell is listed as the primary contact. The Application detailed the operation and management of the school by RBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The facts show that RBA and CDS, Inc. are significantly intertwined, yet legally distinct entities. RBA provides the facilities, maintenance, staff and administration. However, despite these close connections, CDS, Inc. is the non-profit entity which holds the charter with the State and the Board of CDS, Inc. is the entity with final authority over the uniform policy at issue in this matter. Therefore, the court finds the state action doctrine does not extend so far as to cover RBA in this particular instance. While the court notes that RBA and its principals appear to exercise much\n   indirect influence over the Board of CDS, Inc., CDS, Inc. remains the legal entity charged with approving the uniform policy and discipline code at issue. Therefore, RBA's motion for summary judgment as to the constitutional claims is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   c. EPC Claims Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Having found state action on the part of CDS, Inc., the court turns to the issue of whether the uniform policy, as currently written and enforced, violates the equal protection clause. \"The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals against intentional, arbitrary discrimination by government officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayden ex rel.

Most recent uniform and dress code cases are claims based on the First\n   Amendment, not the Equal Protection Clause. Arguably, the most analogous cases are the hair length cases of the Vietnam era, cases decided long before\n   <em>\n    United States v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   and not based explicitly on an Equal Protection analysis. Since the 1960s and 70s, there have been limited cases concerning requirements that girls wear skirts. This is likely a function, at least partly, of changing community standards that have led to the near eradication of prohibitions on girls wearing pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, the court need not decide the exact breadth of application of\n   <em>\n    Virginia's\n   </em>\n   intermediate scrutiny or whether\n   <em>\n    Hayden's\n   </em>\n   \"comparable burdens\" standard is part of intermediate scrutiny, because even under a \"comparable burden\" analysis, the court finds the skirts requirement does not pass muster. While this court recognizes that certain sex-differentiated standards consistent with community norms may be permissible, the skirts requirement in this case is not consistent with community norms. Women (and girls) have, for at least several decades, routinely worn both pants and skirts in various settings, including professional settings and school settings. Females have been allowed to wear trousers or pants in all but the most formal or conservative settings since the 1970s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to plaintiffs' expert, most public school dress codes across the country allowed girls to wear pants or shorts by the mid-1980s. \"[I]t is worth noting that the community standards which may account for the differences in standards applied to men and women, girls and boys, do not remain fixed in perpetuity.\n   <em>\n    Hayden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115458\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/569/#p577\">\n    743 F.3d at 581-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   While defendants argue the skirts requirement is based on the traditional values approach of the school as a whole and is in place to instill discipline and keep order, defendants have shown no connection between these stated goals and the requirement that girls wear skirts. Defendants argue that the sex-differentiated requirements cannot be viewed in isolation but instead \"work seamlessly together in a coordinated fashion in a disciplined environment that has mutual respect between boys and girls and between each other as students\" and that the uniform policy, and specifically the skirts requirement, helps the students to \"act more appropriately\" toward the opposite sex. They argue that taking away the \"visual cues\" of the skirts requirement would hinder respect between the two sexes. However, even assuming these are legitimate goals, defendants have not shown how the skirts requirement actually furthers these stated goals. The evidence shows that on any given day, a portion of the female student population is not subject to the skirts requirement. The undisputed facts show that there are a number of days (P.E. days at least once per week, as well as special event, and field trips days) where girls are not required to wear skirts. There has been no evidence presented that the boys treat the girls differently or vice versa on those days. When questioned about the skirts requirement, none of the Board members deposed could explain how requiring girls to wear skirts specifically furthered the policy's stated goals. Further, there is no evidence that requiring girls to wear skirts on a daily basis is consistent with community standards of dress in Brunswick County or in North Carolina generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   It is not the holding of this court that dress, grooming and uniform policies cannot have differences for boys and girls. However, even under the\n   <em>\n    Hayden\n   </em>\n   theory of an \"evenly-enforced grooming code\" with \"comparable burdens,\" defendants cannot show that the uniform policy imposes comparable burdens. Yes, the boys at the School must conform to a uniform policy as well. But plaintiffs in this case have shown that the girls are subject to a specific clothing requirement that renders them unable to play as freely during recess, requires them to sit in an uncomfortable manner in the classroom, causes them to be overly focused on how they are sitting, distracts them from learning, and subjects them to cold temperatures on their legs and/or uncomfortable layers of leggings under their knee-length skirts in order to stay warm, especially moving outside between classrooms at the School. Defendants have offered no evidence of any comparable burden on boys. While defendants emphasize that the uniform policy is most frequently enforced against boys for failure to wear a belt, there is no evidence that wearing a belt inhibits the boys' ability to fully participate in the programs or activities of the School. Therefore, the skirts requirement causes the girls to suffer a burden the boys do not, simply because they are female.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Under the facts of this specific case, the court finds that the skirts requirement of the uniform policy of the School promulgated by CDS, Inc., as written and enforced, violates the Equal Protection Clause. Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this issue. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     North Carolina Constitutional Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The North Carolina Constitution provides a direct cause of action only in the absence of an adequate state remedy. \"An adequate state remedy exists if, assuming the plaintiffs claim is successful, the remedy would compensate the plaintiff for the same injury alleged in the direct constitutional claim.\"\n   <em>\n    J.W. v.

Therefore, the motions for summary judgment as to the North Carolina constitutional claims are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to be refiled, if appropriate, with proper support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Breach of Contract Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs contend they are third-party beneficiaries to the contract between the State of North Carolina and CDS, Inc. as well as the management agreement between CDS, Inc. and RBA. While plaintiffs contend their status as third-party beneficiaries is clear, the court finds, similar to the state constitutional claim, that neither defendants nor plaintiffs have adequately addressed this legal issue in a manner in which the court can provide proper analysis. Therefore, the cross motions for summary judgment are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE as to the breach of contract claims to be refiled, if appropriate, with proper support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As to the Motion to Strike Answer to Amended Complaint [DE #200], Motion to Stay Motion to Strike [DE #203], and Motion for Extension of Time to File Response to Motion to Strike [DE # 203], all of these are procedural motions which only\n   need be addressed if summary judgment is ultimately denied. While the court is denying without prejudice the motions for summary judgment as to the state law claims, the denial is solely for the purposes of seeking additional filings from the parties. Therefore, judicial efficiency would not be served by addressing the procedural motions at this time. Therefore, these motions are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to be refiled if necessary. If refiled, the court will consider them as if filed on their original filing date so as to avoid prejudicing the parties as to timeliness arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Also before the court is defendants' motion for this court to allow trial before an advisory jury [DE #208]. The court, in its discretion, denies this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court hereby orders as follows: the cross motions for summary judgment [DE #149 and #158] are GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, AND DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN PART. Specifically, as to the Title IX claims, defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and plaintiffs' motion DENIED. As to the EPC claim, defendants' motion is GRANTED as to defendant RBA and DENIED as to all other defendants. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to CDS, Inc. and the individual board members insofar as the court finds the skirts requirement violates the equal protection clause. As to the North Carolina Constitutional and breach of contract claims, the cross motions are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. The motion to strike, motion to stay and motion for extension of time [DE #200, #203] are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to be refiled if necessary, and the motion for an advisory jury [DE #208] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The clerk is directed to refer this matter to the magistrate judge for further case management.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Defendants' former counsel withdrew and defendants now have different counsel than those found to have committed misconduct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Charter Day School, Inc.
