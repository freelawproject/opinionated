Bauman\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which brought about a sea change in the jurisprudence of exercising general personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation.\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   held that under the Due Process Clause, subjecting a foreign corporation to general jurisdiction in every state in which it \"engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business\" was \"unacceptably grasping.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , the exercise of general jurisdiction over a foreign defendant (except in extraordinary circumstances) was limited to where the corporation was \"at home,\" namely, the forums in which the foreign corporation is incorporated and where it maintains its principal place of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pennsylvania has long had a statute which requires a foreign corporation wishing to do business in Pennsylvania to register in Pennsylvania. Correspondingly, Pennsylvania law provides that such registration constitutes a sufficient basis for the exercise of general personal jurisdiction over the foreign corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Federal and state courts in Pennsylvania have struggled to divine the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   to the Pennsylvania registration scheme with mixed results. Building on that jurisprudence, this Court concludes that: (1) the Pennsylvania statutory scheme that requires foreign corporations to register to do business and, therefore, to consent to general personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania, offends the Due Process Clause and is unconstitutional; and (2) the Third Circuit's pre-\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Bane v. Netlink, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   finding that, by registering to do business in Pennsylvania, a foreign corporation consents to general personal jurisdiction, is irretrievably irreconcilable with the teachings of\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , and can no longer stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Jackie Sullivan brought this asbestos personal injury action against 48 Defendants in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on July 25, 2018. She alleges that decedent John Sullivan was exposed\n   to asbestos during his Naval service from October 1967 through January 1980. Plaintiff further alleges that this asbestos exposure caused Sullivan to develop lung cancer which ultimately led to his death. HIC removed the action on August 22, 2018 pursuant to the Federal Officer Removal Statute, 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1442.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Regarding the allegations against HIC, Plaintiff alleges that in 1973, Sullivan was assigned to the U.S.S. Blakely while serving in the Navy as a machinist mate. Plaintiff further contends that an alleged predecessor of HIC, Avondale Shipyard, built the Blakely in Westwego, Louisiana and \"designed its ship to contain asbestos and despite the ability to know of and warn of the hazards of asbestos failed to do so.\" Am. Compl. 8-9 (ECF No. 100). It is undisputed that Sullivan's alleged asbestos exposure aboard the Blakely did not occur in Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most importantly for the purposes of this case, HIC is incorporated and has its principal place of business in Virginia, not in Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania Business Registration Statutory Scheme and Federal Due Process Guarantees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff contends that this Court has general personal jurisdiction over HIC pursuant to 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 411 and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301 because HIC and its alleged predecessors registered to do business in Pennsylvania at various points of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 411 provides in relevant part that a foreign corporation \"may not do business in this Commonwealth until it registers with the department.\" 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 411(a). If a foreign corporation does business in the state without registering, as a penalty, it \"may not maintain an action or proceeding in\" the state. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 411(b). Section 5301 provides in relevant part that registration as a foreign corporation in Pennsylvania \"shall constitute a sufficient basis of jurisdiction to enable the tribunals of this Commonwealth to exercise general personal jurisdiction over such\" entities. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i). Read together, these two statutes provide that, the state will only permit a foreign corporation to \"do business\" in Pennsylvania if it registers and, thus, subjects itself to general personal jurisdiction. The Court will refer to the interplay of these two statutes as the \"Pa. Statutory Scheme.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The concept of due process is deeply rooted in our judicial system, having been imported from England as an essential bulwark against arbitrary deprivations by the crown.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

The Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In order to determine whether this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over HIC, it must first analyze two questions: (1) whether Pennsylvania's long-arm statute provides for the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction, and, if so; (2) whether the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction in this case satisfies the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    IMO Indus., Inc. v.

Pennsylvania's long-arm statute first lists discrete actions performed in-state that create personal jurisdiction including transacting various types of business, entering into contracts, causing harm, owning real property, taking various appointments, applying for licences, and violating laws. 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 5322(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition to these specific instances, the statute also provides that \"the jurisdiction of the tribunals of this Commonwealth shall extend ... to the fullest extent allowed under the Constitution of the United States and may be based on the most minimum contact with this Commonwealth allowed under the Constitution of the United States.\" 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 5322(b). It is with this second section of the long-arm statute that the Court is concerned as the specific acts listed in Section 5322(a) are not implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because Section 5322(b) of Pennsylvania's long-arm statute is coextensive with the Due Process Clause, the Court need only analyze whether jurisdiction is proper under federal Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that \"[f]ederal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons\" but that when a state long-arm statute is co-extensive with the Constitution, the court should inquire whether finding personal jurisdiction \"comports with the limits imposed by federal due process\");\n   <em>\n    Vetrotex Certainteed Corp. v.

This approach to the exercise of general personal jurisdiction continued and was further refined but remained problematic since the general jurisdiction analysis became exceedingly fact specific and idiosyncratically applied. As a result, it was difficult for national corporations to divine where they might be haled into court, and - depending on the extent of their business operations - such corporations could be subject to general jurisdiction\n   in virtually every state, regardless of any connection between the suit and the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tanya J.

The Court held that a foreign corporation is subject to general personal jurisdiction only where it \"is fairly regarded as at home.\" 564 U.S. at 924,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2846/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just three years later, and following the lead of\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court elaborated in\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   that a corporation is typically \"at home\" in only two places: its state of incorporation and the state in which it has its principal place of business.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   137 &amp; 139 n.19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Statutory Scheme to attempt to establish general personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation. This case is on point since: (1) HIC is neither incorporated in nor does it have its principal place of business in Pennsylvania; (2) Plaintiff does not allege any exceptional circumstances; and (3) none of the alleged exposure attributable to HIC occurred in Pennsylvania. Therefore, Plaintiff must turn to the Pa. Statutory Scheme in order to save her assertion of personal jurisdiction over HIC.

Rather, the relevant question here after\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   is a narrow one: does a foreign corporation knowingly and voluntarily consent to general jurisdiction in a state by registering to do business under a statutory regime that conditions the right to do business on the waiver of general jurisdiction?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is axiomatic, and none of the cases discussing this issue dispute, that consent is only valid if it is given both knowingly and voluntarily. The issue is whether this sort of mandatory registration scheme which conditions the ability to do business in a particular state on consent to general personal jurisdiction satisfies these two requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Most courts that have confronted the issue have determined that their state registration statutes do not imply consent to general jurisdiction because, inter alia, the language of the statutes are not explicit in this regard. These courts hold that, at a minimum, any consent to general personal jurisdiction cannot be implied from the mere act of registration, and therefore, the purported consent is not knowingly given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Pa. Statutory Scheme, on the other hand, is unique in that it provides explicitly that by the act of registering to do business in Pennsylvania, the foreign corporation consents to general jurisdiction. Thus, the statutory consent is arguably given knowingly under the Pa. Statutory Scheme in that it is expressly provided for in Section 5301. The question is, in light of the mandatory nature of registration to do business in Pennsylvania, whether the consent to general jurisdiction is voluntary. Below, the Court discusses both registration statutes generally and the Pa. Statutory Scheme specifically, and describes why such schemes do not comport with due process after\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

As a result, under the jurisdictional rubric established in\n   <em>\n    Pennoyer\n   </em>\n   , corporations could not be haled into foreign courts, even for claims that arose in the forum, because they could not physically be served there.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143530\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/619/#p640\">\n    814 F.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So that states could protect their citizens from corporate injury in their jurisdiction, state legislatures began enacting registration statutes codifying the principle that the state could require foreign corporations \"to appoint an in-state agent for service of process and to consent to jurisdiction for claims related to its forum business in return for the privilege of conducting in-state business.\" Rhodes,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 442.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As noted by the Second Circuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A corporation's \"consent\" through registration has thus always been something of a fiction, born of the necessity of exercising jurisdiction over corporations outside of their state of incorporation: Consent was perhaps more of a promise, fairly extracted, to appear in state court on actions by a state's citizens arising from the corporation's operations in the jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143530\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/619/#p640\">\n    814 F.3d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As a result, the Court further concludes that the Third Circuit's pre-\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Bane\n   </em>\n   , finding that, by registering to do business in Pennsylvania, a foreign corporation consents to general personal jurisdiction, is irretrievably irreconcilable with the teachings of\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , and can no longer stand. Under the facts of this case, without the presence of: (1) specific jurisdiction; (2) HIC's voluntary consent; (3) HIC being incorporated in or having its principal place of business in Pennsylvania; or (4) some other extraordinary circumstance, this Court has no personal jurisdiction over HIC. Therefore, the Court grants HIC's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    6th\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    June, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum of Law, and upon consideration of the motions detailed below, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   1.
