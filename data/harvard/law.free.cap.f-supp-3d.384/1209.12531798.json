INTRODUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Christopher Campbell alleges that he suffered racial discrimination while employed by Defendant Department of Human Services, State of Hawaii (\"DHS\"). Given this court's earlier order granting partial judgment on the pleadings, Campbell's remaining claims are a disparate treatment claim and a hostile work environment claim, both under Title VII. Campbell and DHS have filed competing motions for summary judgment on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court concludes that DHS is entitled to summary judgment. The majority of Campbell's allegations of discrimination are time-barred or were not administratively exhausted. For the remaining allegations, Campbell has not demonstrated that the reasons offered by DHS are pretexts for race discrimination. As a result, Campbell's motion is denied, and DHS's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Campbell was employed by DHS in Hilo, Hawaii, from June 2008 until he resigned in July 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 97-1, PageID # 866. He worked as a Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist (\"VRS\"), assisting deaf and hearing-impaired clients. ECF No. 116-1, PageID # 2071. Campbell alleges that, while employed by DHS, he was subjected to \"a discriminatory, hostile work environment\" based on being African-American. ECF No. 1, PageID # 5. His claims focus on the conduct of his supervisor, Alison Lee, and his co-worker, Claire Castro. Campbell alleges that Lee denied him promotions, yelled at and mocked him, threatened to discipline him based on false accusations, and treated him differently from co-workers who were not African-American.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-10. Campbell also alleges that Castro repeatedly used racial slurs, and that no action was taken in response to Campbell's complaints about Castro.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Campbell filed two employment discrimination charges with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission (\"HCRC\"). Campbell filed the first Charge of Discrimination on February 18, 2014 (\"February 2014 Charge\"). ECF No. 101-17. In the February 2014 Charge, Campbell alleged that \"[o]n September 30, 2013, I was falsely accused by [Lee] for avoiding an intake interview with a client,\" and that \"[o]n October 30, 2013, I was passed up for a Temporary Assignment (TA) position for which I previously held.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 1558. The EEOC mailed Campbell a \"Dismissal and Notice of Rights\" on April 29, 2014, which informed Campbell that he had the right to file suit within 90 days of receipt of the notice. ECF No. 101-19, PageID # 1562. The HCRC mailed Campbell a \"Notice of Dismissal and Right to Sue\" on May 9, 2014. ECF No. 101-20, PageID # 1563. Campbell did not file suit within 90 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The second Charge of Discrimination was filed on January 9, 2016, and amended on June 9, 2016 (\"June 2016 Charge\"). ECF Nos. 101-30, 101-31. The June 2016 Charge stated, \"Since December 2014, [Lee] (Asian) has bypassed me for TA positions. The last such action took place on July 14, 2015, when she indicated that [Castro] would be TA between July 15 and 21, 2015.\" ECF No. 101-31, PageID # 1594. Campbell allegedly filed a union grievance over the matter and communicated with Hawaii State Senator Suzanne Chun Oakland about DHS's \"violation of their own discrimination polices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The June 2016 Charge also stated, \"On December 1, 2015, I was placed on a Department Directed Leave of Absence in relation to comments I made about my supervisor. I was allowed to return to work on March 4, 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The EEOC mailed Campbell a \"Dismissal and Notice of Rights\" letter on December 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 97-3, PageID # 888.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 29, 2017, Campbell filed a Complaint against DHS asserting: (1) a race discrimination claim involving an alleged violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e - 2000e-17, (2) a hostile work environment claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) a retaliation claim against him as a whistleblower, brought under chapter 378 of Hawaii Revised Statutes. ECF No. 1, PageID #s 15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 2, 2018, the court granted DHS's motion for partial judgment on the pleadings, determining that the Eleventh Amendment barred Campbell's state law claims against DHS. ECF No. 84. The court dismissed Campbell's state law claims, leaving for adjudication Campbell's Title VII claims of disparate treatment and hostile work environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 6, 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 94, 96. The court heard argument on the motions on March 19, 2019. ECF No. 121. Trial is currently set for July 9, 2019. ECF No. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Campbell argues that DHS violated Title VII by subjecting him to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment on the basis of his race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court addresses both claims in this order and concludes that Campbell raises several allegations of discrimination that are time-barred or that were not administratively exhausted. The remaining allegations may support a prima facia case of disparate treatment, but Campbell fails to establish that the reasons offered by DHS are pretexts for race discrimination. The court therefore denies Campbell's motion and grants DHS's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The court cannot deem these incidents part of the same course of conduct alleged in the June 2016 Charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Because Campbell failed to exhaust these incidents, this court need not determine whether the incidents could be considered adverse employment actions as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reasons.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As discussed above, Campbell may be able to establish that he suffered from adverse employment actions when he was bypassed for the TA position in July 2015 and when he was placed on DDL in December 2015. Assuming that Campbell is able to establish a prima facie case based on these actions, the next step under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework requires DHS to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged conduct.

Because Campbell does not show pretext, his disparate treatment claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Campbell's filings on the summary judgment motions did not clearly articulate that DHS's reasons were pretextual. As a result, before the hearing on the summary judgment motions on March 19, 2019, the court asked Campbell to come to the hearing prepared to \"identify facts in the record indicating that the reasons offered by DHS are pretexts for race discriminations, specifically with respect to the decisions to not assign him the TA position in July 2015 and to place him on DDL in December 2015.\" ECF No. 119, PageID # 3035. The court's prehearing statement also said, \"If Campbell intends to argue that the conduct or statements of Claire Castro support a finding of pretext, he should explain how these two decisions--i.e., the decision to give Castro the July 2015 TA position and the decision to place Campbell on DDL--are attributable to Castro.\" ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   No. 119, PageID # 3035.

July 2015 TA Position.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At the hearing, Campbell's counsel argued that Castro's conduct was evidence that Lee's explanation that she had mistakenly assigned the July 2015 TA position to Castro was pretext of race discrimination. Specifically, he pointed to Castro's use of racial slurs in the office and to instances of Castro's playing loud rap music containing racial slurs. His argument was essentially that, because Lee and Castro had a close relationship, Castro's actions should be attributed to Lee, who was Campbell's supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   However, there is no evidence in the record that Lee knew about Castro's use of racial slurs or playing of rap music. During his deposition, Campbell stated that he complained to Lee about Castro's use of profanity, but was unsure whether he had complained about the rap music that contained racial slurs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q. Have you ever complained to Alison Lee about Claire playing rap music that used the N word?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. I don't know if I complained about that specifically, but in general, I complained about Claire's vulgarity, her using inappropriate language in the office. A lot of it revolved around the break room, where she would--every other word out of her mouth was \"fuck,\" \"fucking\" this, and loud enough so that my clients could all hear what was going on in the break room. And it was something that I spoke to [Lee] about on several occasions, either through email, or I might have mentioned it to her in person; but I know on several emails, I did bring this to her attention, so she was well aware of what type of language and vulgarity that Claire was bringing into that office either through her own mouth or through the music she played.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   ECF No. 97-8, PageID # 1085.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Campbell's above deposition testimony about profanity does not go to race issues. Moreover, even if Castro's alleged conduct did exhibit racial animus, the present record does not support Campbell's argument that Lee knew about, condoned, and/or was influenced by the conduct. Campbell has not offered any \"specific and substantial\" evidence of pretext with respect to Lee's decision not to assign him the July 2015 TA position.\n   <em>\n    Villiarimo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396804\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/1054/#p1063\">\n    281 F.3d at 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Godwin v.

However, beyond this general statement, Suzuki did not provide any information indicating that anyone complained to Lee about the music or that Lee was present when the music was played. When asked whether Castro ever said the \"N word\" in front of Lee, she responded, \"No, or not that I am aware of.

Kobayashi appears to have complained to Lee once in August 2014, which would fall outside of the applicable time period for Campbell's claim. Moreover, Campbell provides no further detail regarding Kobayashi's alleged complaint, so the court is unable to determine how Lee responded to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Given the lack of timely evidence that Lee or any other supervisor knew about Castro's alleged conduct, Campbell has not shown that DHS would be liable for that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Other Allegations Contributing to Hostile Work Environment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Campbell's motion also appears to argue that other conduct contributed to the creation of a hostile environment at DHS (dates included where discernible from the record):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   \u2022 April 22, 2015: \"Plaintiff's supervisor gave Claire Castro the authority to change the entry code to the office and did so without telling the Plaintiff.\" ECF No. 96-1, PageID # 834.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   \u2022 \"In 2016, the Plaintiff's supervisor, Ms. Allison Lee continually threatened him with discipline for insubordination based on misrepresentations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   \u2022 May 18, 2015: \"Ms. Suzuki noticed that her co-workers, including Alison Lee were 'shunning' the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   \u2022 [Undated]: \"Ms. Lee and Ms. Castro spread the false rumor through the office that the Plaintiff was violent and dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   \u2022 [Undated]: \"Plaintiff changed his work schedule to avoid Ms. Lee and Ms. Castro and close his door at work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 835.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   \u2022 [Undated]: \"Ms. Lee also ordered the Plaintiff to stop taking on-line sign language class which was directly related to assisting the hearing impaired clients he was assigned to.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Most of these allegations are repeated from Campbell's disparate treatment claim. As discussed above, these incidents are either time-barred or were not administratively exhausted. The allegations that Lee \"shunned\" Campbell and that Lee and Castro spread rumors about Campbell are specific to the hostile work environment claim. However, they are not \"reasonably related\" to the claims raised in the June 2016 Charge and therefore were not exhausted. Nor is it clear that these relate to race, or any other Title VII category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
