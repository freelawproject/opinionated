No. 47). The Government filed a response in opposition (Doc. No. 53). On December 10, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. Thereafter, the parties filed post-hearing briefs (Doc. Nos. 87, 92). For the reasons discussed below, Defendant's Motion to Suppress will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL FINDINGS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 26, 2015, when preparing for release on parole from a Tennessee prison, Defendant signed a Parole Certificate that contained conditions of his parole. (Government Exhibit 1; Doc. No. 80 (\"Tr.\") at 96-98.) One of the conditions stated, \"I agree to a search, without a warrant, of my person, vehicle, property, or place of residence by any Probation/Parole officer or law enforcement officer, at any time without reasonable suspicion.\" (Government Exhibit 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From May 2016 to November 2016, Defendant's assigned Parole Officer was Michael Pasqualetto. (Tr. at 94.) On July 11, 2016, Defendant provided a required Monthly Reporting Form to Officer Pasqualetto. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-99; Government Exhibit 2.) The Monthly Reporting Form stated that Defendant's residential address was 317 Tillman Lane, Nashville, Tennessee. (Tr. at 99; Government Exhibit 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 4, 2016, Officer Pasqualetto went to 317 Tillman Lane with a team of parole officers to conduct a parole search, which was prompted by a phone call he had received approximately one week earlier and a second call he had received a day or two earlier. (Tr. at 102-07.) When the parole officers arrived at the Tillman address, they encountered an individual who informed them that Defendant was not home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108.) Officer Pasqualetto then called Defendant, who answered the phone, and Defendant agreed to meet Officer Pasqualetto at the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108-09.) Defendant arrived shortly thereafter and encountered Officer Pasqualetto in the front yard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Pasqualetto then informed Defendant that he was going to perform a search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111.) Defendant responded by stating that he had moved out two weeks ago to another residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-12.) Defendant provided Officer Pasqualetto with an address that \"had some threes in it\" and the street name \"Chesapeake.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112.) When asked where he had been living at the Tillman address, Defendant responded that he had been living in the basement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Pasqualetto asked Defendant for consent to search the Tillman address, and Defendant provided consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officers then looked in the basement and noted that it showed no sign of any recent habitation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16.) Defendant was again asked which room was his, and he did not change his answer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116.) The officers next went into a bedroom and found Defendant's driver license,\n   mail, and Officer Pasqualetto's business card. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-19.) Officer Pasqualetto picked up the comforter on the bed and three bags of heroin fell out of it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-20.) A scale was also found in that bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118.) Metro Nashville Police Department (\"MNPD\") officers at some point arrived to assist because they, and not parole officers, can seize contraband and collect evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75, 106, 122, 148, 174.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MNPD Officer Ryan Cagle placed Defendant under arrest and searched his person incident to that arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Pursuant to that search, Officer Cagle seized Defendant's keys from his clothing pocket. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Parole Officers Haley Howell and Tiffany Rodd searched Defendant's vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172.) From the vehicle, they recovered several cell phones and a box containing a large sum of cash. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173-74, 216.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the search was taking place, Defendant was seated on the front porch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174.) Officer Howell noticed that Defendant had his cell phone in his hand and was in the process of sending a message, which appeared to be instructing another person to hide something. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175.) Officer Howell called to someone to take the phone out of Defendant's hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175.) Officer Rodd then looked at text messages and photographs on the phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219.) While Officer Rodd was handling the phone, the same number repeatedly called and sent text messages to the phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Rodd then gave the phone to MNPD officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, 220.) When Defendant's phone was handed to Detective Seth England, it was opened to the number that Officer Rodd had observed calling and texting Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) Detective England gave the phone to Detective Bobby Young who ran it through a Nashville Electric Service (\"NES\") database on his laptop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Pasqualetto had already relayed to Detective England that Defendant had provided an address for an additional residence on Chesapeake, albeit apparently one with a street number that could not possibly have matched an actual address on Chesapeake because it did not have enough digits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, 122-23.) Detective England testified that the street name provided was Chesapeake but that the number provided had three digits even though all addresses on Chesapeake have four or more digits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) The officers decided to run the number through an NES database to see if it would \"come back to potentially anybody that he might be staying with or any addresses in relation to the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The number was found to be associated with an address on Chesapeake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26, 136-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on this information, Officers Howell and Rodd determined that Defendant was also possibly residing at a secondary address on Chesapeake, and that there may be a risk that evidence was being destroyed at that address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177-78, 222.) Officers Howell and Rodd went to that address, followed by MNPD officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Officers Howell and Rodd arrived at 3565 Chesapeake Drive, Officer Howell knocked on the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179.) An individual, who appeared to be a minor, answered the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The officers asked whether an adult was home, and a woman (the \"twenty year-old female\") came to the door who stated that she was twenty years old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179-80.) That individual stated that Defendant had been \"staying\" at the residence for approximately two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180, 224.) Officers entered the residence and were directed towards a locked bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180-81.) A key on Defendant's key ring that was taken from his person was used to unlock the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   40-41, 181, 224-25.) Parole officers entered the room and began to search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182, 225.) Officer Howell found a shoebox containing heroin and scales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182.) Officer Rodd recovered a box full of money and a handgun. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183, 225.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The fruits of the August 4, 2016 search of 317 Tillman Lane form the basis of Count One (possession with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin). (Doc. No. 1.) The fruits of the August 4, 2016 search of 3565 Chesapeake Drive form the basis of Count Two (possession with intent to distribute a detectable amount of heroin), Count Three (felon in possession of a firearm), and Count Four (possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant has moved to suppress the contraband found at both locations as well as Defendant's statement that he had moved out of the Tillman address two weeks ago to an address that \"had some threes in it\" and was off Chesapeake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Search of 317 Tillman Lane\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the purposes of this motion, the Court assumes, without deciding, that Defendant has standing to challenge the search of 317 Tillman Lane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A person serving the remains of his sentence on parole has limited protections under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Samson v.

Defendant argues that the Court should apply the two-part test set forth in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Doxey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351488\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/692/\">\n    833 F.3d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2016) to determine whether the search violated Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. In\n   <em>\n    Doxey\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit stated that a two-step test applies to evaluate the search of a parolee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351488\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351488\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/692/\">\n    at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit examines whether: (1) the relevant regulation or statute pursuant to which the search was conducted satisfies the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement; and (2) the facts of the search itself satisfy the regulation or statute at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351488\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351488\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/692/\">\n    at 703-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant concedes that he was on parole and subject to the above conditions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48 at 1.) Based on this evidence, the Court finds that the search of 317 Tillman Lane was a reasonable parole-authorized search.

These questions include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Does the individual's statement that Defendant \"stayed\" at 3565 Chesapeake Drive mean that Defendant lived or stayed overnight there? Although Detective England's statement in his affidavit in support of the arrest warrants can be interpreted to assert that \"staying\" means living (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendant Exhibit 1), the Court is unaware of any evidence in the record on this issue-such as evidence of personal belongings, receipt of mail, or car parked outside the residence-indicating that Defendant lived or stayed overnight at 3565 Chesapeake Drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 How often did Defendant \"stay\" at 3565 Chesapeake Drive? The Court cannot determine the answer to this question from the uncorroborated statement of the twenty year-old female who stated that Defendant stayed at 3565 Chesapeake Drive from \"time to time.\" (Tr. at 238.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 What was the basis of her purported knowledge that Defendant \"stayed\" there? At most, the Court can only infer two alternative possible bases: (a) acquaintance with the identity of Defendant and personal observation of his presence on site; and/or (b) second-hand information conveyed by someone else, perhaps her mother (inasmuch as she told the officers that Defendant had been dating her mother). It is unclear which of these (if either) was the ostensible basis. The record does not reflect any basis for knowledge or the soundness of any such basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 When was the last time Defendant \"stayed\" at 3565 Chesapeake Drive? Defendant fails to discuss, and the Court is unaware of any evidence in the record, on this issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Were any personal belongings of Defendant present in 3565 Chesapeake Drive? Defendant fails to discuss, and the Court is unaware of any evidence in the record on, this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Was Defendant an owner or lessor of 3565 Chesapeake Drive? Was Defendant providing the twenty year-old female, her supposed mother, or anyone else any compensation in return for staying at 3565 Chesapeake Drive? Again, there is a deficiency in the record on this issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Although the record states that Defendant \"\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   recently\n   <em>\n    been\n   </em>\n   dating\" the mother of the individual who spoke with the officers (Tr. at 238) (emphasis added), what was the nature (including whether it can be considered personal or business and the the length of time) of Defendant's relationship with the mother at the time of the search? Again, the record contains no evidence on this issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Was Defendant able to come and go into the residence freely? Once again, no evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Did Defendant have the right to exclude others from the residence and/or any part of it, including the particular room in which the officers conducted the search at issue? Again, there is no evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The only relevant information about which the Court can be reasonably sure is the following: (1) in a room at 317 Tillman, officers found documents belonging to Defendant, together with male clothing and shoes; (2) at 317 Tillman Lane, Defendant told the parole officers that he had moved to a particular address on Chesapeake (likely not 3565 Chesapeake and perhaps not an actual existing street address at all) for about two weeks (Tr. at 24, 112); (3) the individual who spoke with the officers at the door at 3565 Chesapeake Drive, told the officers that Defendant had \"been staying there\" and dating her mother (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202, 238); (4) Detective England stated in his arrest warrant that Defendant \"stays at\" 3565 Chesapeake Drive (Defendant Exhibit 1); (5) Defendant had a key to the room at 3565 Chesapeake Drive in which the search was conducted (Tr. at 40-41, 181, 224-25.); (6) in the room at 3565 Chesapeake Drive, the officers found a picture (or two) of Defendant (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46; Government Exhibits 26-27); and (7) in the room at 3565 Chesapeake Drive, the officers found evidence suggesting the carrying of a heroin-trafficking business, namely heroin, scales, cash, and a gun (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182-83, 225).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Albeit a close call, the Court finds that Defendant has not met his burden to establish standing. The exhaustive list of questions that the Court discusses above are one indication that Defendant has failed to provide enough evidence to the Court to demonstrate standing by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the evidence Defendant has in fact submitted to the Court, discussed above, falls short of establishing an expectation of privacy in 3565 Chesapeake Drive. The evidence amounts to: (a) terse, out-of-court statements from Defendant to the effect that he had moved out of 317 Tillman and into 3565 Chesapeake; (b) terse, out-of-court statements from one other person (with an unspecified basis of knowledge) that Defendant was \"staying\" at 3565 Chesapeake and had a relationship a woman who perhaps resided there; (c) testimony that Defendant possessed a key to a room inside 3565 Chesapeake Drive in which officer found a photograph of Defendant and items suggest a possible connection to drug-trafficking operations; (d) and\n   testimony regarding the discovery of items at 317 Tillman suggesting that Defendant possibly still could be staying overnight there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This evidence is insufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence the proposition that Defendant was an overnight guest at the address or that he used the premises for a predominantly personal or social, rather than business, purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, categories (c) and (d) plainly are inconsistent with this proposition, except for Defendant's photograph-but even that is explainable as a keepsake not of Defendant in the capacity of overnight guest, but rather of Defendant as (illicit) business operator or of the apparent resident-mother who was reportedly dating Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As for Defendant's claim to have moved recently to 3565 Chesapeake from 317 Tillman, he made that statement at a time when he had a substantial incentive to try (even if hopelessly) to distance himself from 317 Tillman Lane because at the time a search was imminent and heroine was located there, just waiting to be found immediately. Moreover, from Defendant's text messages, there is reason to believe that Defendant was interested in keeping relevant information and evidence from the authorities. (Tr. at 23, 52-53, 115-16). In short, in this context, Defendant's claim of moving to 3565 Chesapeake is-though not inherently incredible or necessarily untrue-not reliable based on the current record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the hearsay statements of the twenty year-old are not reliable either, given their lack of specificity and foundation of knowledge. They cannot reliably stand for the proposition that Defendant was \"staying\" at 3565 Chesapeake, let alone staying there to the degree and in the manner to engender a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises. It is certainly possible that he was, but the Court cannot conclude that he was, because this has not been established by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court would be applying speculation to the present record if it found otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, because he lacks Fourth Amendment standing with respect to 3565 Chesapeake Drive, Defendant's\n   motion to suppress the evidence from will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendant's Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant argues that his statement to Officer Pasqualetto that he moved to a new address should be suppressed because Officer Pasqualetto did not read Defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights before Defendant made that statement. However, the evidence in the record demonstrates that Defendant's statement was not the result of a custodial interrogation, as Defendant volunteered that he had been staying elsewhere, and therefore Officer Pasqualetto was not required to advise Defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

(Tr. at 150, 160-61.) On the contrary, Officer Pasqualetto was under the impression that Defendant was residing at the Tillman address until Defendant volunteered that he had been staying somewhere else during their conversation. Officer Pasqualetto testified, \"[Defendant] told me that he was not living there, he moved out two weeks ago. Kind of spontaneous statement.\" (Tr. at 150.) Moreover, this statement occurred before the search of 317 Tillman Lane and before Defendant waited while the officers performed the search of that address. The Court finds no viable basis to discount Officer Pasquletto's testimony on this issue.

Defendant is also required to submit a Monthly Reporting Form which requires him to give an updated residential address. (Tr. at 98-99; Government Exhibit 2.) Implicit in these conditions is that Defendant has a requirement to inform his parole officer of his residential address and that Defendant does not have to be provided his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights for his parole officer to ask for his address.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Defendant, for the first time in his post-hearing brief, also appears to move to suppress all statements he made in response to officers' questioning during the searches because he was in custody and not advised of his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights. Defendant specifically states, \"if Pasqualetto or any other parole or police officer conducted a custodial interrogation of Shelton, he/she was required to notify Mr. Shelton of his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights.\" However, Defendant does not sufficiently develop this argument.
