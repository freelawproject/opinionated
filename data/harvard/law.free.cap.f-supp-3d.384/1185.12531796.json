Plaintiff filed an opposition to Defendant's motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 11.) For the reasons set forth more fully below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1.d.1, the Court finds the instant matter suitable for determination on the papers and without oral argument. Accordingly, the hearing date of June 20, 2019 at 2 p.m. is vacated as to this motion only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Kathryn Kailikole (\"Plaintiff\") brings seven causes of action, under state and federal law, for retaliation and disability discrimination against her previous employer, Palomar Community College District\n   (\"Defendant\"). (Doc. No. 7.) Plaintiff alleges that on December 14, 2017 she was \"mysteriously and suddenly placed on paid leave.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) She was told she could not speak to anyone at the college and was not given information about why she was removed, other than that it involved an investigation related to a confidentiality issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Plaintiff remained on paid leave for five months without ever being informed of the nature of the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's retaliation claims are rooted in her participation as a witness in an investigation against Takashi Nakajima (\"Nakajima\") and Arthur Gerwig (\"Gerwig\"), who were professors at Palomar Community College District accused of sexual harassment and race discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.) In May 2017, Plaintiff received a report from a faculty member about their racist and sexually harassing conduct, and reported the incident to Shawna Cohen, the District's Manager of the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office and a Deputy Title IX Coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) On November 1, 2017, an investigator for the school district concluded that Plaintiff was credible, and Nakajima and Gerwig were guilty of violating the College's anti-harassment policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) No action was taken against these professors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff inquired and discussed with other faculty in November 2017 as to why action was not being taken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On December 12, 2017, the District placed Nakjima and Gerwig on one month of unpaid leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff was subsequently placed on paid leave on December 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff alleges that her computer was searched, without her consent, to acquire evidence that would discredit her report of Nakajima's and Gerwig's racist and sexually harassing conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Through this search, an email dated December 8, 2017 was obtained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This email contained a forwarded message from the Plaintiff to another faculty member about an incident involving Nakajima and Gerwig. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The faculty member then forwarded the email to his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) Based on this conduct, the District investigator concluded that Plaintiff was part of a conspiracy to leak confidential information about Nakajima and Gerwig outside the College. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's disability claims are rooted in her informing the Defendant of her disability and her subsequent termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 11, 14.) On May 5, 2017, Plaintiff alleges that she needed to leave a meeting because she believed she was having a heart attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff was instead having a panic attack and was later diagnosed with anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She suffers from feelings of being overwhelmed, helplessness, and nervousness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also has panic attacks and suffers from vertigo and cysts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The effects of her anxiety affect her daily activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff informed Dr. Jack Kahn, the Vice-President of Instruction, that she suffered from anxiety in May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff later met with Dr. Kahn on December 4, 2017 and discussed her anxiety with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Dr. Kahn \"assured Plaintiff that she was an 'incredibly valuable member of the team' and that he was dedicated to providing her with his 'complete support.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Less than two weeks after this meeting, Plaintiff was put on paid leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, the instant action is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Higgins-Williams\n   </em>\n   since no facts have been presented here that indicate that Plaintiff's stress and anxiety relates to working under a particular supervisor. Additionally, no facts indicate that the stress was specifically \"work-related.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she first became aware of her anxiety in early May 2017, after having a panic attack at work. (Doc. No. 7 \u00b6 4.) In May 2017, Plaintiff met with Dr. Khan to inform him of this anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It was not until December 2017 that she \"discussed her anxiety with Dr. Khan and expressed concern about her overwhelming workload, which included duties that are not typically part of the Dean's job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 68.)

These two individualized concerns, in context, do not appear to hint that Plaintiff's anxiety and stress stemmed from her workload. Rather, she had anxiety, and in addition, had concerns about her workload. Because the Court must accept all factual allegations as true, we must accept Plaintiff's assertion that these are individualized, unrelated concerns as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedars-Sinai Med.

Additionally, Plaintiff discussed her disability with Dr. Khan during a May 2017 meeting. (Doc. No. 7 \u00b6 4.)
