Chad Grams' tractor trailer collided with a car driven by Byron Greene at the intersection of Benning Road and Maryland Avenue. Mr. Grams' employer, USA Truck, Inc., admits that he was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident and now moves for summary judgment on Mr. Greene's direct negligence claims against the company. Mr. Greene, however, seeks to amend his Complaint to add punitive damages against both Defendants, citing Mr. Grams' poor driving record. For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Mr. Greene's Motion to Amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Greene stopped at a red light at the intersection of Benning Road NE and Maryland\n   Avenue NE on the evening of March 30, 2016.

USA Truck admits that Mr. Grams caused the accident while acting within the scope of his employment. Answer at 1, ECF No. 8.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This was not Mr. Grams' first strike as a driver, and Mr. Greene cites Mr. Grams' driving record and criminal history to justify amending his Complaint to add claims for punitive damages against Mr. Grams and USA Truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. to Amend (\"Mot. to Amend\") at 1-2, ECF No. 23.

The Maryland Court of Appeals found that \"[t]hree prior instances of [DUI], coupled with an afternoon of drinking on the day of the accident\" did not alone establish a case for punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019394\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/331/720/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019394\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/331/720/\">\n    at 726-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Mr. Greene's theory, it was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   reckless for Mr. Grams-or anyone with a similarly blotched record-to be driving at all. But that cannot be the law. Even with his history, Mr. Grams has a valid commercial driver's license, which requires more proficiencies than a standard driver's license, from the State of Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer to Interrog. at 2, ECF No. 24-3. The Court will not second guess Minnesota's decision that Mr. Grams'\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   drive safely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Of course, even licensed drivers may engage in conduct so outrageous that punitive damages are warranted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conklin v.

True, Mr. Grams failed to stop at a red light. Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6 9; Answer at 1. But something more is necessary to warrant punitive damages, and Mr. Greene has pointed to no other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Greene's punitive damages claims against USA Truck are also deficient, so any exception to the\n   <em>\n    McHaffie\n   </em>\n   Rule does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071830\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/736/8/#p9\">\n    736 F.

Not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   USA Truck tried to determine Mr. Grams' fitness to drive before hiring him. And USA Truck's corporate representative testified that if the company knew about Mr. Grams' DUI and felony convictions, it likely would not have hired him. Lowry Dep. at 4-5, 9, ECF No. 23-3. But the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act only requires motor carriers to investigate a driver's safety performance history for the preceding three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20391.23\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . USA Truck's hiring standards went beyond this baseline. It investigated Mr. Grams' driving record and criminal history for the preceding seven years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lowry Dep. at 4-5. Despite this more-than-required\n   inquiry, nothing suggests that USA Truck learned about Mr. Grams' decades old DUI and felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Greene cites no authority suggesting that a motor carrier acts with malice or with a reckless disregard for others' safe by failing to investigate an applicant's entire criminal history and driving record. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   the court determined that contending that an employer failed to investigate properly an employee's background was not enough to warrant punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071830\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/736/8/#p9\">\n    736 F. Supp. at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nor has Mr. Greene cited authority suggesting that hiring someone whose only serious convictions are decades old necessarily qualifies as \"outrageous, grossly fraudulent, or reckless toward\" others' safety. And D.C. tort law militates against such a proposition. The District has mandated that employers should be circumspect about inquiring into an applicant's criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1341\">\n    D.C.

In the seven years before USA Truck hired him, Mr. Grams had six citations for speeding and other traffic infractions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12. That record is troubling. Still, USA Truck's decision to hire Mr. Grams does not amount to malice or reckless disregard for others' safety. Indeed, Mr. Greene does not suggest that these infractions were enough to disqualify Mr. Grams' from driving under the FMCSA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20383.51\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 383.51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while Mr. Grams had a prior accident while driving for USA Truck, the company retained him only after requiring him to attend training. Grams Dep. at 9-10. There is simply no basis to assert that USA Truck acted with evil intent, actual malice, or with reckless disregard for the safety of other when it hired, retained and entrusted its truck to Mr. Grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It follows that Mr. Greene's Motion to Amend must be denied. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) allows for liberal amendment of pleadings, \"when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). But if amendment would be futile, the Court may in its discretion deny such a motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vreven v.
