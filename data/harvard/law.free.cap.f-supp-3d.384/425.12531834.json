Bello's employment had resigned in 2015 after an allegation that he had sexually harassed a Hospital employee. (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 9) at 1-2 &amp; n.2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 30, 2017, Bello returned to the Hospital. He was wearing a white doctor's coat and a Hospital identification badge, which had not been taken from him when his employment was terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2) Hidden under Bello's white coat was an AR-15 rifle and extra magazines, which he had purchased from Defendant Upstate, a firearms shop in Schenectady, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bello was also carrying a Tropicana orange juice container filled with gasoline, which he used to set fire to the Hospital's 16th floor nursing station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After arriving at the Hospital on June 30, 2017, Bello shot Plaintiff; killed another doctor; and wounded four other members of the medical staff and a patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2) The bullet that hit Plaintiff entered his abdomen and exited his right thigh, \"requiring surgical procedures and treatment ... at Defendant Hospital and Mt. Sinai Hospital\" from June 30, 2017 to July 21, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2) After his rampage, Bello killed himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This was not the first shooting incident at the Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 11, 2011, a gang member shot into the Hospital's emergency room, hitting a nurse and a security guard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that, after the 2011 incident, the Hospital was on \"notice that its security system was ineffective,\" but it did nothing to improve it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also alleges that the Hospital \"failed to take proper action\" after it learned that Bello had sexually harassed another Hospital employee and should have taken custody of Bello's identification badge when he resigned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As for Upstate, Plaintiff alleges that it sold Bello, a New York City resident, an AR-15 rifle on June 22, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5) According to Plaintiff, that sale constitutes negligent entrustment in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B), because Upstate was on notice that AR-15 rifles are \"the semi-automatic weapon of choice in ... mass death and casualty shootings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7) Plaintiff also alleges that Upstate was required to - but did not - contact the New York City Police Department before selling Bello the rifle to determine whether Bello had a New York City permit for the weapon.

Attached to Jarmon's affidavit are the following documents: (1) the Hospital's workers' compensation policy as of June 30, 2017 (Dkt.

The Administrative Code sets forth municipal rules, however, and Plaintiff has not shown that the violation of such rules - as opposed to the violation of a statute - constitutes negligence\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that Upstate's alleged violation of the New York City Administrative Code constitutes a violation of the Gun Control Act. The Gun Control Act makes it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector to sell or deliver ... (b) any firearm to any person in any State where the purchase or possession by such person of such firearm would be in violation of any State law or any published ordinance applicable at the place of sale, delivery or other disposition, unless the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the purchase or possession would not be in violation of such State law or such published ordinance....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As set forth above, the Gun Control Act addresses a sale or delivery that is unlawful \"at the place of sale, delivery or other disposition.\" Here, Bello purchased the AR-15 in Schenectady, not in New York City. New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 303 has no applicability in Schenectady, where the firearm was purchased. Plaintiff argues, however, that the Gun Control Act prohibits any \"other disposition\" of a firearm, and because \"Upstate Guns knew that Bello was a resident of NYC ... the disposition of Upstate Gun's transaction with Bello was NYC.\" (Pltf. Br. (Dkt. No. 38) at 8) Plaintiff cites no authority in support of this interpretation of the statute, however, and the weight of the authority is against Plaintiff's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Huddleston v.
