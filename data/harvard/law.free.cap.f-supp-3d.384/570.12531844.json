Plaintiff allegedly experienced severe pain and discomfort following the insertion of the Product and underwent a revision surgery due to the failure of the Product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff asserts negligence claims against defendants on the basis that they failed to exercise reasonable care in the design, research, manufacture, marketing, testing, advertisement, supply, promotion, packaging, sale, and distribution of the Product. She also asserts defendants failed to exercise due care in the labeling of the Product and failed to issue to consumers and healthcare providers adequate warnings of the risk of serious bodily injury resulting from its use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as lost wages, disgorgement of profits, restitution, attorneys' fees, interest, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants removed the case on May 18, 2018, and answered on May 25, 2018. On August 31, 2018, following the parties' submission of individual reports and discovery plans pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f), and following a telephonic scheduling conference before a magistrate judge, the court entered case management order allowing defendants to file a summary judgment motion on the ground that all claims are preempted by federal law, and staying discovery pending entry of an order disposing of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 15, 2018, plaintiff filed the instant motion to vacate the court's August 31, 2018, order staying discovery. That same date, defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment, relying upon a memorandum in support, statement of material facts, and a declaration of Kathy J. Brocato (\"Brocato\"), which incorporates and describes business records maintained by defendant DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (\"DePuy\"), including medical records of the Product that is the subject of the instant dispute, and the history of regulation and pre-market approval of the Product by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant motion for discovery, as corrected, on December 3, 2018, relying upon a memorandum of law, which is identical in substance to her memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, filed separately on November 19, 2018. In support thereof, plaintiff relies upon a declaration by counsel for plaintiff, Margaret E. Cordner (\"Cordner\"), as well as proposed interrogatories and requests for production of documents. Defendants responded in opposition to the motion for discovery and replied in support of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 15, 2019, the court directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing, in light of the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Burrell v.

(Defs' Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 1; Brocato Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28). Following approval, defendant DePuy submitted to FDA several supplements to the Product, in February and May 2000, July 2007, and February and June 2009. (Defs' Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 2; Brocato Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 28-37).

She asserts that the MDA does not preempt her state law negligence claim based upon breach of \"the duty to provide the FDA with 'Adverse Reaction' and 'Device Defect reports' \" and the duty \"to report to the FDA\" information suggesting \"that a device ... may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.\" (Opp. to S.J.

Rather, North Carolina law recognizes a duty to warn only users or medical practitioners in certain circumstances. For example, North Carolina law provides a cause of action for \"failure to provide adequate warning or instruction,\" where \"[a]fter the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller, the manufacturer or seller became aware of or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known that the product posed a substantial risk of harm to a reasonably foreseeable user or consumer.\" N.C.

Such dismissal is with prejudice because the court determines independently that, as a matter of law, all remaining claims asserted in the complaint are preempted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/#p318\">\n    552 U.S. at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/#p318\">\n    128 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming summary judgment of claims \"interpreted\n   ... to assert that [the defendant's] device violated state tort law notwithstanding compliance with the relevant federal requirements\");\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710874\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/569/#p578\">\n    670 F.3d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that products liability claims for negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty are preempted by the MDA);\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p347\">\n    531 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p347\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"[s]tate-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud\"); Thus defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all claims asserted in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   3. Discovery\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In her motion to vacate the court's scheduling order and motion for discovery, plaintiff argues she should be allowed a period of discovery on the issue of preemption before the court decides defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff proposes interrogatories and requests for production related to the design, manufacture, and warnings associated with the Product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) provides that \"[i]f a non-movant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In this case, plaintiff has not demonstrated that discovery is essential to justify her opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The court's preemption determination herein turns upon the simple undisputed fact that the Product is a medical device granted premarket approval by the FDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/#p318\">\n    552 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   317-320 &amp; 330,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/#p318\">\n    128 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (Defs' Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 1; Brocato Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28-37). None of the proposed discovery is directed to this fact, nor does plaintiff assert that additional discovery will provide a basis to dispute this fact. Indeed, the Rule 56(d) declaration of plaintiff's counsel acknowledges \"the Product's PMA [premarket approval] and subsequent supplemental approval.\" (Cordner Decl. \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Rather, plaintiff seeks discovery \"that could be used to challenge the integrity of\" FDA's premarket approval of the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For example, plaintiff seeks discovery regarding whether defendants' \"submissions to the FDA were timely, truthful and complete.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12(e)). Plaintiff seeks information regarding Product development, history, reports and warnings, as well as communications about the device with FDA and healthcare providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). A challenge to the integrity of FDA's premarket approval of the Product, however, is itself preempted under\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p347\">\n    531 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   349 n. 4 &amp; 350,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p347\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating \"it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants who are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions\"; and \"State-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud consistently with the Administration's judgment and objectives\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, the discovery sought is inapposite to the court's resolution of defendants' motion for summary judgment. Therefore, plaintiff's motion to vacate and motion for discovery must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on the foregoing, defendants' motion for summary judgment (DE 28) is GRANTED. Plaintiff's motion to vacate order staying discovery (DE 27) and motion for discovery (DE 43) are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The clerk is DIRECTED to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   SO ORDERED, this the 28th day of May, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The court constructively has amended the caption of this order to reflect dismissal by notice of voluntary dismissal previously filed in state court of defendants designated as Zimmer Biomet, Inc., Zimmer Orthopaedic Surgical Products, Inc., Biomet, Inc., Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., and Smith &amp; Nephew, Inc.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    As discussed further herein, plaintiff expressly limits her negligence claims to a theory of breach of duty \"to warn and warranty.\" (Pl's Supp. Br.
