The \"any competent court\" language also appears in the \"Risk Details\" section of the Policy that summarizes the Choice of Law and Jurisdiction provision (Dkt. #5-1 at p. 3). Oddly, the \"Risk Details\" section does not contain the \"of Texas\" language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Black's Law Dictionary defines a \"Court of Competent Jurisdiction\" as \"[a] court that has the power and authority to do a particular act; one recognized by law as possessing the right to adjudicate a controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Court of Competent Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).

Further, nothing in the \"any competent court\" sentence indicates that the parties agreed only to litigate in Texas state court or that Defendants waived their removal rights. Based on the plain reading of the \"any competent court\" language and the diversity of citizenship discussion above, this Court qualifies as a competent court in the United States that has the power and authority recognized by law to adjudicate the parties' dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Other Courts have reached similar conclusions analyzing comparable language.

Unfortunately, two additional clauses of the Policy further muddy the water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Service of Suit Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The \"Service of Suit Clause (U.S.A.)\" first provides a different version of the \"any competent court\" language before specifically addressing removal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   It is agreed that in the event of the failure of the Underwriters hereon to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Underwriters hereon, at the request of the Insured (or Reinsured), will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nothing in this Clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Underwriters' rights to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any State in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Dkt. #5-1 at p. 23) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The first emphasized sentence has two impacts. First, it reinforces the \"any competent court\" language found in the Risk Details and Choice of Law and Venue provisions as the parties again express their intent to litigate disputes anywhere in the United States, not simply Texas state courts. Second, unlike the \"any competent court\" language found in the other provisions, in this sentence, one party agrees to submit to the venue chosen by the other party. Read alone, this clause could be\n   construed as a different method of waiving Defendants' removal rights under\n   <em>\n    New Orleans\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nutmeg\n   </em>\n   , 931 F.2d at 15-16 ;\n   <em>\n    New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , 376 F.3d at 504 (emphasis added) (\"A party may waive its rights by explicitly stating that it is doing so,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     by allowing the other party the right to choose venue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , or by establishing an exclusive venue within the contract.\"). However, the next emphasized sentence specifically reserves Defendants' removal rights. Therefore, at least in the Service of Suit Clause, Defendants explicitly reserved their removal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Harmonizing the Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To summarize, the \"of Texas\" language suggests the parties agreed to exclusively litigate their claims in Texas state court. The first \"any competent court\" language found in the Risk Details and Choice of Law and Jurisdiction provisions indicates the parties agreed to litigate their claims in any competent court within the United States-federal or state, within or outside of Texas. Defendants then appear to waive their removal rights in the second \"any competent court\" language found in the Service of Suit Clause by agreeing to submit to Plaintiffs' venue choice. Yet, the Service of Suit clause then specifically states that no language in the Clause constitutes a waiver of Defendants' removal rights. The Court must attempt to harmonize the provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Federal law governs the enforceability of jurisdictional agreements while state law governs the interpretation of such clauses.\n   <em>\n    Weber v.

This proposed harmonization is not valid for three reasons. First, Plaintiffs' proposal renders the first condition superfluous as the second condition alone requires the parties to file cases exclusively in Texas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phila.

Third, Plaintiffs' proposal changes the language of the Policy. The Policy states, \"each party agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any competent court in the United States of America.\" The clause does not read, \"disputes must be heard in a court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs' contend \"the most obvious purpose\" of the \"any competent court\" language \"is to clarify that disputes would be subject to resolution in a judicial, rather than an arbitral forum.\" (Dkt. #10 at p. 4). Yet, the Policy includes an \"Arbitration\" provision that provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Upon any controversy arising out of or relating to the rights and obligations owed under this Policy, including the effect of any applicable statutes or common law upon the contractual obligations otherwise owed, the Underwriters or any \"Insured\" may request that the dispute be subjected to binding arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Dkt. #5-1 at p. 18). Consequently, the Policy contemplates that disputes could be subject to a judicial or arbitral forum, contrary to Plaintiffs' suggested reading of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs focus on the Service of Suit Clause language providing, \"Nothing in this Clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Underwriters' rights ... to remove an action to a United States District Court....\" Focusing on the \"nothing in this Clause\" language, Plaintiffs argue that while Defendants did not waive their removal rights in the Service of Suit Clause, Defendants waived their removal rights in the Choice of Law and Jurisdiction provision (Dkt. #10 at pp. 4-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court disagrees\n   for two reasons. First, it is illogical that Defendants would explicitly preserve their removal rights on one page of the Policy, but then immediately waive their rights on the next page (Dkt. #5-1 at pp. 23-24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Plaintiffs' proposed reading does not resolve the \"of Texas\" and \"any competent court\" conflict found in the Choice of Law and Jurisdiction provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Defendants' Proposal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Responding to Plaintiffs' argument citing\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , Defendants contend:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [B]y choosing to use the term \"of Texas\" rather than the term \"Courts of Texas,\" the language used in Endorsement 8 does not clearly and unequivocally refer to the state courts of Texas as the proper venue to the complete exclusion of federal courts within Texas that have jurisdiction over a matter on diversity grounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Dkt. #9 at p. 5). The Court finds Defendants' distinction between \"exclusive jurisdiction of Texas\" as opposed to \"exclusive jurisdiction of [the Courts] of Texas\" tenuous based on the Court's reading of\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Clear and Unequivocal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"For a contractual clause to prevent a party from exercising its right to removal, the clause must give a 'clear and unequivocal' waiver of that right.\"\n   <em>\n    New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , 376 F.3d at 504 (citing\n   <em>\n    McDermott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527865\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/1199/\">\n    944 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1199 ;\n   <em>\n    Waters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088978\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/796/#p797\">\n    252 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   796 ). \"Ambiguous language cannot constitute a 'clear and unequivocal' waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Grand View\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185680\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/255/#p258\">\n    847 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   258 (citing\n   <em>\n    New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , 376 F.3d at 505-06 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the Policy, the parties first agreed to submit to \"the exclusive jurisdiction of any competent court within the United States of America.\" (Dkt. #5-1 at pp. 3, 24). The parties next agreed to submit to the \"exclusive jurisdiction of Texas.\" (Dkt. #5-1 at p. 24). Defendants also agreed that, \"at the request of the Insured (or Reinsured), [Defendants] will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.\" (Dkt. #5-1 at p. 23). Defendants then specifically reserved their removal rights in the same Clause, \"Noting in this Clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Underwriters' rights ... to remove an action to a United States District Court....\" (Dkt. #5-1 at p. 23). The parties do not propose adequate interpretations of these clauses that enable the Court to harmonize the language. The Court also cannot independently harmonize the provision. Accordingly, regardless of the exact interpretation of these clauses, Defendants did not clearly and unequivocally waive their removal rights in the Policy. As a result, Plaintiffs' motion to remand should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on the preceding discussion, it is therefore\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand is hereby denied (Dkt. #5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Court assumes \"wholly owned\" indicates the owner is the sole member.

Second, in\n    <em>\n     Motiva\n    </em>\n    , the court relied on the \"nothing in this Clause\" language to fix the contradiction between the language of the Schedule and the Service of Suit provision.
