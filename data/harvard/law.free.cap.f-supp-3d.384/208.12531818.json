Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants first argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars Plaintiffs' claims against them in their official capacity insofar as they request monetary relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 11 at 20-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nieves-M\u00e1rquez v.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claims for monetary relief against Defendants in their official capacity are\n   hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   under the Eleventh Amendment. Conversely, Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants (i) in their official capacity for injunctive relief (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , reinstatement); and (ii) in their personal capacity for money damages survive since they are not afforded such immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court agrees, except as to Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For co-Defendants Redondo-Santana and Figueroa-Torres, the Court concurs that Plaintiffs do not offer enough factual averments linking their conduct to the alleged constitutional deprivation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ocasio-Hern\u00e1ndez v.

To be sure, the Complaint does reference \"particular actions taken by Defendants, either individually or as a group, against [P]laintiffs.\" Docket No. 18 at 7. But these generic statements concerning Defendants' collective conduct still leave the Court guessing as to Redondo-Santana and Figueroa-Torres' roles in the alleged adverse employment actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soto-Torres v.

And although Plaintiffs do describe Redondo-Santana and Figueroa-Torres' duties and functions within the OSC, Section 1983 \"liability cannot rest solely on [these co-Defendants'] position[s] of authority\" within that office.\n   <em>\n    Ocasio-Hern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p16\">\n    640 F.3d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to\n   Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim against Redondo-Santana and Figueroa-Torres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to co-Defendant Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez, on the other hand, the Complaint does contain sufficient well-pleaded factual allegations describing his involvement in-and familiarity with-Plaintiffs' termination following the 2016 elections. According to the Complaint, Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez serves as the Auxiliary Superintendent in charge of operations at the OSC. Docket No. 1 at 13. In that capacity, Plaintiffs allege he was \"actively involved in the transition process\" that culminated with their discharge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p16\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Complaint charges that Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez, together with the Transition Committee, compiled information on the political affiliations of OSC's staff and contractors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p16\">\n    at 22-23, 25, 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These allegations, while certainly not \"smoking gun\" evidence of political discrimination, plausibly show that Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez shared some responsibility in Plaintiffs' termination and, therefore, \"raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [his] illegal conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocasio-Hern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203517\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1/#p16\">\n    640 F.3d at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"[c]ircumstantial evidence must, at times, suffice\" to satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)'s plausibility requirement) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim against Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez is duly\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court also\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim against Redondo-Santana and Figueroa-Torres. This cause of action survives as to the remaining officials,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , (1) Rivera-Schatz; (2) M\u00e9ndez; (3) Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez; (4) Ramos-Garc\u00eda; and (5) Sastre-Fern\u00e1ndez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Fourteenth Amendment Claim-Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that the Complaint does not plausibly plead a procedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment because Plaintiffs held temporary, at-will positions and, as such, had no property interest in their continued employment with the OSC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 11 at 11; 11-1 at 10; 22 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maymi v.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"A constitutionally protected property interest in continued public employment typically arises when the employee has a reasonable expectation that [his or] her employment will continue.\"\n   <em>\n    G\u00f3mez v.

Hence, at-will employees will ordinarily lack such reasonable expectation and, therefore, have no property interest in their job.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781082\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/103/#p110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    King v.

Indeed, \"this is true of so-called transitory public employees in Puerto Rico\"-they \" 'generally do not have a property interest in continued employment beyond their yearly terms of appointment.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11981295\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/965/#p969\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Nieves-Villanueva v.

But Plaintiffs fail to provide any information as to when their temporary positions expired, or what procedural safeguards accompany their transient, \"at-will\" status. For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim and, thus,\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   this cause of action as to all Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Docket No. 11 at 17-19. Regarding the constitutional charge, Defendants correctly advert that it tracks Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.

They also realize that this argument would only work if the Court dismisses all the federal claims asserted in the Complaint against these three officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 11 at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera-D\u00edaz v.
