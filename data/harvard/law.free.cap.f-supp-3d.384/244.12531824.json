By letter dated July 19, 2017, the Treasury acknowledged the FOIA Request and assigned it tracking number 2017-137 (the \"Acknowledgment Letter\"). (Acknowledgment Letter, annexed to Am. Compl. as Ex. B, Docket Entry No. 15; Am. Compl. \u00b6 12; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Treasury's search for records responsive to the FOIA Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Treasury personnel worked with the Office of the Executive Secretariat (\"OES\"), which maintains records for the Office of the Secretary and the Chief of the Staff, and with the Office of the Chief Information Office (\"OCIO\") to conduct searches for agency records responsive to Plaintiffs' FOIA Request and \"identify the most likely sources of potential records.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 4; Decl. of Andrew B. Stein (\"Stein Decl.\") \u00b6 6, Docket Entry No. 25.) After discussions with OES and OCIO, Treasury personnel \"determined that the most likely sources of responsive materials would be: (a) Ms. Sandberg's emails during her employment at Treasury (approximately 1996 to 2000); (b) emails of the current and former Secretaries of the Treasury listed in Plaintiffs' June 13, 2017 letter; and (c) electronic records of the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff during Ms. Sandberg's employment at Treasury.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 5; Stein Decl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, in 2000, the Treasury transitioned to a new email system, and, as a result, Treasury personnel were unable to search emails that Sandberg sent or received during her employment at the Treasury because \"the majority of legacy emails sent or received prior to that time and Ms. Sandberg's entire email account [we]re no longer maintained by Treasury and [we]re not accessible in any form.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 6; Stein Decl. \u00b6 6.) Although unable to search Sandberg's email account, on May 17, 2018, OCIO searched available emails of current and former Secretaries of the Treasury listed in Plaintiffs' FOIA Request for any communications with Sandberg from her last date of employment at Treasury, in 2000, through May 17, 2018. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.) Treasury personnel searched using the terms \"Sandberg,\" \"Sheryl,\" \"Sheryl Sandberg,\" \"@leanin.org,\" and \"@facebook.org.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.) These searches did not produce any responsive records. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Treasury also searched for notes of meetings between Sandberg and current and former Secretaries of the Treasury listed in Plaintiffs' FOIA Request by reviewing records maintained by OES, but the search did not produce any responsive records. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 8; Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, the Treasury searched electronic records maintained by the Office of the Secretary \"by querying OES electronic databases for all materials authorized by Ms. Sandberg during her employment at Treasury.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 9; Stein Decl. \u00b6 9.) The Treasury Office of the General Counsel (\"OGC\") reviewed the documents that were located, and \"determined that one of them was related in part to the subjects enumerated in Plaintiffs' [FOIA Request],\" (the \"Responsive Document\").

(Treasury's Final Response, annexed to Stein Decl. as Ex. D, Docket Entry No. 25-4; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 10; Am. Compl. \u00b6 14.)

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl.) OGC discussed Plaintiffs' FOIA Request with OES and OCIO because of the age of the records Plaintiffs sought. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) After doing so, the Treasury determined categories of records that constituted \"the most likely sources of responsive materials.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The categories consisted of \"OES electronic records from Ms. Sandberg's tenure at Treasury (1996 to 2000) maintained by the Office of the Secretary, Ms. Sandberg's emails from that period, and the current and former Secretaries' emails.\" (Def. Mem. 5; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 5; Stein Decl. \u00b6 6.) Treasury personnel searched its electronic records maintained by OES and \"queried its electronic databases for all materials authored by Ms. Sandberg during her tenure at Treasury.\" (Stein Decl. \u00b6 9.) OGC reviewed the documents located and determined that one document was responsive in part to Plaintiffs' FOIA Request. (Stein Decl. \u00b6 9; Responsive Document.) However, Treasury personnel were unable to search Sandberg's emails from 1996 to 2000 because, in 2000, the Treasury transitioned to a new email system and therefore \"a majority of legacy emails sent or received prior to the transition are no longer maintained and are not accessible in any form.\" (Stein Decl. 7; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With respect to emails of the former and current Secretaries, the Treasury conducted a search of all available emails and electronic databases for documents responsive to Plaintiffs' FOIA Request concerning communications between the Secretaries and Sandberg from January 1, 2000 through May 17, 2018, the date of the search. (Stein Decl. \u00b6 9.) Treasury personnel used various search terms that were reasonably likely to uncover relevant responses, including \"Sandberg,\" \"Sheryl,\" \"Sheryl Sandberg,\" \"@leanin.org,\" and \"@facebook.org,\" but did not locate any responsive records. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.) The Treasury also reviewed records maintained by OES and did not identify any responsive notes of meetings between Sandberg and the Secretaries identified in Plaintiffs' FOIA Request. (Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs' various arguments as to methods the Treasury used to search for responsive documents are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

(Pls. Mem. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   However, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the OGC worked with OES, which maintains the records of the Office of the Secretary and the Chief of Staff, and OCIO to identify sources of potentially responsive records. (Stein Decl. \u00b6 6.) The offices discussed Plaintiffs' FOIA request and determined the categories of records which constituted the most likely sources of responsive materials given the age and nature of the documents requested: \"OES electronic records from Ms. Sandberg's tenure at Treasury (1996 to 2000) maintained by the Office of the Secretary, Ms. Sandberg's emails from that period, and the current and former Secretaries' emails.\" (Def. Mem. 5; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 5; Stein Decl. \u00b6 6.) Although Plaintiffs challenge whether these are in fact the \"most likely\" sources of responsive materials, Plaintiffs' speculation, without more, is insufficient to undermine the adequacy of the Treasury's searches.

(Pls. Mem. 7-8.) Plaintiffs further argue \"[t]hat Ms. Sandberg received (and presumably authored) such documents is beyond dispute\" and \"logically they likely will be located in the files of Secretary Summers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although Plaintiffs did not provide search terms for Treasury personnel to use during the searches and the Treasury was not aware of Sandberg's email address(es) after she left the Treasury, the Treasury used various search terms that were reasonably likely to uncover relevant responses, including \"Sandberg,\" \"Sheryl,\" \"Sheryl Sandberg,\" \"@leanin.org,\" and \"@facebook.org,\" but did not locate any responsive records. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Stein Decl. \u00b6 8.) Moreover, although Plaintiffs argue that the Treasury should have searched for documents by issues mentioned in their FOIA Request, Plaintiffs included those issues under category 1 of their FOIA Request, seeking Sandberg's records from 1996 to 2000. (FOIA Request 2.) The Treasury reviewed its electronic databases for all records authored by Sandberg during this period and \"[a]fter a careful review, OGC identified one document response to category 1\" of Plaintiffs' FOIA Request.

(Stein Decl. \u00b6 7.) In addition, because the records Plaintiffs seek are more than fifteen years old, potentially responsive records have either been destroyed in accordance with the Treasury's applicable records schedules or permanent records transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (\"NARA\"). The Treasury's destruction of records pursuant to published retention schedules does not undermine the adequacy of its searches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conti v.

Moreover, the Treasury represents that, if it possessed any responsive document, it would have located it, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7), and presumably the document would have been produced or the Treasury would have claimed an exemption under FOIA.
