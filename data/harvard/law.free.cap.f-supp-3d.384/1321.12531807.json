As directed by the Court, Ali and Kaiser each filed a supplemental brief (Dkt. ## 113, 114) addressing Kaiser's assertion that the claim should be dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity.

The Court dismissed the claim against Kaiser for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Dkt. # 98, at 20.

Accepting as true Ali's allegations that Kaiser acted deliberately and maliciously with the intent to cause Ali pain by manipulating Ali's arms while Ali was handcuffed and offering no resistance, Dkt. # 83, at 7-8, these cases support Ali's assertion that the law governing Kaiser's alleged conduct was clearly established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Within 14 days of the entry of this opinion and order, Kaiser shall file an answer to the amended complaint with respect to that claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 12(a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

Within 14 days of the entry of this opinion and order, Kaiser shall file an answer to the amended complaint with respect to the excessive-force claim alleged against him in count II of the amended complaint (Dkt. # 83).\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The motion to dismiss (Dkt. # 86) was jointly filed by Defendants Dustin Duboise, Gary Kaiser and Travis Lambert, on April 26, 2017. After the Court granted the motion in favor of all three defendants, Ali appealed. Dkt. # 100. Pursuant to the Tenth Circuit's decision, Dkt. # 106, Duboise is no longer a party to this action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. # 108, at 2-3. Further, as discussed below, because the Tenth Circuit reversed this Court's determination that Lambert was entitled to qualified immunity, the sole basis this Court relied on to grant his request to dismiss the amended complaint, the Court construed the Tenth Circuit's decision as effectively denying the motion to dismiss as to Lambert. As a result, the Court directed Lambert to file an answer and reinstated the motion to dismiss (Dkt. # 86) only as to Kaiser's request for dismissal on the basis of qualified immunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. # 108, at 2-3. To the extent the Court's prior order (Dkt. # 108) could be construed as reinstating the motion to dismiss as to all three defendants, the Court hereby denies the motion to dismiss (Dkt. # 86) as to Duboise and Lambert.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
