The sentence was imposed in 1998 based on the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines for offenses involving crack cocaine committed by a person who qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The First Step Act is a remedial statute that serves to extend reductions in crack cocaine statutory penalties provided by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 to persons previously ineligible for a reduction. For reasons that follow, I conclude that Congress, in enacting the First Step Act, intended to give the Court discretion to reduce Mr. Allen's sentence.

Consequently, ... he is ineligible for a reduction in sentence based on the crack cocaine amendments.\" (emphasis omitted)). The issue presented here is whether the First Step Act has given courts authority to grant relief to persons in Mr. Allen's situation when warranted. This a straightforward issue of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The pertinent provision, section 404 of the First Step Act, provides: \"[a] court that imposed a sentence for a covered offense may, on motion of the defendant, ... impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 ... were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\" \u00a7 404(b), 132 Stat. at 5222. \"[T]he term 'covered offense' means a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010,\" and which was committed before the Fair Sentencing Act was enacted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A defendant who was sentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act, or whose motion under the First Step Act was previously denied, is not eligible for relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404(c). Section 404 further provides that \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to require a court to reduce any sentence pursuant to this section.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Allen argues that his sentence was imposed for a \"covered offense\" as defined in the First Step Act, and he is therefore eligible for relief, because he was convicted of violating a statute punishing an offense involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, the penalties for which have been lowered by the Fair Sentencing Act. The government contends that Mr. Allen is not eligible for relief because his offense conduct involved 675 grams of crack cocaine, as found by the Court at the sentencing hearing, and the penalty for an offense involving this quantity has not been reduced. In the government's view, in other words, the drug quantity that matters in determining whether a defendant was sentenced for a \"covered offense\" within the meaning of the First Step Act is not the statutory quantity in the indictment but the quantity found by the Court at sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I agree with the defendant's interpretation of section 404. \"Under the plain language of [this section], whether an offense is a 'covered offense' is determined by examining the statute that the defendant violated.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a growing number of courts have concluded, \"it is the statute of conviction, not actual conduct, that controls eligibility under the First Step Act.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To the extent the statutory text is ambiguous, the ambiguity is dispelled by considering the purpose underlying the First Step Act. Both parties agree that no legislative history is available to document the purpose of section 404. It is undisputed, however, that Congress wanted to further the Fair Sentencing Act's objective of mitigating the effects of a sentencing scheme that had a racially disparate impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407151\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/260/#p268\">\n    567 U.S. at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407151\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/260/#p268\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given this remedial purpose, the First Step Act should be construed to provide courts with discretion to reduce a sentence when the statute the defendant violated has been modified by the Fair Sentencing Act to provide less severe penalties.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noel v.

Put differently, they dispute whether, in determining what relief should be granted to Mr. Allen, the Court is confined to considering only the penalties modified by the Fair Sentencing Act and made retroactive by the First Step Act, or should give him the benefit of all changes in applicable law since he was sentenced, including the change mandated by\n   <em>\n    United States v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , which rendered the Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p227\">\n    543 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p227\">\n    125 S.Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925862\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/220/#p227\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). This question need not be resolved here because Mr. Allen is entitled to immediate release based on the Fair Sentencing Act's modification of the statutory maximum penalty applicable to his offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   If the Fair Sentencing Act had been in effect when Mr. Allen was sentenced in 1998, his statutory offense quantity of 50 grams or more would have carried a maximum sentence of 40 years rather than life,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(iii), so his offense level under the career offender guideline would have been 34 rather than 37.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level would have been 31, resulting in a range of 188-235 months on count one, instead of 262-327.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. Pt. 5. In 1998, I was required to sentence Mr. Allen in accordance with the then-mandatory Guidelines and, in doing so, imposed a sentence on count one at the bottom of the applicable range. Using\n   the new range of 188-235, I similarly find that a sentence at the low end of the range should be imposed now. Adding the mandatory consecutive term of 60 months on count four results in a total sentence of 248 months. Because Mr. Allen has already served 252 months, a sentence of time served is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1)(C) (\"In no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, the sentence is hereby reduced to time served. The term of supervised release on count one is reduced to 48 months, to run concurrently with the terms of 36 months imposed on count four and 60 months imposed on count five. All other provisions of the judgment will remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   So ordered this 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of April 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S. Sentencing Commission,\n    <em>\n     Final Crack Retroactivity Data Report Fair Sentencing Act\n    </em>\n    at 2-4 (Dec. 2014), https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/retroactivity-analyses/fair-sentencing-act/Final_USSC_Crack_Retro_Data_Report_FSA.pdf.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Section 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, which eliminated the mandatory minimum sentences for simple possession, is not relevant here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3, 124 Stat. at 2372.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The parties agree that the other restrictions on eligibility do not apply here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 404(c), 132 Stat. at 5222.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
