The account from which these purchases were made was held in his wife's name and was previously\n   enrolled in a program called \"Amazon Mom.\" As described below, to enroll in Amazon Mom, a user must accept the \"Amazon Prime Terms and Conditions,\" which incorporate an arbitration provision. Plaintiff subsequently brought a putative class action against Defendant Amazon.com, Inc. (\n   <strong>\n    \"Amazon\"\n   </strong>\n   ), asserting that Amazon's sales of 1 Day Diet violated the Consumer Product Safety Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and state law. After Amazon moved to compel arbitration, the matter was referred to the Hon. Lois Bloom for a Report and Recommendation (\n   <strong>\n    \"R&amp;R\"\n   </strong>\n   ), which advised that the motion be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court adopts the R&amp;R's conclusion that arbitration be granted, finding that it is supported by its careful analysis of the facts and the law which is manifest, and not impugned by Plaintiff's objections to it, which are denied. The Court is driven to this conclusion upon its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the evidentiary record, parties' motion and objection papers, and applicable legal authority, as mandated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(3), for the reasons expanded upon below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In deciding a motion to compel arbitration, \"courts apply a 'standard similar to that applicable for a motion for summary judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nicosia v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 9, 2008, an Amazon account was created in the name of \"Annemarie Nicosia\" (the\n   <strong>\n    \"Account\"\n   </strong>\n   ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). At all relevant times, the Account was used by both Plaintiff and Annemarie, although\n   Plaintiff relied on Annemarie to manage it. (D.

(Ressmeyer Decl. \u00b6 15). On August 19, 2011, the following arbitration clause was added to the COU:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to Amazon.com or to products or services sold or distributed by Amazon or through Amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court\n   </strong>\n   , except that you may assert claims in small claims court if you qualify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ressmeyer Decl.

The arbitration provision was also accompanied by a class action waiver, which provides that \"\n   <strong>\n    any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Ressmeyer Decl. Ex. M, at AMZ000365) (bold in original). Finally, the COU contains a choice-of-law clause specifying that \"the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington ... will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Amazon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AMZ000366).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Amazon Prime and Amazon Mom\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Amazon Prime (\n   <strong>\n    \"Amazon Prime\"\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    \"Prime\"\n   </strong>\n   ) is a bundle of services, including free two-day shipping, discounted one-day shipping, and access to movies and television shows, offered to Amazon accountholders for an annual membership fee. (Ressmeyer Decl. \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Amazon Mom (\n   <strong>\n    \"Amazon Mom\"\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    \"Mom\"\n   </strong>\n   ) was a free membership program launched by Amazon in September 2011 which offered limited, promotional Prime benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). By signing up for Mom, an accountholder could receive discounts on diapers and baby products, as well as three months of free two-day shipping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). By purchasing products on Mom, the accountholder could extend their free two-day shipping benefits to up to one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Amazon Mom was explicitly promoted as a kind of free trial for Prime. In the promotional FAQ, the free shipping benefits were expressly referred to as \"Amazon Prime benefits.\" (Ressmeyer Decl. Ex. J, at AMZ000369, ECF No. 116-10). Extending these benefits by making qualifying purchases on Mom gave the accountholder \"more free months of Prime.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Amazon Mom sign-up page contained text reading: \"\n   <strong>\n    After your free period, you'll be charged $79 for a year of Amazon Prime and Amazon Mom benefits\n   </strong>\n   ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AMZ000372, ECF No. 116-11).

Annemarie testified that, before this lawsuit was brought, she believed in her mind that Prime and Mom were the same program. (A. Nicosia Dep. at 59:24-60:3, 93:18-20). Amazon's Associate General Counsel for Marketing, too, viewed Mom as an \"an\n   addition\" to Prime, whose \"underlying program is a Prime program.\" (Ressmeyer Dep. at 204:11-13, ECF No. 118-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    September 30, 2011: The Account enrolls in Amazon Mom\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Annemarie testified that, while she was pregnant with her second son, she heard about Amazon Mom from a friend, Albert Dennis (\n   <strong>\n    \"Dennis\"\n   </strong>\n   ), who told her that the program offered diapers at a \"good price.\" (A. Nicosia Dep. at 15:20-16:7, 58:8-11, 73:11-13). Annemarie gave Dennis her password (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:4-11), and Dennis told her that he was signing her up for Mom \"to get diapers and formula if [she] needed it\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:3-8). On September 30, 2011, Dennis enrolled Annemarie in Mom with her \"permission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:12-37:7):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Q: And your friend Al Dennis told you, 'There's this Amazon.com Mom program where you can get a discount on diapers,' right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Q: And that sounded pretty good to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Q: So your friend Al Dennis signed you up for that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Q: And that was okay with you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"A: Yes, sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:8-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As of September 30, 2011, in order to sign up for Amazon Mom, a customer would be required to complete a two-step process.

Directly above the \"Continue\" button was a line that read: \"By clicking the\n   <strong>\n    Continue\n   </strong>\n   button, you acknowledge that you agree to the\n   <em>\n    Amazon Mom Terms and Conditions\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (bold in original). The underlined term was a hyperlink to the Amazon Mom Terms and Conditions (\n   <strong>\n    \"Mom T&amp;C\"\n   </strong>\n   ) (Ressmeyer Decl. \u00b6 28), which contained the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Welcome to the terms and conditions (\"Terms\") for Amazon Mom, which govern the Amazon Mom membership.

On February 2, 2015, the Honorable Sandra L.

(ECF No. 114, at 18-22; ECF No. 123, at 4-5). Amazon styled this argument as its \"derivative rights\" theory. (ECF No. 123, at 4). The R&amp;R did not make a definitive recommendation with respect to Amazon's \"derivative rights\" theory. (R&amp;R at 28-30). Instead, the R&amp;R recommended that the motion be granted on the grounds that Plaintiff agreed to the COU directly through the checkout page. Specifically, the R&amp;R accepted Amazon's argument that Plaintiff agreed to the COU by making purchases after this lawsuit was commenced, and hence after he acquired actual notice of the fact that the COU incorporated an arbitration provision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22). Alternatively, the R&amp;R accepted Amazon's argument that Plaintiff was on constructive notice of the COU by virtue of his status as a repeated user of Amazon who frequently encountered the checkout page when shopping online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff timely objected to the R&amp;R, although he did not specifically object to the R&amp;R's treatment of Amazon's \"derivative rights theory.\" (ECF No. 159, at 1-2). Amazon reasserted its \"derivative rights\" argument in its statement in support of the R&amp;R and reply memorandum to Plaintiff's objections.

Because the Court grounds its decision solely in Amazon's \"derivative rights\" argument, some of these objections are rendered academic. Only three need be addressed here: (1) Plaintiff's objections (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, 94-95, ECF No. 119; ECF No. 121, at 17) to the images of the Prime sign-in flow (Ressmeyer Decl. Exs. B, C, D, N); (2) Plaintiff's objections (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, 86; ECF No. 121, at 17) to the images of the Mom sign-in flow (Ressmeyer Decl. Ex. J); and (3) Plaintiff's objections (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 94-95) to the declaration of Karen Ressmeyer, Amazon's Associate General Counsel for Marketing and Prime, insofar as it describes the process to sign up for Prime. (Ressmeyer Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Amazon Prime sign-up flow\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Amazon did not produce a copy of the Prime sign-up flow that a customer would have seen on October 11, 2012, claiming that it \"does not have a depiction\" of these webpages. (Ressmeyer Decl. \u00b6 35). Instead, Amazon provided several \"current and historical examples\" of the Prime sign-up screens. (Ressmeyer Decl. Exs. \u00b6 11 &amp; Exs B, C, D, N). But the record shows that none of these screens could have been the ones viewed by Annemarie when she re-enrolled in Prime in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does the record even contain a statement that these Prime sign-in screenshots are\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   to the one Annemarie would have seen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Court finds that the Prime sign-up screens produced by Amazon lack relevance. Therefore, the Court cannot consider them in adjudicating this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Amazon Mom sign-up flow\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff objects that the Mom sign-up flow produced by Amazon bears a 2012 copyright notice, and therefore could not have been the exact screen that Dennis viewed when the Account enrolled in Mom on September 30, 2011. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 83). But Ressmeyer's declaration establishes that the same sign-up flow \"was in place on September 30, 2011.\" (Ressmeyer Decl. \u00b6 27).

Nothing in the COU, the Prime T&amp;C, the Mom T&amp;C, or the Amazon Mom offer terms limits the scope of the arbitration clause to purchases for Prime-eligible products. The COU, which are \"incorporated\" into the Prime T&amp;C, and to which Annemarie agreed when the Account enrolled in Mom, broadly state that \"\n   <strong>\n    [a]ny dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to Amazon.com or to products or services sold or distributed by Amazon or through Amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration....\n   </strong>\n   \" Clearly, purchases of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   products on Amazon.com-whether Prime-eligible or not-fall within this provision's plain sweep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Amazon Mom Arbitration Agreement continues to apply when a user enrolls in a paid Prime subscription\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiff further objects that Annemarie's enrollment in Amazon Mom is \"irrelevant\" because her membership in the program expired in 2012, prior to Plaintiff's purchases of 1 Day Diet (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 81-88). The Court disagrees. When a user signs up for Amazon Mom-essentially a temporary, free trial of Prime,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Background I.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   -and thereby agrees to an arbitration provision, that arbitration provision continues to govern if the user signs up for a paid Prime subscription after their free trial expires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We turn first to the relevant contractual language. The COU itself places no temporal limitations on the arbitration clause. It states only that \"[a]ny dispute or claim relating in any way\" to the accountholder's use of Amazon \"will be resolved by binding arbitration.\" A literal reading of this clause, therefore, would suggest that it applies to all future disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Prime T&amp;C provide that \"[t]he [Prime T&amp;C], together with applicable terms and conditions related to any promotional offers provided to you for use with Prime, constitute the entire agreement between you and Amazon.com\n   <em>\n    related to the Prime membership\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). The Prime T&amp;C further provide that, \"[\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    f you sign up for a Prime membership\n   </em>\n   , you accept these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements\" (emphasis added). This emphasized language must be read in conjunction with the Mom T&amp;C, which provide: \"Once your free shipping benefits have expired, you may\n   <em>\n    continue\n   </em>\n   to receive Amazon Prime shipping benefits by enrolling in Amazon Prime for an annual membership fee of $79\" (emphasis added). Read together, this language refutes Plaintiff's argument that, by signing up for Amazon Mom, an accountholder is only governed by the Prime T&amp;C for the duration of their \"free\" Amazon Mom benefits. Instead, under these terms, one who\n   enrolls in a paid subscription after their free trial expires, and thereby reactivates their \"Prime membership,\" remains bound by the Prime T&amp;C to which they previously agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Because nothing in the\n   <em>\n    text\n   </em>\n   of the Amazon Mom Arbitration Agreement supports the temporal limitation urged by Plaintiff, any such argument must rely on\n   <em>\n    context\n   </em>\n   . In other words, Plaintiff's argument must be that a reasonable consumer entering into an arbitration agreement as part of a free trial would not understand the clause to survive if they convert to a paid subscription. But Plaintiff cites no authority for this proposition, and the Court has difficulty accepting it. It is fairly routine for vendors to offer free trials of certain goods or services, which automatically roll over to paid subscriptions unless the consumer affirmatively cancels. There can be no doubt that one who agrees to a contract term as part of a free trial remains bound if they automatically convert to a paid subscription.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E. G. Ground Management v. YCharts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-55 (RGK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013357669\">\n    2015 WL 13357669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. May 8, 2015) (limitation of liability clause, which accountholder agreed to in order to sign up for free trial, barred negligence claims against vendor which accrued after accountholder upgraded to paid subscription).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, Amazon Mom was described by Amazon as, and understood by Annemarie to be, a kind of Prime membership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Background I.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The sign-up screen for Mom read: \"\n   <strong>\n    After your free period, you'll be charged $79 for a year of Amazon Prime and Amazon Mom benefits\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and \"\n   <strong>\n    Amazon Prime membership continues until cancelled\n   </strong>\n   .\" If Annemarie's reenrollment in Prime were simply automatic at the expiration of her Amazon Mom membership, there is no question that she would remain bound by the Prime T&amp;C. The fact that she\n   <em>\n    manually\n   </em>\n   re-enrolled in October 2012 only makes the case for arbitrability stronger. By affirmatively rolling her Mom membership over into a paid Prime subscription, Annemarie implicitly manifested an assent to remain bound by whatever contractual obligations previously governed the Account while it was enrolled in Mom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In arriving at this conclusion, the Court does not hold that the 2012 sign-up process for Prime, on its own, provided sufficient inquiry notice of the Prime T&amp;C. As previously stated, there is insufficient evidence to support this conclusion as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Discussion II.1, II.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

Plaintiff is Equitably Estopped from Avoiding Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The preceding analysis shows that Annemarie entered into a binding arbitration agreement by signing up for Amazon Mom and that the agreement covered purchases of products, whether Prime-eligible or not, made after Annemarie re-enrolled in Prime in 2012. Thus, if it were Annemarie herself who purchased 1 Day Diet, she would be bound to arbitrate this dispute. The question at the heart of Amazon's \"derivative rights\" argument is whether the Amazon Mom Arbitration Agreement can be circumvented when it is a third party (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiff), rather than Annemarie herself, who makes purchases on the Account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   To ask this question is to answer it.

Plaintiff protests that \"Amazon anthropomorphizes [the] Prime account\" and that it is \"individuals ... not inanimate objects,\" who \"consent to arbitration.\" (ECF No. 121, at 1). But the entire purpose of an \"account\" on a platform like Amazon is to assume virtual personhood-to enter into contracts and, crucially, to\n   <em>\n    remain bound\n   </em>\n   by the contracts to which it has previously, and with due authority, agreed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the validity of these contract terms waxed and waned depending on the identity of the human user behind the screen, it would impose a cloud of uncertainty over any contract formed over the internet.

Nev. Mar. 31, 2016), a case which in all relevant respects resembles this one. The plaintiff's mother held an account at the defendant bank, Credit One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. In order to establish this account, she was acquired to sign a \"cardholder agreement,\" which included an arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-*2. She underwent surgery and was hospitalized, and the plaintiff, concerned about her finances in the event that she should pass away, called Credit One's toll-free automated information system in order to inquire about her account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The automated system prompted the plaintiff to enter \"your sixteen digit card number\" and \"the last four digits of your social security number,\" to which the plaintiff entered his mother's card number\n   and social security number digits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon successful authentication of the account and social security information, the plaintiff's was able to access the information he sought, but his phone number became linked to his mother's account.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   After his mother's account became delinquent, calls were made to recover the debt, including to the plaintiff's phone number.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff sued under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the bank moved to compel arbitration. Although the plaintiff himself did not sign the arbitration agreement, the court held that he \"benefitted from the agreement by calling Credit One, inputting his mother's validation information, and gaining access to his mother's financial information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The court found that plaintiff's claims were so related to the underlying cardholder agreement that he could be estopped from avoiding the arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   analyzed Credit One's motion to compel under the direct benefits test rather than traditional equitable estoppel, it is easy to see how the same result could have been reached under the latter theory. When the plaintiff provided his mother's personal information to Credit One's automated information system, he implicitly represented that he was the true accountholder. Credit One justifiably relied on that representation when it subsequently provided the information plaintiff sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This case is essentially no different from\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   . When Plaintiff accessed the Annemarie Account and used it to place purchases of 1 Day Diet, he, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   , implicitly represented that he was the true accountholder. Like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   , he directly benefited from the making of that representation, in that it allowed him to step into the shoes of his wife and enjoy the same contractual rights she enjoyed,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , the right to place an order on Amazon.com. Because plaintiff knowingly accepted the benefit of Annemarie's contractual relationship with Amazon, he must also be held to the arbitration clause that governs that relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   For these reasons, under either a traditional theory of equitable estoppel or direct benefits estoppel, Plaintiff is bound by the Amazon Mom Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Amazon's \"derivative rights\" argument is not waived\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Court should deem Amazon's derivative rights argument waived because it was not specifically pleaded in Amazon's responsive pleadings. (ECF No. 121, at 20-21).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1) (\"In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including: ... arbitration and award; ... [and] estoppel....\"). The Court disagrees. In its Answer, Amazon asserted that \"Plaintiff's purported claims ... are subject to mandatory arbitration ... pursuant to one or more agreements binding on the Plaintiff or applicable to the claims he purports to set forth.\" (ECF No. 84, at 34) (emphasis added). This broad phrasing put Plaintiff on notice that Amazon would seek not only to enforce the purported arbitration agreements that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   entered into, but those that were \"binding on [him].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In any event, even where an affirmative defense is not adequately pleaded, a district court may still entertain it at the summary judgment stage \"in the absence of undue prejudice to the plaintiff, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the defendant, futility, or undue delay of the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Hamilton v.

Amazon's failure to be more granular in its Answer about the specific arbitration agreements that it seeks to enforce could hardly be said to work unfair prejudice under the circumstances of this case. Plaintiff argues that \"Amazon was in possession of his wife's Amazon account records since the beginning of this case\" (ECF No. 121, at 20), but this argument cuts both ways. Plaintiff, too, was not ignorant of the fact that his 1 Day Diet purchases were made through a Prime account. (D. Nicosia Dep. at 136:12-138:12). Furthermore, discovery in this case focused not only on Plaintiff's Amazon usage, but that of his wife. It strains credulity to think that Plaintiff would have been surprised when Amazon asserted, in its motion to compel, that Plaintiff was bound by the arbitration agreement entered into by his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

(ECF No. 121, at 5-8; ECF No. 159, at 6-11). The R&amp;R is hereby adopted insofar as it rejected this argument. (R&amp;R at 12-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The thrust of Plaintiff's objection is that Amazon should not be permitted to take a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose\" approach, where it is able to move to dismiss on the merits, winnow out certain claims in court, and only proceed to arbitration on the claims that were not dismissed. (ECF No. 159, at 3, 11). While this argument would have force if Amazon had only moved to dismiss on the merits, it must be rejected in this case, where Amazon moved to dismiss on\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   arbitrability\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   merits grounds. To find prejudice under these circumstances would be to endorse a rule that a defendant who has a colorable argument for dismissal on either merits or arbitrability grounds must choose one argument and abandon the other. Such a rule would work substantial prejudice-against the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court also rejects Plaintiff's argument (ECF No. 159, at 10-11) that the 32-month delay between Amazon's motion to dismiss and its motion to compel warrants a finding of waiver. (R&amp;R at 13 (\"[T]he 32-month period between commencement of the lawsuit and the instant motion, although significant, 'does not by itself support a finding of waiver' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chehebar v.

Nor does the Court find compelling Plaintiff's argument that Amazon was able to gain an unfair advantage by \"see[ing] the strength of Plaintiff's case on the merits.\" (ECF No. 159, at 10). Finally, Plaintiff's argument that there has\n   been litigation on \"substantial issues going to the merits\" (ECF No. 159, at 8-9), is, as the R&amp;R observed, \"belied by the record\" (R&amp;R at 14 n. 17). \"[A]lthough the parties have engaged in discovery, it has been limited and focused on the issue of whether Nicosia agreed to arbitrate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Amazon's right to arbitration has not been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Actual and constructive notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's objections to those portions of the R&amp;R which concluded that Plaintiff had actual (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22) and constructive (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25) notice of the COU through his use of the Amazon.com checkout page, and finds that they are academic in light of the Court's disposition above, which is based on the Amazon Mom Arbitration Agreement.

In any event, the Court adopts the R&amp;R insofar as it held that, if Plaintiff entered into an agreement to arbitrate by purchasing 1 Day Diet, the illegality of the contract would be a question for the arbitrator.

Dismissal in Lieu of Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Amazon seeks, in addition to an order compelling arbitration, \"an order ... dismissing or staying these proceedings.\" (ECF No. 113). Although Section 3 of the FAA only speaks of staying proceedings, it is well-settled that an arbitrable dispute may be dismissed in lieu of a stay if the defendant requests dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zambrano v.

The conclusion is reached after substantial research and discussion of the cases and relevant literature summoned in the struggle created by the advent of the internet-the struggle to make the common law of contracts\n   applicable when people interacted with people in the commercial world, fit comfortably in a time when people interact with machines in that world and with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   However, the rule that the \"existence\" of additional contract terms must be made \"reasonably conspicuous\" is, this Court submits, largely a superfluity. The cases specify that such terms must be reasonably conspicuous from the point of view of a \"reasonably prudent\" user.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263702\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/66/#p70\">\n    868 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   77 ;\n   <em>\n    Berkson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339601\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/97/359/#p372\">\n    97 F.Supp.3d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But is there any question that reasonably prudent internet users know that there are terms and conditions attached when they log onto Facebook, order merchandise on Amazon, or hail a ride on Uber? They know this, not because a loud, brightly-colored notice on the screen tells them so, but because it would be difficult to exist in our technological society without some generalized awareness of the fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206476934\">\n    2016 WL 6476934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"The act of contracting for consumer services online is now commonplace in the American economy.

Among those that both read and understand the terms of use, most will proceed with the transaction anyway, because the terms are presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

On the one hand, the law cannot countenance an environment where unscrupulous merchants are able to insert any contractual term they wish into the hybridwrap agreement and expect automatic enforcement. On the other hand, a legal rule which merely exalts the\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    visual layout\n   </em>\n   of the hybridwrap agreement, incentivizing merchants to adopt some judicially-favored website designs while foregoing others, is unlikely to have more than a negligible impact on the way buyers and sellers contract over the internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   This Court suggests that Llewellyn had the answer: rather than scrutinizing hybridwrap agreements for contract formation issues, courts should recognize that such agreements, like other adhesive contracts, represent in substance a \"blanket assent\" to any terms that are not objectively unreasonable.

But as a general principle, a judicial approach which shifts the inquiry away from the formal trappings of the contract,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   notice and acceptance, to the substance of its terms, will much more readily honor the merchant's legitimate commercial expectations while safeguarding the consumer from abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Exquisitely applicable and responsive to the stubborn problems presented by this case and countless others like it is the observation by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in his 1881 Lectures on the Common Law: \"The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.
