The APA authorizes judicial review of final agency action when a relevant administrative agency\n   statutory provision does not directly provide for judicial review.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court must therefore turn to the APA. However, the parties dispute whether there is final agency action sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Generally, a final agency action must: 1) \"mark the 'consummation' of the agency's decisionmaking process, it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature,\" and 2) \"be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which 'legal consequences will flow.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Therefore, there is no final agency action under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Further, although courts have acknowledged some exceptions to the finality rule, none apply here. For instance, \"[a] claim that an agency action is in plain contravention of a statutory mandate ... may present one of the extraordinary exceptions to the finality requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Veldhoen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523240\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/222/#p225\">\n    35 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

LEXIS 9467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 17, 1980), for the proposition that at least one district court has enjoined the Coast Guard from publishing a final report when it included information beyond the scope of the cause of the investigation. Dkt. 9 at 23. However,\n    <em>\n     Seafarers\n    </em>\n    does not govern here. In\n    <em>\n     Seafarers\n    </em>\n    , plaintiffs were wrongfully denied the status of \"parties in interest\" and were excluded from participating in the hearings without any legal cause. No. 78 Civ. 4698, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *18. Because the plaintiffs were entitled to participate in the proceedings, the Court enjoined the publication of the final report until the hearings in the investigations were reconvened and plaintiffs could call and examine any witnesses.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1980%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%209467\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at *18-*19. In the present case, Plaintiffs complain that the Coast Guard is exceeding the scope of its authority by examining Plaintiffs' SMS, not because they are being excluded from participating in the hearing as a party in interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
