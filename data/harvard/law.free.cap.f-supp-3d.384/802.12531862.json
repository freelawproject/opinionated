Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although this lawsuit is still in its early phases, its procedural history is complicated. This case was consolidated with eight other Flint water class action complaints on July 27, 2017. (Dkt. 173.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In September 2017, plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint. (Dkt. 214.) A second amended complaint followed less than a month later. (Dkt. 238.) Then, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on January 25, 2018. (Dkt. 349.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). (Dkts. 273, 274, 276-79, 281-83, 294.) On August 1, 2018, after hearing oral argument on the motions to dismiss, the Court issued an opinion and order granting defendants' motions in part and denying them in part.\n   <em>\n    Carthan v. Snyder (In re Flint Water Cases)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527043\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/369/\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. 2018),\n   <em>\n    vacated\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-10444,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20192371\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Nov. 9, 2018). Several defendants appealed part of the ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (Dkts. 570, 573, 575, 579, 589); others filed motions for reconsideration. (Dkts. 560-61.) And under the prevailing rules, the Sixth Circuit awaited the resolution of the motions for reconsideration prior to taking jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Carthan v. Snyder\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1967 (6th Cir. Aug. 28, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint for a fourth time before the Court had resolved the pending motions for reconsideration. (Dkt. 620.) The Court granted leave for plaintiffs in other Flint water lawsuits to file similar motions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, as a result, there was a significant risk that the Flint Water Cases would proceed in a piecemeal fashion. (Dkt. 670.) The Court was managing filings from more than 150 lawyers and coordinating with related federal and state cases. Having different lawsuits proceed on divergent allegations and differing claims would further complicate the case. Such a scenario would also burden defendants, who would be unable to wage consistent defenses. In the interest of handling the cases in a consistent manner, the Court interpreted plaintiffs' motion as a joint motion for relief from judgment and a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Finding just cause, the Court vacated its August 1 decision on November 9, 2018, so that it could consider plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   To fulfill its duty to ensure that the litigation proceeds efficiently, the Court adopted an unorthodox but necessary plan. Noting that there was significant overlap between the proposed fourth amended complaint and the third amended complaint, and that a motion for leave to amend and a motion to dismiss turn on substantively the same standard, the Court determined that it would treat defendants' responses to the motion for leave to amend as addenda to their previously filed motions to dismiss. (Dkt. 714.) The Court would then issue an omnibus opinion and order, adjudicating plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, and, if successful, defendants' motions to dismiss it in a single decision. Mindful of the parties' rights, the Court also gave plaintiffs and defendants the opportunity to file supplemental briefing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court now addresses plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the complaint and defendants' motions to dismiss. Accordingly, this opinion and order will proceed as follows: Part II will address plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, and, for the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant it in part and deny it in part. In Part III, rather than wait for plaintiffs to file their amended complaint, the Court will adopt the fourth amended complaint as the operative complaint and rule on defendants' motions to dismiss it. The Court's ruling in Part II will be preclusive, so any claim found lacking there will not be addressed separately in Part III. The result will be that the fourth amended complaint, to the extent permitted below, will become the operative complaint for the purposes of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Facts As Pleaded in the Third Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   What follows is a summary of the facts set forth in the third amendment complaint, as summarized in the Court's vacated August 1, 2018, opinion and order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   An 1897 city ordinance required that all water pipes in Flint be made of lead. (Dkt. 349 at 38.) In 1917, the Flint Water Treatment Plant (FWTP) was constructed, and drew water from the Flint River as Flint's primary water source until 1964, when it went dormant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) From 1964 through 2014, users of municipal water in Flint, Michigan received their water through the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.) In 2014, Flint's water supply switched back to the Flint River, and the water was treated at the FWTP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.) This case concerns the decision to return to the Flint River as Flint's primary water source in 2014, and the alleged injuries that arose from that switch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Beginning in the 1990s, Flint, along with other local governments relying on the DWSD water supply, had concerns about the cost of that supply, and began studying the viability of alternative water supplies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.) In 2001, Michigan's Department of Natural Resources noted that businesses along the Flint River had permits to discharge industrial and mining runoff, as well as petroleum and gasoline cleanups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) In 2004, a study by the United States Geological Survey, the [MDEQ], and the Flint Water Utilities Department determined\n   that the Flint River was a highly sensitive drinking water source susceptible to contamination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2006 and 2009, Flint and other local governments commissioned a study from LAN regarding the viability of continuing to purchase water from the DWSD or constructing a new pipeline, which would be administered by what would later be known as the [KWA]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   In 2011, Flint commissioned a study by Rowe Engineering and LAN to determine if the Flint River could be safely used as a water supply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The study determined that water from the Flint River would require more treatment than water from Lake Huron, and that proper treatment for Flint River water would require upgrades to the FWTP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The report included an addendum that set forth over sixty-nine million dollars in improvements that would be necessary to use Flint River water through the FWTP, including the use of corrosion control chemicals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   In August 2012, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed Edward Kurtz as Flint's Emergency Manager, following the declaration of a financial emergency in Flint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) Emergency managers may be appointed by the governor of Michigan \"to address a financial emergency within\" a local government, subject to the limitations in Michigan Public Act 436 of 2012. M.C.L. \u00a7 141.1549(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Upon appointment, an emergency manager shall act for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the office of chief administrative officer of the local government. The emergency manager shall have broad powers in receivership to rectify the financial emergency and to assure the fiscal accountability of the local government and the local government's capacity to provide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential to the public health, safety, and welfare. Following appointment of an emergency manager and during the pendency of receivership, the governing body and the chief administrative officer of the local government shall not exercise any of the powers of those offices except as may be specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager or as otherwise provided by this act and are subject to any conditions required by the emergency manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   M.C.L. \u00a7 141.1549(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   In November 2012, Kurtz suggested to State of Michigan Treasurer Andy Dillon that Flint join the proposed KWA under the belief that doing so would save money over continuing to purchase water from the DWSD. (Dkt. 349 at 40.) The KWA was to be an administrative body overseeing a pipeline that would use Lake Huron water for the areas it serviced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright had encouraged the formation of the KWA in 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   DWSD argued throughout 2012 that Flint should not join the KWA based on cost and reliability projections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It made these arguments to Governor [Snyder], Wright, Kurtz, Dillon, and then-Mayor of Flint Dayne Walling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During that period, Wright consistently argued to Kurtz, Dillon, and Governor Snyder that the DWSD studies were wrong. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) In late 2012, Dillon requested that an independent engineering firm assess the cost effectiveness of joining the KWA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The firm concluded that remaining with DWSD was more cost-effective both in the short and long term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 17, 2013, Dillon e-mailed Governor Snyder and stated that the KWA advocates were misrepresenting\n   the benefits of a switch, and that the \"[r]eport I got is that Flint should stay w [sic] DWSD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   On March 26, 2013, MDEQ District Supervisor Stephen Busch sent an e-mail to MDEQ Director Daniel Wyant and MDEQ Chief of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance Liane Shekter-Smith setting forth risks associated with using the Flint River as Flint's drinking water source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The e-mail stated that the water posed increased health risks, including a microbial risk, a risk of trihalomethane (known as \"Total Trihalomethanes\" or \"TTHM\") exposure, and would come with additional regulatory requirements, including significant upgrades to the FWTP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   On March 27, 2013, MDEQ officials acknowledged that the decision to stay with the DWSD or switch to the Flint River was not based on the scientifically determined suitability of the water, but instead that it was \"entirely possible that they will be making decisions relative to cost,\" in the words of MDEQ Deputy Director Jim Sygo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   On March 28, 2013, Dillon e-mailed Governor Snyder and other officials, and recommended that the state \"support the City of Flint's decision to join the KWA,\" and that all relevant officials supported the move. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43.) During this period, Governor Snyder was personally involved in the decision-making process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.) On April 4, 2013, Governor Snyder's Chief of Staff Dennis Muchmore informed Governor Snyder that \"[a]s you know, the Flint people have requested Dillon's ok to break away from the DWSD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Governor Snyder then instructed his Chief of Staff, Dillon, the Emergency Manager of Detroit Kevin Orr, DWSD, and Kurtz to solicit an additional offer from the DWSD before permitting the transition away from the DWSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   DWSD submitted its final proposal later in April. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kurtz and Orr, according to an e-mail from a Senior Policy Advisor in the Michigan Department of Treasury, determined that Flint would not accept the DWSD offer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) Governor Snyder's Executive Director forwarded the e-mail to Governor Snyder on April 29, 2013, and stated that it \"[l]ooks like they adhered to the plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Following this communication, Governor Snyder authorized Kurtz to enter into a contractual relationship with the KWA beginning in mid-2016.

Additional Allegations in the Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The proposed fourth amended complaint adds new factual allegations as follows. During the middle of the twentieth century, Flint's water supply was taken from the Flint River and was of poor quality due to the presence of fecal coliform bacteria and contaminants. (Dkt. 620-3 at 38-39.) Because of these environmental concerns, Flint began evaluating different water sources in the 1960s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Flint eventually mothballed the FWTP around 1965, and entered into an agreement to receive its water from DWSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This agreement gave Flint the exclusive right to sell DWSD water to the remainder of Genesee County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And the Genesee County Drain Commission (GCDC) contracted\n   with Flint to buy DWSD water in order to resell it to local customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In 1973, the GCDC updated its contract with Flint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) The GCDC had to accept water from Flint as delivered, so long as it met \"all requirements of the various State Regulatory Agencies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.) In return, Flint was required to sell water \"generally sufficient to supply the County's system use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) In 2003, the contract was again updated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It similarly required the \"City ... to sell water to the [GCDC] in such quantities as will meet the demands of the County Agency's customers\" and \"the [GCDC] agree[d] to purchase water exclusively from the City[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This was the situation until 2014, when Flint transitioned back to the Flint River as its source of water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Flint was not the only municipality looking to switch its water supply in the early 2000s. Various communities in the same region had formed the KWA in 2009 to explore this possibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) Specifically, the KWA was aiming to construct a new water pipeline connected to Lake Huron. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Walling was elected as the KWA's chair, and Wright was elected its Chief Executive Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Wright later stated that he was motivated to establish the KWA at least in part because DWSD was \"the poster child for Detroit corruption.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   To be viable, the KWA would have to construct a water intake at Lake Huron and sixty-three miles of pipeline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The system would have to supply sixty million gallons of water each day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It was estimated that Genesee County would require forty-two million gallons a day and Flint eighteen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The projected capital cost ran to approximately $ 300 million, of which Flint would shoulder eighty-five million and serve 34.2% of the debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unlike the treated water supplied by DWSD, the KWA water would be raw and would require considerable treatment before use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   By 2013, Wright had secured long-term commitments from most of its members to purchase their future water from the KWA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) The commitments were necessary to fund the bonds required to finance the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, at that time, Flint had not committed to the KWA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And Wright knew that it was doubtful the financing would be successful without Flint's backing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-47.) So beginning in March and April of that year, Wright aggressively argued the case for Flint joining the KWA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) All officials involved in the decision knew that the FWTP would have to be upgraded to process the future supply of raw water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Yet there was a problem with Flint's participation in the KWA: how would it pay for its share of the costs? Under state law, Flint could not issue new bonds because it was in financial receivership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.) An Administrative Consent Order (ACO) would permit Flint to circumvent this problem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129-32.) But the only way Flint could obtain an ACO was from a state agency as a result of an emergency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132.) Accordingly, Flint began pursuing an ACO from the MDEQ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 133.) And although initially hesitant, the MDEQ began to help with the ACO even though there was no prerequisite emergency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 133-34.) The MDEQ executed the ACO on March 20, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136.) Pursuant to its terms, Flint was bound to adopt the interim plan to use the Flint River as its water source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The bond issue that followed allowed the KWA project to move forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   When developing the interim plan, a group of people including defendants Wright, Dillon, and Walling recognized that the FWTP could not process enough\n   water for all of Genesee County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) So together with other officials, these defendants eventually planned for Flint to receive Flint River water while Genesee County would continue to receive DWSD water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This was despite evidence that the use of the Flint River would \"[p]ose an increased microbial risk to public health,\" \"an increased risk of disinfection by-product (carcinogen) exposure,\" and \"[r]equire significant enhancements to treatment [sic] at the [FWTP.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As a necessary part of the interim plan, MDEQ officials issued an operating permit for the FWTP in April 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.) However, they did so without following the required procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126.) Federal law requires states to \"review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136.) In turn, Michigan law regulates the MDEQ's authority to issue permits that impact the State's water systems. Before issuing a permit for certain water sources, the MDEQ is required to provide a public comment period of \"not less than 45 days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136-37.) This regulation applied to the FWTP permitting process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137.) Publicly, the MDEQ stated that \"the city would just continue to buy water from [DWSD]\" if no permit was issued in time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138.) And Flint officials assured people that there would be a series of open forums to permit public questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But when Flint eventually submitted its permit application on March 31, 2013, it was approved in a matter of days, without an opportunity for public comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Flint transitioned to the Flint River on April 25, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.) And in the months that followed, members of Governor Snyder's senior staff began to discuss the possibility of lead contamination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104-05.) In March 2015, a Flint resident wrote an open letter to Walling stating that \"the water is dangerous to our health!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158.) Ambrose eventually received the letter, forwarding it to Flint's public relations firm simply stating, \"[w]elcome to Monday.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Civic groups tried to get the government defendants to take the issue seriously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158-59.) But officials dismissed their concerns as unwarranted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Even as the EPA continued to uncover evidence of lead contamination and some senior members of Governor Snyder's administration voiced the view that the problem was not being taken seriously (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 159-60), many officials continued to deny that anything was wrong. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-62.) Instead, they put it down to \"old time negative racial experiences.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161.) Several officials recommended that more money be spent on public relations to combat the issue, rather than looking to resolve the underlying problem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   On April 28, 2015, Governor Snyder received an e-mail from his chief of staff advising him that the water issue in Flint continued to be a \"danger flag\" for the administration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92.) Later that summer, the Governor's Director of Urban Initiatives discussed with him the growing concerns among Flint residents that they were being exposed to contaminated water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94.) And on September 25, the Governor's chief of staff again e-mailed the Governor to discuss the issue of lead exposure and the potential political implications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103.) In the same communication, the chief of staff opined that the residents of Flint were having their concerns about water quality inappropriately dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.) The Governor received this e-mail almost a week before he publicly acknowledged in October 2015 that Flint's water was contaminated with lead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   103.) In the meantime, MDEQ officials continued to tell the public that \"the drinking water distributed to city customers\n   currently meets all drinking water standards[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Following his public acknowledgment of the crisis in October 2015, the Governor was told in December that in addition to elevated lead levels, Flint residents were also at risk of legionella exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101.) Despite all this knowledge, Governor Snyder did not disclose this risk when he declared a state of emergency on January 5, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102.) It was not until January 13 that he publicly admitted that Flint's water contained legionella bacteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He did this while activating the Michigan National Guard to assist the people of Flint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 14, Governor Snyder asked the federal government to issue an emergency declaration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The federal government did so two days later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In the aftermath of the crisis, facts about how the MDEQ dealt with the disaster came to light. For example, the MDEQ failed to comply with various rules and regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126.) State law requires the MDEQ to notify the public if a source of water is found to be out of compliance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142.) In August 2014, MDEQ officials discussed whether a Flint boil water advisory was caused by a sampling error in a test or a high fecal coliform result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It was far from certain that sampling error was the culprit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And although the MDEQ suspected that the water was contaminated, no one made an effort to investigate the issue or notify the public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Additionally, the MDEQ lacked a nondiscrimination policy required by federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126.) In 1992, the EPA found that the MDEQ had discriminated against Flint's majority African American population in the public participation processes for a power station permit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145-46.) In conducting its investigation, the EPA concluded that the MDEQ had insufficient formalized safeguards to protect against operational discrimination as required by federal regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146.) In 2014, the EPA informed the MDEQ that it was still not in compliance and needed to have in place a non-discrimination policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147.) And even when the MDEQ provided the EPA with a written policy, the EPA determined that it was legally insufficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The same defective policy remains in place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Throughout the crisis and its aftermath, the concerns and fears of the people of Flint were not taken seriously. In the opinion of some government officials, residents \"making noise about civil unrest, violence, [Michigan State Police] shootings and an [emergency manager], [were] the naysayers[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156.) These officials believed that too many of them had \"their handout [sic] and their voices raised,\" and caving to their demands was part of the reason that Flint had been \"placed in receivership twice in the past decade.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156-57.) In the view of these officials, the problem an \"entitlement mentality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157.) Ultimately, the Task Force charged with investigating the causes of the crisis summed it up: \"Flint residents, who are majority Black or African American and among the most impoverished of any metropolitan area in the United States, did not enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards as that provided to other communities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.

Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Several parties question the Court's jurisdiction to rule on plaintiffs' motion. (Dkt. 635 at 4-5; Dkt. 650 at 1-2; Dkt. 653\n   at 12-13; Dkt. 655 at 12-14; Dkt. 657 at 11-12.) They argue that the Court was divested of jurisdiction by appeals filed in response to its August 1, 2018 opinion and order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, as explained in its November 9, 2018 order, the Court retained jurisdiction. (Dkt. 670.) And the Sixth Circuit recently affirmed this position, dismissing defendants' appeals in the process.\n   <em>\n    Carthan v. Snyder\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1967 (6th Cir. Feb. 19, 2019).

Class Definitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Plaintiffs seek leave to amend the class definitions. The third amended complaint broadly defined the class as including all individuals and entities who were exposed to Flint's contaminated water and who experienced injuries or damages to their persons or property. (Dkt. 349 at 112-13.) The fourth amended complaint keeps this general definition but adds a subclass of African Americans. (Dkt. 620-3 at 167-68.) Plaintiffs also further divide the proposed classes into a series of even smaller subclasses based on property damage, personal injury, injunctive relief, and a set of common issues relating to liability and causation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Class certification should occur \"at an early practicable time.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A). The Court is currently preparing a comprehensive case management order that will set forth the timeframe for consideration of class definitions and certification.

Competing Interests and Likelihood of Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Some of the defendants argue that leave to amend the complaint should be denied because plaintiffs' request is unduly delayed. (Dkt. 651 at 19-20; Dkt. 653 at 33-34). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   It is true that the present case has been pending for several years. This is now plaintiffs' fourth amended complaint, and if\n   this were a routine case, their attempt to amend the pleadings again might be unusual. But this litigation is far from routine. The harm alleged and the number of parties involved are extraordinary. What started out as a series of individual suits has become a large consolidated action. And the complex nature of the claims coupled with less than straightforward procedure must be considered. This weighs in plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Conversely, defendants do not explain how they will be prejudiced. Having resisted the start of discovery, they cannot claim that they will be subject to duplicative discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   , 290 F.3d at 800-01. Plaintiffs have not changed their allegations so much that defendants will need to completely overhaul their strategy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prather v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540099\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/1255/#p1259\">\n    918 F.2d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1259 (6th Cir. 1990). And the fourth amended complaint does not contain new claims so far outside the scope of the third amended complaint such that granting leave to amend may later lead to confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lover v.

As a result, leave to amend will not be denied on the basis of prejudice. Instead, the Court will examine each count for futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Futility of Amendments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Bodily Integrity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Plaintiffs first seek leave to amend their bodily integrity claim brought under \u00a7 1983 against defendant Governor Snyder.

Plaintiffs' claim therefore implicates the right to bodily integrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Plaintiffs also plead facts which, when taken as true, show that Governor Snyder was deliberately indifferent. First, plaintiffs plausibly allege that Governor Snyder knew of facts from which he could infer that plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of serious harm. As early as March 2014, members of the Governor's administration were warning that transitioning to the Flint River could lead to a potential disaster. Initial warning signs included an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Flint area. And by October 2014, senior staff, including the Governor's Chief of Staff, were discussing the need to return to DWSD water because of a growing awareness that the treated Flint River water did\n   not meet established quality standards. In July 2015, this clamor continued to build when the Governor's Chief of Staff wrote that concerns over lead contamination were being inappropriately dismissed. There was also a public outcry. Concerned religious leaders informed the administration of problems with the Flint River. News articles discussed lead in Flint's drinking water. And General Motors stopped using Flint water because it was corroding machinery. Considering the seriousness of the potential problem, the widespread reports, and the seniority of the government staff involved, it is reasonable to infer from plaintiffs' allegations that Governor Snyder was aware of this information. As a result, the Governor possessed sufficient facts from which he could have deduced that plaintiffs faced a substantial risk of serious harm from the Flint River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Second, plaintiffs successfully claim that Governor Snyder did in fact infer that plaintiffs faced such a risk of harm. In January 2015, the Governor met with other government officials to discuss the ongoing threat to public health posed by legionella bacteria in the Flint River water. A couple of months later, the Governor and his staff discussed whether to distribute water filters to Flint residents as a form of mitigation against possible contamination. At the same time, the Governor's Chief of Staff informed the Governor that the water issue in Flint continued to be \"a danger flag\" and was something that needed addressing sooner rather than later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92.) And in the summer, a senior member of the administration spoke with Governor Snyder about the fear that Flint's residents were being exposed to toxic levels of lead through the Flint River water. So when plaintiffs state that by February 2015, the Governor was fully aware of a public health threat posed by the water supply in Flint, and that by July 2015, at the very latest, the Governor knew that the water supply was contaminated, these conclusions are supported by well-pleaded factual allegations. It is reasonable to infer that Governor Snyder knew that the residents of Flint faced a substantial risk of serious harm emanating from the water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Third, plaintiffs plausibly state that the Governor acted indifferently to the risk of harm they faced, demonstrating a callous disregard for their right to bodily integrity. This indifference manifested itself in two ways. Initially, the Governor was indifferent because instead of mitigating the risk of harm caused by the contaminated water, he covered it up. In private, he worried about the need to return Flint to DWSD water and the political implications of the crisis. But in public, he denied all knowledge, despite being aware of the developing crisis. As a result, plaintiffs were lured into a false sense of security. They could have taken protective measures, if only they had known what the Governor knew. Instead, the Governor misled them into assuming that nothing was wrong. Governor Snyder's administration even encouraged them to continue to drink and bathe in the water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Subsequently, the Governor continued to show indifference to the risk of harm plaintiffs faced. Even once he acknowledged the crisis, he downplayed the risks that plaintiffs faced. By October 2015, the Governor had publicly admitted that the water was contaminated and Flint had returned to DWSD water. Yet the Governor still waited many months to declare a state of emergency. This was despite local area leaders requesting such a declaration as far back as March 2015. Without a state of emergency, plaintiffs were denied valuable resources that could have helped abate the harm that they were still suffering. It is reasonable to infer that the rationale for\n   the delay was in part because the Governor wanted to act as if the issue was resolved. But by downplaying the continuing risk of harm, the Governor undermined efforts to enact protective measures. And as with his initial form of indifference, this led to plaintiffs involuntarily ingesting lead and other contaminants, violating their bodily integrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   These two ways of showing indifference represent a continuum of actions, more powerful combined than when viewed in isolation. They depict indifference in the form of deception, from the Governor's unwillingness to admit the crisis, to his downplaying of its severity once it became public knowledge. Viewed as a whole, the allegations plausibly describe \"conscience shocking\" conduct. Governor Snyder's actions were deliberately indifference and exhibited a callous disregard for plaintiffs' right to bodily integrity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(Dkt. 620-3 at 181-82.) In plaintiffs' view, there was no rational basis for this decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Even assuming that Flint and the remainder of Genesee County were similarly situated for equal protection purposes, there are many rational reasons that could justify providing only Flint with Flint River water. The KWA could not proceed without Flint's participation. Flint's participation was contingent on the FWTP's ability to process the raw water that the KWA pipeline would provide, and upgrading the FWTP would cost millions. One key way defendants could accomplish this was to stop paying for the relatively expensive DWSD water and to start taking water from the Flint River. Indeed, even plaintiffs allege that this was a critical part of the interim plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   In hindsight, this was a terrible decision. It placed financial interests above the health and safety of Flint's residents. Assuming the allegations are true, defendants harmed plaintiffs in the pursuit of fiscal expedience. But the Court cannot consider the wisdom of the decision. And it does not matter that defendants may have had other options available to them. It only matters that there is a rational basis for the decision. As such, plaintiffs' first theory fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Plaintiffs' second theory fails for a similar reason. They draw a comparison between Flint and other communities with respect to emergencies across the state. Governor Snyder allegedly waited several months to declare a state of emergency in Flint from the date he publicly acknowledged the seriousness of the problem. (Dkt. 620-3 at 102). With other disasters, he typically acted within days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-53.) Plaintiffs again argue that there was no rational basis for this difference in treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Again, even assuming that Flint and these other disaster-struck communities were similarly situated for equal protection purposes, there is a conceivable rational basis for treating them differently. In part, plaintiffs were harmed by the Governor's delay in declaring a state of emergency because it limited their access to state resources to remedy the problem. It is thus conceivable that the Governor initially decided not to expend these resources, believing that the Flint Water Crisis could be addressed without them. In retrospect,\n   this was objectively the wrong decision. And the Governor undoubtedly was within his authority to declare a state of emergency at an earlier time. But the Court cannot inquire further under rational basis review. As a result, plaintiffs' second theory also fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Plaintiffs' third theory runs into a different problem. Plaintiffs allege that the MDEQ defendants Wyant, Shekter-Smith, Prysby, and Busch treated them differently by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   (1) granting a fraudulent [ACO] to allow Flint to borrow funds to participate in the KWA; (2) issuing the [FWTP] a permit pursuant to the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act without observing the statutorily mandated 45-day notice and comment period; (3) failing to comply with sampling and optimized corrosion control protocols as required under the State and Federal Lead and Copper Rule; and (4) lacking any nondiscrimination policy for more than 30 years and ignoring EPA requirements to update its policy for years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183-84.) However, they fail to explain how this treatment differed from that of a similarly situated class of persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Class-based discrimination is the essence of an equal protection claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herron v.

In limited situations, a plaintiff does not need to identify a specific group of persons who were treated differently.

For example, to the extent that defendants failed to observe the statutory forty-five day notice and comment period before issuing the FWTP an operating permit, it may be that they normally dispensed with this requirement. Likewise, although plaintiffs plead that defendants did not comply with state and federal lead and copper testing requirements, the complaint reveals nothing about the possibility that defendants failed to enforce these laws on a statewide basis. Accordingly, plaintiffs' third and final theory also fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   In some of their briefing, plaintiffs argue that rational basis review should not apply to their wealth-based equal protection claim because the claim should be construed as one involving discrimination implicating the fundamental right to bodily integrity. (Dkt. 379 at 88.) However, plaintiffs have not pleaded the claim this way in the fourth amended complaint. And in fact, plaintiffs do not raise this argument in their most recent briefing.

Under each theory, they allege that defendants' conduct negatively impacted Flint. And Flint is majority African American. However, this is not the \"rarest case\" where the discriminatory impact is so stark as to immediately warrant an inference of discriminatory purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomillion v.

After all, Flint is 40.4% white. (Dkt. 620-3 at 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to the historical background for all three theories. They identify a long history of race discrimination and segregation and argue that this should factor into the Court's analysis. (Dkt. 620-1 at 18.) But plaintiffs do not connect Flint's history of systemic racism to defendants' conduct. They imply that the legacy effects of historical racism should be imputed to defendants because they were state actors carrying out official business. But this alone is not enough to warrant an inference of discriminatory purpose. It will be considered with the other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Plaintiffs' first theory, the decision to switch Flint's water supply to the Flint River while providing DWSD water to the remainder of Genesee County, lacks sufficient facts to warrant an inference of discriminatory purpose. Little about the sequence of events indicates that a racial bias was driving defendants. In the months leading up to the switch, cost studies suggested that DWSD water was the more economic mid-term option. But the KWA would only be viable if the Flint River was used as an interim water source. And defendants were concerned that DWSD water would become increasingly expensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Likewise, defendants' contemporary statements do not change the outcome. Defendant Wright expressed the view that DWSD is a corrupt entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this does not indicate racial animus and the fourth amended complaint offers nothing further. Therefore, when all the facts are taken into consideration, the allegations fail to show that race motivated defendants' decision. At most they show that defendants\n   acted in spite of the risk of harm that plaintiffs faced, not that they were driven by it. Plaintiffs' first theory thus fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   With their second theory that the Governor treated the emergency situation in Flint differently, plaintiffs also fail to allege sufficient facts to warrant an inference of discriminatory purpose. Governor Snyder allegedly knew that Flint's water supply was contaminated months before publicly acknowledging it, but he did not alert the public until October 2015, when it was impossible to deny. The Governor also took many months more to declare a state of emergency. And presumably the conditions that gave rise to the eventual emergency declaration existed the whole time. Similarly, a departure from past practice works in plaintiffs' favor. Governor Snyder's conduct in Flint differed from that in some majority white communities, where he promptly issued states of emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Nonetheless, these facts taken as a whole do not support an inference of discriminatory intent. The comparative states of emergency identified in the fourth amended complaint involved drastically different situations, such as several wildfires and floods, meaning plaintiffs' comparison is less apples-to-apples than it initially appears. And in the one instance where plaintiffs cite to an emergency involving water contamination, they identify an incident that occurred several years after the facts pertinent to this present case. Accordingly, it is hard to know whether the Governor's prompt response was a reaction to the criticism about his handling of Flint, rather than evidence of a desire to harm African Americans. Moreover, plaintiffs do not point to a clear pattern of discrimination where Governor Snyder consistently delayed declaring states of emergency in mostly African American areas. In fact, a close inspection of the analogous emergencies suggests the opposite was almost true. During a flood in Wayne County, which is 45.4% non-white, the Governor declared an emergency within two days. (Dkt. 620-3 at 152.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The departure from practice is less salient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Plaintiffs point to no other facts sufficient to support a finding of discriminatory purpose. During the crisis, a senior member of the Governor's administration dismissed complaints from Flint activists as the product of \"old time negative racial experiences.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161.) But even if the same thoughts are attributed to Governor Snyder, it only shows that he acted in spite of the fact that Flint was majority African American, not because of this fact. When the allegations are collectively considered, they do not warrant an inference of invidious intent. And as such, plaintiffs' second theory fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs' third theory that the MDEQ defendants failed to enforce certain laws and policies also fails to allege sufficient facts to warrant an inference of discriminatory purpose. As discussed above, plaintiffs generally point to Flint's history of racial discrimination, and this alone is insufficient to show invidious intent. However, here, plaintiffs also note that the EPA had concluded earlier that the MDEQ had discriminated against Flint's African Americans when issuing an operating permit for a local power station. In particular, the EPA found that the MDEQ did not have a sufficient non-discrimination\n   policy in place. And this lack of policy persisted during the Flint Water Crisis. As recently as 2017, the EPA was still raising concerns that the MDEQ did not take its non-discrimination obligations seriously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   However, the MDEQ's failure to develop a sufficient non-discrimination policy does not demonstrate discriminatory intent. Plaintiffs do not allege that Shekter-Smith, Prysby, and Busch were responsible for the MDEQ's internal policies. Nor is there any sign that they obstructed or otherwise hindered the development of other procedural safeguards. Defendant Wyant, as MDEQ director, was presumably ultimately responsible for the non-discrimination policy, but plaintiffs do not plead facts that suggest his failure to develop such a policy was motivated by a nefarious purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Neither the specific sequence of events nor any departure from standard procedures suggest a race-based motive. Defendants Shekter-Smith and Busch were allegedly involved in helping Flint secure a fraudulent ACO. Yet there is no suggestion that a desire to harm African Americans motivated their conduct. The same is true of the decision to grant the FWTP an operating permit without sufficient public participation, and the MDEQ's failure to enforce lead and copper testing requirements. The allegations do not provide any way to link these decisions to a discriminatory intent. Plaintiffs allege that these types of nonconformities with law and policy never occurred in majority white communities, but these are conclusory accusations. These defendants also made no contemporary statements indicating that race motivated their actions. And there is nothing else to connect their conduct to a discriminatory purpose. As such, when the facts are considered together, plaintiffs' third theory fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Plaintiffs' equal protection allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The wealth-based claim fails on grounds that rational justifications conceivably exist that explain the challenged conduct. And the race-based claim fails because plaintiffs plead insufficient facts to infer that a discriminatory purpose motivated defendants' decisions. That is not to say that race and poverty did not play a role in the Flint Water Crisis. As plaintiffs explain, multiple sources indicate that historical patterns of discrimination created the conditions for what happened. But under current caselaw, the Equal Protection Clause does not provide redress for the harms as alleged. Granting plaintiffs' leave to amend the complaint to include them would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Plaintiffs possibly show that the impact of historical race discrimination played a role in the Flint Water Crisis, but not that it was a motivating factor. For example, plaintiffs repeatedly assert that the interim plan provided safe water to predominantly white Genesee County residents and unsafe water to the mostly African American Flint residents. But this only demonstrates a disparate impact resulting from defendants' decisions. It does not show that they were motivated by the kind of discriminatory animus necessary to state a \u00a7 1985(3) claim. Similarly, plaintiffs contend that early complaints from Flint residents would have been taken into account faster had they been affluent and predominantly white. This allegation suffers from the same flaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Many of the facts contained in the fourth amended complaint set forth the historic impact of racism in Flint, but not specific instances of racially motivated conduct by the defendants. This history is important to understanding patterns of segregation, poverty, and other conditions that may have left plaintiffs vulnerable to the Flint Water Crisis. Yet such theories do not show invidious class-based animus by the named defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Plaintiffs raise many serious and challenging issues, but they fail to plausibly allege that race discrimination animated defendants' conduct. This is especially so considering the heightened pleading standard. Therefore, their revised \u00a7 1985(3) claim could not withstand a motion to dismiss. As such, granting leave to amend the complaint to include it would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Gross Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs seek leave to add a gross negligence claim against defendants Snyder, Dillon, Lyon, Shekter-Smith, Rosenthal, Busch, Cook, Prysby, Wurfel, Wright, Kurtz, Earley, Ambrose, Croft, Johnson, and Glasgow. (Dkt. 620-3 at 217.) Plaintiffs allege that these government defendants owed them a duty not to conduct their official responsibilities recklessly (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), but that they did so by playing a role in Flint's transition to the Flint River and downplaying the resulting harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217-18.) Plaintiffs argue that defendants' conduct was grossly negligent and caused their injuries, and that defendants are not entitled to immunity under Michigan's Government Tort Liability Act (GTLA), Mich. Comp. Laws. \u00a7 691.1401 -1419 (2014). (Dkt. 620-3 at 218.)

The GTLA premises immunity on various theories. Pertinently, \"the elective or highest appointive executive official of all levels of government are immune from tort liability for injuries to persons or damages to property if he or she is acting within the scope of his or her ... executive authority.\" \u00a7 691.1407(5).

Instead, plaintiffs argue that they need only demonstrate that \"it was foreseeable that the defendant's conduct could result in harm to the victim.\" (Dkt. 620-1 at 22 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%2052\">\n    501 Mich. at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20366\">\n    903 N.W.2d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) But this is a misinterpretation of\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   , a case this Court is bound to follow. And because plaintiffs ask the Court to do something it cannot, amending the fourth amended complaint to include this claim would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Plaintiffs raise several counter arguments, but none are persuasive. First, plaintiffs argue that defendants were not acting within the scope of their authority, and, as such, they cannot claim immunity. (Dkt. 663 at 50-52.) For instance, plaintiffs contend that Governor Snyder did not have the power to discriminate against African American communities in his handling of emergencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51.) Similarly, plaintiffs argue that Lyon and Wurfel did not have the authority to downplay the risks of harm posed by the contaminated water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.) But these arguments are circular. Under plaintiffs' view, tortious conduct is sufficient to deprive a government defendant of immunity because tortious conduct is not within the defendant's scope of authority. This is not how the GTLA functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Second, plaintiffs claim that even if their interpretation of caselaw is wrong, they have adequately pleaded that defendants were the \"most immediate, efficient, and direct cause\" of plaintiffs' injuries, because each defendants' conduct served as \"the proximate cause\" for some discrete harm that, taken in the aggregate, forms a piece of the Flint Water Crisis.

In other words, it is not enough that plaintiffs are able to point to some cause and effect relationship within the Flint Water Crisis.

(Dkt. 279 at 29-32; Dkt. 739 at 16-18.) The state defendants are correct that sovereign immunity bars claims against the State of Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Boler v.

It held that the\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception applied to the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs against Governor Snyder in his official capacity. There, the plaintiffs sought an \"injunctive order to remediate the harm caused by Defendants' unconstitutional conduct including, but not limited to: repairs of private property and establishment of medical monitoring to provide healthcare and other appropriate services to Class members for a period of time deemed appropriate by the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275592\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/391/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275592\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/391/\">\n    at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The claim for injunctive relief against Governor Snyder in his official capacity may go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Second, the city defendants argue that sovereign immunity deprives the Court of jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs' claims against the City of Flint because it was an arm of the State in the period leading up to and including the Flint Water Crisis. (Dkt. 276 at 43-55.) According to the city defendants, Flint is therefore entitled to the same cloak of sovereign immunity as that afforded the State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the Sixth Circuit recently rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Guertin v.

This argument is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   In sum, although immunity with regards to the State of Michigan is granted, it is denied as to Governor Snyder in his official capacity and the City of Flint.

Absolute Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Defendants Wyant and Wurfel claim absolute immunity from plaintiffs' lawsuit. They rely on the immunity awarded to federal officials carrying out discretionary prosecutorial actions, arguing that they were functionally acting as federal officials despite working for a state agency. (Dkt. 281 at 38-40; Dkt. 282 at 33-34.) However, the Sixth Circuit rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Mays v.

(Dkt. 620-3 at 172.) According to plaintiffs, they did this by acting with deliberate indifference to the risk of harm plaintiffs faced, creating and perpetuating their exposure to contaminated water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-73.) Defendants move to dismiss. (Dkt. 294 at 3-10; Dkt. 282 at 17-23; Dkt. 281 at 17-28; Dkt. 279 at 37-43; Dkt. 277 at 18-22; Dkt. 276 at 20-23; Dkt. 273 at 32-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   As set forth earlier in this opinion, plaintiffs unknowingly drank and bathed in contaminated water, encroaching upon their right to bodily integrity.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.d.ii.1. Therefore, to state a bodily integrity claim, plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) the government defendants knew of facts from which they could infer a substantial risk of serious harm, (2) they did infer it, and (3) they nonetheless acted with indifference, demonstrating a callous disregard towards the rights of those affected.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.d.ii.1.a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   The Court will address the allegations against each group of government defendants in turn. Because the right to bodily integrity is clearly established, defendants cannot rely on qualified immunity if plaintiffs state a valid claim against them.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.d.ii.1.b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

For the same reason, plaintiffs Frances Gilcreast, Epco Sales, LLC, and Angelo's Coney Island Palace, Inc. fail to state a bodily integrity claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   <strong>\n    b. State Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   The remaining plaintiffs allege that defendants Governor Snyder, Andrew Dillon, Nick Lyon, and Nancy Peeler violated their right to bodily integrity. For the following reasons, plaintiffs state a claim against defendants Governor Snyder and Dillon, but not against Lyon or Peeler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Plaintiffs state a bodily integrity claim against Dillon. He allegedly knew that the Flint River had been rejected as a water source as recently as 2011, and that the FWTP would require substantial improvements to safely process the river's water. From this, it is reasonable to believe that Dillon was aware of the risks associated with using the Flint River as a water source. Yet despite this knowledge, Dillon helped to develop an interim plan that saw Flint transition to the Flint River. And importantly, he rejected a final bid from DWSD that could have obviated the need to use water from the Flint River until the FWTP had the capacity to treat it safely. This demonstrated an indifference to the risk of serious harm plaintiffs faced, made all the more inexplicable given that he knew DWSD presented the most cost effective mid-term option.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Conversely, plaintiffs do not state a bodily integrity claim against Lyon. It is reasonable to conclude that Lyon was aware of the risk of harm plaintiffs faced. As the crisis unfolded, he received materials showing an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Flint. He also received emails from senior government officials raising concerns about possible lead contamination in Flint's water. Moreover, he was surely aware that these incidents coincided with the transition to the Flint River. However, plaintiffs fail to show how Lyon was deliberately indifferent. It is true that he did not make the information he received public, nor did he alert other government departments. But he directed his team to investigate the reports and emails, which shows his concern. And plaintiffs do not plead that Lyon attempted to cover up what was happening. Therefore, without more, the claim against Lyon does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs' claim against Governor Snyder is successful for the reasons set forth in Section II.d.ii.1. On the other hand, plaintiffs' claim against Peeler fails because the complaint contains no factual allegations against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   <strong>\n    c. MDEQ Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Plaintiffs next allege that defendants Bradley Wurfel, Daniel Wyant, Liane Shekter-Smith, Adam Rosenthal, Stephen Busch, Patrick Cook, and Michael Prysby violated their right to bodily integrity. For\n   the following reasons, plaintiffs state a bodily integrity claim against Wurfel, Shekter-Smith, Rosenthal, Busch, Cook, and Prysby. They do not state a claim against Wyant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Plaintiffs state a bodily integrity claim against Wurfel. He knew of ample facts from which to infer that plaintiffs were facing a substantial risk of harm, and it is reasonable to conclude that he did infer it. For example, Wurfel knew about the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. And he was also well aware that something was wrong with Flint's water. Moreover, plaintiffs demonstrate that Wurfel acted with deliberate indifference. On several occasions as the crisis unfolded, he publicly denied that there was a problem with Flint's water. He appeared on radio and television to advise listeners that the water was safe to consume and bathe in, and he discredited others who suggested that lead was leaching into Flint's water. Such indifference showed a callous disregard for plaintiffs' right to bodily integrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Plaintiffs also state a claim against Shekter-Smith, Rosenthal, Busch, Cook, and Prysby. It is reasonable to assume that they were aware of the substantial risk of harm plaintiffs faced. Before Flint's transition to the Flint River, Shekter-Smith and Busch knew of the risks associated with the Flint River. In addition, Busch, Rosenthal, and Prysby recognized that the FWTP was not ready to begin operations. After the transition, Rosenthal learned that the FWTP was not practicing corrosion control, and he and Shekter-Smith both knew that no legitimate lead and copper testing was occurring. Moreover, Busch, Shekter-Smith, and Prysby also knew that the transition had created the conditions for legionella bacteria to flourish. Not to mention the fact that the EPA and civic leaders were raising concerns about the quality of Flint's water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   Yet despite knowing of these serious risks, these defendants were indifferent to them. Shekter-Smith ensured that Flint received the ACO that allowed it to transition to the Flint River; Cook signed the final permit necessary for the FWTP to begin operations; and Busch resolved the regulatory hurdles associated with Flint's use of the Flint River. Furthermore, these defendants took steps to deceive Flint's residents into continuing to drink and bathe in the contaminated water. Busch and Cook misled the EPA by falsely suggesting that the proper corrosion control was in use at the FWTP;\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Busch, Rosenthal, and Prysby directly or indirectly altered reports to remove results showing high lead concentrations in Flint's water. These actions exhibited a callous disregard for plaintiffs' right to bodily integrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   In contrast, plaintiffs do not state a claim against Wyant because the allegations do not demonstrate deliberate indifference. Wyant was likely aware of the health risks posed by using the Flint River as a water source. There is also some indication that he knew the FWTP was not utilizing the proper corrosion control techniques and that Flint's water was contaminated. However, the fourth amended complaint contains nothing to suggest that Wyant either publicly denied there was a problem with Flint's water, or that he otherwise encouraged Flint residents to use the contaminated water. Plaintiffs\n   therefore do not plead that Wyant was deliberately indifferent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   <strong>\n    d. City Defendants and Defendant Wright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs allege that defendants Darnell Earley, Gerald Ambrose, Howard Croft, Daugherty Johnson, Michael Glasgow, Jeffrey Wright, Edward Kurtz, and Dayne Walling violated their right to bodily integrity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, plaintiffs state a claim against Earley, Ambrose, Croft, Johnson, and Glasgow. They fail to state a claim against Wright, Kurtz, and Walling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Plaintiffs state a bodily integrity claim against Earley and Ambrose. It is reasonable to infer that Earley and Ambrose were aware of the substantial risk of harm plaintiffs faced. After Flint transitioned to the Flint River, they knew about the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease ; General Motors stopped using Flint water at its Flint factory because of its corrosive nature; and test results revealed high lead levels in two locations on the University of Michigan-Flint's campus. There were even growing calls from senior government officials that Flint \"should try to get back on the Detroit system as a stopgap ASAP before this thing gets too far out of control.\" (Dkt. 630-3 at 66.) Additionally, plaintiffs plead that Earley and Ambrose were indifferent to this risk. Earley publicly denied any connection between the Legionnaires' disease outbreak and Flint's water, despite knowing that other branches of government concluded that there was a link. And he repeatedly refused to consider returning to DWSD water. Having replaced Earley as the Emergency Manager, Ambrose also refused to return to DWSD. He even went so far as rejecting a Flint City Council vote to reconnect to DWSD. In both cases, Earley and Ambrose's conduct thus showed a callous disregard for plaintiffs' right to bodily integrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Similarly, plaintiffs state a claim against Croft, Glasgow, and Johnson. As with Early and Ambrose, it is reasonable to conclude that these defendants were aware of the substantial risk of harm facing plaintiffs. As the transition to the Flint River loomed, all three knew that the FWTP was not ready to process the raw water. And Croft, in particular, was aware of the lead and Legionnaires' disease issues that followed the transition. Glasgow tested for and found high concentrations of lead in the water. He also recognized that Flint was not using corrosion control treatment and had no legitimate lead and copper testing in place. Moreover, these defendants acted with a callous disregard for plaintiffs' right to bodily integrity. Despite knowing that the FWTP was not ready to process the Flint River water, Croft and Johnson pressured Glasgow to give the green light to the transition. Johnson later blocked the Genesee County Health Department from scrutinizing Flint's water testing process. And Glasgow altered reports to hide high lead concentrations in Flint's water. Croft, Glasgow, and Johnson were thus deliberately indifferent by deceiving plaintiffs into thinking that there was no problem with Flint's water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   In contrast, plaintiffs fail to state a claim against Wright because they do not show how he either caused or prolonged their exposure to the contaminated water. First, plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that Wright caused their exposure because he had no oversight over Flint's transition to the Flint River. Plaintiffs argue that Flint and Genesee County's water systems were unified, suggesting that Wright's position as Genesee County's Drain Commissioner gave him the means to affect the choice of Flint's water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54 (\"[B]ecause of the joint operation of the combined water systems, each of [the defendants] played a role in the decision to provide ... Flint ... with the high risk water[.]\").) But the fourth amended complaint reveals that the arrangement between Flint and Genesee County was a standard contractual relationship. Those in charge of Flint's system purchased water and then sold it to Genesee County. And although Genesee County was required to buy it, the County had no say in where it came from. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40 (\"[GCDC] agreed to 'accept water as delivered from the water system of the City [of Flint.]' \").) In other words, Wright was in charge of Genesee County's water system, but not Flint's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53 (\"Wright was in control of the County side of the jointly operated water systems[.]\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Second, Wright did not prolong plaintiffs' exposure to the contaminated water. Plaintiffs do not plead that Wright took steps to deceive Flint residents about the safety of Flint's water following the transition, or that he otherwise played a role in any coverup. Although Wright may have been aware of the risk of harm plaintiffs faced, he did not cause their injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   The same goes for Kurtz and Walling. Here too, plaintiffs fail to state a claim against these defendants because they do not show how they caused or prolonged plaintiffs' exposure to the contaminated water. Although Kurtz may have set in motion the chain of events that led to the transition to the Flint River, he resigned as Flint's Emergency Manager before the transition and therefore lacked control over the final decision. Additionally, Walling was involved in the decision to use the Flint River as an interim source of water but he was stripped of virtually all authority over Flint's operations during emergency management. Plaintiffs also do not allege that either of these defendants deceived plaintiffs about the safety of Flint's water or that defendants helped coverup the crisis. Thus, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against these defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   In summary, plaintiffs state a claim against Earley, Ambrose, Croft, Glasgow, and Johnson. Plaintiffs do not state a claim against Wright, Kurtz, and Walling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Equal Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   In Counts II and III, the African American plaintiffs allege that defendants Snyder, Dillon, Wright, Ambrose, Kurtz, Earley, Wyant, Shekter-Smith, Prysby, and Busch violated their right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons set forth above, plaintiffs fail to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.d.ii.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

State-Created Danger\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   In Count IX, plaintiffs allege that the government defendants violated their right to be free from a state-created danger. (Dkt. 620-3 at 208.) Plaintiffs plead that the government defendants created the conditions that led to the Flint Water Crisis and then attempted to cover up the resulting risk of harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In their view, because the government defendants knew or should have known of the danger they created, they violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208-09.) Defendants move to dismiss. (Dkt. 294 at 13-16; Dkt. 282 at 23-25; Dkt. 281 at 28-30; Dkt. 279 at 35-37; Dkt. 277 at 18-22; Dkt. 276 at 19-20; Dkt. 273 at 24-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   In its vacated August 1, 2018 opinion and order, the Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss an identical count. Nothing in the fourth amended complaint affects the Court's earlier analysis.

The residents of Flint were all made to use contaminated water that leached lead and bacteria from old lines.

For much of the time the Flint River was used as Flint's primary water source, residents did not and could not have known the danger the water posed to them or their families. To entertain plaintiffs' counsel's theory of harm, the Court would have to find that a loving parent, seeking only to provide their child with food or water, committed an intentional or at least negligent act of violence against his or her own child. According to counsel, every person who showered or washed their hands or made coffee or boiled pasta with bacteria-infected, lead-tainted water provided to them by their government committed repeated acts of violence against themselves, their families, their friends, and their guests.

Veolia argues that plaintiffs' allegation of recklessness is insufficiently pleaded. However, the allegation meets the fraud pleading standard. Information about Veolia's recklessness in 2015 is solely within the knowledge of Veolia's decision-makers. On a theory of recklessness and ignorance about the veracity of a statement in a fraud claim, the plaintiffs' voluminous factual background about the information known to Flint, which retained Veolia, and to the public at large in 2015, satisfies this pleading requirement.

The phrase \"which Plaintiffs did\" is the sole factual allegation in the complaint stating that any plaintiff specifically relied on these statements in continuing to drink Flint River water after February 2015. That statement lacks any specificity as to when or how any plaintiff heard the allegedly fraudulent statements, which were set forth in a report purportedly on the city's website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-394\">\n   At oral argument, plaintiffs argued that specific reliance was pleaded with regard to at least one plaintiff: Tiantha Williams.

They also relied on statements about the safety of the water that were made in public forums.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) These general allegations are insufficient to specifically plead that Williams heard and relied on Veolia's statements.

(\"LAN P.C.\"), and Lockwood, Andrews &amp; Newnam, Inc. (\"LAN, Inc.\"), making it impossible to tell what each entity did. The Court has addressed the relationship between LAD, LAN P.C., and LAN, Inc. in a prior opinion. (Dkt. 437.) LAD is the parent company of LAN, Inc.; LAN P.C. is a corporation established to satisfy licensing requirements for LAN, Inc. to operate in the state of Michigan. (Id. at 4.) An agreement between LAD and LAN, Inc. establishes a relationship between the two companies in which all LAN, Inc. employees are LAD employees and all LAN, Inc. revenues go to a joint bank account over which LAD had full control. (Id. at 10-11.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-433\">\n   Because LAN P.C. was a legal entity created solely to permit LAN, Inc. to perform work in Michigan, all work LAN, Inc. performed can be attributed to LAN P.C. Because all employees of LAN, Inc. were actually employees of LAD, all work those employees performed, including the work at issue in this case, can be attributed to LAD. The complaint treats all three companies as a single entity for pleading purposes because, based on the corporate structure of the companies, they are indistinguishable for the purposes of this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-434\">\n   LAN also objects to being \"lumped in\" with Veolia with regard to some allegations. (Dkt. 283 at 26.) The complaint clearly specifies the actions LAN and Veolia each took with respect to Flint's water supply, and sometimes refers to them jointly because either both sets of defendants had similar duties, if at different times, or because plaintiffs are asserting similar claims against both sets of defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527043\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/369/\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d at 391-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   <strong>\n    e.
