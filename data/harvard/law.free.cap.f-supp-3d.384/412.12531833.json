(Doc. 43 (\"Ds' 56.1 Resp.\") \u00b6 1.) Defendant Fireservice Management LLC f/k/a Fireservice Management Michigan LLC (\"Fireservice\"), a Michigan limited liability company that cleans and repairs protective clothing used in the firefighting industry, (Doc. 47 (\"Ps' 56.1 Resp.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2), was a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, (Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 3). Pursuant to this agreement, Fireservice made contributions to the Fund on behalf of certain of Fireservice's employees.

He also initially owned 100 percent of Fireservice, but Joel Weiner purchased a 49 percent interest in Fireservice on July 1, 2007, and maintained that interest through the filing date of the Complaint in this case. (Doc. 42-1 (\"Smeltzer Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 20-22; Doc. 42-2 (\"Weiner Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) Mr. Smeltzer and Mr. Weiner each own 50 percent of the membership interests of two other businesses incorporated in Michigan: TurnoutRental LLC, which rents out firefighting gear, and Schoolcraft Ventures LLC, which owns the real property out of which Fireservice and TurnoutRental operate (together, \"Proposed Intervenors\").

(Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 3.) According to Plaintiffs, however, Defendants \"were parties to a series of collective bargaining agreements\" and \"collectively identified themselves as the employer obligated to make contributions to the Fund.\" (Doc. 54 (\"Ps' 56.1 Stmt.\") \u00b6 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 4, 2011, the Fund notified Defendants that it had determined that \"Fire Service Management LLC f/k/a White Tower Laundry\" had withdrawn from the Plan as of December 31, 2009, and therefore incurred a withdrawal liability to the Fund of $ 221,783.46 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201381\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Oh Decl. Ex. B; Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.) The notice demanded that Defendants make eighty payments of $ 4,079.09 per quarter beginning on or before June 1, 2011. (Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 6.) On June 15, 2011, the Fund notified Defendants that they had failed to make the first quarterly payment and would be in default unless they cured within sixty days. (Oh Decl. Ex. C; Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 2, 2011, and July 1, 2011, Fireservice requested by letter that Plaintiffs review their withdrawal liability determination because Fireservice is \"separate and distinct\" from Smeltzer. (Oh Decl. Ex. D; Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 9.) Defendants did not initiate arbitration of the withdrawal liability. (Ps' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 10.)

The first claim alleges that Defendant Fireservice is in default within the meaning of Section 4219(c)(5)(A) of ERISA and that Plaintiffs are entitled to immediate payment of withdrawal liability in the amount of $ 221,783.46 plus accrued interest, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees and costs under Section 502(g). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 21-30; Ps' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 7.) The second claim alleges that Defendant Smeltzer is an \"employer\" of the employees of Fireservice within the meaning of Section 3(5) of ERISA because it had an alter ego, single employer, and/or joint employer relationship with Fireservice, and that Smeltzer therefore is jointly\n   and severally liable for Fireservice's withdrawal liability, interest, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-35.) The third claim alleges that John Doe Defendants 1-10 are and at all relevant times were trades or businesses under common control with Fireservice under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA and Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that the John Does are therefore jointly and severally liable for the total amount of Fireservice's liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-40.) The fourth claim alleges that the Fund will be irreparably harmed unless Defendants are immediately restrained from disposing of their assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Discovery concluded on June 4, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21.) On September 7, 2018, Proposed Intervenors moved to intervene or be joined. (Doc. 34 (\"Intervenors' Mem.\").) On the same date Proposed Intervenors also moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' third and fourth claims on the ground that Proposed Intervenors were not under common control with Defendants when Fireservice withdrew from the Plan. (Doc. 35; Doc. 40 (\"Intervenors' SJ Mem.\") at 2.) On October 15, 2018, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their claims against Fireservice and Smeltzer.

Defendants deny that Smeltzer was a party to the collective bargaining agreement governing Fireservice's contributions. (Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 3.) Even though Plaintiffs produced several agreements that name \"Smeltzer Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Fireservice Management\" as a party, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oh Decl. Ex. A at 2, 19-22, 38-41), Defendants raise a fact dispute by claiming that this was an error that Smeltzer tried to rectify. (Ds' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 3.) Their position is bolstered by the fact that other agreements provided by Plaintiffs do not refer to Smeltzer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oh Decl. Ex. A at 45-47, 66-69.) Further, Defendants contend that Fireservice and Smeltzer operated different businesses, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Smeltzer Aff. \u00b6 5; Weiner Aff. \u00b6 5); served distinct customer bases, (Smeltzer Aff. \u00b6 5 (automotive industry); Weiner Aff. \u00b6 6 (fire departments) ); had different owners (although Martin T. Smeltzer was an owner of both), (Smeltzer Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Weiner Aff. \u00b6 18); filed separate tax returns, maintained separate bank accounts, and kept separate financial records, (Smeltzer Aff. \u00b6 32; Weiner Aff. \u00b6 13); paid retirement contributions separately (Smeltzer Aff. \u00b6 30; Weiner Aff. \u00b6 17); and employed different people (Smeltzer Aff. \u00b6 34; Weiner Aff. \u00b6 15). Accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that Smeltzer was not party to the relevant collective bargaining agreements and therefore was not an employer under the MPPAA at the time of withdrawal. Thus, Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion is denied as to Smeltzer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Unconscionability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants urge the Court to enter an order that Fireservice is not responsible for Smeltzer's withdrawal liability by arguing that imposing the total withdrawal liability assessed on Fireservice would be procedurally and substantively unconscionable.

Even\n   if the common law unconscionability doctrine is a defense to MPPAA withdrawal liability,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   imposing liability on Fireservice is not unconscionable.

Defendants have made no showing that Fireservice lacked any meaningful choice when entering the collective bargaining agreements that support its employer status. Moreover, Defendants fail the substantive unconscionability prong. They argue that the amount Plaintiffs seek includes Smeltzer's withdrawal liability, and that \"impos[ing] the Smeltzer Group's substantial withdrawal liability on Fireservice\" would be substantively unconscionable because Smeltzer was a larger company that had a \"vast, decades-long contribution history.\" (D's Mem. at 14-15.)
