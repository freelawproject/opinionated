Stadtmueller, U.S. District Judge\n   On February 11, 2019 Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging fraud and violations of Wisconsin state law in connection with their rights as shareholders. (Docket #45). On March 7, 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, in which they sought dismissal of Counts Four and Five of the amended complaint. (Docket #50). Count Four seeks declaratory judgment that a transfer restriction implemented in 2014 (the \"2014 Restriction\") does not apply to John Dewey (\"John\")'s shares because his shares were issued prior to the 2014 Restriction, and because he did not vote for or agree to the 2014 Restriction. Count Five seeks declaratory judgment that the 2014 Restriction is unenforceable. The motion to dismiss is fully briefed. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case consist of minority shareholders of several closely held corporations, as well as various related trusts and beneficiaries. Defendants are the majority shareholders and five companies. The key players among Plaintiffs are Nancy Dewey (\"Nancy\") and her son, John, (collectively, \"the Deweys\"), who are eager to sell their shares in the companies but are having difficulty valuing (and thus selling) their shares. The key players among Defendants are Kurt Bechthold (\"Kurt\") and David Bechthold (\"David\") (collectively, \"the Bechtholds\"), who are Nancy's brothers, and who run the defendant companies (\"the Defendant Companies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This story begins in 1967, when the Defendant Companies first adopted a transfer restriction (the \"1967 Restriction\") which included a right-of-refusal provision that required a seller of company stock to first offer to the stock to the corporation for thirty days, and then to other holders of the same class of stock for thirty days, each time at an option price. (Docket #45 at 15). If, after this sixty-day period, the stock was not purchased, then the stockholder would be free to sell his shares to a third party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060229\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/476/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The option price was described as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [T]he book value of the stock determined by a balance sheet stated according to recognized accounting practice as of the end of the calendar month preceding the offer to the corporation and in such balance sheet no value shall be assigned to any good will but the value of all contracts and work in progress shall be included on a percentage of\n   completion basis according to recognized accounting practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060229\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/476/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs understand this definition to mean that the \"book value\" was based on the shares' \"market value.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060229\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/476/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   John's shares were subject to the 1967 Restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1993, the Defendant Companies enacted another transfer restriction bylaw (the \"1993 Restriction\") which elaborated that the option price would be calculated as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he book value of the stock determined by\n   <em>\n    the corporation's\n   </em>\n   balance sheet\n   <em>\n    included in its financial statements and\n   </em>\n   stated\n   <em>\n    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently\n   </em>\n   applied as of the end of the calendar month preceding the offer to the corporation and in such balance sheet no value shall be assigned to any good will but the value of all contracts and work in progress shall be included on a percentage of completion basis\n   <em>\n    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (additions underlined in amended complaint). According to Plaintiffs, this new definition of option value required the book value to be calculated solely on \"the corporation's balance sheet included in its financial statements,\" which effectively allows the controlling shareholders to set the book value. John did not vote for the 1993 Restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2014, another restriction was created to protect certain inter-trust transfers. John objected to the 2014 Restriction to the extent that it contained the right-of-refusal language from the 1993 Restriction-which he had not voted for-but agreed with its protective effects on the trusts. He was led to believe that he could vote in favor of the 2014 Restriction while retaining his right to challenge the right-of-refusal provision to which he did not agree. Accordingly, John voted in favor of the 2014 Restriction. When John subsequently tried to value and sell his shares, he claims that he was unfairly held to the 2014 Restriction's definition of option value as book value. Because of this, he claims that Defendants fraudulently induced John into voting for the 2014 Restriction. Plaintiffs allege that the 2014 Restriction gives the Bechtholds the ability \"to manipulate the books in order to force minority stockholders to sell their shares to the controllers at an artificially-depressed price,\" which makes the right-of-refusal provision \"unreasonable and unenforceable\" as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    3. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the 2014 Restriction does not apply to John and that it is generally invalid and unenforceable. Defendants contend that claim preclusion bars John from arguing that the 2014 Restriction does not apply to him (\"Count Four\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They further\n   contend that the claim for declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the right-of-refusal provision (\"Count Five\") must be dismissed because it is barred by the statute of limitations and issue preclusion. Defendants also argue that the 2014 Restriction is presumptively valid; that the \"manifestly unreasonable\" requirement does not apply to right-of-refusal restrictions; that requiring a book value purchase price does not make the right-of-refusal provision unreasonable or unenforceable; and that there is no conflict of interest that would make the provision unenforceable. Finally, Defendants argue that even if John is not subject to the 2014 Restriction, he is still subject to the 1967 Restriction, which is not substantially different from the 2014 Restriction. For the reasons explained below, the Court will dismiss Count Five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3.1 Count Four - 2014 Restriction Application to John\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the \"2014 Restriction does not apply to John's shares because his shares were issued prior to the enactment of the bylaws containing the 2014 Restriction and the Defendant Companies are estopped from asserting that John voted in favor of the 2014 Restriction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Under Wisconsin law, a transfer restriction \"may not affect shares and other securities issued before the restriction is adopted unless the holders of the shares and other securities are parties to the transfer restriction agreement or vote in favor of the transfer restriction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20180.0627\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 180.0627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b). Plaintiffs have alleged facts that John did not vote in favor of the right-of-refusal provisions contained in the 2014 Restriction which, in most cases, would be sufficient to survive the motion to dismiss stage. However, Defendants have argued that preclusion bars this claim as a matter of law, which will be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3.1.1 Preclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue that Count Four is barred by claim preclusion. The Court looks to Wisconsin law to assess the preclusive effect of a ruling of a Wisconsin state court, and to determine the nature and scope of preclusion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Marrese v.

Broadly speaking, he complained that the Bechtholds \"refused to appropriately share in the control over the Defendant Companies\" and \"refused to make fair distributions.\" (Docket #52-12 at 12). He alleged that he was being squeezed out of the company,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13; that Defendants prevented him from receiving dividends (and instead paid themselves unreasonably high salaries),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 19; that Defendants made improper investments and unauthorized loans,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14; that Defendants engaged in self-dealing that harmed both the company and John,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; that Ned Bechthold exposed shareholders to adverse tax consequences,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21; and that Defendants violated John's rights as a minority shareholder, specifically by making it difficult for John to attend an annual meeting,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. John sought, among other things, a fair buy-out of his interest in the Defendant Companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. In his state court complaints, he also challenged Defendants' refusal to change the right-of-refusal provision's \"book value\" to the \"fair market value\" as a breach of fiduciary duty in light of the tax results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket #52-5 at 17); (Docket #52-12 at 21-22). The state court dismissed the case, holding that John had failed to allege claims of breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, and promissory estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Count Four of the amended complaint relates to a right-of-refusal provision that was enacted in 2014, in the midst of the state law litigation.

These allegations, if true, constitute \"material operative facts\" that arose\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the state court case, which, \"taken in conjunction with the antecedent facts, comprise a transaction which may be made the basis of a second action not precluded by the first.\" Rest. 2d Judg. \u00a7 24 cmt.

Defendants argue that this was not the nature of the agreement-they offer submissions to illustrate that the agreement pertained only to John's challenge of the provision in the state court litigation. This is a factual dispute that must be fleshed out with more evidence. In light of the allegations made at this stage in the proceedings, claim preclusion does not bar Count Four. Defendants argue that even if the 2014 Restriction does not apply to John, he is still held to the 1967 Restriction.
