At Step Four, relevant to Plaintiff's ability to ambulate, the ALJ mentioned Plaintiff's aptitude to take walks at the mall for exercise,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PageID 56, and his nonuse of an ambulatory device. PageID 59. He also made a few cursory references to Plaintiff's obesity. PageID 59, 60.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shilo\n   </em>\n   , 600 Fed.

The undersigned finds these Step Four findings not sufficiently conclusive and, consequently, a reasonable fact finder could have resolved the matter differently.\n   <em>\n    Kooser v.

Ohio Sept. 16, 2016) (finding \"this single consideration regarding Plaintiff's use of a cane should not end the inquiry because such example is not the only example of ineffective ambulation\"). Indeed, the record includes\n   evidence that appears supportive of the contrary conclusion,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiff was unable to ambulate effectively, especially when appropriately considering the extent of Plaintiff's obesity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Most significantly, the record includes evidence that he walked with a limp after his 2000 car accident, PageID 591; a 2012 x-ray image of the right knee showing post-operative changes, moderate osteoarthritis, and findings suggestive of lateral subluxation of the patellofemoral joint, PageID 582; a 2014 x-ray imaging of Plaintiff's right and left knee showing moderate to severe degenerative changes, PageID 631-32; and evidence of surgery in August 2015 to remove screws from his leg, which did not alleviate his pain and necessitated the use of an ambulatory device at that time, PageID 716-19. Plaintiff also has a BMI of 61.4, which is well over the cut-off of 40 for Level III Extreme Obesity and the gravity of which was highlighted by all of the physicians in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shilo\n   </em>\n   , 600 Fed. Appx. at 962 (finding a BMI of 53.7 to be \"disturbing\" in light of the cut-off for Level III obesity ). Julia Ann Boyd, M.D., Plaintiff's treating physician, noted that he was morbidly obese. PageID 508. Damian Danopulos, M.D, a state agency consulting physician, opined that \"Plaintiff's ability to do any work-related activities is affected and restricted from the combination of his unusual morbid obesity plus his right knee moderate arthritic changes and right upper leg arthralgias.\" PageID 576. The opinions of both state agency reviewing physicians also documented Plaintiff's \"severe obesity.\" PageID 128, 173.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the undersigned notes that in determining Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ relied on three state agency physicians, Maria Congbalay, M.D., Elaine Lewis, M.D., and Damian Danopulos, M.D., PageID 60, who formed opinions concerning Plaintiff's disability status without first conducting a full and complete review of the record.\n   <em>\n    Kelly ex rel. Hollowell v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884983\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/314/827/#p831\">\n    314 F. App'x 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (6th Cir. 2009) (finding remand necessary where new evidence renders previous opinions of reviewing physicians untenable). Dr. Danopulos examined Plaintiff in 2012; Dr. Lewis conducted her review in July 2014, PageID 139; and Dr. Congbalay reviewed Plaintiff's records in November 2014, PageID 175. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's medical record includes an April 2014 x-ray of his right knee that demonstrates \"advanced degenerative changes.\" PageID 631. The files reviewed by the state agency physicians in 2014, however, do not include this x-ray.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   PageID 124-26, 169-72. Consequently, none of the three state agency physicians had the benefit of reviewing the most severe of Plaintiff's objective medical records in conjunction with his severe obesity. This consideration provides additional reasoning that a reasonable fact finder, at the administrative hearing, could have concluded, based upon the most contemporary objective medical evidence, that Plaintiff was not able to ambulate effectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the ALJ's conclusion -- that Plaintiff did not meet or equal Listing \u00a7 1.02(A) -- is deemed unsupported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the ALJ's non-disability finding should be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   When the ALJ's non-disability determination is unsupported by substantial evidence, the Court must determine\n   whether to remand the matter for rehearing or to award benefits. Generally, benefits may be awarded immediately \"if all essential factual issues have been resolved and the record adequately establishes a plaintiff's entitlement to benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Faucher v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830367\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/171/#p176\">\n    17 F.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (6th Cir. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

The Court may only award benefits where proof of disability is strong and opposing evidence is lacking in substance, so that remand would merely involve the presentation of cumulative evidence, or where proof of disability is overwhelming.\n   <em>\n    Faucher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830367\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/171/#p176\">\n    17 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   176 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felisky v.
