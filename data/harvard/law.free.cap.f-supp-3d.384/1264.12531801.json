FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States Government owns an approximately 570-million-acre coal mineral estate. (Doc. 118 at 12.) The Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") administers federal coal leases on the Government's estate. (Doc. 118 at 12.) The BLM possess broad discretion to lease public land for coal mining. (Doc. 118 at 12.) The BLM remains constrained, however, by the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act (\"FLMPA\") and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (\"MLA\") (as amended by the Federal Coal Leasing Amendment Act). (Doc. 118 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BLM currently manages 306 active federal coal leases in ten states. (Doc. 118 at 13.) The BLM managed leases account for an estimated 7.4 billion tons of recoverable coal. (Doc. 118 at 13.) Over forty percent of the coal produced in the United States comes from federal land. AR-00004. Over eighty-five percent of coal production on federal land in the United States occurs in the Powder River Basin shared by Montana and Wyoming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   BLM possessed forty-four pending lease and lease-modification applications in February of 2017. (Doc. 118 at 14.) BLM last commenced a comprehensive environmental review for the federal coal program in 1979. (Doc. 118 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Doc. 118 at 16.) The Jewell Order directed BLM to prepare a programmatic environment impact statement (\"PEIS\") that addressed at a minimum the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) how, when, and where to lease coal; (b) fair return to the American public for federal coal; (c) the climate change impacts of the federal coal program, and how best to protect the public lands from climate change impacts; (d) the externalities related to federal coal production, including environmental and social impacts; (e) whether lease decision should consider whether the coal would be for export; and (f) the degree to which federal coal fulfills the energy needs of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. 118 at 17.) the Jewell Order imposed a moratorium on new coal leasing until completion of the PEIS.

(Doc. 118 at 20.) Secretary Zinke subsequently issued Secretarial Order 3348 (hereafter \"the Zinke Order\") on March 29, 2017. AR-00001-2 The Zinke Order determined that\n   \"the public interest is not served by halting the Federal coal program for an extended time[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Zinke Order further reasoned that Federal Defendant's consideration of potential improvements to the coal leasing program did not require a PEIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Zinke Order lifted the moratorium and directed BLM to \"process coal lease applications and modifications expeditiously in accordance with regulations and guidance existing before the issuance of\" the Jewell Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Jewell Order determined that over forty percent of coal production in the United States came from federal land. AR-00004. The Jewell Order provided a blanket moratorium on BLM administered coal development for the purpose of preparing a PEIS. AR-00003. The moratorium attempted to avoid the risk of \"locking in for decades the future development of large quantities of coal under current rates and terms that the PEIS may ultimately determine to be less than optimal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

In other words, the Zinke Order served to lift the environmental protections that the Jewell Order had provided during the pendency of the preparation of a new PEIS. The legal consequences that flow from the Zinke Order are evident. With the Zinke Order's implementation, all BLM land became subject to lease applications with terms of twenty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-00010. The Zinke Order directed new lease applications to be \"expedit[ed.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.
