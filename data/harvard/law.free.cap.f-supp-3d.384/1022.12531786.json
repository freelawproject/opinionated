For the reasons stated below, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This motion is the latest in a series of lawsuits arising out of defendant National Football League's (NFL) alleged \"return-to-play\" scheme in which former players were given painkillers indiscriminately in an effort to quickly return players back to the game and maximize profits, despite the players' lingering physical injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A prior order set forth in detail the well-pled background facts, assumed to be true for purposes of the present motion (Dkt. No. 106). In brief, the NFL is an unincorporated association of thirty-two separately-owned and independently-operated professional football \"clubs\" or teams across the country. Named plaintiffs are ten retired players who played for a number of those individual football teams at various points in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2014, plaintiffs filed the instant putative class action, alleging that they were supplied an endless stream of powerful pain medications, such as opioids, Toradol, local anesthetics, and combinations thereof, in order to return players back to the game as quickly as possible instead of allowing them to rest and heal properly from serious football-related injuries. The medications were distributed, plaintiffs alleged, without proper prescription, documentation, or disclosure of the medical risks and side effects, in violation of various laws. Plaintiffs then asserted nine claims against the NFL in their second amended complaint - including claims for negligent misrepresentation, negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , negligent hiring and retention, fraud, and fraudulent concealment (Dkt. No. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The essence of the then-operative second amended complaint was that the NFL had been negligent in not doing enough to police the alleged problem of the individual clubs abusing pain medications in order to quickly return their injured players to the field. But in order to evaluate the reasonableness of the NFL's conduct towards the players, it would have been necessary to consider the long history of provisions agreed to by the NFL in collective bargaining agreements (CBA) intended to protect the players. In turn, this consideration of the CBAs triggered the preemption rule within our circuit, as exemplified by\n   <em>\n    Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/683/#p689\">\n    255 F.3d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689-93 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc). Accordingly, in December 2014, the Court found that the theory of liability was barred as preempted by Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Dkt. No. 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2018, our court of appeals reversed and remanded, holding that plaintiffs' claims neither arose from the CBAs nor required their interpretation and were thus not preempted by Section 301. It so ruled based on plaintiffs' pitch to our court of appeals that the second amended complaint alleged a \"pyramidal conspiracy\" - specifically, by using the club doctors, \"the NFL control[led] and direct[ed] a pyramidal scheme for the distribution of controlled substances and prescription drugs in flagrant disregard of federal and state law\" (Dkt. No. 131-1 at 1-2). Plaintiffs argued that \"the duty at issue [was] to obey the law\" and that \"[o]nce the illegality exemption [to Section\n   301 preemption] [was] applied, the rest of the duties flow[ed] to obey the law. You then just follow the drugs\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 8). In other words, plaintiffs argued that they alleged that the NFL\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   supplied and distributed the endless stream of drugs, thereby violating the relevant federal and state statutes governing controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our court of appeals agreed with plaintiffs' reading of the second amended complaint, as demonstrated by the following exchange during oral argument between the appellate court and counsel for the NFL (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (emphasis added)):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Counsel, what do we do with the allegation in the complaint that the NFL directly gave drugs to athletes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think what you do is you read it in the context of the entire complaint, so with respect to every one of the ten plaintiffs, the specific allegations are that they were given injections by the team doctors, the doctors ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: I'm looking at paragraph 17 of the complaint. This is the second amended complaint, the NFL directly?\n   <em>\n    I'm going to put some ellipses in here. The NFL directly supplied players with opioids.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This reading of the complaint drove our court of appeals' analysis. It construed the second amended complaint as \"not merely alleging that the NFL failed to prevent medication abuse by the teams, but that the NFL\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   illegally distributed controlled substances, and therefore its actions directly injured players.\"\n   <em>\n    Dent v.

Specifically, they argue that but for the supposed \"Business Plan,\" \"\n   <em>\n    Club doctors and trainers would not have violated drug laws and regulations\n   </em>\n   regarding controlled substances and prescription drugs\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   By their own admission then, plaintiffs do not allege that the NFL\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   violated the relevant drug laws and regulations governing the medications at issue - that violation is specifically attributed to the club doctors and trainers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs attempt to hand wave this deficiency as a\n   mere technicality, asserting that \"it matters not who actually put a pill in a player's hand, but rather, how it came to be that, despite a comprehensive and thorough regulatory scheme designed to prevent the abuses at issue, those abuses nonetheless occurred\" (\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ). They try to shore up a direct liability claim by pointing to various allegations within the third amended complaint to argue that the NFL is \"controlling all of this\" (Dkt. No. 134 at 44:10-11; Opp. 3-4). For example, plaintiffs allege that the NFL \"compiled weekly injury reports and required reports from teams on the volume of drugs they [the clubs] were distributing to their players\"; it \"mandated that the Clubs have locked drug storage areas at their facilities\"; it \"approved Club financial arrangements with doctors and medical groups\"; it \"established committees to discuss and oversee the distribution of Medications\"; it \"conduct[ed] on-site inspections of the Clubs' facilities to ostensibly determine compliance with the laws identified in\" the third amended complaint; and it \"sponsored League-wide studies on the effects of certain Medications\" (Opp. 2-3; Third Amd. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 159, 163-72, 178-80, 188-96). Plaintiffs thus contend that the NFL was involved in \"every aspect\" of the players' medical care - except for the actual distribution of the controlled substances (Dkt. No. 134 at 44:14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the NFL points out, however, this distinction is dispositive. Significantly, plaintiffs do not make any specific, plausible allegation that the relevant statutes apply to the NFL, let alone that the NFL violated those statutes. Despite ninety pages of allegations (largely directed to the clubs' conduct), nowhere in the third amended complaint do plaintiffs allege, as they previously pitched before our court of appeals, that the NFL undertook to provide direct medical care and treatment to players such that its conduct violated any relevant drug laws. Though plaintiffs generally contend that the NFL controlled and directed the distribution of the players' medication via the \"Business Plan,\" nowhere in the third amended complaint do plaintiffs specifically allege any facts as to how the NFL instructed the club doctors' handling, distribution, and administration of the drugs or otherwise forced the club doctors to violate any relevant drug laws. (In fact, the conduct by the NFL that plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   specifically allege largely relate to its efforts to help the clubs\n   <em>\n    comply\n   </em>\n   with those statutes (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Third Amd. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 159-82)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Our court of appeals previously found that the NFL owed a duty (and the claims were not preempted) where plaintiffs alleged that the NFL was directly \"involved in the distribution of controlled substances\" based on \"the general character of [that] activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518404\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1109/#p1118\">\n    902 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotations omitted) (alterations in original). It further explained that plaintiffs' negligence claim \"will require the players to\n   <em>\n    establish that the relevant statutes apply to the NFL, the NFL violated those statutes\n   </em>\n   , and the alleged violations caused the players' injuries\" and that it \"le[ft] it to the district court to determine whether the plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to support their negligence claim against the NFL.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518404\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1109/#p1118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518404\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1109/#p1118\">\n    at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis\n   added). Plaintiffs now acknowledge in their third amended complaint and briefing that the NFL did not itself provide medical care for or distribute medications to the players, and the operative complaint contains only conclusory allegations related to conduct by the NFL that would give rise to a duty of care. This order therefore finds that plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts that, if proved, would support their negligence claim against the NFL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Instead, plaintiffs ultimately accuse the NFL of doing nothing despite awareness of the alleged conduct by club doctors and trainers (Third Amd. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-71). For example, the first sentence of the section titled \"Despite the Foregoing, the League Did Nothing\" states as follows: \"One of the most striking aspects of the audit program described above is that, despite the thousands of pages of documented\n   <em>\n    illegal violations engaged in by all the clubs\n   </em>\n   , there [was] no follow up from the League\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 213 (emphasis added)). But the NFL's alleged failure to act echoes the exact theory already found preempted by Section 301 - namely, that the NFL failed to intervene in the\n   <em>\n    club's\n   </em>\n   implementation of the supposed \"Business Plan\" (a ruling which our court of appeals left undisturbed). As the Court previously held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   To determine what the scope of this supervisory duty was, and whether the NFL breached it, the Court would need to determine ... what the NFL, through the CBAs, required of the individual clubs and club physicians. The NFL's overarching duty would then depend on the extent to which the various CBAs required the clubs to protect the players' medical interests. It would thus be impossible for the Court to analyze whether the NFL acted negligently, and whether the NFL's conduct caused the players' injuries, without consulting the specific CBA provisions that cover the individual clubs' duties to the players.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Dkt. No. 106 at 13-14). This was effectively confirmed when the Court asked plaintiffs' counsel directly for an instance when the NFL violated a relevant statute during oral argument (Dkt. No. 134 at 48:16-49:11):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: Give me what you would say is your best example of an NFL employee violating the Controlled Substances Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   MR. CLOSIUS: When they are telling people to distribute it illegally. Your Honor, the -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE COURT: Where is that -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   MR. CLOSIUS: Let me rephrase that. The Third Amended Complaint is replete with people telling the NFL that what's happening is illegal. The DEA is doing it. The Matava report is doing it. They are being told all through about illegal dispensation of controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE COURT: By who? By the Clubs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   MR. CLOSIUS: By the Clubs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. That's not the same though. Let's say that the - let's say the - somebody is telling the NFL, Hey, the Clubs are violating the Controlled Substances Act. That's not the same as the NFL itself violating anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   MR. CLOSIUS: Well, they never did anything to remedy it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE COURT: Well, that's the original theory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Counsel then tried to pivot by next arguing that an NFL associate stated that the NFL had \"joint culpability on this\" issue (Dkt. No. 134 at 49:12-50:12; Third. Amd. Compl. \u00b6 11). This general \"admission\" of joint culpability, however, could easily refer to some general moral sense of culpability, not necessarily a legal culpability under the CSA or other relevant drug law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   And, mere allegations that the NFL paid for surveys and reports and did nothing despite being told of the illegal distribution of medications by the clubs do not raise the reasonable inference that the NFL\n   <em>\n    mandated\n   </em>\n   their illegal distribution such that the NFL itself is culpable under the relevant statutes. The NFL's alleged pressure on the clubs to return players to play as soon as possible does not sufficiently support plaintiffs' allegation that the NFL was directly involved in the clubs' distribution of the medications such that it owed a duty to plaintiffs or violated any relevant statutes. To repeat, plaintiffs escaped preemption before our court of appeals by asserting the NFL's\n   <em>\n    proactive\n   </em>\n   involvement with medication distribution. Having convinced our court of appeals that they were alleging that the NFL itself directly provided medical care and supplied drugs to players, plaintiffs may not bob and weave back to old theories of negligence that, in essence, amount to the NFL's failure to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs complain that the NFL focuses only on our court of appeals' use of the word \"distribute\" as literally defined in the CSA. They suggest that because our court of appeals used the word \"handle\" elsewhere in\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   (a word that plaintiffs assert is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   used in either the CSA or FDCA), the appellate court's choice of words \"may not have been that precise\" because it \"us[ed] all kinds of phrases\" (Dkt. No. 134 at 46:15-25). As such, plaintiffs aim for a broader interpretation of liability allowed under\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   to include the NFL's alleged activities beyond those governed by the relevant drug statutes, such as recordkeeping and storage. Not so. Though\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   arguably leaves room to find the NFL liable even if it is not physically handing out drugs to players itself, the clear import of\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   centers on the NFL's alleged provision of medical care to the players and\n   <em>\n    direct distribution\n   </em>\n   (at least, under the NFL's specific direction) of the medications\n   <em>\n    in violation of the relevant statutes.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To repeat, as our court of appeals understood the second amended complaint, plaintiffs were \"not merely alleging that the NFL failed to prevent medication abuse by the teams, but that\n   <em>\n    the NFL itself\n   </em>\n   illegally distributed controlled substances, and therefore its actions directly injured players.\"\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518404\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1109/#p1118\">\n    902 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

This order thus need not consider this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, plaintiffs fail to sufficiently persuade that the relationship between the former players - who were compensated adult professional athletes with collectively bargained rights over their medical care - and the NFL is analogous to that of the relationship between students and their colleges. Plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Regents of University of California\n   </em>\n   , is therefore unavailing. There, the California Supreme Court held that colleges \"have a special relationship with students while they are engaged in activities that are part of the school's curriculum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 624-25. In so holding, it considered \"the unique features of the college environment,\" such as the provision of \"social, athletic, and cultural opportunities\" to students who are still \"learning how to navigate the world as adults\" and are \"dependent on their college communities to provide structure, guidance, and a safe learning environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, colleges \"have superior control over the environment and the ability to protect students,\" as \"[t]hrough [their] providing of food, housing, security, and a range of extracurricular activities\" and their administrators and educators \"hav[ing] the power to influence students' values, their consciousness, their relationships, and their behaviors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 625 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Furek v.

That being said, plaintiffs failed to adequately plead their sole negligence claim and thus for the foregoing reasons, the NFL's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

But the plaintiffs are pursuing a theory of direct liability, not vicarious liability. And they have attempted to vindicate virtually identical claims against the clubs themselves in separate litigation. Therefore, on remand, any further proceedings in this case should be limited to claims arising from the conduct of the NFL and NFL personnel - not the conduct of individual teams' employees.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The totality of the allegations renders this conclusory label implausible. That is, even taking all allegations as true, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the doctors and trainers directly distributing the drugs allegedly in violation of the relevant statutes were NFL personnel. For example, plaintiffs allege that the NFL \"has distributed these controlled substances and prescription medications with little to no regard for the law or the players' health\" and label the relevant actors \"NFL doctors and trainers\" (Third Amd. Compl. \u00b6 7). To support this contention they allege in the very next sentence that \"\n    <em>\n     Raiders owner Al Davis\n    </em>\n    routinely pressured players and doctors to do anything to get a player back on the field, regardless of the risks\" and that \"as the position of\n    <em>\n     Club\n    </em>\n    doctor and trainer have become increasingly lucrative, the pressures on the medical personnel to return players to the field have only increased\" (\n    <em>\n     ibid.\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added)). But these factual allegations refer to an\n    <em>\n     individual team's\n    </em>\n    actions,\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    the NFL's. The third amended complaint is replete with numerous other factual allegations similarly undercutting plaintiffs' conclusory allegations of the NFL's direct distribution of the medications (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 21, 30, 39, 47, 58, 67, 77, 86, 96). Nor can plaintiffs' reliance during oral argument on Dr. Pellman's alleged dual role as New York Jets' doctor and NFL medical advisor give rise to this inference, as his alleged violations of the relevant laws and regulations were made in his \"capacity as a\n    <em>\n     team\n    </em>\n    doctor\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 216 (emphasis added)).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The conflation is made all the more evident by plaintiffs' contention that the \"relationship [between the NFL and the clubs] is complicated and, without discovery, it will not be entirely clear ... what exactly that relationship is, and concomitantly, what that may mean for this case\" and their musing that \"although the NFL and the clubs are independent legal entities, there is more to the puzzle\" (Opp. 4). At bottom, the fact remains that the NFL and the clubs, while closely related,\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    separate entities, and plaintiffs' plain assertion that the NFL is the clubs' \"super-employer\" is insufficient to conjure up a direct (rather than a vicarious) liability claim (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. 5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Because this order finds that plaintiffs failed to adequately plead a negligence claim, it need not and does not reach the NFL's statute of limitations argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
