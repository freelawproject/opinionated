COOPER, United States District Judge\n   The United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") allows customers to design and print customized postage stamps. We've all seen them: personalized postage for a wedding invitation featuring a photograph of the happy couple, a birth announcement featuring an image of the newborn, or an upcoming sale featuring the company's logo. Artist Anatol Zukerman wanted to create his own personalized postage to promote an upcoming gallery exhibition and submitted a proposed design to a third-party vendor that printed customized postage on USPS's behalf. The vendor rejected Zukerman's design as too \"partisan or political\" under USPS's then-extant guidelines: aimed at critiquing the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   decision, the design cautioned that \"Democracy is not for sale\" and featured the image of a snake-marked with the words \"Citizens United\" and shaped like a dollar sign-strangling Uncle Sam. Zukerman and the gallery sued, alleging that USPS, through the vendor, had violated the First Amendment. The Court denied a previous motion to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction, and the parties proceeded to discovery. In the meantime, though, USPS promulgated new regulations to govern the customized postage program, redefining and narrowing somewhat the type of content that is permitted. Again, Zukerman submitted proposed designs to a vendor; again, those designs-substantially similar to the previous one-were rejected; and again, Zukerman and the gallery sued, supplementing their original claims with a facial First Amendment challenge to the new regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   USPS has moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' suit. It says that Plaintiffs' original claims are moot because they are based on guidelines that have been superseded by the operative regulations. And it contends that Plaintiffs' supplemental claims challenging those regulations fail to state a claim because the customized postage program is a nonpublic forum and its governing regulations need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, which they are. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' original claims are moot and must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). The Court further concludes that Plaintiffs' supplemental claims fail to state a claim and must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Guidelines attached to the 2009 agreement of one such vendor, Zazzle, Inc., directed the vendor not to accept, among other categories, \"[c]ontent or images actively advocating or disparaging the religious, political, or legal agenda of any person or entity, including but not limited to content or images designed to influence a specific piece of legislation\" or \"[p]artisan or political content or images, including but not limited to content or images supporting or opposing election of any candidate(s) to any federal/state/local governmental office or supporting or opposing any referendum conducted by federal/state/local government.\" Standardized Image Guidelines, Exhibit A to Customized Postage Amended and Restated Authorization between USPS and Zazzle, Inc.

Reg. 60,117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01, 60,117-18 (Dec. 19, 2017). The final rule emphasized that although customized postage is a specialized form of evidence of prepayment of postage, there is a possibility that consumers will believe that the images originated with the Postal Service. Accordingly, USPS concluded that it \"must limit eligible private content to protect its own business and brand interests against dilution, false attribution, appearances of endorsement, and other potential impacts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060%2C117\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060%2C117\">\n    at 60,117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The new Regulations thus limit the type of content allowed on customized postage to just two categories: \"commercial\" and \"social\" content.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20501.21\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   They also require that images be suitable for all ages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20501.21\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 501.21(b)(2). Finally, the Regulations \"exclud[e] entire categories of content,\" 82 Fed.

Thus, under the Regulations, which went into effect in May 2018, the \"default presumption\" is that images are\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   eligible for printing. 82 Fed.

To promote an exhibition titled \"Truth to Power: Anatol Zukerman's 'Responsible' Art,\" planned for February 2016, the gallery suggested that Zukerman create a custom postage design using the drawing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.

Their First Amended Complaint alleges that USPS, through Zazzle, engaged in content and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment because Zazzle printed postage promoting the campaigns of several 2016 presidential candidates while declining to produce Zukerman's proposed\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   design.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 33, 44.

Suppl. Compl., ECF No. 52, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 8. But in addition to the image of the dollar-sign snake strangling Uncle Sam, the design features the text \"Democracy is Not for Sale, But This Artwork Is!\"-presumably included to situate the design within USPS's allowance for commercial content-and the name \"Charles Krause Reporting Fine Art.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.

Although the Regulations and the Guidelines are not as starkly different as the government would have the Court believe, the Court can discern key distinctions between the two regimes. The Regulations' prohibition of everything but commercial and social content is logically more restrictive than the Guidelines' exclusion of content that \"actively advocat[es] or disparag[es] the [ ] political [ ] agenda of any person or entity\" or \"[p]artisan or political content\" that \"support[s] or oppos[es] election of any candidate\" or \"referendum.\" Standardized Image Guidelines at 9. In other words, under the current program,\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   political content is permitted, regardless of whether that content is neutral or takes a stance on a particular issue; under the prior program, at least some political content would have been permitted provided it was non-partisan and did not advance a particular \"agenda.\" Hypothetically, the Court can envision certain calls for political or civic participation-e.g., \"Register to Vote\" or \"Think Global, Act Local\"-that would not be permitted\n   under the Regulations because they are neither commercial nor social, but could have been under the Guidelines because they are both general and non-partisan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The daylight between the two programs is in part a product of their default presumptions. The Regulations start from a \"default presumption\" of \"ineligibility\" and then carve out two narrow categories of permissible content: \"commercial\" and \"social.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 60,118 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20501.21\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). All other content, including \"political\" content (no matter how incidental or neutral), is categorically excluded.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20501.21\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). The Guidelines, by contrast, started from a presumption of eligibility and then enumerated categories of prohibited content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Relatedly, the Regulations represent a more objective, blanket ban while the Guidelines allowed for considerable subjective line-drawing. The Regulations simply ban all political content without exception; the Guidelines, by contrast, appear to have allowed for\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   political content so long as it was neutral. In addition, the Regulations do not allow vendors to impose additional eligibility criteria, while vendors under the Guidelines could, as demonstrated by Zazzle's interpretive gloss barring \"primarily partisan or political\" designs or designs advocating for or against a political agenda \"in a way that may appear controversial to others.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23. Figuring out whether a particular design is primarily partisan, would be controversial to others, or advocates for or against specific legislation demands a level of subjectivity not required by the Regulations. Therefore, the Court concludes that although there is some overlap between the Regulations and the Guidelines, USPS did not simply \"repeal[ ] the challenged [program] and replac[e] it with one that differs only in some insignificant respect.\"\n   <em>\n    AFDI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518336\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/356/#p362\">\n    901 F.3d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ne.

Under the Regulations, \"[c]ommercial means intended for no purpose other than the sale of goods or services in commerce.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20501.21\">\n     39 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(i). \"Social means promoting or depicting people, animals, items, or events commonly associated with community relations or companionship and likely to generate invitations, announcements, notices, thank-you notes, RSVPs, or similar correspondence.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20501.21\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 501.21(b)(1)(ii).

In other words, Plaintiffs rely on a false equivalence between the \"political\" in\n    <em>\n     Mansky\n    </em>\n    and the \"political\" in the Regulations: in\n    <em>\n     Mansky\n    </em>\n    , the fulcrum of what is acceptable (whether apparel was \"political\") was not defined while here, the fulcrum (whether a design is \"commercial\" or \"social\") is. Thus, far from being \"unmoored,\" what can come in under the customized postage program is in fact anchored by both the definitions of the inclusions and the list of exclusions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    There is another key difference between the political-speech ban in\n    <em>\n     Mansky\n    </em>\n    and the restrictions before this Court. In\n    <em>\n     Mansky\n    </em>\n    , although the state law broadly banned all \"political\" apparel, it was \"the unmoored use of the term 'political' ...\n    <em>\n     combined with\n    </em>\n    [the state's] haphazard interpretations\" of the term in guidance and briefing that led to the law's demise.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n     138 S. Ct. at 1888\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Minnesota's \"Election Day Policy\"-the state's authoritative guidance on the political-apparel ban-was internally inconsistent and so broad as to invite \"erratic application\" by election judges attempting to enforce the ban.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n     at 1888-90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And in briefing, Minnesota separately argued that the broad term \"political\" should be interpreted to proscribe \"only words and symbols that an objectively reasonable observer would perceive as conveying a message about the electoral choices at issue in [the] polling place\"-a standard even Minnesota's counsel struggled to apply during oral argument.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n     at 1888-89, 1891\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (alteration in original). It was this effort to clarify and qualify the broad term \"political\" that led to the \"confusing line-drawing problems\" that undermined the ban.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/#p1885\">\n     at 1889\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that here, it is the\n    <em>\n     absence\n    </em>\n    of \"operational guidance\" that will lead to \"impossible line-drawing problems\" because vendors like Stamps.com will be forced to decide on their own \"whether an image is too 'political.' \" Opp'n at 23. They round off a litany of examples of borderline, potentially political customized postage designs that would otherwise fall into the permitted \"commercial\" or \"social\" categories.

Under the Regulations, the question is not whether a design is\n    <em>\n     too\n    </em>\n    political; it is whether it is political at all, and thus barred, or whether it is instead \"expressly allowed\" as a commercial or social image. 82 Fed.

There will undoubtedly be some borderline cases, but this simplicity contributes to the program's administrability: the Regulations establish an intentionally broad, categorical exclusion from which USPS, unlike Minnesota in\n    <em>\n     Mansky\n    </em>\n    , does not retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The First Amendment allows the government to exclude entire categories of content from a nonpublic forum.

Plaintiffs do not argue that the Regulations are inconsistent with the Postal Service's interest in avoiding misattribution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    USPS next says that its \"restriction on political content [also] reasonably serves USPS's 'particularly weighty' governmental interest in avoiding political entanglement, 'given the history of the Postal Service and its problematic historical associations with partisan politics.' \" MTD at 34 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Del Gallo v.

Plaintiffs do not contest that USPS has a legitimate interest in avoiding at least\n    <em>\n     partisan\n    </em>\n    entanglement but assert that it does not have a similar interest in avoiding entanglement with political issues more generally because the Postal Service's problematic history is associated only with partisan politics and electioneering. Opp'n at 29. But this is another tailoring argument and, as explained above, there is no requirement that a rule restricting access to a nonpublic forum be narrowly tailored.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hodge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340712,12173311\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1145/\">\n     799 F.3d at 1167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (explaining that Congress was \"under no obligation\" to limit regulations on assembly in Supreme Court plaza \"so as to encompass only those forms of expressive activity ... that most acutely implicate the government's concerns\" and instead \"could paint with a broader brush\"). Thus, again, USPS is entitled to actively regulate private speech in a nonpublic forum so long as its means are consistent with its purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Finally, restrictions in nonpublic fora are more likely to be considered reasonable where alternative channels of communication remain open.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p44\">\n     460 U.S. at 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p44\">\n     103 S.Ct. 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The reasonableness of limitations on [the defendant's] access to the school mail system is also supported by the substantial alternative channels that remain open for union-teacher communication.\"). As USPS points out, Plaintiffs could instead print postcards or envelopes with the proposed design that\n    would not pose the same risks of misattribution and entanglement. MTD at 35. Plaintiffs do not dispute that they \"had alternative means to engage in speech,\" Opp'n at 30, and counter only that the Regulations are otherwise unreasonable because they are indeterminate and unrelated to USPS's invoked interests. As explained above, the Court disagrees with Plaintiffs on these grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In all, the Court concludes that the 2018 Regulations satisfy the requirements for restrictions on private speech in nonpublic fora. Unlike the political-apparel ban in\n    <em>\n     Mansky\n    </em>\n    , the Regulations are not fatally indeterminate; rather, as a categorical ban on political speech, they provide sufficiently clear guidance on what can come in and what must stay out. The Regulations are also consistent with USPS's legitimate interests in avoiding political entanglement and potential misattribution of postage designs that could harm USPS's business interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss the claims originally set forth in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint as moot and the supplemental claims set forth in Plaintiffs' Supplemental Complaint for failure to state a claim. The Court will also deny as moot Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. An Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-96\">\n     The D.C.
