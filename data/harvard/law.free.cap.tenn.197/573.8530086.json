The children obtain a \u00a3iride\u201d on these devices by placing a coin (a dime) therein. The owners of the retail establishment in which these devices are placed receive a percentage of the proceeds derived from the operation of the devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">The question arises as to whether the operation of devices known as \u201ckiddy-rides\u201d, comes within Item 49, subsection (e), Code Supplement Section 1248.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Section 1248.2 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cAll devices operated by persons as a source of profit, such as devices wherein may be seen pictures, or devices for throwing at wooden figures or any other object, throwing rings or any other device, striking an object to test the strength, and blowing to test the lungs, each per annum .... $20.00. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The above quoted is a part of the General Revenue Act of Tennessee, and is included under the general title \u2018 \u2018 Occupations Which Are Privileges and Taxes Thereon. \u2019 \u2019 Item 49 of the Revenue Act is entitled \u201cGames\u201d, and it is insisted by complainant that \u201ckiddy-rides\u201d which are sought to be made the subject of taxation here, involve no contest or trial of skill, or chance, and are therefore not included in the taxing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">It is insisted by defendants, that among the several definitions included in Webster\u2019s New International Unabridged Dictionary is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201c \u2018 1. Sport of any kind; play, frolic, or fun; as boisterous game; joke or jest; as, to make game of one. 2. An amusement or diversion; as, make believe as a children\u2019s game. 3. A scheme or art employed in the pursuit of an object or purpose; method of procedure; project line of operations; plan; project; course. 4. A contest, physical or mental, conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>according to set rules, and undertaken for amusement or recreation, or for winning a stake. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Tlie language of Item 49(c), \u201cAll devices operated by persons as a source of profit, sucb as devices wherein may be seen pictures * * indicates tbat it was not tbe intention of tbe Legislature to confine tbe tax imposed to games of cbanee or contest of skill, and we are persuaded tbat it was tbe legislative intent to include sucb devices as tbe one involved herein, and tbat tbe taxing authorities were justified in making tbe levy questioned by tbe bill' of complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Under Item 49(b), miniature football, golf, baseball, pinball machines and all other miniature games are taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\"We think tbe devices in tbe present case being-operated as a source of profit sucb as devices wherein may be seen pictures, or devices for throwing at wooden figures or any other object, striking an object to test tbe strength, and blowing to test tbe lungs, are taxable under Item 49(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">An examination of Item 49 of tbe General Revenue Act reveals tbat it is comprehensively directed at tbe operation of all commercial amusement devices. The legislature was evidently intending to tax tbe privilege of operating contrivances usually found at fairs, carnivals, amusement parks, penny arcades, recreation parlors, etc., but sometimes located elsewhere. Nothing in tbe statute purports to restrict tbe application of tbe tax to sucb contrivances as may be located in tbe above mentioned places.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">While many different forms of amusement devices are thus referred to specifically, in tbe statute, it is to be noted tbat in each of the first three subsections of Item 49, it is made clear tbat tbe tax is not to be confined to tbe specifically named amusements, but that each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>named ones is set forth, merely for the purpose of illustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">The Legislature no doubt realized that complete listing of all known devices would be impracticable, and that other devices would be contrived subsequent to the enactment of the taxing item. So they added following the illustrative listing in Item 49(a) the words \u201cand all similar devices\u201d; and in Item 49(b) the words \u201cand all other miniature games.\u201d And in Item 49(c), they laid the tax on \u201call devices operated by persons as a source of profit. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The word \u201cgame\u201d is not a technical word, but one of ordinary everyday usage, hence is to be-given its ordinary meaning. <em>Hedges </em>v. <em>Shipp, </em>166 Tenn. 451, 62 S. W. (2d) 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Complainants insist that the device here has no element of a contest. However, amusement may be had from any or all of the games listed whether they have the element of contest or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Biding a \u201cbucking horse\u201d or a \u201crocket ship\u201d is no contest for the child; but it is an amusement or diversion, or sport, play, frolic or fun, any of which will serve to bring it within the definition of the word \u2018 \u2018 game \u2019 \u2019 as hereinbefore defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In construing the statute we are especially impressed with the words, \u201call devices operated by persons as a source of profit, \u2019 \u2019 in reaching the conclusion that the item herein involved was to be taxed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">All assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the Chancellor is affirmed with costs;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
