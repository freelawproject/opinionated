Chibe Justice Neil</author>\n<p id=\"Ant\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">This is a workmen\u2019s compensation case in which the only question for the Court\u2019s consideration is as to the extent of the injury suffered by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The case had its origin in the Chancery Court, Armstrong Construction Company filing its original bill alleging that the defendant, Sams, had suffered an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment; that it paid him compensation for a period of six (6) weeks, at the expiration of which time Sams was able to return to work, and that he had failed to return to his job. It is further alleged that defendant takes the position that he is unable to return to work and is entitled to further compensation ; that this creates a dispute requiring adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction under Tennessee Code 6885.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The defendant filed an answer and cross-bill, in which he alleged the nature and extent of his injury to his back and spine. The cross action claims that he has suffered an injury that is total and permanent and that he should be paid compensation accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">We will refer to the parties as if Joe Sams, the employee, had sued the Armstrong Construction Company in a court of law, Sams as plaintiff and his employer as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The plaintiff, 'Sams, was a day laborer for the defendant and when injured was lifting some broken pieces of concrete which weighed approximately one hundred (100) pounds. He felt a sharp jerk in his back, causing pain to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>run from Ms back down to Ms liips and legs, and tbat \u201clie conld not bend, nor could he hardly walk.\u201d Contention is further made that his back and legs were injured and he was advised that he suffered a ruptured disc. He earned $1.20 an hour, or approximately $48.00 a week. The defendant has made the contention from the beginning, and now insists that the plaintiff has not suffered any total and permanent injury. The Chancellor found the issues in favor of the plaintiff, and made an award of $25 a week for three hundred (300) weeks. From this decree the Armstrong Construction Company has appealed and assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">The first three assignments involve purely issues of fact; \u201cthat there is no evidence to support the judgment\u201d. (4) It was error for the court to ask the plaintiff, over objection, \u201cAre you totally and permanently disabled?\u201d This amounted to having the plaintiff decide the law suit himself. (5) It was error for the court to permit Dr. John Munal to give a history of the case since Dr. Munal admittedly was not the family physician of Sams. (6) It was error for the court to permit Mrs. Sams and Mrs. Ollie Johnson to testify as to Sams\u2019 condition, their testimony being \u201chearsay and self-serving\u201d and because the rule had been called for. Mrs. Johnson testified that \u201cMr. Sams could not sit up in bed\u201d; while Mrs. Sams stated that her husband said, \u201cIt hurt right back there.\u201d (7) It was error to permit Charles Hunley to testify, the rule being called for; also it was not proper for him to testify as a character witness. (8) It was error for the court to advise Dr. Keener not to answer the following question by defendant\u2019s counsel, \u201cDr. Keener, haven\u2019t you told me on more than one occasion you always gave the man considerably more disability than you thought he had so that you would make sure he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>got enough.f\u201d (9) \u201cIt was error for the Court to conclude, and -unreasonably so, that Sams was totally and permanently disabled, upon the testimony of two ordinary practitioners and the statement of Sams\u2019 family, the latter of which could only be self-serving\u2019, ag-ainst the testimony of one ordinary practitioner and an orthopedic <em>surgeon </em>\u2014 the <em>only man really qualified to malte a diagnosis in the case.\u201d </em>(Italics ours). (10) It was error for the court to approve a decree for three hundred (300) weeks, less the six (6) weeks prior payments of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">All of the errors assigned, severally and collectively, make the single contention that it was error for the Chancellor to find that Sams was totally and permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em> </em>There is no merit in Assignment (4). While the answer called for a conclusion, there is nothing in the record to show that it was a controlling factor in the court\u2019s decision. Assignment (5) complaining that Dr. Munal\u2019s recitation of the plaintiff\u2019s case history was incompetent has no merit. There is no prejudice to the defendant resulting from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Assignment (6) complaining of certain specific statements of Mrs. Sams and Mrs. Johnson as being \u201chearsay and self-serving\u201d is highly technical and argumentative. The quoted statement of Mrs. Sams, standing alone, doesn\u2019t mean anything, while that of Mrs. Johnson that Sams \u201ccould not sit up in bed\u201d is only part of her statement as to what she saw generally. Sams lived in the same house with Mrs. Johnson. She assisted in giving medicines, \u201cand everything I think would ease him when he complained of his back.\u201d The opinion of the witness was technically inadmissible, but it was a harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Contention is made in Assignment (7) that Hun-ley, and possibly one other witness, were permitted to testify as character witnesses when the rnle had been called for. The assignment is overruled. There is no prejudice shown, and it was a matter entirely within the Chancellor\u2019s discretion. It was not improper for them to testify as to Sams \u2019 character for truth, since defendant had suggested that he was a malingerer and was otherwise exaggerating his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">There is no merit in Assignment (8). The question itself was not in proper form as laying a ground for impeaching the witness, in that no time or place was stated as to when the statement is said to have been made. Moreover the record shows that counsel for the defendant admitted later that Dr. Keener\u2019s reputation was good. The Chancellor also stated, \u201cHe has done an excellent job, and the court has been impressed with his honesty and medical knowledge. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Assignment (9) makes the contention that the court erroneously decided the determinative issue upon the testimony of Sams and his family \u201cwhich could only be self-serving\u201d and two medical experts \u201cwho were not qualified to make a diagnosis of the case\u201d. The sole contention of the defendant\u2019s counsel is that only Dr. Shobe, who testified for the defendant and admittedly was an experienced orthopedic surgeon, was qualified to testify as to the cause of Sams\u2019 disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Counsel refer the Court to a number of our decisions dealing with the question of a medical expert\u2019s opinion and its value as determining the cause of an injury as well as its extent, such as <em>Cumberland Tel. </em>&amp; <em>Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Teacher Mill Co., </em>129 Tenn. 374, 164 S. W. 1145, L. R. A. 1915A, 1045; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Blue Ridge Glass Corp., </em>161 Tenn. 535, 33 S. W. 2d 84; and <em>Lee v. Aluminum Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>184 Tenn. 287, 198 S. W. 2d 639. In these cases the Court follows the general rule that where the cause of an injury is in dispute an expert\u2019s opinion may be admitted that the effect of a certain cause could or might produce the condition, but is not permitted to testify as to what in his opinion was the real and producing cause \u2014 .as this would invade the province of the jury. We think the courts have given medical experts a good deal of latitude in expressing their opinion as to causes of injuries. Such experts, men of great learning, are an invaluable aid to the court in an effort to arrive at the truth in any given case. But in no case have we gone ,so far as to hold that an expert\u2019s opinion is determinative of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The counsel for defendant makes the extravagant statement, to which we cannot assent, that Sams\u2019 testimony and that of his family should he ignored because it is \u201cself-serving\u201d. If this is sound as a matter of law then no injured employee, or any of his family, should be permitted to testify at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Adverting to the issue as to the qualification of a medical man to give expert testimony, there is no doubt as to the qualifications of Dr. Shobe and Dr. Tipton, witnesses for the defendant. Dr. Shobe was very positive that the plaintiff had not suffered a total and permanent injury. Dr. Tipton testified substantially to the same effect. Dr. Munal and Dr. Keener testified to the contrary. There was no objection at any time to their competency to testify as medical experts. Dr. Munal had practiced his profession in Kingsport for twenty-two (22) years. He made more than one examination of plaintiff Sams. He expressed the opinion, without objection, that the plaintiff had a \u201cruptured disc (vertebra) on the right side of the lumbar area. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cQ. Doctor, is this man now able to work? A. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-3\">\u201cQ. Well, will he ever be able to work? Is this disability permanent? A. This disability is usually permanent, and it stays permanent until that pressure from the disc is removed from that nerve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cQ. Is that, Doctor, a major operation? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3S\">\u201cQ. Is it a dangerous operation? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\">The second medical witness for the defendant was Dr. Gr. Gr. Keener. He had practiced medicine in Kingsport, Tennessee for forty-four (44) years, after his graduation from the University of Tennessee Medical School. He testified without any objection to his qualifications as an expert. When asked as to his diagnosis said: \u201cWell, his back was sore and tender on pressure, and my diagnosis is that he is suffering from a ruptured disc on the right side of the lumbar area.\u201d \u201cP.ain was running down his leg.\u201d \u201cThe reflexes was absent in his right leg*.\u201d \u201cHe is not able to do any type of labor or construction work.\u201d On cross-examination he thought he could do \u201clight work\u201d, but did not explain what he meant by \u201clight work\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Chancellor\u2019s opinion, which appears in the record at page 20 discusses the testimony of <em>all witnesses. </em>He concludes with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cThe Court finds from'all of the evidence that it is true that the cross-complainant was injured while working in the course of his employment, and that said injury is permanent, and that according to the clear preponderance of the evidence, that the cross-complainant is suffering with great pain, and that he is not .able in his present condition to perform any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>kind of work. From tke record as a whole, the Court concludes that the cross-complainant, Joe Sams, is now totally and permanently disabled and is entitled to a judgment for a total and permanent disability as set out in Section 6878 of the Code of Tennessee,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-3\">We think the testimony of lay witnesses and medical experts fully supports the opinion and decree of the Chancellor. The assignments of error are accordingly overruled and the decree is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Chancery Court for enforcement of the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On Petition to Reheae.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Plaintiff in error has filed a petition to rehear complaining that the Court failed to pass upon the real question involved, to wit, \u201ccould or might the condition complained of by Sams be connected with any accidental injury.\u201d It is also insisted that it is not answered by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The original opinion fully discussed the testimony of witnesses both for the plaintiff in error and the defendant as bearing upon the \u201creal question\u201d as to whether the accident resulted in, or caused, a permanent injury to Sams. The Court was of the opinion that the evidence supported the finding of the Chancellor, or at least there was material evidence to support his decree. The so-called \u201ccould or might rule\u201d involves the probative value of evidence as to \u201ccausation\u201d. We not only directed attention to the testimony of lay witnesses but also to the opinions of medical experts. There was direct evidence to support the Chancellor\u2019s decree. Moreover the value of the testimony of medical experts was not based solely upon any opinion that the accident \u201cmight or could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>have \u2019 \u2019 caused a permanent injury. Titus on page 564 of 270 S. W. (2d) there appear excerpts from the testimony of Dr. Munal that .as a result of the accident Sams would not recover without a major operation and that such an operation \u201cwas dangerous\u2019\u2019. If we concede that this was opinion evidence it surely was based upon facts which the doctor found to exist, i. e. \u201ca ruptured disc on the right side of the lumbar area.\u201d The petitioner introduced no testimony suggesting* that this \u201cruptured disc\u201d resulted, or could have resulted, from any cause other than the accident complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">The contention of counsel is highly technical and requires no response except to say that the original opinion is not subject to the criticism appearing in the petition. The petition to rehear is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
