A writ of error lies in all cases where an appeal in the nature of a writ of error would have lain. So that if a party fails to take an appeal in error he has still another chance which is to file the record for a writ of error (Idem, Sections 446 and 448, last paragraph on page 491).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
