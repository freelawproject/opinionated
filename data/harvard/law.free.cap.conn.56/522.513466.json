W. Munsell &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">On the trial of the cause in the court below the defendant, in order to prove the allegations of his answer, that the book tendered him by the plaintiffs in fulfilment of their contract did not \u201c contain a map of the city of New Haven, showing ward boundaries, location of streets, parks, cemeteries,' churches, public buildings, street railroads,\u201d etc., as the contract required, offered the testimony of one Hill, who stated that he had been a civil engineer for. fifteen years; that he had been city engineer for a number of years; that he was familiar with maps, and had made one of the city of New Haven ; and that a map, called the Bogart and Andrews map, was an accurate one of the city. He further testified in regard to certain inaccuracies of the plaintiffs\u2019 map ; and the defendant claimed to have proved by his testimony that it was grossly inaccurate ; that it did not show the ward boundaries, location of streets, parks, cemeteries, churches, public buildings and street railroads; that certain portions of the city of New Haven had been omitted entirely; and that the streets were inaccurately located, and improperly named. The witness used the Bogart and Andrews map to refresh' his recollection in pointing out to the jury the inaccuracies of the plaintiffs\u2019 map.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The defendant then offered in evidence the map the witness had used to refresh his recollection, and the one which he had stated accurately represented the city, in order that the jury might more thoroughly understand the witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>and remember Ms testimony in regard to the errors he had described in the plaintiffs\u2019 map; and the defendant had pointed out the places where the errors might be found by certain red lines marked on the Bogart and Andrews map.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The plaintiffs objected to the admission of the map in evidence, on the ground that they had not agreed to furnish an accurate map of the city, but only that the book should contain a map of the city, showing its wards, streets, etc.; that is, as they claim, a map of substantial accuracy. The court excluded the evidence. In this we think the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Although the plaintiffs\u2019 contract did not require that they should furnish an accurate map, but one substantially correct, as the court properly charged, still the difficulty of determining in a closely balanced case whether the matter in dispute is on one side or the other of the line of substantial accuracy,' is just as great as it would be if the line was drawn anywhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">No engineer or number of engineers could carry in their recollection all the streets of a great city like New Haven, their courses and distances and relations to each other, the ward boundaries, and location of parks, churches, public buildings, cemeteries and street railroads, so that they could determine whether a map of the city shown them was substantially correct or not; much less could a jury, strangers to the subject, determine the question by hearing the inaccuracies of the map verbally described. In all such cases there must be a standard to which the matter can be referred, to determine whether it is substantially correct, or grossly inaccurate. Indeed the plaintiffs\u2019 contract, upon the construction of it which they claim, makes a correct map of the city the only criterion by which the substantial correctness of their map can be determined. Suppose a farmer agrees to furnish substantially a ton of hay, or cord of wood, or one hundred bushels of potatoes, would he not make the standard of weight or measure, as the case may be, the test whether he fulfills his contract or not, and would he not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>make that standard evidence on the subject? We think he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The view we have taken- of this question renders it unnecessary to consider the other questions raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">There is error in the judgment appealed from and it is reversed, and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
