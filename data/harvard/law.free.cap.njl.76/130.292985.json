But the defendant by receiving, retaining and constantly using the mules and keeping the check with full knowledge of all the material facts and circumstances, ratified the sale. <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>32 Vroom 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The rule is that a subsequent ratification of an act done by another, assuming to act in the capacity of an agent,, though without any precedent authority, creates the relation of principal and agent, and after such ratification, with full knowledge <em>of </em>all the material facts and circumstances, the principal is bound by the act to the same extent as if it had been done by his previous authority. <em>Gulick &amp; Holmes </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>463.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The result is that the judgment below should be reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
