But the fact that there was such evidence, and that it was of a persuasive character, cannot affect the disposition of this appeal, for the reason that this court will not review the decisions of the District Court upon questions of fact. It can only look to see if there is any legal evidence upon which the judgment may rest. <em>New York and New Jersey Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>40 <em>Vroom </em>183.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">As remarked, the record exhibits such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Other objections specified in the state of the case, but not referred to upon the argument or in the brief presented on behalf of the appellants, have not been considered. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>43 <em>Vroom </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">The result is the judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
