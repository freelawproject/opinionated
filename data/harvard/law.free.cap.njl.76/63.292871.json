L. </em>1897, <em>p. </em>289), the failure of the record to show the evidence or a conviction as required by law is fatal if the proceedings are regarded as summary, and the failure to show a judgment is fatal if regarded as a civil action. Nor is the prosecutor precluded from raising these questions becaus.e he has proceeded by <em>c&amp;rtiorm-i </em>and not by appeal, or because the judgment has been satisfied.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b107-10\">Before Justice Swayze.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-11\">For the prosecutor, <em>Alexander P.

L. </em>1897, <em>p. </em>289), which resulted in a fine of $10.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">If we regarded proceedings under this section as summary in their character <em>(North Plainfield </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>43 <em>Vroom </em>146), the record fails to show the evidence or a conviction, as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">If we regard the proceedings as a civil action <em>(Brophy </em>v. <em>Perth Amboy, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>217), and subject therefore to the provisions of the act relating to courts for the trial of small causes <em>(White </em>v. <em>Neptune City, </em>27 <em>Id. </em>222; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Schlacter, </em>37 <em>Id. </em>247), the record fails to show a judgment, and this defect is fatal unless the prosecutor is prevented from raising the question. He is not prevented by the fact that he has proceeded by <em>certiorari </em>instead of by appeal to the Common Pleas, for the Borough act only allows the appeal when the penalty imposed exceeds $20. He is not prevented by the fact that he has paid the fine. In civil actions a judgment may be reversed on error, though it has been satisfied. <em>Tidd Pr. </em>1033. The same rule has been applied to criminal cases where the sentence has been served or the fine has been paid. <em>Barthelemy </em>v. <em>People, </em>2 <em>Ilill </em>248; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleckner, </em>167 <em>Mass. </em>13. As was said in the former case, \"The payment or satisfaction of an erroneous judgment against a party can never be allowed as a bar to a writ of error, even in a case where we must see that no restitution could follow the reversal as a legal consequence, and no costs be recovered. An erroneous judgment against him is an injury <em>per se, </em>from which the law will intend he is or will be damnified by its continuing against him unreversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The proceedings must be reversed. The case -in this respect is governed by <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Schlacter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\"><em>We </em>cannot regard the deposition of the mayor and correct the record thereby. The proper course was to rule the court below for a further return. <em>North Plainfield </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>43 <em>Vroom </em>146, 149.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
