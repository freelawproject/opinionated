Nor can we say, in the light of the doctrine enunciated in that case, that a passenger, by entering a public conveyance more or less crowded, his fare being accepted, and the relation of passenger and carrier having been thereby created, <em>ipso facto </em>was chargeable with negligence. We should say, rather, that the condition is akin to that presented by a passenger, who stands upon the running-board of a crowded car. There, it may be truly said, the danger is obvious, and yet the Court of Errors and Appeals, in <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Consolidated Traction Co., </em>32 <em>Id. </em>606, held \u201cthat by taking his stand upon the running-board of the ear the plaintiff assumed the risk of such damages as were obviously incident to that position; still the company, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>accepting him there as a passenger, owed to Mm the duty-arising out of that relation.\u201d To the same effect is <em>City Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>21 <em>Id. </em>435. The acceptance of plaintiff as a passenger under the conditions affords the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in this and other jurisdictions. <em>West Chicago Street Railway Co. </em>v. <em>McNulty, </em>64 <em>Ill. App. </em>549; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Brooklyn City Railway Co., 5 N. Y. App. </em>492; <em>Abel </em>v. <em>Northampton Traction Co., </em>212 <em>Pa. St. </em>329; <em>Seller </em>v. <em>Market Street Railway Co., </em>139 <em>Cal. </em>268; <em>Elliott v. Newport Street Railway Co., </em>18 <em>R. I. </em>707; <em>Geitz </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Railway Co., </em>72 <em>Wis. </em>307.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">And so in the case at bar, it would seem to be a rational deduction or corollary, from the rule that a common carrier is required to exercise due care to anticipate danger, and to employ care to avert it, that the acceptance by it of a passenger upon a crowded car, presents a condition requiring it to exercise due care, under conditions and over an environment due to its own creation; and whether such care was exercised, and whether the passenger was chargeable with contributory negligence, in view of the conditions, necessarily become questions for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">For these reasons the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
