Humphrey, 40 <em>Vroom 436\u2014Held. </em>that where a real estate broker has no written authority at the time a sale is effected by him, an express promise to pay a stated commission subsequently made in writing and signed by the vendor will not sustain an action for the sum named therein.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-11\">On appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b299-12\">Before Justices Garrison, Swayze and Trgnci-iard.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQ5\">Eor the appellant, <em>Samuel W.

The case was tried before the court without a jury, and resulted in a judgment of nonsuit at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The following are the facts of the case as found by the trial court:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The plaintiff, who is a real estate broker, was orally empowered by the defendant to sell a parcel of real estate owned by her. The plaintiff found a purchaser for the premises, introduced him to the defendant, and a written agreement for the sale and conveyance of the land was thereupon made between defendant and the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">After that agreement was executed, but at the same session, plaintiff demanded payment of a commission at the rate of two and one-half per cent, on the purchase price of $2,950. Defendant objected to the payment of such a large commission and agreed to pay $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Plaintiff then drew up and defendant signed a written agreement as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u201cI agree to pay Charles Bagnole fifty dollars ($50) for commission for the sale of my property at No. 36 Stone St. on or before July 1, 1907. Bridget Madden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The plaintiff was nonsuited upon the ground, <em>inter </em>alia, that he made the sale without written authority in which the rate of commission was stated, and also on the ground that the writing executed after the sale lacked consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">In the case of <em>Stout </em>v. Humphrey, 40 <em>Vroom </em>436, it was declared to be the policy of the statute of frauds that \u201cin the absence of a written contract there shall be an absence of right to compensation for services, and that where there is no written contract a subsequent express promise to pay for the services is entirely devoid of consideration.\u201d In view of this language of the Court of Errors and Appeals it is fruitless to re-examine the interesting question presented by the case in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">The case before us falls within the terms of the decided case; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>if any modification of the early decision is to be made it must be by the court that pronounced it.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The judgment of the Second District Court of Newark is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
