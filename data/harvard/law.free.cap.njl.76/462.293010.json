Farrell, 25 <em>Vroom </em>416.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">But we do not find it necessary to make that objection the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in the case at bar, for the reason that the indictment is clearly bad in alleging \u201csales to one John Doe and divers others.\u201d The rule is clearly settled that where the names of the offenders are known, they should be alleged in the indictment; and if they cannot be ascertained, that fact should be set forth, or the indictment must, upon proper motion, be quashed. <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>118; <em>Feigen </em>v. McGuire, 35 <em>Id. </em>152.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">Eor this reason the judgment of conviction should be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
