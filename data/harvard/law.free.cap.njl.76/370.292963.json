The credibility of witnesses was a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Under such circumstances a verdict will not be directed. <em>Baumann </em>v. <em>Hamburg-American Packet </em>(Co., 38 <em>Vroom 250; Hanson </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad </em>Co., 43 <em>Id. </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">It is urged, in the brief of the appellants, that the evidence of what was said by the defendants\u2019 foreman was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">So far as appears from the state of the case ho objection was made to this evidence in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">On appeal this court will not consider an alleged error not brought to the attention of the trial judge or in any way raised before him. <em>Frisby </em>v. <em>Thomas Jefferson </em>Council, 45 <em>Vroom </em>213; <em>Osborn </em>v. Gurtner, 46 <em>Id. </em>224.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Furthermore, the alleged error is not among the specifications filed of the determinations of the District Court with respect to which the appellants are dissatisfied in point of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">A rule of this court provides that appeals from the District Court shall be heard and determined solely upon the points \u2022of law so specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">Accordingly, the alleged error has not been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The result is that the judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
