Stat., p. </em>36. The complaint was sufficient to confer jurisdiction, but it is contended by the prosecutor that the justice lost jurisdiction by his denial of the demand for a jury made by the prosecutor at the proper stage of the proceedings. The denial was placed by the justice upon either of two <em>grounds\u2014first, </em>the refusal of the demandant to advance the venire fees, and second, that the cause was not triable by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Neither of these attempted justifications can be sustained. The first is directly opposed to the rule laid down in this court in the case of <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>40 <em>Vroom </em>184, and the second is also directly ruled by <em>Harman </em>v. <em>Board of Pharmacy, </em>38 <em>Id. </em>117. These cases also decide that after such a denial the justice is without jurisdiction to try the cause without a jury. <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Forsyth, Penn. </em>*432; <em>Meirs </em>v. <em>Bussom, </em>28 <em>Vroom </em>383.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In view of the rule thus established in this court it is unnecessary for us to consider, as if it were a novel question, whether in such cases <em>certiorari </em>will lie. Upon the authority of the cases cited <em>certiorari </em>is the proper remedy. The judgment of the justice in the present case is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
