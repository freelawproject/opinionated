He challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to continue his sentencing hearing and its five-level increase of his base offense level for his relevant conduct of possessing over 600 images of child pornography. Stevens also contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">Stevens sought to continue his sentencing hearing so that he could present a second psychiatric evaluation as evidence of mitigating circumstances. He argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it denied his motion to continue based solely on the fact that the motion was untimely. He claims that he suffered specific substantial prejudice because he received a longer sentence than similar defendants who had been given the opportunity to present expert testimony about their psychological histories and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to continue sentencing for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1128 (11th Cir.2007). The defendant must show that the denial \u201cproduced specific substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Where the continuance was sought for the purpose of obtaining a witness, we consider these factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-14\">(1) the diligence of the defense in interviewing the witness and procuring his testimony; (2) the probability of obtaining his testimony within a reasonable time; (3) the specificity with which the defense was able to describe the witness\u2019s expected knowledge or testimony; and (4) the degree to which such testimony is expected to be favorable to the accused, and the unique or cumulative nature of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">Applying those factors to the present case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stevens\u2019 motion for a continuance. The court found that Stevens\u2019 motion for a continuance \u2014 filed four days before the scheduled sentencing hearing and over ninety days after Stevens\u2019 guilty plea \u2014 was untimely. Stevens did not establish the unique or non-cumulative nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>proposed psychiatric evaluation. He informed the court that one psychological evaluation had been completed and that he sought a second one from a \u201cBoard certified sexologist,\u201d who might be able to \u201cgive the Court some valid information relating to the history and characteristics of this defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Stevens\u2019 constitutional right to the assistance of counsel was not violated because counsel was able to present evidence about mitigating circumstances. Before the sentencing hearing, Stevens\u2019 counsel submitted to the district court a psychological evaluation conducted by Dr. Steven Edney that described Stevens\u2019 personal history and problems involving his work, marital relations, and substance abuse. Stevens made a statement to the court explaining the factors in his life that led to his admitted obsession with pornography and \u201ctrading pictures and videos with people\u201d in online chat rooms. Stevens\u2019 counsel recounted statements from family, friends, and neighbors about them good opinion of Stevens, and counsel read to the court a letter written by Stevens\u2019 wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">When it sentenced Stevens at the low end of the guidelines range, the district court acknowledged that it had considered the statements presented at the hearing. The possibility that Stevens would have received an even shorter sentence if he had presented a second psychological report by another expert is pure speculation. Stevens did not show that the denial of the continuance constituted an abuse of discretion or that it caused him specific substantial prejudice. <em>See Douglas, </em>489 F.3d at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">As for the five-level enhancement of his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) for possession of more than 600 images of child pornography, Stevens did not challenge that enhancement in the district court. Therefore, we review it only for plain error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe four prongs of plain error review are: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect the appellant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 1014 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). We will not correct any error unless all four requirements are met. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, \u201cat least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Stevens contends that the term \u201coffense\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) should not include the relevant conduct of possessing hundreds of images of child pornography because he was only convicted of transmitting two images. He argues that the Sentencing Commission did not intend for possessors of child pornography to be punished as severely as distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) covers both possession and distribution of child pornography and contains a specific offense characteristic that permits a five-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved ... 600 or more images.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D). An offense is defined as \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(H). Unless otherwise specified, specific offense characteristics are determined based on all acts committed in preparation for and during the offense of conviction as well as acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that were part of the same course of conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a). Relevant conduct is not limited to the conduct charged in the indictment. <em>United States v. Iguancio Munio, </em>909 F.2d 436, 438 (11th Cir.1990). Stevens cannot show that a decision by the Supreme Court or this Court prohibited the district court from considering evidence of his possession of hundreds of images of child pornography in order to enhance his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Finally, Stevens contends that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. His procedural argument is that the district court simply stated that it had considered the statutory factors, which was an inadequate explanation of the sentence. His substantive argument is that the court refused to give him extra time to get a second psychological evaluation and that it imposed a five-level enhancement for possession of child pornography, so he was punished as if he were a distributor of hundreds of images when he actually only distributed two images. He asserts that those decisions thwarted \u00a7 3553(a)(6)\u2019s objective of avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The Supreme Court has explained that the reasonableness standard of review requires us to consider the ultimate sentence imposed under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d and to take into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Section 3553(a) requires the sentencing court to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with necessary educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining a particular sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">In explaining the sentence imposed, an acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is enough. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The district court is not required to explicitly state that it has considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Although a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The district court correctly calculated Stevens\u2019 sentencing guideline range, considered testimony and evidence relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained in enough detail the sentence imposed. For reasons we have already discussed, the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to grant Stevens a continuance so that he could introduce a second psychological evaluation, and it did not err in imposing a five-level enhancement for Stevens\u2019 possession of over six hundred images of child pornography. Stevens\u2019 sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">. In support of his argument about sentencing disparities Stevens cites decisions such as <em>United States v. Gray, </em>453 F.3d 1323, 1324 (11th Cir.2006), where we upheld a 72-month sentence for distribution of child pornography where the defendant's guideline range was the same as Stevens\u2019 \u2014 151 to 188 months. Stevens\u2019 argument overlooks the point that reasonableness review is deferential both when the government contends that the sentence is too low and when the defendant contends that the sentence is too high. <em>See id. </em>at 1325 (\u2018\u2018[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
