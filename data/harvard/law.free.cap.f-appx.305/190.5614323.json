Rodriguez contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not provide adequate reasons for selecting the sentence. Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he argues that the sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, does not take account of empirical data and national experience. Finally, Rodriguez asserts that his sentence is substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>tively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We review Rodriguez\u2019s procedural argument for plain error because he did not timely object to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons for selecting the sentence. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). To show plain error, Rodriguez must identify an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008). And even if he makes such a showing, giving us the discretion to correct the error, we may only do so if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing were adequate to show that it had considered Rodriguez\u2019s contentions and the pertinent sentencing factors. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We disagree with Rodriguez\u2019s reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. The <em>Kimbrough </em>Court said nothing about the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by our decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">After reviewing the record on appeal for procedural errors and considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we conclude that Rodriguez has failed to show that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, much less overcome that presumption. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b216-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
