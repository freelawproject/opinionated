Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Hubbard contends Amendment 706 changed her guideline range, because her base offense level of 38 was mandatory prior to the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ment, but became advisory after <em>Booker. </em>Hubbard also argues Amendment 706\u2019s failure to explicitly reduce her base offense level of 38 is inconsistent with the policies underlying the amendment and with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(2)(c), which requires a policy statement to be consistent with \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and other pertinent federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). We also review <em>de novo </em>\u201cquestions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, there is an exception where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases, calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2008, by incorporation into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713 (2008). Prior to the amendment, a base offense level of 38 applied to drug offenses involving 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2006). As a result of the amendment, a base offense level of 38 now applies to an offense involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, whereas level 36 applies to an offense involving at least 1.5 but fewer than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), (2) (2007). Thus, although Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, the base offense level for convictions based on 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine remained unchanged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">We have held <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) clearly authorizes a lower court to reduce a sentence only where a defendant\u2019s original sentencing range has been reduced by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hubbard\u2019s motion to modify her sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although Amendment 706 affected the applicable guideline range for crack cocaine offenses involving less than 4.5 kilograms, Hubbard\u2019s offense involved more than this amount; thus, her base offense level of 38, and therefore her guideline range, remained unchanged. The plain language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) expressly prohibits a district court from granting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in Hubbard\u2019s case. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Because Amendment 706 did not effectively lower Hubbard\u2019s base offense level and guideline range, the district court did not err in finding it had no authority to reduce her sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, Hubbard\u2019s arguments based on <em>Booker </em>and policy considerations are meritless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
