We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and review de novo the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>-See, e.g., Ryan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>528 F.3d 1194, 1198 (9th Cir.2008). \u201cThe Social Security Administration\u2019s disability determination should be upheld unless it is based on legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Webber claims the ALJ erred in rejecting her subjective-symptom testimony. We agree. Once an applicant has established the existence of an impairment that could reasonably be expected to cause some degree of symptom, an ALJ may reject an applicant\u2019s subjective symptom testimony only by providing \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons\u201d for doing so. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281-84 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ\u2019s proffered reasons are not clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">The ALJ relied on the lack of objective medical evidence, Webber\u2019s reported daily activities, infrequent office visits and failure to follow recommended treatment. Although reliance on reported daily activities is permissible, the ALJ failed to explain how Webber\u2019s very limited domestic activities, primarily caring for her minor disabled son, were transferable to the workplace. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 7 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cmany home activities may not be easily transferable to a work environment where it might be impossible to rest periodically or take medication\u201d) (citing <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989)). Reliance on unexplained, or inadequately explained failures to seek or follow treatment is also permissible. However, the ALJ erred in this case by ignoring the explanations proffered by Webber and her treating physician, Dr. Kirsten. <em>See Flaten v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1464 (9th Cir.1995). As the ALJ\u2019s negative credibility determination may not stand exclusively upon a lack of objective medical evidence, <em>see Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997), we must credit Webber\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Webber also claims that the ALJ erred in rejecting the opinion of her treating physician Dr. Kirsten. We agree. <em>See Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 632 (9th Cir.2007) (an ALJ may not reject the opinion of a treating physician \u201cwithout providing \u2018specific and legitimate reasons\u2019 supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d); <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995). Dr. Kirsten was the only physician to examine Webber and render a medical opinion. The ALJ rejected Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>gaps between office visits, purported inconsistencies with other evidence of record, and Dr. Kirsten\u2019s reliance on Webber\u2019s subjective report of her limitations. First, as noted <em>supra, </em>the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Webber\u2019s infrequent office visits and failure to follow recommended treatment without examining the explanations proffered by Dr. Kirsten and Webber was error. Second, the rejection of Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion for its reliance on Webber\u2019s subjective complaints fails because, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the subjective complaints themselves were improperly rejected. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001) (medical opinion based on subjective complaints can be properly rejected where the subjective complaints themselves have been refuted). Third, the purported inconsistencies noted by the ALJ are unsupported by the record in this case. Accordingly, Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion must be given credit as a matter of law. <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Webber also argues the ALJ improperly disregarded her husband\u2019s testimony after finding him generally credible. We agree. Family members in a position to observe a claimant\u2019s symptoms and activities are competent to testify as to the claimant\u2019s condition. <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993). An ALJ must give reasons for disregarding testimony from a competent lay witness. <em>Id. </em>at 919; <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ did not give the husband\u2019s testimony separate treatment, rejecting it apparently for the reasons given for rejecting Webber\u2019s testimony. The analysis used to discredit Webber was rejected <em>supra, </em>and we have found no other reason to reject the husband\u2019s lay testimony. Accordingly, it too should be credited.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We decline comment on Webber\u2019s allegation regarding the vocational grids as the issue is moot in light of the rest of this memorandum. On remand, the ALJ should reevaluate Webber\u2019s residual functional capacity, fully crediting Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion and the testimony of Webber and her husband. <em>See Moisa v. Barnhart, </em>367 F.3d 882, 886-87 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation\u201d) (quoting <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b339-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b340-8\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AV_\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Although this is a close case, given our deferential standard of review I cannot concur with the panel majority\u2019s decision to reverse and to remand for further proceedings. We must affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision if it (1) employs the correct legal standard, and (2) is supported by substantial evidence, which amounts to more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance. <em>See Ryan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>528 F.3d 1194, 1198 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Connett v. Barnhart, </em>340 F.3d 871, 873 (9th Cir.2003). Because the ALJ properly evaluated the testimony of Webber and her husband as well as the opinion of her treating physician, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Webber was insured only through September 30, 2001. Thus, the question presented is whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings as to Webber\u2019s disability <em>on that date; </em>her disability after that date is irrelevant. This distinction is overlooked in the panel majority\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ failed to adduce \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons\u201d for discrediting Webber\u2019s testimony on the ba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>sis of her reported daily activities. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">A claimant\u2019s daily activities are relevant to the ALJ\u2019s assessment of her disability and may impact the claimant\u2019s credibility. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989). Here, the ALJ noted that Webber performs many household activities, albeit in a limited capacity, and concluded that \u201cthe mental and physical capabilities\u201d Webber employs to perform these tasks \u201creplicate those necessary for obtaining and maintaining employment.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Significantly, Webber\u2019s testimony occurred on July 27, 2003. The ALJ took this into account, explaining that \u201c[w]hile claimant and her husband were generally credible in their description of a medical condition that <em>currently </em>imposes significant limitations on claimant\u2019s ability to sustain exertional activities, it also appears that the condition has been progressively deteriorating, and the effects <em>were not as severe prior to September 30, 2001.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The ALJ also explained that Webber\u2019s daily activities <em>\u201cnow </em>appear to be limited by [her fibromyalgia],\u201d (emphasis added), but noted that Webber\u2019s own statements in 1998 indicated that she was able to perform her daily chores \u201cas long as she took her time.\u201d Indeed, the ALJ lists various events from 1995 through 2002 which suggest the progressive onset of symptoms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Relying on this assessment of the record as a whole, the ALJ concluded that while Webber\u2019s testimony may very well indicate she was disabled as of July 27, 2003, it was not credible evidence as to the state of her disability on September 30, 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Webber\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">The panel also concludes that the ALJ erred in discrediting the opinion of Webber\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Kirsten. An ALJ may reject the opinion of a treating physician in favor of the opinion of an examining physician if the ALJ makes \u201cfindings setting forth specific, legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the ALJ gave \u201cless weight\u201d to Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion because: (1) there were large gaps between Webber\u2019s visits to Dr. Kirsten; and (2) Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with other medical evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The panel majority erroneously rejects the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the gaps between Webber\u2019s visits for failure to examine the explanation provided by Dr. Kirsten. Maj. Disp. at 313-14. Dr. Kirsten justified the gaps by explaining that \u201cthere [were] no new medication/modalities to try, and [Webber was] fairly stable.\u201d As discussed above, <em>supra </em>at 315 n. 2, while this might be a valid reason not to schedule appointments, the fact remains that the absence of appointments undermines Dr. Kirsten\u2019s reliability as a witness to Webber\u2019s condition on September 30, 2001. The ALJ did not reject Dr. Kirsten\u2019s <em>reason </em>for not scheduling more appointments; he concluded that <em>because </em>such appointments were infrequent, Dr. Kirsten\u2019s 2003 retrospective analysis was less reliable than other evidence in the record. Such fact was a specific and legitimate reason for according Dr. Kirsten\u2019s opinion less weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The panel majority also erroneously discounts the \u201cinconsistencies noted by the ALJ\u201d as \u201cunsupported by the record.\u201d Maj. Disp. at 314. At least one inconsistency, however, <em>is </em>supported by the record: Dr. Kirsten\u2019s 2003 opinion states that Webber suffers from \u201cpoor muscle strength,\u201d whereas Dr. McCarthy\u2019s 1998 exam indicates that Webber had normal muscle tone and motor strength in her left arm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While Dr. McCarthy\u2019s exam was conducted three-and-a-half-years before September 30, 2001, Dr. Kirsten did not complete her report until one-and-a-half years <em>after </em>such date. Dr. Kirsten stated that Webber had been disabled since 1995. Dr. McCarthy stated the opposite in 1998. By highlighting this conflict, the ALJ articulated a specific and legitimate reason not to credit Dr. Kirsten\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Thus, the ALJ identified two specific and legitimate reasons for discrediting Dr. Kirsten\u2019s 2003 report. Any reliance on other, improper grounds was harmless error because the remaining two reasons are \u201clegally valid\u201d justifications for discrediting an examining physician\u2019s testimony. <em>Carmickle, </em>533 F.3d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">Based on the foregoing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s opinion to the contrary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. The ALJ went on to discuss how Webber\u2019s daily activities were \u201ctransferable to the workplace,\u201d Maj. Disp. at 3, explaining that such activities indicated that as of September 30, 2001, she was capable of \"a substantial range of sedentary exertional activity\u201d pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">. The ALJ also noted the large gaps between Webber\u2019s visits with doctors. For example, Webber did not visit a physician for a twenty-one-month period surrounding her date of last insured. While Dr. Kirsten attempted to explain the reason for the infrequent visits, such gaps in the record nonetheless create difficulties in assessing the nature of Webber\u2019s condition on September 30, 2001. Because claimants bear the burden of proving disability at this stage of the analysis, <em>Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005), the cost of this lack of evidence falls on Webber.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">. The panel is right to rule that the ALJ erred in relying on Webber\u2019s failure to follow or seek treatment. Nonetheless, such reliance was harmless error. <em>See, e.g., Batson v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195-97 (9th Cir.2004). Here, the ALJ's determination \u2014 that Webber was less than fully credible because her testimony conflicts with her daily activities and the medical evidence \u2014 is \u201clegally valid\u201d despite the fact that the ALJ erred in not addressing her explanation for not following recommended treatment protocols. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1162 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 959-60 (9th Cir.2002) (claimant\u2019s performance of daily activities relevant to credibility); <em>id. </em>(inconsistencies between claimant\u2019s testimony and medical evidence also relevant to credibility).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-17\">. The ALJ applied the same reasoning in discrediting the testimony of Webber\u2019s husband. That determination, therefore, is likewise valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">. Dr. McCarthy's assessment was not limited to Webber's left arm. Dr. McCarthy, a neurologist, performed a complete physical and cranial nerve examination and concluded that Webber\u2019s neurological evaluation was normal and that she was likely depressed. Although Dr. McCarthy specifically discussed the muscle tone in Webber\u2019s left arm (because it was the only extremity she complained of), he found the arm \"normal\" \u2014 a finding in legitimate conflict with Dr. Kirsten\u2019s assertion that Webber had poor muscle strength since 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-16\"><em>. </em>While the panel majority does not reach the question, I would rule that because the AU found Webber was able to perform a \"substantial range of sedentary work,\u201d reliance on the on the medical-vocational rules (Grids) was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
