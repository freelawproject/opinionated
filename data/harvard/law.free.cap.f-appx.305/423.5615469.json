Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss the petition for review in No. 06-72419, and deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review in No. 06-73758.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Lara failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Lara\u2019s motion to reopen because the BIA considered the evidence he submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">Lara\u2019s contention that the BIA violated due process by disregarding certain hardship evidence is not supported by the record and therefore does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas, </em>424 F.3d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">No. 06-72419: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">No. 06-73758: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b450-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
