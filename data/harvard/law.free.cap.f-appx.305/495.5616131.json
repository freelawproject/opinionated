PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b522-21\">Plaintiffs-appellants appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing their action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">Three of the four appellants are Deborah Hendrix and her two children, who were disenrolled as members of the Comanche Nation in April 2008. The fourth appellant, Phyllis Attocknie, was not disenrolled, but believed that she was aggrieved by what happened to Ms. Hendrix and her children. They filed suit, alleging violations of the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), thefr due process rights, and their equal protection rights. In an order filed on July 10, 2008, 2008 WL 2740901, the district court granted defendants-appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss because \u201cthis dispute centers around tribal membership, a matter outside the purview of [the district court] to review.\u201d R., Doc. 27, at 4-5. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he ICRA does not create a federal cause of action either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>in its own right or in conjunction with other federal law[,]\u201d and that appellants\u2019 due process and equal protection claims \u201cconcerning tribal membership eligibility, election participation, and petitioning privileges fail because there is no federal forum created by the ICRA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u201cWe review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 12(b)(1) and review findings of jurisdictional facts for clear error.\u201d <em>Butler v. Kempthorne, </em>532 F.3d 1108, 1110 (10th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Nov. 26, 2008) (No. 08-711). Appellants argue that there is federal subject matter jurisdiction, citing numerous statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We have carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s order in light of the parties\u2019 arguments, the record on appeal, and the governing law. As the district court observed, this is a dispute over tribal membership, which is a matter of internal tribal concern. We are unpersuaded by appellants arguments and affirm for substantially the reasons clearly explained by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Appellants\u2019 motion for en banc review is DENIED because appellants did not comply with the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 35(b). Even though appellants are appearing in this court pro se, they are nevertheless required to follow the court\u2019s procedural rules. <em>Green v. Dorrell, </em>969 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir.1992). Appellees\u2019 motion to strike appellants\u2019 reply brief (styled \u201cAppellants\u2019 Answer to Appellees Motion to Dismiss\u201d) is GRANTED because appellants failed to obtain this court\u2019s permission to file a reply brief that was untimely under Fed. R.App. P. 31(a)(1), that exceeded the page limit permitted by Fed. R.App. P. 32(a)(7)(A), and that otherwise failed to comply with this court\u2019s procedural rules. Appellants\u2019 cross-motion to strike appellees\u2019 answer brief and \u201cmotion to impeach, strike and or quash\u201d appellees\u2019 response to appellants\u2019 cross-motion to strike are DENIED as baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-13\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
