Fuson is serving a 90-year sentence imposed by a California court after he was convicted of twenty counts of committing a lewd act upon a child. <em>See </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288(a). In a certified issue, Fuson contends his conviction was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights to counsel and against self-incrimination. Raising an uncertified issue, Fuson also contends his conviction was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">The admission at trial of Fuson\u2019s incriminating statements to police did not violate Fuson\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. The California courts\u2019 conclusion Fuson was not in custody during his interview was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Though some facts present here suggest Fuson was in custody, Fuson came to the interview without police compulsion and police repeatedly assured Fuson he was not under arrest and could terminate the interview at any time. <em>See Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (per curiam). Fairminded jurists could disagree, given these conflicting indications, whether a reasonable person in Fuson\u2019s position would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave. In such situation, we are not free to substitute our judgment for that of the state courts. <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 663-65, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\">The court treats the briefing of an uncertified issue on appeal as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. <em>King v. Schriro, </em>537 F.3d 1062, 1074-75 &amp; n. 39 (9th Cir.2008). Because we do not find the district court\u2019s resolution of Fu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>son\u2019s Sixth Amendment claims to be \u201cdebatable or wrong,\u201d we decline to expand the certificate. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
