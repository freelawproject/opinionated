Greene contends the Government breached the terms of his plea agreement by presenting testimony and argument in support of an eight-level offense level enhancement on Count Five for threatening to cause physical injury in order to obstruct justice, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2J1.2 (b)(1)(A) (2006). Greene claims the Government agreed to recommend, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(B), an offense level of 14 and that it reasserted this stipulation during the plea hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">The Government agrees with Greene that its presentation of evidence in support of the enhancement after erroneously representing that the \u201cadjusted offense level\u201d was also 14 constituted a breach of the agreement. In light of the Government\u2019s concession, without reaching the merits of Greene\u2019s argument, we vacate Greene\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing. Consistent with our past practice in such circumstances, we remand the case to a different district court judge for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, Greene\u2019s motion to expedite decision in this case is denied as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\">. Additionally, Greene contends the district court erred in imposing the enhancement because USSG \u00a7 2J1.2 (b)(1)(A) requires a threat to cause injury, not merely an attempt to cause injury. However, in light of the Government's concessions, it is not necessary for the court to address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-18\">. <em>See United States v.
