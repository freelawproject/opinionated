R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Juan Ernesto Orozco-Rosales and his wife Guadalupe Orozco-Gonzales petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision affirming and adopting the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of their application for cancellation of removal. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Petitioners challenge the IJ\u2019s decision denying them cancellation of removal, arguing that they met the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d test. We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument since the IJ\u2019s hardship determination is a discretionary decision over which our jurisdiction has been eliminated. <em>See de Lourdes v. Mukasey, </em>539 F.3d 1102, 1105-06 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed insofar as it challenges the IJ\u2019s \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">We have jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 constitutional argument that the denial of their applications for cancellation of removal violated the equal protection clause because similarly-situated aliens from countries covered under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (\u201cNACARA\u201d) benefit from relaxed requirements for relief. However, this argument fails on the merits. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 602-03 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cNACARA easily satisfies the rational basis test\u201d). Petitioners\u2019 constitutional challenge to IIRIRA is similarly meritless. <em>Ram v. I.N.S., </em>243 F.3d 510, 517 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Petitioners finally claim that the BIA failed to articulate its reasons for denying petitioners\u2019 request for relief from deportation. However, the BIA stated that it \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed]\u201d the IJ\u2019s determination and cited <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). \u201cA <em>Burbano </em>affirmance signifies that the BIA has conducted an independent review of the record and has determined that its conclusions are the same as those articulated by the IJ.\u201d <em>Figueroa v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 487, 491 (9th Cir.2008). Since the BIA can adequately explain its reasoning by adopting the IJ\u2019s decision as it did here, <em>see Alaelua v. I.N.S., </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1381-82 (9th Cir.1995), petitioners\u2019 argument fails and the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
