Burr denying Chen\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Yiyin Chen, </em>No. A 98 889 403 (B.I.A. Feb. 15, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 889 403 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, June 8, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>See Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The agency reasonably found it implausible that: (1) the authorities fined Chen\u2019s mother for violating the family planning policy twenty years after she was forcibly sterilized; and (2) Chinese authorities would issue a receipt listing the fine as paid in January 2005, two months before Chen allegedly sent money from the United States to his parents to pay the fine. These findings were sufficient to support the conclusion that Chen was not credible. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">Because Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims were premised on the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination was fatal to both claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
