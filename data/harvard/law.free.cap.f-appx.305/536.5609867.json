After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In 2003, Saint Jour, a citizen of Haiti, attempted to enter the United States at Miami International Airport using an altered Haitian passport and green card. A Notice to Appear charged him with being inadmissible for: (1) fraudulently procuring documentation for admission to the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae, INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00ae; and (2) being an immigrant seeking admission to the United States without being in possession of a valid entry document, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)\u00ae\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Saint Jour conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. Saint Jour claimed that the Lavalas party, and its street gang, the Chimeres, sought to kill him for his political opinion. Saint Jour was the General Secretary of a Haitian non-profit community organization called the Association of Filie of Bariadelle (\u201cAFB\u201d). At an AFB celebration, Saint Jour refused the mayor\u2019s request to speak in favor of Lavalas and President Aristide. Saint Jour\u2019s application claimed the Lavalas government issued warrants for his arrest, sent police looking for him, ransacked his home and killed another AFB member.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">At the asylum hearing, Saint Jour indicated that he was ready to proceed on his asylum claim. The IJ inquired about Saint Jour\u2019s 1-130 petition for an immigrant visa, and Saint Jour responded that it had not yet been approved. The government stated that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) was awaiting documentation of the bona fides of his marriage. The parties asked for a \u201cshort continuance\u201d to permit fast tracking of Saint Jour\u2019s 1-130 \u201cmarriage interview\u201d and the submission of the marriage bona fides. When the IJ reminded the parties that Saint Jour also would need to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility due to his use of a fraudulent visa, the government\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cI had forgotten about the fraud\u201d and opined that USCIS was unlikely to grant a waiver. Noting that the asylum case had been scheduled on the calendar \u201cfor well over a year,\u201d the IJ denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">After Saint Jour testified, the IJ issued an oral decision denying all requested relief. The IJ found Saint Jour\u2019s testimony was not \u201csufficiently detailed, consistent or believable to provide a plausible and coherent account on the basis of his fears and thus cannot suffice to establish his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal and Torture Convention relief.\u201d The IJ listed numerous inconsistencies and omissions between Saint Jour\u2019s testimony and his asylum application and the documentary evidence. The IJ found that Saint Jour had not shown he could not relocate within Haiti to avoid harm, noting that the Lavalas party and Aristide were no longer in power in Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">The BIA dismissed Saint Jour\u2019s appeal, concluding that: (1) the IJ had not erred in refusing to continue the asylum pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ceedings; and (2) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. Saint Jour filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Acj\">A. Request for Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">An IJ has discretion to grant a motion for a continuance \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. We review the denial of a continuance request for abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cJudicial review of denials of discretionary relief incident to [removal] proceedings ... is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Saint Jour has not shown the IJ abused its discretion in denying his continuance request. First, at the time of the removal hearing, Saint Jour remained an \u201carriving alien\u201d and was never lawfully admitted to the United States. Thus, even if Saint Jour had filed an 1-130 petition for an immigrant visa based on his marriage and even if Saint Jour had obtained such a visa, the IJ himself had no jurisdiction to adjust Saint Jour\u2019s \u201carriving alien\u201d status to that of a lawful permanent resident. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1); <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1250-52 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 146, 172 L.Ed.2d 40 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Second, to the extent the continuance request was to give the government (whether USCIS or Department of Homeland Security) more time to adjudicate Saint Jour\u2019s 1-130 application for an immigration visa so he could later seek adjustment of status, Saint Jour failed to show that he was eligible for adjustment of status or had filed an 1-601 application for a waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The Attorney General may adjust an alien\u2019s status to lawful permanent resident if: (1) \u201cthe alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa\u201d; and (2) the alien \u201cis admissible to the United States for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A), INA \u00a7 245(i)(2)(A). An alien, such as Saint Jour, who by fraud seeks admission to the United States is inadmissible. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C), INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C). Thus, even if Saint Jour was eligible to receive an immigrant visa, he was not admissible at the time of the hearing and therefore not eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">We recognize, as the IJ did, that the Attorney General has the discretion to waive inadmissibility if the alien is the spouse of a United States citizen and \u201cit is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the refusal of admission to the United States of such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the citizen.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i)(l), INA \u00a7 212(i)(l). However, to obtain a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(i), an adjustment of status applicant must file a Form 1-601. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7(a)(l)(ii). Again, there is no evidence in the record that Saint Jour had filed a Form 1-601 or intended to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">Saint Jour argues that his case is like <em>Haswanee v. United States Attorney General, </em>471 F.3d 1212 (11th Cir.2006). But, unlike the petitioner in <em>Haswanee, </em>Saint Jour is an \u201carriving alien\u201d who is inadmissible due to his attempted fraudulent entry. In any event, the petitioner alien in <em>Haswanee </em>had not only obtained a labor certificate and completed the necessary steps to obtain an immigrant visa, but also was statutorily eligible for adjustment of status. Here, however, Saint Jour: (a) had not yet obtained a \u00a7 212(i) waiver of inadmissibility, which Saint Jour concedes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>he would need (due to his use of a fraudulent passport and green card) to be eligible for an adjustment of status, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i)(l), INA \u00a7 212\u00a9(1); (b) had presented no evidence that he had initiated the \u00a7 212(i) waiver process by filing a Form 1-601; and (c) had not yet submitted the documents establishing the bona fides of his marriage or had his \u201cmarriage interview,\u201d which were prerequisites to obtaining an immigrant visa. Under all of the circumstances of this case, we cannot say the IJ abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">B. Adverse Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Saint Jour argues that his testimony should have been credited and compels the conclusion that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An asylum applicant has the burden to show, with specific and credible evidence, either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i)-(ii), INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i)-(ii). In determining whether the applicant has sustained that burden, the IJ may weigh the credibility of the applicant\u2019s testimony along with other evidence in the record. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii), INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(ii). The IJ must make an explicit credibility determination and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for the finding.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). The alien bears the burden to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding is not supported by specific, cogent reasons and is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">After review, we conclude that the IJ gave specific, cogent reasons for discrediting Saint Jour. The IJ identified numerous inconsistencies, omissions and deficiencies in Saint Jour\u2019s hearing testimony, several of which relate directly to Saint Jour\u2019s persecution claims, including: (1) the omission in his asylum application of the Chimere\u2019s alleged killing of Saint Jour\u2019s brother and cousin due to Saint Jour\u2019s involvement with AFB; (2) the discrepancies between Saint Jour\u2019s testimony and his supplemental statement as to how his cousin died; and (3) inconsistent explanations of AFB\u2019s purpose and political posture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>omissions and inconsistencies are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we have no occasion to reverse the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Furthermore, Saint Jour does not contend that the other documentary evidence, alone, compels a conclusion that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Because Saint Jour failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he likewise failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93,1303-04.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">. On appeal, Saint Jour\u2019s challenge to the credibility determination is limited to his claim of future persecution and he raises no argument as to past persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding petitioner abandoned issue by failing to raise it in opening brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">. Like other factual findings, we review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and will overturn them only if the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005). Where, as here, the BIA\u2019s decision relies upon the IJ's reasoning, we review both the IJ's and the BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230. Contrary to the government\u2019s assertion, Saint Jour challenged the adverse credibility finding in his notice of appeal to the BIA. Thus, he exhausted his administrative remedies, and jurisdiction exists to review the credibility finding. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b565-14\">. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the INA to permit an adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies \"without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d)(4)(C), 119 Stat. 231, 303, 304-05 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1229a(c)(4)(C)). Because Saint Jour\u2019s application was filed before May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act's changes do not apply to his claims. Nonetheless, we need not resolve whether adverse credibility determinations must go to the heart of a pre-REAL ID Act asylum claim because a number of the inconsistencies identified in Saint Jour\u2019s case are material and directly relate to his persecution claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b566-16\">. On appeal, Saint Jour argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in preparing his asylum application. We lack jurisdiction to review this claim because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), INA \u00a7 242(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
