We affirm Harris\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-21\">Harris was arrested after a neighbor observed him firing a semiautomatic rifle at a house in Mims, Florida. At trial, the government presented evidence that the rifle was made in Romania, imported by Century Arms International of Vermont, and found in Harris\u2019 possession in Florida. The ammunition Harris used was manufactured in Winchester, Illinois. Harris stipulated that he was a convicted felon, and the jury convicted him of possessing a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">The Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSI) recommended that the court sentence Harris as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). To qualify as an armed career criminal, a defendant must have three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, each of which occurred on a separate occasion. According to this rubric, the district court found that Harris had two convictions for selling cocaine and one under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) for sexual battery on a child under the age of sixteen. The government proved these crimes by submitting certified copies of Harris\u2019 convictions, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>were based on guilty pleas, to the district court. The district court then concluded that the sexual battery charge was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e) and sentenced Harris as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The ACCA provision that the district court relied on established a statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years. Under the sentencing guidelines, Harris\u2019 range was 262-327 months. The district court departed from the guidelines under <em>United States v. </em>Booker; 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and sentenced Harris to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Harris brings four challenges to his conviction and sentence. He contends that: (1) his conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) is not a violent felony and thus not a predicate offense under the ACCA; (2) that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him under the ACCA based on prior convictions that were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) that his conviction violates the Due Process and Commerce clauses because there was insufficient evidence to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce; and (4) that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional on its face because it is not limited to interstate commerce and because it exceeds the scope of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Harris contends that his conviction for sexual battery of a child under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) is not a violent felony within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e). Therefore, Harris argues, ACCA should not apply to his case, and he should be sentenced under \u00a7 924(a)(2), which carries a ten-year statutory maximum. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusion that a particular offense is a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">In determining whether Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) describes a violent felony, we must use a \u201cformal categorical approach\u201d in which we examine only the statutory definition of the offense and not the particular facts on which Harris\u2019 conviction was based. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (\u201cThe Courts of Appeals uniformly have held that \u00a7 924(e) mandates a formal categorical approach, looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.... We find the reasoning of these cases persuasive.\u201d). Thus, the proper question is whether the act prohibited by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) is a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">We must first determine whether Harris was convicted under the version of \u00a7 800.04(3) that was effective before October 1990 or the version effective between 1990 and 1996, when Harris was charged and convicted. The 1996 version of \u00a7 800.04(3) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">800.04. Lewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act upon or in presence of child</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">Any person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">(3) Commits an act defined as sexual battery under s. 794.011(l)(h) upon any child under the age of 16 years ... is guilty of a felony of the second degree</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1990-1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">But Harris argues that there is no evidence in the record as to <em>when </em>his crime occurred. Harris then argues that, if the crime happened before October 1,1990, his 1996 conviction could be based on the preOctober 1990 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3). That version stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>800.04. Lewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act upon or in presence of child; sexual battery Any person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">(2) Commits an act defined as sexual battery under s. 794.011(l)(h) upon any child under the age of 16 years; or (3) Knowingly commits any lewd or lascivious act in the presence of any child under the age of 16 years ... is guilty of a felony of the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1989). The government submitted only Hams\u2019 judgment of conviction to the district court. That judgment, dated August 19, 1996, lists the crime as \u201csexual act with a child under 16 years of age\u201d and cites \u00a7 800.04(3). Without more evidence that the 1996 statute applied, Harris argues that the 1990 version, which he further contends did not qualify as a violent felony, may have been what the 1996 Florida court used.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">It is clear from the record that Harris was convicted under the 1996 version of \u00a7 800.04(3). In his arguments to the district court Harris repeatedly referred to his crime as \u201cstatutory rape.\u201d That description, while fitting \u00a7 800.04(3) (1990-1996), is inconsistent with \u00a7 800.04(3) (pre-1990), which refers simply to lewd or lascivious acts <em>in the presence of </em>a child. Harris\u2019 description of his crime as \u201cstatutory rape\u201d describes pre-1990 \u00a7 800.04(2), not \u00a7 800.04(3). Yet the 1996 judgment form clearly notes the offense as falling under \u00a7 800.04(3), and also describes it as \u201csexual act with a child under 16 years of age.\u201d That description also comports far better with the 1990-1996 version of \u00a7 800.04(3) than the pre-1990 one. Finally, we observe that Harris has never outright claimed that the actual offense occurred before October 1990 \u2014 he claims only that it <em>might </em>have. Thus Harris has given us no good reason to doubt what appears to be obvious: that the 1996 court\u2019s undated statutory citation and corroborating description refer to the version of the statute effective at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Violating the 1996 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) is a violent felony under ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any felony that: \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is a burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another ...\u201d We have held that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of \u2018physical force\u2019 is power, violence, or pressure directed against a person consisting in a physical act.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Physical force is a minimal requirement satisfied by physical contact, which cannot be achieved without some degree of Newtonian force. <em>Id. </em>at 1342. Congress did not insert the term \u201cviolent\u201d into its description of physical force, and neither will we. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\"><em>United States v. Young, </em>527 F.3d 1274 (11th Cir.2008), is instructive. In <em>Young, </em>we held that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.085, \u201cBattery of child by throwing, tossing, projecting, or expelling certain fluids or materials,\u201d qualified as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. 527 F.3d at 1277-78. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 is nearly identical to \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), and our cases interpreting that guideline \u201cprovide important guidance in determining what is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>489 F.3d 1112, 1113 (11th Cir.2007). Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.085(1) makes it \u201cunlawful for any [adult] to knowingly cause or attempt to cause a child to come into contact with blood, seminal fluid, or urine or feces by throwing, tossing, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>jecting, or expelling such fluid or material.\u201d In Young, we reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">[The actions outlawed by \u00a7 784.085(1)] require a physical act and are directed against a person. Thus, the only remaining requirement for physical force is that it involve \u201cpower, violence, or pressure.\u201d ... The impact of the fluids against the child creates pressure and this minimal contact satisfies the requirement of physical force. Therefore, we conclude that the offense is a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">527 F.3d at 1278. In other words, the act of intentionally ejaculating on a child, even without any other physical touch, qualifies as a crime of violence under statutory language identical to \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">By comparison, \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) required that Harris \u201cCommit[] an act defined as sexual battery under \u00a7 794.011(l)(h) upon any child under the age of 16 years.... \u201d Under \u00a7 794.011(l)(h), \u201cSexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another.\u201d Certainly, there is at least as much physical contact involved in \u201coral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with [sexual organs]\u201d as in \u201cthrowing, tossing, projecting, or expelling\u201d fluids. <em>See </em>\u00a7 794.011(l)(h); \u00a7 785.084(1). Accordingly, under this Court\u2019s minimal physical contact requirement, a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) is a violent felony. <em>See also United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1236 (11th Cir.2007) (finding that statutory rape, as defined by Alabama law, is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2). Harris thus qualified for sentencing as an armed career criminal under ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Harris contends that his 240-month sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because it was based in part on his three prior felony convictions, none of which were proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether the district court erred under <em>Apprendi </em>is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-40, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1228-29, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the government need not prove a defendant\u2019s prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the district court to use those convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756, the Supreme Court confirmed that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>applies to Sixth Amendment cases. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Although <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been criticized, it has not been overruled and we must follow it. <em>See Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1316 n. 3; <em>United States v. </em>Shelton, 400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[The Supreme Court\u2019s] conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d). </em>Under <em>AlmendarezTon-es, </em>the district court did not violate Harris\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence using his three prior violent felony convictions, although they were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Harris also contends that the government failed to establish a nexus between his rifle and interstate commerce. Harris argues that though the government demonstrated that the rifle traveled from Romania to Vermont to Florida, it provided no evidence that the gun had ever been bought or sold. According to Harris, his rifle therefore had no proven connection to interstate commerce. Therefore, Hams argues, the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. We review sufficiency of the evidence challenges <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The offense Harris was convicted of requires the government to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that \u201cany firearm or ammunition\u201d was \u201cpossessed] in or affecting commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 362, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1071, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (the government must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt). More specifically, the government must prove that \u201cthe firearm possessed traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\"><em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001) controls. In <em>Dwpree, </em>we held that \u201c \u00a7 922(g) requires only a minimal nexus to interstate commerce ... and by brandishing a firearm that was manufactured in California and found in his car [in Georgia], Dupree\u2019s actions satisfy this test.\u201d Here, the government presented uncontradicted testimony that the rifle was made in Romania, imported into Vermont, and found in Harris\u2019 track in Florida. Similarly, Harris\u2019 ammunition was manufactured in Illinois. Under <em>Dupree, </em>the government has proved a minimal but sufficient nexus to interstate commerce. <em>See </em>258 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Finally, Harris contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional on its face because although it states that felons may not \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u201d it fails to specify <em>interstate </em>commerce in that clause. Harris also argues that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional because Congress, in failing to require a <em>substantial </em>nexus to interstate commerce, acted outside of the scope of its Commerce clause powers. Harris failed to raise these constitutional objections before the district court, so we review them only for plain error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>121 F.3d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Harris\u2019 arguments drown in a flood of precedent. As Harris admits, we have specifically rejected both of his constitutional challenges to \u00a7 922(g), in <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265 (11th Cir.1997) (upholding \u00a7 922(g) against a facial challenge based on the absence of the word \u201cinterstate\u201d), and <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (rejecting the argument that \u00a7 922(g) must require a substantial effect on interstate commerce). <em>See also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not open to question.\u201d); <em>United States v. Chesney, </em>86 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir.1996) (\u201cIn accordance with the prior decisions of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits, we conclude that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional on its face under the Commerce Clause analysis used by the Supreme Court in <em>Lopez.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">None of Harris\u2019 arguments have merit. His conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">. Harris\u2019 arguments based on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) are not relevant because <em>Begay </em>explicitly addressed only \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (any felony that \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d), not \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (any felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d). Thus, the Supreme Court's holding that DUI was not a violent felony under clause (ii) has no bearing on whether statutoiy rape is a violent felony under clause (i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
