Belin\u2019s sentence was the statutorily mandatory minimum term. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the statutory mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 create unconstitutional disparities between offenses involving crack cocaine and those involving powder cocaine. Belin was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-22\">We review a criminal sentence for reasonableness, using the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Reasonableness review requires appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-25\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Belin\u2019s advisory guideline range, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sidered that range in conjunction with the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2006 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008), and adequately explained its reason for imposing sentence. <em>See United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). We recently held that \u201ca statutorily required sentence, ... is <em>per se </em>reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Farrior, </em>535 F.3d 210, 224 (4th Cir.2008) (emphasis in original). Moreover, the recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines have no effect on the constitutionality of the statutory mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 573, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), after the amendments, \u201csentencing courts remain bound by the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed [by statute].\u201d We conclude that Beliris sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Belin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
