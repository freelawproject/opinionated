Shadur, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b345-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Page\u2019s long-term disability plan imposed a 24-month limitation on benefits for conditions \u201ccaused by, or contributed to by,\u201d anxiety disorders, mental illness, or depressive disorders, among other things. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Page\u2019s \u201ccondition was caused by or contributed to by anxiety, depression and/or mental illness\u201d is not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6); <em>Deegan v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>167 F.3d 502, 509 (9th Cir.1999). Doctors Sperling, Yamane, Gill, Benincasa, and Mekjian all concluded that Page was disabled, at least in part, as a result of mental illness or depression. Although Page places particular weight on Mekjian\u2019s report, that report likewise concluded that Page was disabled due to both psychiatric and neuropsychological conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">In reaching its conclusion, the district court did not err in giving little weight to medical opinions regarding Page\u2019s physical conditions that were predicated on Page\u2019s self-reported symptoms. The district court adopted this approach because it found that her \u201csubjective complaints are inconsistent and lack credibility\u201d and that \u201c[t]he medical records contained only minor objective findings.\u201d These findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">In light of the district court\u2019s findings, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that LINA\u2019s decision to terminate Page\u2019s benefits after 24 months did not violate the terms of the long-term disability plan under either a de novo or an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Because we would reach the same conclusion under either standard of review, we need not address the question whether the de novo or abuse-of-discretion standard of review is applicable. Nor need we address Page\u2019s argument that she was entitled to de novo review because LINA\u2019s conduct in administering her claim was inappropriate, or her argument that the district court erred in denying her discovery requests to obtain further information about LINA\u2019s claims processing procedure. \u201cIf de novo review applies, no further preliminary analytical steps are required. The court simply proceeds to evaluate whether the plan administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>correctly or incorrectly denied benefits, without reference to whether the administrator operated under a conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Insur. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir.2006). Nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008) (which <em>Abatie </em>anticipated as to the conflict-of-interest analysis) is at odds with this simplifying approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b345-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
