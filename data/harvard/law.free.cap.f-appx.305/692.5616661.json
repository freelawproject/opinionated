Lamb denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yu Hui Chen, </em>No. A 98 349 174 (B.I.A. Mar. 4, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 349 174 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 30, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination, <em>see Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">As an initial matter, Chen failed to raise any claim based on his illegal departure from China before the agency, and the government raises that failure before this Court. Accordingly, we decline to address this unexhausted issue. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20, 124 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on material inconsistencies regarding the date of the sole incident underlying Chen\u2019s claim \u2014 his arrest and subsequent beating in detention. <em>See Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95. As the IJ found, Chen\u2019s testimony concerning the date of his arrest was both internally inconsistent and inconsistent with his asylum application. Before this Court, Chen does not contest that those inconsistencies exist; instead, he argues that the IJ erred in relying on those inconsistencies. Chen explains that he was confused during his testimony and was unable to understand the questions asked of him due to his limited education and the traumatic memories of what happened to him. Because Chen did not assert before either the IJ or BIA that he did not understand the questions asked of him due to a lack of education or his traumatic memories, we decline to consider those unexhausted arguments. <em>Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The IJ properly gave diminished weight to the affidavits of Chen\u2019s friend and sister because they are unauthenticated and did not mention the date of Chen\u2019s arrest. Contrary to Chen\u2019s argument, the IJ is not precluded from giving these affidavits little weight because the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the IJ. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). Also contrary to Chen\u2019s assertion, the IJ did not err in relying on those omissions in Chen\u2019s corroborating evidence to support the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Surinder Singh v. BIA, </em>438 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Additionally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that even though Chen submitted a document corroborating the date of his ai\u2019rest, the document could not overcome the inconsistencies in Chen\u2019s testimony concerning the date of his arrest. <em>See Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95. Although inconsistencies need not be fatal if minor and isolated, the inconsistencies here concern the date of the sole incident underlying his claim for asylum. <em>Cf. Diallo v. </em>INS, 232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). Chen\u2019s testimony concerning the date of that incident changed throughout the course of his testimony, eventually identifying three separate dates spanning a period of approximately one year. These inconsistencies call into question whether the arrest occurred at all. <em>See Jin Yu Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>413 F.3d 188, 190 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>3 (2d Cir.2005) (finding alien\u2019s testimony to be \u201cso obviously dubious\u201d where alien initially testified to her daughter being born on April 28, 1982, \u201cthen stated that the child was born in 1998 and subsequently said that her daughter was born in 1993 before finally settling on 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Because the only evidence that Chen would be persecuted or tortured depended on his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
