In 2002, Gunawan filed an asylum application which was referred to the Immigration Court. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear charging Gunawan with being subject to removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for overstaying his travel visa. He conceded removability. In seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), Gunawan claimed that he and his family were persecuted in the past and plausibly feared future persecution in Indonesia on the basis of his Chinese ethnicity and Christian religion. On August 22, 2005, the Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denied relief based on a review of the testimonial record and documentary evidence, including the testimony and submissions of the expert witness, Jeffrey Winter, Ph.D., and the 2004 Country Report. The IJ concluded that Gunawan failed to demonstrate that he suffered past persecution or that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. On March 12, 2007, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. On April 1, 2007, Gunawan filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA, which the BIA denied on June 13, 2007. Gunawan then filed a petition for review on July 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">As a threshold matter, we address the government\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s March 2007 decision because Gunawan failed to file a timely petition for review as to that order. Gunawan did not address this jurisdictional issue in his opening brief, and he has not filed a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">A petition for review must be filed not later than thirty days after the date of a final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>McAllister v. Attorney General, </em>444 F.3d 178, 185 (3d Cir.2006). Gunawan\u2019s petition for review was filed on July 13, 2007, well beyond the thirty-day deadline for filing a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 12, 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Gunawan\u2019s petition for review <em>is </em>timely as to the BIA\u2019s June 13, 2007 decision denying reconsideration. That the petition is timely as to the June 2007 decision, however, does not cure the jurisdictional defect with respect to Gunawan\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s earlier decision. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (deportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely manner after issuance, regardless of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider). Thus, we conclude that Gunawan\u2019s petition for review is untimely as to the BIA\u2019s March 12, 2007 decision and we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Next, the government argues that although the petition for review was timely filed as to the BIA\u2019s June 2007 order denying reconsideration, Gunawan has waived his appeal of the June 2007 BIA order because he failed to raise any issue in his brief with respect to the denial of reconsideration. We agree that we are not in a position to review the order of the BIA denying Gunawan\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Under Rule 28, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, \u201cthe appellant is required to list the issues raised on appeal and present an argument in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>them.\u201d <em>Nagle v. Alspach, </em>8 F.3d 141, 143 (3d Cir.1993). Pursuant to Rule 28, \u201cthe argument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them.... \u201d Rule 28(a)(9), Fed. R.App. P. In his brief, Gunawan failed to identify the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration as an issue in his statement of issues and provided no written argument regarding the denial. Accordingly, he has abandoned and waived the issue. <em>Nagle, </em>8 F.3d at 143. (\u201cWhen an issue is either not set forth in the statement of issues presented or not pursued in the argument section of the brief, the Appellant has abandoned and waived that issue on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
