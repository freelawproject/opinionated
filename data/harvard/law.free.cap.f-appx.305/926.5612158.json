Following a capital sentencing hearing before a North Carolina jury, Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of Joyce and to life imprisonment for the murder of Caroline. After unsuccessfully challenging his death sentence on direct appeal and in state post-conviction proceedings, Davis filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 2006). Because the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>of established Supreme Court precedents, nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">In May 1996, Phillip Davis brutally murdered his aunt, Joyce Miller, and seventeen-year-old cousin, Caroline Miller, in the home they shared in Asheville, North Carolina. Two foster children, ages two and four, were present in the home when Joyce was murdered. Davis was eighteen years old and a senior in high school at the time. The circumstances of the crimes, and the events leading up to them, are described in detail in the opinion of the North Carolina Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\">Approximately one week before the murders, [Joyce] told her brother, Billy Davis that she was missing $800.00. Caroline believed that defendant had taken the money because he had recently purchased clothing and a gold chain. [Joyce] obtained a receipt for the clothes and returned them. Caroline was hiding the gold chain from defendant so that she and [Joyce] could take it to a pawn shop. Several days before the murders, defendant stated to Caroline, \u201cWell, if I don\u2019t get my chain, it\u2019s only going to hurt you in the long run.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-7\">On 24 May 1996, defendant shot and killed his cousin Caroline. On the same day, he killed [Joyce] by shooting her and cutting her with a meat cleaver. [Billy] Davis visited [Joyce\u2019s] home in the evening and found [Joyce] lying in a pool of blood. Niconda Briscoe, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, arrived at approximately the same time as [Billy] and called for emergency assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-8\">A paramedic with the Buncombe County Emergency Medical Service arrived at the Miller residence at 7:32 p.m. He noted blood smeared on the outside of the door. He discovered severed fingers on the floor in the foyer and [Joyce\u2019s] body in a large pool of blood. The two foster children were in the living room looking into the foyer. As the paramedic entered the living room to escort the children out, he observed Caroline in her bedroom on the bed. After checking her pulse, he determined that she, too, was dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-10\">Meanwhile, between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m., defendant attempted to cash a check in the amount of $360.00, bearing the name of [Joyce\u2019s] former husband, at the Bi Lo grocery store on Henderson-ville Road. The manager refused to cash it, as she did not believe it was legitimate. According to the manager, defendant appeared to be \u201creally calm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-11\">At approximately 8:00 p.m., defendant went to Dillard\u2019s in the Asheville Mall and tried on clothing in the men\u2019s department. The sales receipt showed that defendant purchased six clothing items at 8:08 p.m. for $231.61 using a credit card in [Joyce\u2019s] name. When questioned by the cashier, defendant told her that the credit card belonged to his aunt and that she knew he was using it. Two of the items defendant purchased were identical to the ones [Joyce] had returned several days prior to the murders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-12\">At 8:21 p.m., a driver for the Blue Bird Cab Company was dispatched to the Amoco station on Hendersonville Highway. A person matching defendant\u2019s description approached the driver and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019ll be with you in a couple minutes.\u201d He returned with two bags and asked the driver to take him to Pisgah View Apartments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-13\">Defendant entered unit 29-D of Pisgah View Apartments; showed an acquaintance, Felicia Swinton, the clothes he had purchased; changed clothes; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>left to attend a party in West Asheville. He spent approximately twenty minutes in Swinton\u2019s apartment and acted \u201cnormal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\">Kendall Brown and Ryan Mills, friends of defendant\u2019s, heard that [Joyce] and Caroline had been murdered and went to the party to pick up defendant. During the ride back to the Miller residence, defendant asked Brown if it \u201cwas ... true about the murders\u201d and said he \u201cwanted to know what all had happened.\u201d When they arrived at the residence, defendant sat on the curb; started crying; and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t let them take me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-6\">Later that evening, Sergeant David Shroat took a statement from defendant at the Asheville Police Station. Defendant first told Sergeant Shroat that he did not know what had happened; then blamed others; and finally stated, \u201cMy life is over; I did it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">Defendant described the following series of events to the detectives. Earlier in the week, defendant found a gun in the closet and test-fired it in the back yard. At approximately 5:30 p.m. on 24 May 1996, he entered Caroline\u2019s bedroom with the gun in order to get his clothes. Caroline was lying on her bed. He went to the right side of the bed, pointed the gun at her, and fired twice. He then walked around to the other side of the bed and fired a third shot at her. After killing Caroline, defendant ate a sandwich and watched television. [Joyce] arrived at the residence at approximately 7:00 p.m. with the two foster children. When defendant heard her entering, he hid behind the door. After she entered, defendant shot her in the back. He shot [Joyce] only one time because he had \u201c[n]o more bullets.\u201d [Joyce] attempted to reach the telephone, but defendant pulled the cord from the receptacle. When she tried to leave the house, he took a meat cleaver from the kitchen and struck her with it ten or twelve times with his eyes closed as he stood on top of her in the foyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">Immediately thereafter, defendant placed his clothes in a white plastic garbage bag along with the meat cleaver. He took two VCRs, one from Caroline\u2019s bedroom and one from [Joyce\u2019s], and put them in another plastic bag along with [Joyce\u2019s] brown purse. He also took [Joyce\u2019s] black purse. At approximately 7:15 p.m., he placed the two plastic bags on the front passenger floorboard of [Joyce\u2019s] vehicle. Defendant then drove to the Asheville Mall, where he used [Joyce\u2019s] credit cards to purchase clothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">From the Asheville Mall, defendant drove to Oak Knoll Apartments and placed the two plastic bags in the Dumpster. He then drove to the Amoco station, where he threw the black purse and the gun into a wooded area behind the station. He told the taxi cab driver whom he had called that he would be there in a minute, returned to [Joyce\u2019s] vehicle, and retrieved the shopping bags containing the clothing he had purchased at Dillard\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-11\">Defendant left [Joyce\u2019s] vehicle at the Amoco station and traveled in the taxi to Pisgah View Apartments, where he changed clothes. He then put the stolen credit cards and keys to [Joyce\u2019s] vehicle in a garbage can near Swinton\u2019s apartment. Defendant drove around downtown Asheville with his friend Kelby Moore and smoked marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-12\">At 10:30 p.m., defendant arrived at the party in west Asheville. Defendant danced for a while at the party before Brown and Mills took him to [the Miller] residence. Upon completing his state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>ment, defendant went to sleep under the table in the interview room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">The autopsy of [Joyce] revealed that she had a single gunshot wound to the left side of the head, amputation of two fingers, and fifteen individual and clustered injuries consistent with being inflicted by a meat cleaver. The autopsy of Caroline revealed three separate gunshot wounds, one to the head with stippling around the entrance wound indicating a close range shot; one to the chest; and one to the arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">Investigators found that Caroline\u2019s bedroom was in disarray and that a VCR and television were missing. A large amount of cash and some jewelry were discovered in a book bag in Caroline\u2019s room. In [Joyce\u2019s] bedroom, drawers had been pulled out and items had been dumped on the bed. Investigators found an empty jewelry box, a checkbook, and a box of checks on the floor. A second VCR was missing from the entertainment center in Miller\u2019s bedroom. Miller\u2019s truck, a red Bravada, was also missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">Police officers recovered two VCRs, jewelry, clothes, a bloody meat cleaver, and a brown purse containing [Joyce\u2019s] bank cards from a Dumpster at the Oak Knoll Apartments. Additionally, they found [Joyce\u2019s] credit cards in a trash bag near Pisgah View Apartments. [Joyce\u2019s] Bravada truck, two gloves, a black purse, and a Colt .32 revolver with five spent casings in the cylinder were discovered near the Amoco station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-9\"><em>State v. Davis, </em>353 N.C. 1, 539 S.E.2d 243, 251-53 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Davis pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. At the conclusion of the capital sentencing proceeding, the jury recommended a sentence of death for the murder of Joyce, based upon the following aggravating circumstances: (1) that the murder was committed by Davis while he was engaged in the commission of armed robbery; (2) that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain; (3) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; and (4) that the murder was part of a course of conduct that included the commission by Davis of other crimes of violence against other persons. At least one juror found fifteen of fifty submitted mitigating circumstances, but no juror found the existence of the submitted mitigating circumstance that Davis had shown remorse for his conduct and had asked for his family\u2019s forgiveness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found the mitigating circumstances insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>outweigh the aggravating circumstances, and recommended a sentence of death for the murder of Joyce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">On appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and imposition of the death sentence for the murder of Joyce, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Davis initiated state post-conviction proceedings in May 2002, which were denied in December 2003, and the North Carolina Supreme Court denied certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Davis thereafter filed his \u00a7 2254 petition for federal habeas relief. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the petition be denied. The district court agreed and issued an opinion denying relief, but granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence of various correspondence Davis mailed to his mother while he was awaiting trial. We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the trial court erred in submitting, as separate aggravating circumstances, that Joyce\u2019s murder was committed in the course of an armed robbery and for pecuniary gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas relief on the basis of a state court record <em>de novo. See Tucker v. Ozmint, </em>350 F.3d 433, 438 (4th Cir.2003). However, because the state court adjudicated Davis\u2019s claims on the merits, we review the matter in light of the limits on federal habeas review of a state conviction that are imposed by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d). When a habeas petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d we may not grant relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">A state court\u2019s decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under \u00a7 2254(d) where it \u201capplies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth\u201d by the United States Supreme Court or \u201cconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [that] precedent.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Factual determinations made by the state court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and \u201c[t]he appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>cant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Finally, even if constitutional error occurs, habeas relief will only be granted if the trial error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[i]f we are in \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to the harmlessness of an error, the habeas petitioner must prevail.\u201d <em>Fullwood v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 663, 679 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 436, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995)). Such \u201c\u2018[gjrave\u2019 doubt exists when, in light of the entire record, the matter is so evenly balanced that the court feels itself in \u2018virtual equipoise\u2019 regarding the error\u2019s harmlessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>513 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 992).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">We begin with Davis\u2019s claim that his constitutional rights were violated by the state court\u2019s denial of his motion to admit, as mitigating evidence, correspondence that Davis sent to his mother, Phyllis Davis, while he was incarcerated and awaiting trial for the murders of Joyce and Caroline.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Davis did not testily during the sentencing proceeding, but he called a number of family member's and friends, as well as Dr. Jerry Noble, the clinical psychologist who evaluated Davis for trial, to offer testimony in mitigation. The evidence included testimony about Davis\u2019s difficult childhood, his mother\u2019s drug abuse and criminal activity, her accompanying absence and neglect during Davis\u2019s childhood, and Davis\u2019s efforts and successes in overcoming this troubled childhood. There was also testimony about the difficulties Davis had experienced while living with Joyce and Caroline, and his remorse for having murdered them. The North Carolina Supreme Court summarized the mitigating evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-12\">Defendant\u2019s mother was a drug addict, habitual felon, and mental patient who could not care for him, and his father took no responsibility for him. Since his childhood, defendant alternated between the homes of friends and relatives because his mother was periodically incarcerated or incapacitated. Defendant was a good athlete, but his parents never attended his athletic or school events. When he was thirteen years old, defendant sustained a closed-head injury when he intervened in an argument between his mother and a drug addict, who hit defendant with a baseball bat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-13\">In the summer of 1995, defendant moved in with [Joyce] and Caroline and obtained a job at a Food Lion grocery store. He made the school football team and stopped working in September when football season began. Teammates described defendant as a leader and a hard worker. In December of 1995, defendant began working as a bag boy at a Bi Lo grocery store where he was described as a good worker. Defendant\u2019s high school principal described him as a normal and well-behaved student. Defendant was \u201con track\u201d to graduate from high school, was accepted into North Carolina A &amp; T State University, and had passed an Air Force entrance test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>There was constant rivalry between defendant and Caroline to the extent that Caroline packed up defendant\u2019s belongings on more than one occasion. There was also tension between defendant and his aunt. On one occasion, [Joyce] pointed a pistol at defendant and said that when she gave him an order, \u201cshe expected it to be done.\u201d Witnesses described defendant as remorseful and noted that he cried whenever he discussed the murders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">A clinical psychologist, Dr. Jerry Noble, testified as an expert witness. Dr. Noble performed a postarrest valuation and determined that defendant\u2019s basic psychological, emotional, and nurturing needs had been neglected. Defendant had an IQ of only 78, but he never repeated a grade or had any special-education classes. According to Dr. Noble, defendant had four significant mental disorders on 24 May 1996:(1) borderline intellectual functioning, (2) borderline personality disorder, (3) cannabis abuse, and (4) acute stress disorder. The borderline personality disorder caused defendant to be emotionally unstable and impulsive and to have difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Dr. Noble described defendant as anxious, depressed, immature, and prone to unravel during periods of stress. Defendant\u2019s conduct in eating a sandwich and watching television after he killed Caroline was consistent with acute stress disorder, disassociation, and derealization. According to Dr. Noble, defendant could not fully remember, did not understand, and was genuinely bewildered about [Joyce\u2019s] death. Following the homicides, defendant exhibited suicidal thoughts, increased interest in religion, and signs of remorse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-6\"><em>Davis, </em>539 S.E.2d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Phyllis Davis was one of the witnesses called to testify on Davis\u2019s behalf, and she offered extensive testimony of her neglect of Davis during his childhood, her absence from his life, and her drug abuse and criminal history. Most recently, Phyllis testified that she was arrested in April 1996 for violating her probation, approximately one month prior to Davis\u2019s arrest for the murders of Caroline and Joyce. She was sentenced to 300 days in a North Carolina prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">In October 1996, five months after Davis\u2019s arrest but before Phyllis was released from prison, Davis wrote the first of several letters to his mother. Some of the letters are postmarked during the time period that Phyllis was imprisoned, and others are postmarked after her release from prison in January 1997. In the letters, Davis wrote that he was sorry for what he had done and asked for forgiveness. He expressed interest and concern for his mother\u2019s well-being, as well as his love for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Davis attempted to introduce the content of the letters, both by having his mother read them and as separate exhibits, as additional mitigating evidence <em>\u201cto </em>show the relationship between Phillip Davis and his mother,\u201d J.A. 335, of his remorse for having murdered Joyce and Caroline, and to \u201ccorroborate [Phyllis\u2019s] testimony and the testimony of Dr. Noble.\u201d J.A. 833. The state objected to the letters as inadmissible, self-serving hearsay. Unlike hearsay testimony of statements made by a defendant in the presence of a testifying witness which are often admitted in capital sentencing proceedings, the state contended that the letters written by Davis were immune from any type of cross-examination and were without any indicia of reliability or trustworthiness that would counsel in favor of then- admissibility-</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>The trial court denied Davis\u2019s request that Phyllis be allowed to read the letters into evidence and to introduce them as separate exhibits, but the court allowed Phyllis to testify about their correspondence and her relationship with her son.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court noted that the letters were written by Davis after the murders and to his mother, a likely witness on his behalf, and that Phyllis \u201cwas unable to see [Davis] at the time the statements were written, and ... unable to make any observation as to his demeanor or attitude or any other conduct that he might be engaged in at the time he was writing the letter to her.\u201d J.A. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The trial court also ruled that the letters were cumulative to the testimony of several of the mitigation witnesses, including Phyllis. Phyllis testified that Davis had written her from jail, talked to her about his feelings, and \u201cwas very sorry for what he had done to our family.\u201d J.A. 353. Phyllis also testified that she was able to speak with Davis by telephone during this time period. She testified that Davis had difficulty talking about the murders and that he cried when he did speak of them. After her release from prison, Phyllis was also able to visit Davis once a month and to talk to him on the telephone between her visits. She testified that Davis was remorseful and that he would \u201cget[ ] upset if [she] sa[id] anything about Joyce or Caroline\u2019s name.\u201d J.A. 356. Davis would \u201cget real watery-eyed, which, in turn, ma[de her] cry, so [she] tr[ied] not to talk about it.\u201d J.A. 356. As noted by the trial court, Phyllis was allowed to \u201ctestify] without objection that [Davis] expressed his remorse to her in the same letters,\u201d and \u201cthat he had expressed remorse to her in conversations with her. She further testified that she had a loving relationship and that he said he had loved her.\u201d J.A. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">In addition to Phyllis, a number of additional witnesses, including family members and friends, testified about Davis\u2019s expressions of remorse after the murders. Davis\u2019s brother testified that he and Davis would cry together during his visits to the prison and that Davis had demonstrated that he was \u201csorry for what he\u2019s done.\u201d J.A. 746. Davis\u2019s aunt testified that Davis wrote her and \u201casked [her] and the rest of the family to please forgive him because that is something that he never meant to happen.\u201d J.A. 793. She \u00e1lso testified that Davis told her he was sorry for what he had done and that she believed he was remorseful. Davis\u2019s cousin testified that she also visited Davis and \u201cbelieved [Davis] [wa]s remorseful.\u201d J.A. 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Davis\u2019s friend, Ryan Mills, testified that when he and Davis got to the Miller home after the murders, Davis \u201csat down on the curb and cried.\u201d J.A. 223. Another friend testified that Davis cried during their telephone call, \u201cstated he wished he had not done what he had done that night,\u201d and \u201cwas very upset about it.\u201d J.A. 121. Colonel Roy Parker, a teacher at Davis\u2019s high school, testified that Davis \u201cwas in tears\u201d when they visited. J.A. 525. Parker testified that Davis \u201cseemed to be very saddened by what he had done and everything else associated with it, as you would expect from somebody in that position.\u201d J.A. 525. Sandra Darity, whom Davis described as a second mother to him, testified that Davis wrote her that \u201chis mother is sticking with him now when he needs her most,\u201d J.A. 702, and \u201cthat he loves her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>for that,\u201d J.A. 703. He also told Darity that he was praying for her and her family, asked Darity to pray for him, and told Darity that he was \u201cstill the same Phillip that used to spend the night all the time. I can\u2019t believe I did this.\u201d J.A. 703. He also told Darity that \u201c T made a mistake by putting myself here, but a good mother might have helped prevent it, also.\u2019 \u201d J.A. 705. Davis\u2019s former principal, Richard Green, testified that he visited Davis two or three times and each time Davis told him that he was sorry for what he had done and \u201cappeared to be remorseful.\u201d J.A. 829. Green testified that he \u201csincerely th[ought] [Davis was] remorseful over what happened to Caroline and Joyce Miller.\u201d J.A. 832. Reverend Carson Moseley also talked to Davis about the murders and testified that \u201c[w]henever [Davis] talks about what happened, it\u2019s with tears. He\u2019s very emotional at that point, so there\u2019s not a lot of talk about it other than I believe regret [is] in his heart. Very emotional whenever we\u2019ve spoken about it.\u201d J.A. 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Finally, Dr. Noble testified that he saw \u201csigns of remorse\u201d in Davis, as well as mental disorders consistent with one who \u201cfeels guilt, anxiety, depression, remorse about his actions.\u201d J.A. 649. Dr. Noble testified that Davis had problems with \u201csuicidal thinking since the homicides\u201d and \u201csome trouble with sleep, with nightmares, with instrusive detailed images about these deaths.\u201d J.A. 649. He saw \u201csigns of remorse in his increased interest in religious pursuits,\u201d \u201ca statement to police of remorseful emotions,\u201d and \u201cindications of remorse in some of his test results.\u201d J.A. 649. Dr. Noble also read to the jury the responses given by Davis that Dr. Noble believed were indicative of remorse, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-6\">\u201cI want to know how I got myself into such a mess.\u201d \u201cI regret even being born.\u201d \u201cI feel that my life is over.\u201d \u201cI suffer when I think or dream about what I\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve failed in life.\u201d \u201cWhat pains me is the thought of what I\u2019ve done, and I regret doing it.\u201d \u201cI wish I was never born.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">J.A. 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">On appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the letters from evidence because they lacked sufficient indicia of reliability and were cumulative of other evidence introduced by the defendant at trial. <em>See Davis, </em>539 S.E.2d at 260 (noting that \u201cwhile the rules of evidence do not apply in a sentencing proceeding, the trial judge still must determine the admissibility of evidence subject to general rules excluding evidence that is repetitive or unreliable\u201d); <em>see also State v. Raines, </em>362 N.C. 1, 653 S.E.2d 126, 137 (2007) (\u201c[W]hile the Rules of Evidence only serve as guidelines in capital penalty proceedings, the trial court may properly exclude hearsay statements which lack sufficient indicia of reliability or lack a proper foundation.\u201d). The court noted, for example, that Davis had presented evidence of his relationship with his mother and that a number of family and friends had testified that Davis \u201cconstantly cried and expressed remorse about what he had done when they visited him during his incarceration.\u201d 539 S.E.2d at 261. In addition, the court noted that there was \u201cevidence in the record that defendant frequently cried <em>during </em>the capital sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The court concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-12\">that the letters would have offered substantially the same evidence as the testimony of defendant\u2019s mother and other witnesses. Defendant was allowed to present to the jury evidence of remorse and of a loving relationship with his mother. In any event, the letters were unreliable in that they were written by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>defendant facing a capital sentencing proceeding to a likely witness in the proceeding. As such, we hold that the trial court properly excluded the letters as cumulative and unreliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-4\"><em>Id. </em>In the alternative, the court held that, \u201c[a]ssuming <em>arguendo </em>that the trial court erred in excluding the letters from evidence, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(b); <em>State v.

Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion), and its progeny. Davis also relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979) (per curiam), asserting that the state trial court erred in applying its evidentiary rules to exclude the letters as additional evidence of remorse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, in order to constitutionally impose a capital sentence, the sentencer may \u201cnot be precluded from considering <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d <em>Lockett, </em>438 U.S. at 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954. In <em>Lockett, </em>the Supreme Court declared an Ohio death penalty statute unconstitutional because it specified only three factors that could be considered by the sentencer in mitigation of the offense. <em>See id. </em>at 608, 98 S.Ct. 2954. In <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), the Court extended <em>Lockett </em>to a ease in which the state court refused to consider, as a matter of law, any mitigating evidence of the defendant\u2019s violent family history and abuse. <em>See id. </em>at 112-13, 102 S.Ct. 869. \u201cJust as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor,\u201d the Court held, \u201cneither may the sentencer refuse to consider, <em>as a matter of laiv, </em>any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 102 S.Ct. 869; <em>accord Skipper v. South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1, 6-8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (reversing imposition of death sentence where trial judge excluded as irrelevant evidence of the defendant\u2019s good behavior in jail awaiting trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">In <em>Green v. Georgia, </em>the Supreme Court held that that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may require the admission of mitigating evidence even if state law rules of evidence would exclude it. There, the Court reversed the death sentence based upon the trial court\u2019s application of Georgia\u2019s hearsay rule to prohibit a witness\u2019s testimony that the defendant\u2019s accomplice in the capital murder had confessed to shooting and killing the victim <em>after </em>ordering the defendant to run an errand. <em>See Green, </em>442 U.S. at 96-97, 99 S.Ct. 2150. In doing so, the Court held that \u201c[t]he excluded testimony was highly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial\u201d <em>and </em>that \u201csubstantial reasons existed to assume its reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150 (citing <em>Lockett, </em>438 U.S. at 604-05, 98 S.Ct. 2954). In particular, the Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-10\">[the accomplice] made his statement spontaneously to a close friend. The evidence corroborating the confession was ample, and indeed sufficient to procure a conviction of [the accomplice] and a capital sentence. The statement was against interest, and there was no reason to believe that [the accomplice] had any ulterior motive in making it. Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>haps most important, the State considered the testimony sufficiently reliable to use it against [the accomplice], and to base a sentence of death upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150. In light of \u201cthese unique circumstances,\u201d the Court held, \u201cthe hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Fullwood, </em>290 F.3d at 693 (noting that \u201cunder certain circumstances, \u2018the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <em>may </em>require the admission of mitigating evidence even if state-law rules of evidence <em>{e.g., </em>hearsay) would exclude it\u2019 \u201d) (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Boyd v. French, </em>147 F.3d 319, 326 (4th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">As we have previously held, however, neither <em>Lockett </em>and its progeny nor <em>Green </em>compel the conclusion that a state court is required to present a capital jury with <em>any </em>evidence the defendant proffers as mitigating, no matter how irrelevant, unreliable, or cumulative, or that a state\u2019s normal evidentiary rules must always yield to allow the introduction of such evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-7\">[T]he principles developed in <em>Lockett </em>and <em>Eddings </em>do not eviscerate all state evidentiary rules with respect to mitigating evidence offered in capital sentencing proceedings. For example, the application of the hearsay rule to exclude evidence offered in mitigation of the death penalty is clearly not a <em>-per se </em>constitutional violation. It is permissible to exclude on hearsay grounds mitigating evidence which is \u201conly [of] cumulative probative value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-8\"><em>Fullwood, </em>290 F.3d at 693 (citations and alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Buchanan v. Angelone, </em>103 F.3d 344, 348-19 (4th Cir.1996)); <em>see also Hutchins v. Garrison, </em>724 F.2d 1425, 1437 (4th Cir.1983) (\u201cWe find no indication that <em>Eddings </em>and <em>Lockett </em>preempt all state rules of evidence. Both cases speak about <em>types </em>of evidence, not evidentiary rules.\u201d); <em>cf. Lockett, </em>438 U.S. at 604 n. 12, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (noting that the opinion did not \u201climit[ ] the traditional authority of a court to exclude, as irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant\u2019s character, prior record, or the circumstances of his offense\u201d). In <em>Buchanan, </em>we explicitly rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court impermissibly excluded hearsay testimony offered by his expert mental health witness for the purpose of providing additional support for the conclusion that the defendant had acted under extreme emotional stress, because the expert\u2019s \u201ctestimony provided ample evidence to explain his opinion\u201d and \u201cthe statements would have had only cumulative probative value.\u201d 103 F.3d at 349. We also noted that the excluded testimony \u201clack[ed] the inherent reliability of the statement excluded in <em>Green,\u201d </em>which had been \u201cagainst the declarant\u2019s penal interest, made spontaneously to a close friend, and ... relied [upon by the state] to convict the declarant of capital murder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">In this case, the state court, having heard the testimony, observed the witnesses, and reviewed the letters, similarly ruled that the letters were cumulative to the ample other evidence of remorse. In addition, the court ruled that the letters, having been written by Davis while awaiting trial on the capital murder offenses and to his mother, a likely mitigation witness on his behalf, lacked the requisite reliability or trustworthiness to render them critical or admissible under its rules of evidence. We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s decision, as affirmed by the state appellate court, was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of the clearly established Supreme Court precedents discussed above, or that the state court\u2019s factual determination was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented to it. There was abundant testimony regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Davis\u2019s remorse and his relationship with his mother, much of which pertained to statements Davis made directly to the testifying witnesses who were in a position to evaluate his tone of voice and, in some cases, to observe his demeanor. Davis was not precluded from offering any type or category of mitigating evidence, and the letters were only of cumulative probative value. Additionally, the content of the letters, which is self-serving, does not rise to the level of the critical relevancy of the accomplice\u2019s confession in <em>Green, </em>nor bear upon its \u201cinherent reliability.\u201d <em>Buchanan, </em>103 F.3d at 349. Indeed, the Court in <em>Green, </em>in ruling that the accomplice\u2019s confession was improperly excluded there, plaeed decided emphasis upon the fact that the confession bore the very indicia of reliability that the state court found lacking in the letters offered in this case. <em>See Green, </em>442 U.S. at 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150. While we might have decided the question of reliability differently were we presented with it <em>ab initio, </em>we cannot say that the ruling of the state trial court was an unreasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Finally, we note that the North Carolina Supreme Court held that, even assuming error, the exclusion of the letters was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Davis, </em>539 S.E.2d at 261 (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(b) (\u201cA violation of defendant\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States is prejudicial unless the appellate court finds that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden is upon the State to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error was harmless.\u201d)). Applying the <em>Brecht </em>harmlessness standard applicable in federal habeas proceedings, the district court ruled that Davis had failed to show that the exclusion of the letters had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d on the outcome of Davis\u2019s sentence. <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (internal quotation marks omitted). We agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">As pointed out by the district court, the circumstances of Joyce\u2019s murder were particularly gruesome and the circumstances surrounding it, chilling. After killing Caroline, Davis ate a sandwich and watched television for an hour, lying in wait for Joyce to come home. When Davis heard Joyce approach, he hid behind the door and, as she entered her home, shot her in the back. As Joyce struggled to reach the telephone, Davis ripped the cord from the wall. Finding himself out of bullets, Davis then retrieved a meat cleaver from the kitchen and struck Joyce with it fifteen times to finish the task. And he did so in the presence of two young children whom Joyce had brought home with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">As also noted by the district court, \u201cDavis\u2019s actions in the immediate after<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>math of that murder appeared anything but remorseful.\u201d J.A. 1018. His first order of business was to go shopping with Joyce\u2019s money, checks, and credit cards, and, more specifically, to return to Dillard\u2019s to repurchase the items of clothing that Joyce had just returned and which had apparently brought about, at least in part, his murderous plan. With his purchases in hand, Davis then went to a friend\u2019s home to change clothes and show off his new purchases, all the while acting calmly and normally to those he encountered. He spent the remainder of the evening cruising, smoking marijuana with friends, and dancing at a nearby party until his friends found him and returned him to the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In contrast to this aggravating evidence, Davis\u2019s jury was presented with substantial evidence of Davis\u2019s difficult childhood, as well as his attempts to overcome this disadvantage and the assistance he received from family members in his attempts to do so. The jury also heard numerous accounts by friends, family members, and clergy, as well as the mental health professional who evaluated Davis, regarding Davis\u2019s personal expressions of remorse for having committed the murders. And, the jury was able to personally observe Davis\u2019s demeanor, including his crying during the proceeding. Ultimately, the jury found as an aggravating circumstance that the murder of Joyce was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious and cruel,\u201d an aggravating circumstance not submitted for Caroline\u2019s murder, and imposed the death sentence for Joyce\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Given the strength of the aggravating evidence presented in Joyce\u2019s case, compared to the relative weakness of the admitted and excluded evidence of Davis\u2019s relationship with his mother and of his remorse for the murder of his aunt, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Davis failed to demonstrate that the exclusion of the letters had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. Therefore, even if we assume that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the letters violated Davis\u2019s constitutional right to introduce mitigating evidence, he is not entitled to federal habeas relief as a result of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Davis\u2019s second argument arises from the trial court\u2019s decision to submit, as separate aggravating circumstances, that the murder of Joyce was committed while Davis was engaged in the commission of armed robbery, <em>see </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(5), <em>and </em>that the murder was committed by Davis for pecuniary gain, <em>see </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-2000(e)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">After murdering Caroline and Joyce, Davis stole two VCRs, the keys to Joyce\u2019s car, Joyce\u2019s purses containing bank cards and credit cards, and personal checks, and fled the scene with the stolen items in Joyce\u2019s vehicle. Within an hour, he attempted to cash a $360 check at a grocery store and purchased six items of clothing at a department store using Joyce\u2019s credit card. Some of those items of clothing were identical to those that Joyce had returned under the apparent belief that Davis had purchased them with money he had stolen from her. Davis then drove to Oak Knoll Apartments, where he discarded the VCRs in a dumpster, and to an Amoco gas station, where he abandoned the car and discarded his aunt\u2019s black purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Under North Carolina law, \u201cit is error to submit two aggravating circumstances when the evidence to support each is precisely the same,\u201d but \u201cwhere the aggravating circumstances are supported by separate evidence, it is not error to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>both to the jury, even though the evidence supporting each may overlap.\u201d <em>State v. East, </em>345 N.C. 535, 481 S.E.2d 652, 664 (1997). Based upon the evidence submitted in Davis\u2019s case, the trial court found that submission of both the armed robbery and the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstances was appropriate because each was supported by separate evidence. To further channel the jury\u2019s consideration of these aggravating circumstances, the court instructed the jury that the evidence regarding the checks, money, and credit cards could be considered for purposes of the pecuniary gain circumstance, whereas the evidence regarding the keys, vehicle, and VCRs could be considered for purposes of the armed robbery circumstance. The trial court rejected Davis\u2019s contention that this amounted to the impermissible submission of double or duplicative aggravating circumstances and, thereby, skewed the process in favor of death. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed, concluding that the two distinct aggravating circumstances presented were based upon sufficient, independent evidence and did not violate Davis\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Davis, </em>539 S.E.2d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In these proceedings, Davis does not claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the separate aggravating circumstances. Rather, Davis asserts that the state court arbitrarily divided the evidence so as to support the two separate aggravating circumstances and that this division did not represent different aspects of Davis\u2019s character or the circumstances of the crimes he committed that evening. Contending that the aggravating circumstances are duplicative, Davis argues that then- joint submission was the equivalent to submitting an <em>invalid </em>aggravating circumstance that unconstitutionally skews the weighing process in favor of death. <em>See Stringer v. Black, </em>503 U.S. 222, 232, 112 S.Ct. 1130, 117 L.Ed.2d 367 (1992) (\u201c[Wjhen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from death\u2019s side of the scale. When the weighing process itself has been skewed, only constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level suffices to guarantee that the defendant received an individualized sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">In <em>Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (plurality opinion), however, the Supreme Court declined the opportunity to equate duplicative aggravating factors to invalid aggravating factors. There, the defendant argued that two nonstatutory aggravating factors found by the jury were duplicative, vague and overbroad, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, the jury had unanimously found (1) victim impact evidence <em>(ie., </em>the victim\u2019s personal characteristics and the effect of the instant offense on her family); and (2) victim vulnerability evidence <em>(ie., </em>the victim\u2019s young age, her slight stature, her background, and her unfamiliarity with San Angelo, Texas). Because personal characteristics necessarily included those things included in the victim vulnerability charge, the defendant argued that charging both impermissibly skewed the process in favor of a death sentence. In rejecting the challenge, a plurality of the Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOv\">We have never before held that aggravating factors could be duplicative so as to render them constitutionally invalid, nor have we passed on the \u201cdouble counting\u201d theory that the Tenth Circuit advanced in <em>[United States v.] McCullah[, </em>76 F.3d 1087 (10th Cir.1996) ] and the Fifth Circuit appears to have followed here. What we have said is that the weighing process may be impermissibly skewed if the sentencing jury considers an <em>invalid </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>factor. <em>See Stringer v. Black, </em>508 U.S. 222, 232, 112 S.Ct. 1130, 117 L.Ed.2d 367 (1992). Petitioner\u2019s argument (and the reasoning of the Fifth and Tenth Circuits) would have us reach a quite different proposition \u2014 that if two aggravating factors are \u201cduplicative,\u201d then the weighing process necessarily is skewed, and the factors are therefore invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGX\"><em>Id. </em>at 398, 119 S.Ct. 2090 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). However, the plurality declined to answer the question of whether duplicative factors, as opposed to an invalid factor, necessarily skew the process in favor of death. Rather, it ruled that \u201cthe factors as a whole were not duplicative \u2014 at best, certain evidence was relevant to two different aggravating factors\u201d and that \u201cany risk that the weighing process would be skewed was eliminated by the District Court\u2019s instruction that the jury should not simply count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors and reach a decision based on which number is greater but rather should consider the weight and value of each factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399-400, 119 5. Ct. 2090 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Here, the trial court relied upon North Carolina law, which allows the submission of aggravating circumstances that are supported by separate evidence, <em>see East, </em>481 S.E.2d at 664, and submitted both aggravating circumstances to the jury with the appropriate explanation. In addition, the trial court specifically instructed the jury not to merely add up the number of aggravating circumstances against the number of mitigating circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-8\">You should not merely add up the number of aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances. Rather, you must decide from all the evidence what weight to give to each circumstance and then weigh the aggravating circumstances so valued against the mitigating circumstances so valued, and finally determine whether the mitigating circumstances are insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">J.A. 884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Given the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jones, </em>we cannot say that the state trial court\u2019s decision to submit both the pecuniary gain circumstance and the armed robbery circumstance was contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, we do not view the aggravating circumstances as duplicative. Although in some cases the evidence may only be susceptible of the conclusion that an armed robbery was attempted or effectuated for pecuniary gain, pecuniary gain is not an element of the offense of robbery and armed robbery is not necessarily synonymous with a goal of achieving pecuniary gain. Indeed, there are a number of scenarios in which material items may be taken in the course of an armed robbery and murder for reasons wholly unrelated to the desire for pecuniary gain, such as to escape, avoid detection, or implicate another person in a murder. In this case, the evidence was clearly susceptible to the conclusion that there were, in fact, two independent aggravating circumstances: Davis took the car and VCRs (which were quickly abandoned) <em>not </em>for pecuniary gain, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>to make the murders appear to be related to a random armed robbery or to implicate others (which he, in fact, attempted to do when he was questioned by the police), whereas Davis\u2019s immediate attempts to cash a check and his use of Joyce\u2019s credit card to purchase clothing were consistent with a separate intent to benefit financially from his crime. While there may be some overlap, the aggravating circumstances were sufficiently independent to justify separate submissions to the jury for its consideration. Here, the trial court divided the evidence in accordance with state law. However, as was the case in <em>Jones, </em>\u201cat best, certain evidence was relevant to two different aggravating factors\u201d and \u201cany risk that the weighing process would be skewed was eliminated by the District Court\u2019s instruction that the jury should not simply count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors and reach a decision based on which number is greater but rather should consider the weight and value of each factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399-400, 119 S.Ct. 2090 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Accordingly, Davis is not entitled to federal habeas relief on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the state. Because the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of established Supreme Court precedents, nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court, Davis is not entitled to federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">. The mitigating circumstances found were (1) that Davis\u2019s age was mitigating; (2) that Davis pleaded guilty with no plea agreement or promise of leniency; (3) that Davis cooperated and disclosed the location of the physical evidence associated with the crimes; (4) that Davis's mother suffered from major depression and drug addiction, so as to render her a neglectful and frequently absent parent throughout Davis's childhood and teenage years; (5) that as a consequence of his mother\u2019s drug addition, Davis never received any long-term and stable nurturance from his mother; (6) that Davis was aware of his mother\u2019s illegal activities, including larceny, shoplifting, and the purchase and sale of illegal drugs; (7) that Davis\u2019s mother did not provide proper supervision and guidance for him during his formative years; (8) that both of Davis\u2019s grandparents died within one year of each other when Davis was 16 years of age; (9) that after the death of his grandparents, no person was ever granted legal custody of Davis; (10) that Davis was on track to earn his high school diploma; (11) that Davis was accepted by North Carolina A &amp; T University; (12) that at the end of his senior year, Davis had applied and been accepted to become a member of the United States Air Force; (13) that Davis never had any permanent or even long-term relationship with an appropriate male role model; (14) that Davis has friends and family members who still love and support him; and (15) that Davis had a borderline personality disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-11\">. With regard to the murder of Caroline, the jury found as aggravating circumstances: (1) that the murder was committed by Davis while engaged in the commission of armed robbery; and (2) that the murder was part of a course of conduct in which Davis engaged that included the commission by Davis of other crimes of violence against other persons. As mitigating circumstances, one or more jurors found the same fifteen circumstances found in Joyce's case and, additionally, that Davis had no significant history of prior criminal activity, that Davis had signed a waiver of his constitutional rights and that Davis had a mental age of fifteen. The jury found that tire mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances, but that the aggravating circumstances were not sufficiently substantial to impose the death penalty when considered with the mitigating circumstances, and recommended a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\">. The correspondence consisted of both letters and cards with handwritten notes, all of which we refer lo as \u201cthe letters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. The trial court initially denied the request that Phyllis be allowed to read the letters into evidence, but reserved final ruling on the admissibility of the letters until the close of the defendant\u2019s case, at which point the trial court heard arguments and considered the matter in light of all the evidence presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\">. In his appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court, Davis acknowledged that he had only specifically argued that the letters were relevant \"to show and explain his relationship with his mother, to show remorse, and to corroborate Phyllis'[s] and other testimony,\" J.A. 934 (internal quotation marks omitted), but attempted to argue a host of additional reasons why the trial court should have admitted the evidence. The appellate court obviously rejected these eleventh-hour arguments, specifically noting that \"[i]n the present case, defense counsel [had] requested that [Phyllis] be allowed to read the letters to the jury and proffered the exhibits as evidence tending to show defendant\u2019s remorse and relationship with his mother,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>539 S.E.2d at 260, and ruling \"that the letters would have offered substantially the same evidence as the testimony of defendant\u2019s mother and other witnesses ... of remorse and of a loving relationship with his mother,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 261. Davis's similar attempts to expand his claim on federal habeas are barred and, in any event, we too have concluded that the exclusion of the letters, even if error, was harmless under the <em>Brecht </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">. Davis's reliance upon our decision in <em>United States v. Tipton, </em>90 F.3d 861 (4th Cir.1996), and its reliance upon the Tenth Circuit's decision in <em>McCullah </em>are misplaced. Our decision in <em>Tipton </em>predates the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones </em>and, in any event, we do not evaluate whether the state court\u2019s determination is contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>our </em>precedent in federal death penalty cases. <em>See Bustos v. White, </em>521 F.3d 321, 325 (4th Cir.2008). Rather, we review the ruling to determine whether the decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Supreme Court </em>precedent. <em>See id.; </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
