On December 15, 1987, Eric Christian, the administrator of Mr. Sewer\u2019s estate, filed an action to quiet title. Appellant Irwin A. Sewer intervened in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">In 1993, the parties reached a settlement agreement and stipulated to a judgment by consent. During the ensuing ten years, appellant filed successive and unsuccessful motions to invalidate and vacate that settlement and judgment. The order denying his 2003 motion was affirmed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">A magistrate judge was assigned to render a report and recommendation regarding implementation of the agreement and consent judgment. He issued a Report and Recommendation on January 26, 2005. Thereafter, the District Court denied appellant\u2019s objections and approved the Report and Recommendation. Its order of June 14, 2005, read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADi\">The Report and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge Geoffrey Barnard dated January 26, 2005 attached hereto as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is accepted and its recommendation approved in all respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-19\">The objections of Defendant Irwin Sewer are DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-20\">Parcel 6Q is to be divided in accordance with the aforesaid Report and Recommendation, as shown on survey map designated as OLG No. A9-625-T004, attached hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-21\">The Clerk of the District Court of the Virgin Islands is hereby directed to execute deeds of partition to the respective parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-22\">The deeds shall be prepared by Desmond L. Maynard, Esq., and submitted to United States Magistrate Judge Geoffrey W. Barnard for approval as to form and content, and then delivered to the Clerk of the District Court of the Virgins [sic] Islands for signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-23\">Desmond L. Maynard, Esq. shall also prepare such further documents as may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>be required to effect the terms of the within order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">App. at 26. The court\u2019s order thus finally resolved the boundary dispute and directed that deeds be executed in accordance with a specific survey map attached to the Report and Recommendation. Appellant did not appeal this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">On June 5, 2006, appellant, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion seeking to prevent the filing of the deeds the court had directed to be executed on the ground that \u201cCommissioners\u201d appointed by the District Court under a Virgin Islands statute should have performed the task that the court had assigned to the magistrate judge. This motion was denied by the District Court on December 27, 2007, and appellant filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Appellees suggest that the District Court\u2019s order of December 27, 2007, was not a final order and that we, accordingly, lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Given that this was a post-judgment order that does not contemplate any further court proceedings with respect to its subject matter, we conclude that it is a final order for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 15B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 3916 (2d ed. Supp.2006). Given the strictly ministerial nature of that order, however, it is difficult to conceive how there could be a legitimate ground for challenge. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe scope of appeal, however, should be restricted to the questions properly raised by the post-judgment motion; it should not extend to revive lost opportunities to appeal the underlying judgment.\u201d). Suffice it to say that the only challenges raised by appellant before us are challenges not to the order of December 27, 2007, but rather to the District Court\u2019s final order of June 14, 2005, which appellant failed to timely appeal. There is nothing that appellant has urged in this appeal that wasn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t have been urged prior to the District Court\u2019s order of June 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order of December 27, 2007, denying appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
