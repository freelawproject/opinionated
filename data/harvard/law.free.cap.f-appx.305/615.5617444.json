Kent and Jo challenge the sufficiency of their indictments and the evidence. Kent also challenges the calculation of the loss amount and the imposition of restitution, and Jo challenges the order of forfeiture. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The Hovinds owned and operated Creation Science Evangelism Enterprises, which sold videos and literature, provided lecture services, and hosted live debates. Between 1999 and 2003, the Hovinds withdrew from AmSouth Bank over one and a half million dollars in increments less than $10,000 to avoid federal filing requirements. Company documents and records of the transactions established that Jo controlled the finances of Evangelism Enterprises and controlled most of the checks that were cashed. Kent, who oversaw payroll and related federal tax obligations, failed to withhold or pay quarterly federal withholding taxes or file related documents with the Internal Revenue Service between 2001 and 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">The Hovinds were charged in a 58-count indictment. Kent was charged in the first twelve counts of the indictment for willfully failing to deduct and pay federal income and withholding taxes for employees of Evangelism Enterprises. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202. The Hovinds were charged in the next 45 counts for structuring cash withdrawals to avoid financial reporting requirements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a), 5324(a)(3), 5324(d); 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.11. Kent was charged in the last count of the indictment for obstructing the administration of internal revenue laws. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a). The indictment also included a provision for forfeiture by the Hovinds of \u201cany and all property, real and personal, involved in\u201d the financial reporting crimes \u201cand any property traceable thereto\u201d and, if that specific property could not be recovered, for \u201cforfeiture of any other property of [the Hovinds] up to the value of the ... property.\u201d Approximately two months after the court-imposed filing deadline, the Hovinds moved to dismiss their indictments. The district court denied the motions as untimely and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">After the government rested its case at trial, the Hovinds moved for an acquittal on each count of the indictment. Defense counsel argued that the government was required to prove for each count of structuring that the transaction equaled or exceeded $10,000 and, because the evidence established that each transaction was less than that threshold, the Hovinds were entitled to dismissal of those counts. The government responded that it had a \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d with the Hovinds\u2019 interpretation of the structuring statutes and argued that structuring necessarily requires a transaction under $10,000. The district court \u201cagree[d] with the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ment\u201d that the Hovinds\u2019 interpretation of structuring was contrary to the statutes and denied the Hovinds\u2019 motion. The court later referred to its decision on the motion and instructed defense counsel that they would \u201cnot be permitted\u201d to argue their interpretation of the structuring statutes. After discussion of the issue, defense counsel explained that they intended to argue that the government did not prove that the Hovinds structured each transaction to evade reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The Hovinds were found guilty of all charges. The jury found that $430,400 was involved in or traceable to the financial reporting crimes. The jury entered a special verdict against the Hovinds for the forfeiture of real and personal property attributable to the reporting crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Separate presentence investigation reports were prepared for Kent and Jo. Kent\u2019s report paired the first 12 counts of the indictment into one group and the next 44 counts into a second group. United-States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3D1.2(d) (Nov.2001). The report listed the offense level applicable to each group and selected the second group, which had the highest offense level of 22. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l); 3D1.3(b); 2S1.3. The base offense level was increased by 2 levels because the offense was part of a pattern of unlawful activity that involved more than $100,000 in a 12-month period, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2S1.3(b)(2), and increased another 6 levels for Kent\u2019s aggravating role in the crimes. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3Bl.l(a); 3C1.1. With a criminal history of I, the report provided a sentencing range between 97 and 121 months of imprisonment. The report calculated a tax liability, under the first twelve counts of the indictment, of $604,874.87. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5El.l(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Jo\u2019s presentence report listed a base offense level of 22. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l); 2S1.3. The report decreased the base level by 16 levels because Jo did not act with reckless disregard of the source of the funds and because the funds were the proceeds of lawful activity and were to be used for a lawful purpose, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.3(b)(2). With a criminal history of I, the report provided a sentencing range between 0 and 6 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Before Jo\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government moved to forfeit substitute property and requested the court substitute ten parcels of real property and a bank account belonging to Jo and Kent to satisfy the $430,400 judgment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p). The government attached to the motion an affidavit from Special Agent Charles Evans of the Internal Revenue Service. The affidavit stated that the agency could not find the $430,400 because the Hovinds had transferred the assets to a third party, expended the assets on business-related expenses, and removed the assets from the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">The district court found that the Hovinds had disposed of the assets subject to forfeiture and granted the motion of the government to substitute property. The district court entered a final order of forfeiture against Jo and sentenced her to one year and one day of imprisonment. The court sentenced Kent to 120 months of imprisonment and to supervised release of 3 years, and ordered Kent to pay restitution of $604,874.87.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">We apply three standards of review in this appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of an indictment. <em>United States v. Bobo, </em>344 F.3d 1076, 1082-83 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and view the evidence in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the government. <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). When an issue is not preserved for appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rubio, </em>317 F.3d 1240, 1241 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>jury instructions to determine \u2018\u201cwhether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Grigsby, </em>111 F.3d 806, 814 (11th Cir.1997)). We review for clear error the calculation of the amount of loss. <em>United States v. Machado, </em>333 F.3d 1225, 1227 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>the legality of the orders of restitution and of forfeiture. <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1275 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Kent and Jo Hovind raise multiple issues for our consideration. Their arguments fail. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\n<em>A. The Hovinds Indictments Were Sufficient.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">It is a well-established principle that \u201c \u2018[t]he sufficiency of a criminal indictment is determined from its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>438 F.3d 1257, 1263 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Salman, </em>378 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004)). \u201cFor an indictment to be valid, it must \u2018contain the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprise the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bobo, </em>344 F.3d 1076, 1083 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 763, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962)). When the indictment tracks the language of the statute, \u201c \u2018it must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense, coming under the general description, with which he is charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Russell, </em>369 U.S. at 765, 82 S.Ct. at 1048).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">The indictment sufficiently alleged Kent\u2019s tax crimes. Kent complains that his indictment omitted what part of Title 26 required him to collect and pay federal withholding taxes for employees of Evangelism Enterprises and failed to define how he acted \u201cwillfully,\u201d but these arguments fail. Kent was adequately notified of his offenses to prepare a defense and to plead double jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense. The indictment alleged that Kent violated Section 7202 of Title 26 and described Kent\u2019s responsibilities under the tax laws, explained Kent\u2019s failure to withhold and pay quarterly federal withholding taxes, and stated the taxable periods in which Kent incurred a tax liability. The government was not required to include specific statutory authority for Kent\u2019s tax liability or to allege facts regarding Kent\u2019s willfulness. <em>See United States v. Chisum, </em>502 F.3d 1237, 1244-45 (10th Cir.2007) (affirming as sufficient an indictment for tax evasion that omitted \u201cwhat part of Title 26 imposed the tax that was being evaded or defeated\u201d). <em>Cf. Huff v. United States, </em>273 F.2d 56, 58-59 (5th Cir.1959) (indictment for smuggling goods into the United States without an invoice was sufficient even without a reference to the statute that required invoicing or a factual description of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The indictment also sufficiently alleged the Hovinds\u2019 structuring crimes. The Hovinds argue that each of the structuring counts fails to state an offense because each count fails to allege that the Hovinds structured an amount that exceeded $10,000 and, without this allegation, the indictments were defective. The Ho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>vinds contend that the language used in the financial reporting statute did not suggest that structuring could involve a cash transaction of less than $10,000. These arguments ignore the plain language of the statute and our interpretation of it. A person is prohibited from \u201cstructuring] ... any transaction\u201d to \u201cevad[e] the reporting requirements!,]\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(a)(3), of domestic financial institutions. Those reporting requirements are activated upon the \u201cpayment, receipt, or transfer of United States coins or currency!,]\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a), \u201cof more than $10,000.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.22(b). In other words, section 5324(a)(3) fox-bids a person from transacting in amounts less than $10,000 to avoid detection by and reporting of the transactions by a financial institution. <em>United States v. Phipps, </em>81 F.3d 1056, 1060-61 (11th Cir.1996). That interpretation is also consistent with the intent of Congress for the structux-ing provision to \u201coperate! ] \u2018without regard for whether an individual transaction is, itself, reportable....\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1061 (quoting S. Rep. No. 433, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1986)). Because a cash transaction does not have to equal or exceed $10,000 to constitute a stracturing offense, the district court did not ex-r by denying the Hovinds\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Kent\u2019s indictment for obstructing administration of the tax laws also states an offense. Kent argues for the first time on appeal that the charge failed to state an offense because none of the acts listed, which included filing complaints against agents of the Internal Revenue Service and instituting bankx-uptcy and other legal proceedings against those agents, were corrupt. His argument misapprehends the definition of \u201ccorruptly.\u201d Acts that might otherwise be legal become corrupt and obstructionist when they are used to \u201cthwax-t the efforts of government officers and employees in executing the laws enacted by Congress.\u201d <em>United States v. Popkin, </em>943 F.2d 1535, 1540 (11th Cir.1991). The district court did not err, much less plainly err, by denying Kent\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>B. The Government Introduced Sufficient Evidence To Support the Hovinds\u2019 Convictions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The Hovinds challenge theix- convictions on three gx-ounds. First, Kent argues that his failure to withhold taxes was not willful. Second, the Hovinds argue that they did not know that section 5324(a)(3) prohibited a transaction of less than $10,000. Third, Kent argues that legal actions he instituted befox-e and during the investigation of the Internal Revenue Service were not corrupt and cannot support his conviction for obstruction of tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">1. Kent Refused To Comply With Laws To Collect And Pay Federal Withholding Taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Sufficient evidence establishes that Kent failed to collect or pay withholding taxes. Kent argues that the government failed to prove that he acted willfully absent evidence that Kent knew of the specific statutes that required him to collect and pay withholding taxes, but that argument fails. In <em>Cheek v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 201, 111 S.Ct. 604, 610, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991), the Supreme Court explained in a hypothetical that the government would satisfy the \u201cknowledge component of the willfulness requirement\u201d if it introduced evidence that the defendant knew of the \u201cduty purpox-tedly imposed\u201d by the tax laws, not that he knew which specific provision created that duty. <em>Id. </em>at 201-02, 111 S.Ct. at 610-11. When a defendant knows of facts constituting an offense, he has \u201cacted with the requisite willfulness to violate the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>500 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 196, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1947, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The government proved that Kent knew the tax laws required the collection and payment of withholding taxes, but he refused to comply. Employees of Evangelism Enterprises, peers, and legal counsel testified that Kent disputed the authority of the Internal Revenue Service based on the separation of the church and state, debated the interpretation and application of the withholding requirements, and intentionally characterized Evangelism Enterprises as a \u201cchurch\u201d and his employees as \u201cmissionaries\u201d to avoid tax obligations. Kent had opined to attorney David Gibbs that he was \u201csmarter\u201d than other church officials who had forfeited real property after they refused to collect or pay withholding taxes. Although Kent argued at trial that he was ignorant of the law and the Revenue Service failed to identify a law that required him to collect and pay withholding taxes, the jury was entitled to find that Kent knew about and deliberately violated the tax laws. <em>See United States v. Lankford, </em>955 F.2d 1545, 1550 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">2. The Hovinds Structured Transactions To Avoid Reporting Requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The government also proved that the Hovinds structured their cash withdrawals to avoid federal reporting requirements. Although the Hovinds challenge the validity of them convictions on the ground that the statute does not penalize transactions below $10,000, this interpretation does not comport with the language of the statute. Congress enacted Section 5324(a)(3) to penalize \u201cany transaction\u201d structured to \u201cavoid triggering [a] bank\u2019s duty to file a [Currency Transaction Report] in the first place.\u201d <em>Phipps, </em>81 F.3d at 1059-60. By its plain language, the statute prohibits transactions of less than $10,000 that are intended to evade reporting requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 1060-61. That reading comports with the regulations that define structuring to penalize cash transactions designed \u201cin any manner, ... including transactions ... below $10,000 ... for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements.... \u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.11(gg).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Evidence established that Kent and Jo Hovind structured cash transactions with knowledge of, and the intent to avoid, reporting of those transactions by Am-South Bank. <em>See United States v. MacPherson, </em>424 F.3d 183, 189 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cassano, </em>372 F.3d 868, 878 (7th Cir.2004). A former employee of Evangelism Enterprises, Brian Popp, testified that Kent knew of and complained about the bank reporting requirements and that Jo, often at Kent\u2019s direction, regularly obtained cash to pay employees of the organization. Other employees and associates of Kent testified that the Hovinds openly disputed the validity of the tax laws. Various documents established that Jo withdrew cash in increments of $9500 and $9600 from AmSouth Bank as often as four or five times a month, for a total of 45 transactions between July 2001 and August 2002. Viewing this evidence in a light favorable to the prosecution, the jury was entitled to find that Kent and Jo knew of the reporting requirements and structured cash transactions in amounts less than $10,000 to prevent AmSouth Bank from reporting the transactions. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>121 F.3d 615, 621 (11th Cir.1997) (willfulness \u201crequires proof of an intentional violation of a known legal duty\u201d); <em>In re Jacobs, </em>490 F.3d 913, 925 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c \u2018the conduct requirement is satisfied where a debtor engages in affirmative acts to avoid payment or collection of taxes\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>In re Fretz, </em>244 F.3d 1323, 1329 (11th Cir.2001))).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>3. Kent Obstructed the Investigation of His Tax Offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Substantial evidence established that Kent obstructed investigation of his tax offenses. A person is guilty of obstructing the administration of tax laws if he \u201ccorruptly\u201d acts to \u201cintimidate or impede any officer\u201d or to \u201cobstruct[], impede, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration\u201d of the tax laws. Kent filed complaints and sued agents of the Internal Revenue Service and instituted legal proceedings to circumvent the lawful seizure of his assets. This evidence supports the finding of the jury that Kent intended to impede agents of the Revenue Service in them efforts to investigate and prosecute Kent\u2019s violations of the tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\n<em>C. The District Court Did Not Err By Adding a Sentence to the Jury Instruction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">A district court is required to inform counsel before closing arguments how it intends to rule on proposed jury instructions. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(b). We require substantial compliance with Rule 30 and reverse for a violation of the rule only if the defendant establishes that he was prejudiced by the change in a jury instruction. <em>United States v. White, </em>27 F.3d 1531, 1538 (11th Cir.1994). Prejudice exists only if the defendant establishes that the modification of the instruction was substantial and repudiated or rendered ineffective his arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The Hovinds were not prejudiced by the change to the jury instruction. The district court did not substantially modify the instruction on structuring. In his closing argument, Kent Hovind used the original jury instruction in a manner that suggested that the government was required to prove that structuring required a cash transaction that equaled or exceeded $10,000. That jury instruction read,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">To structure a transaction means to deposit or withdraw or otherwise participate in a transfer of a total of more than $10,000 in cash or currency by or through a financial institution or bank by setting up or arranging a series of separate transactions, each involving $10,000 or less individually, thereby intentionally evading the currency reporting requirements that would have applied if the transaction had not been so structured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The district court added the last sentence of the regulation that defines structuring: \u201cThe transaction or transactions need not exceed the $10,000 reporting threshold at any single financial institution on any single day in order to constitute structuring....\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.11(gg). The district court was entitled to revise the jury instruction in this manner. <em>See Bender, </em>290 F.3d at 1284 (\u201cWe give the district court wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instructions, ascertaining that the instructions accurately reflect the law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">\n<em>D. The Hovinds Were Correctly Sentenced.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The Hovinds challenge their sentences on three grounds. First, Kent challenges the calculation of the tax loss. Second, Kent challenges his restitution. Third, Jo challenges the forfeiture of substitute property. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">Kent argues that the district court violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment when it calculated the tax loss attributable to his tax evasion charges, but the tax loss played no role in Kent\u2019s sentence. The district court used the offense level for Kent\u2019s structuring charges instead of the offense level for his tax charges to calculate Kent\u2019s sentence. Because the guideline range and sentence was the same regardless of the amount of tax loss, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>error in the calculation was harmless. <em>See United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1305 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Kent challenges his restitution on two grounds both of which fail. First, Kent argues that restitution was not a penalty for his crimes, but his argument ignores that the district court ordered restitution as a condition of Kent\u2019s supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3563, 3583(d). Second, Kent argues, without citation to any authority, that the Internal Revenue Service cannot be a victim, but Kent\u2019s argument overlooks that the Revenue Service, as the agency responsible for collecting taxes, is the only possible victim of tax evasion. <em>Cf. Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1361 (11th Cir.2005) (finding the government a \u201cvictim\u201d of tax evasion under immigration law). The district court did not err by ordering Kent to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Jo presents two challenges to the forfeiture of substitute property both of which fail. First, Jo argues that the amount of forfeiture was excessive and unconstitutional because the money was obtained legally and expended for business obligations of Evangelism Enterprises, but we disagree. The jury was entitled to find that the Hovinds structured transactions to avoid financial reporting laws and hide assets from the Revenue Service and a forfeiture of $430,400 was warranted to punish the Hovinds for their crimes. <em>See Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1279-80. Second, Jo argues that the district court erred by substituting property because the $430,300 could be traced to business-related expenses, but we again disagree. The district court was entitled to order the forfeiture of substitute property when the original property was \u201ctransferred ... or deposited with[] a third party.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p)(l)(B). The district court did not err by ordering a substitution of forfeiture property.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">IV.
