Koeltl of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Summary Order</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Plaintiff-appellant New York Community Bank (\u201cNYCB\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the United States Court for the Southern District of New York (Robinson, <em>J.), </em>affirming an order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Hardin, <em>J.) </em>granting Jerry W. Smith\u2019s motion to reopen his bankruptcy case and ordering NYCB to refund the sum of $44,912.71 to Smith. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">\u201cIn an appeal from a district court\u2019s review of a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, we conduct an independent examination of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>In re Flanagan, </em>503 F.3d 171, 179 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>In re Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>479 F.3d 167, 172 (2d Cir.2007)). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Id. </em>\u201cThe ultimate determination of whether or not to impose an equitable remedy ... is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179-80 (citing <em>Adelphia Bus. Solutions, Inc. v. Abnos, </em>482 F.3d 602, 607 (2d Cir.2007)). \u201cHowever, legal determinations upon which the dispensation of equitable relief may depend are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 180 (citing <em>In re First Cent. Fin. Corp., </em>377 F.3d 209, 213 (2d Cir.2004)). A bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to reopen should not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion, because that decision invokes the bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers. <em>See In re Chalasani, </em>92 F.3d 1300, 1307 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">A bankruptcy court has broad discretion to reconsider allowance or disallowance of proofs of claim under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(j) \u201cfor cause.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(j); see <em>also </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 3008. If reconsideration is granted, the court may allow or disallow the claim \u201caccording to the equities of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(j). Here, the bankruptcy court acted well within its discretion when it granted Smith\u2019s motion to reopen once it was brought to the court\u2019s attention that it had made a mathematical mistake with regard to the correct amount of NYCB\u2019s claim based on the inconsistent and unreliable figures supplied by NYCB. The bankruptcy court also acted within its discretion when it calculated the applicable interest rate by averaging the interest rates used in NYCB\u2019s proofs of claim. We have carefully considered NYCB\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
