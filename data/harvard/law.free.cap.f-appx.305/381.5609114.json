R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Orlando Antonio Grajales, his wife and two daughters, and Deison Bland\u00f3n and his wife, natives and citizens of Colombia, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the guerillas threatened petitioners and demanded money from them on account of a protected ground. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, the record does not demonstrate that the petitioners communicated a political opinion to the guerillas and the evidence does not compel a finding that the guerillas were motivated, even in part, by petitioners\u2019 political opinion. <em>Cf. Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 735-36 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, they have failed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">Because petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if they return to Colombia. <em>See Himri v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b408-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
