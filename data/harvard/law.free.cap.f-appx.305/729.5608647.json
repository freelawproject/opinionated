Mar. 21, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-22\">We ordinarily review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Here, however, the brief submitted by Petitioner\u2019s counsel waives any issue this court has the power to review. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 83-84 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-23\">In his motion to reopen, Petitioner argued that he received deficient representation from his former attorney because he failed adequately to review and present to the IJ, the supporting documentary evidence that Petitioner provided to him. The BIA found that his motion was untimely and declined to consider Petitioner\u2019s assertions that he received ineffective assistance from prior counsel where he failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his case. In his brief to this Court, however, Petitioner does not challenge the agency\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel finding, thereby forfeiting any such argument. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Wang argues instead that: (1) the agency erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it was not supported by substantial evidence; and (2) he suffered past persecution in China and country conditions there remain unchanged, such that he has a well founded fear of future persecution. To the extent these arguments address the IJ\u2019s 2000 decision and the BIA\u2019s 2003 order, we lack jurisdiction to review them. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">This is at least the fourth petition for review filed by Attorney Andre Sobolevsky which we have denied or dismissed because he waived all relevant arguments. <em>See, e.g., See Li Fang Liu v. Mukasey, </em>U.S.C.A. Dkt. No. 08-1310-ag; <em>Chun Qu Zhang, </em>U.S.C.A. Dkt. No. 08-0585-ag; <em>Bao Hua Xiao, </em>U.S.C.A. Dkt. No. 08-1244-ag. As we have previously, we therefore refer Attorney Sobolevsky to the Court\u2019s Grievance Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
