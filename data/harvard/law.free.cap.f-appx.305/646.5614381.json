After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In 2003, Gay pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), and distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). The district court imposed concurrent sentences of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. While Gay was serving his supervised release term, Gay\u2019s probation officer filed a petition to revoke Gay\u2019s supervised release because, <em>inter alia, </em>he had been arrested and charged with aggravated battery and false imprisonment of his girlfriend Diedre Carpenter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">At the revocation hearing, the district court heard testimony from Deputy Ricardo Alves (who responded to a domestic robbery complaint by Carpenter on the morning of March 8, 2008), Josepha Michelle Remon (Gay\u2019s probation officer), and Carpenter. The district court also reviewed both Carpenter\u2019s handwritten statement from March 8, 2008 detailing the domestic violence incident and Deputy Alves\u2019s pictures of Carpenter from March 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">The district court found that Deputy Alves\u2019s testimony was credible. The district court noted that Deputy Alves had testified to observing a slight swelling around Carpenter\u2019s right eye and found that the photographs were consistent with his testimony. The district court noted that it looked as though Carpenter had a slight swelling to the right of her eye, on her upper cheekbone. The district court also found that Carpenter\u2019s demeanor in front of Deputy Alves was consistent with being battered.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">The district court found that Carpenter\u2019s testimony was not credible, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word [Carpenter] said here today, other than the fact she confirmed what she wrote down.\u201d The district court noted that Carpenter now denied being pregnant or having told Gay that she was pregnant by another man, even though Carpenter and Gay made prior, contrary statements. The district court stated that it did not know whether Carpenter was in fact pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">The district court found that Gay had committed a domestic violence battery against Carpenter and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about it.\u201d However, the district court was unable to find aggravated battery because it did not know whether Carpenter was pregnant. The court also found that the false imprisonment charge was borne out by Carpenter\u2019s statements that Gay had not allowed her to leave the room, regardless of whether she left the residence every day. Thus, the district court found that Gay had violated the terms of his supervised release by committing these two crimes. The district court said it was not clear that Gay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>would be convicted of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, but the burden was \u201ca lot less\u201d in a revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The district court revoked Gay\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and 18 months\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Gay\u2019s supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deputy Alves testified that Carpenter told him that Gay questioned and beat her for six days after she told Gay that she was pregnant by another man. Deputy Alves\u2019s description of Carpenter\u2019s appearance when he interviewed her was consistent with Carpenter\u2019s domestic violence complaint. Deputy Alves testified that Carpenter was crying, appeared nervous, had a blanket or sheet wrapped around her, and moved in \u201ca very lethargic manner\u201d as if she was in pain. Deputy Alves also observed a \u201cslight swelling\u201d under Carpenter\u2019s right eye that he photographed. Carpenter\u2019s lack of other visible bruising was consistent with her statement to Deputy Alves that Gay beat her in places that would not show bruises, such as her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In addition to Deputy Alves\u2019s testimony, Carpenter wrote a detailed, sworn statement describing Gay\u2019s battery and imprisonment of her over a six-day period. Carpenter said that she told Gay she was pregnant, Gay continuously questioned her about the pregnancy, and Gay beat her in the face, head, and back when he did not like her answers. Carpenter said that she screamed for help and picked up the phone to call the police, but Gay stopped her. She also said that she tried to get out of Gay\u2019s room, but he picked her up and threw her across the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">It was within the province of the district court to assess the credibility of Deputy Alves and Carpenter as they testified. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). Although Carpenter recanted her prior statements that she told Gay she was pregnant and that Gay beat her, the district court was free to disbelieve her testimony at the revocation hearing and to believe instead Deputy Alves\u2019s testimony and Carpenter\u2019s prior written statement and statements to Deputy Alves. In light of Deputy Alves\u2019s testimony, Carpenter\u2019s written statement, and the photographs of Carpenter, the district court did not err in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Gay committed a battery against Carpenter and falsely imprisoned her against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Finally, Gay has not shown that the district court plainly erred in relying on Deputy Alves\u2019s testimony of the out-of-court statements made by Carpenter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to revocation hearings, district courts still must consider reliability and weigh \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right to confront <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>adverse witnesses against the grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation\u201d before admitting hearsay testimony. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 114 (11th Cir.1994). Here, Carpenter herself testified at the hearing, and Gay declined the opportunity to cross-examine her. Furthermore, Carpenter\u2019s statements to Deputy Alves and those written in her sworn statement were consistent and reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">For all the reasons above, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Gay\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-11\">. The petition also alleged that Gay violated the terms of his supervision by failing to submit monthly reports and to notify his probation officer about a change in residence. The district court found that Gay violated the requirement of submitting monthly reports but did not revoke Gay\u2019s supervised release on that basis. Thus, Gay does not challenge that violation on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">. A district court may \"revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of supervised release authorized by statute ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of This] supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). This Court reviews a district court's revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s findings of fact are binding unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b674-14\">. When an issue was not raised before the district court, this Court reviews for plain error only. <em>United States v. Heath, </em>419 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2005). Plain error exists if there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
