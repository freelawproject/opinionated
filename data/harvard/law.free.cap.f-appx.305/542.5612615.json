Thurmon Bell appeals the district court\u2019s March 29, 2007, Final Order of Dismissal and Order Denying All Pending Motions as Moot. Bell asserts the district court erred by applying \u00a7 95.11(2), Florida Statutes, Florida\u2019s five-year statute of limitations for \u201can action on a judgment,\u201d to bar Bell\u2019s effort to hold Appellees liable, as alter egos, for a debt arising under a 1997 judgment. Bell also asserts the district court erred by concluding Sylvia Reine was not subject to alter-ego liability or jurisdiction, and by declining to impose liability on Omni Construction, LLC (Omni LLC). Ronald Reine cross appeals the adverse rulings made against him, in the event we disagree with the district court\u2019s ruling as to the statute of limitations. After reviewing the record, reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">On January 13, 1997, the district court entered an amended final judgment on a jury verdict against Omni Construction of Mississippi, Inc. (Omni-Miss). OmniMiss ceased its operations and liquidated its assets around 1995, and Bell has yet to collect on the judgment. On November 5, 2002, Bell filed an emergency motion requesting the district court to \u201cfreeze\u201d monies about to be paid to Omni LLC. Although Bell\u2019s efforts to collect were eventually manifested in a 2006 motion for imposition of alter-ego liability, November 5, 2002, is the operative date for statute of limitations purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">We review a district court\u2019s determination regarding a statute of limitations <em>de novo. Atl. Land &amp; Improvement Co. v. United States, </em>790 F.2d 853, 857 (11th Cir.1986). Florida\u2019s statute of limitations provides, in relevant part, \u201c[a]n action on a judgment or decree of any court [other than for the recovery of real property], not of record, of this state or any court of the United States, any other state or territory in the United States, or a foreign country\u201d shall be commenced within five years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(2)(a). This statute has been applied to actions to enforce a judgment in Florida against the alleged alter ego of the judgment debtor. <em>See Turner Murphy Co. v. Specialty Constructors, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Inc., </em>659 So.2d 1242, 1243 (Fla. 1st DCA 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Applying \u00a7 95.11(2)(a), the statute of limitations ran on January 13, 2002, five years after the district court entered judgment against Omni-Miss. Bell filed his motion to enforce the judgment on November 5, 2002. Because Bell can point to no authority in disagreement with <em>Turner Murphy, </em>his attempt to impose liability on Appellees is barred by \u00a7 95.11(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-14\">. Because the district court correctly concluded Fla. St. \u00a7 95.1 l(2)(a) barred Bell\u2019s claims, we do <em>not </em>reach the other arguments raised by Bell, or the issues raised on cross-appeal by Ronald Reine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
