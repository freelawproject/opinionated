For the reasons below, we will grant the petition for review and remand the matter to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Yun Mei Zhou, a native and citizen of China, was admitted to the United States on January 15, 2002 with authorization to remain in the United States no later than February 14, 2002. Zhou overstayed her visa, and, on August 7, 2002, she filed an application for asylum based on religious persecution and sought withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) and the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). On May 3, 2004, the Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denied Zhou\u2019s application for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 as well as her application for withholding of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) and the CAT. In rendering his decision, the IJ expressly made an adverse credibility determination. Zhou appealed, and the BIA dismissed her appeal on October 12, 2005. Zhou did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">In October 2006, Zhou filed with the BIA a motion to reopen her removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) based on changed country conditions in China. Zhou claimed that in March 2006 she joined the China Democracy Party (\u201cCDP\u201d), an organization that opposes the Communist Party leadership in China and promotes democracy. In connection with her membership in the CDP, Zhou asserted that she participated in protest rallies in New York and Washington, D.C., distributed CDP literature in New York, and published three articles on CDP-affiliated Web sites. Zhou argued she was entitled to reopen her removal proceedings because she would be persecuted if removed to China due to her involvement with the CDP and the deteriorating treatment of political dissidents in China. Zhou further claimed that she could file a successive application for asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) based on changed personal circumstances affecting her eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">On June 28, 2007, the BIA denied Zhou\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. The BIA concluded that Zhou \u201chas not submitted evidence which tends to demonstrate that conditions in China have deteriorated\u201d for political dissidents since her last hearing. <em>J.A. </em>at 54. The BIA also observed that Zhou had been deemed not credible at her removal hearing and that the credibility finding had not been overturned on appeal. On July 27, 2007, Zhou filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">This Court has jurisdiction to consider Zhou\u2019s petition for review of the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>her motion to reopen pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 814, 823, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004). Under the abuse of discretion standard, a decision \u201cwill not be disturbed unless [it is] found to be \u2018arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u2019\u201d <em>Guo, </em>386 F.3d at 562 (quoting <em>Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\n<em>A. Motion to Reopen the Removal Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">In general, an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and the alien must file that motion no later than ninety days after the date of the final administrative decision denying relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nevertheless, the numerical and time limitations set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) do not apply if the petitioner can establish \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In addition, a motion to reopen must establish the petitioner\u2019s prima facie eligibility for asylum. <em>Guo, </em>386 F.3d at 563-64. The prima facie standard requires that the moving party \u201c \u2018produce objective evidence showing a reasonable likelihood that he can establish [that he is entitled to relief].\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563 (quoting <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 175 (3d Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Zhou filed her motion to reopen more than ninety days after the agency issued its final order of removal. Accordingly, for the BIA to grant her motion to reopen, Zhou was required to present material evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality\u201d that was not available during her earlier hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In support of her assertion of \u201cchanged country conditions,\u201d Zhou submitted information that was not available at her removal hearing, including the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cMeasures for Administering the Release of News and Information in China by Foreign News Agencies,\u201d reports detailing the recent arrests of and sentences imposed on political dissidents who published articles critical of the Chinese government on the Internet, and the 2005 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>J.A. </em>at 90-183. The 2005 U.S. Department of State Country Report reported a \u201ctrend towards increased harassment, detention, and imprisonment by government and security authorities of those perceived as threatening to government authority\u201d as well as government measures to \u201ccontrol more tightly print, broadcast and electronic media and eensor[] online content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182. With respect to the CDP, the 2005 Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>of State Report noted that \u201c[d]ozens of CDP leaders, activists, and members have been arrested, detained, or confined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The BIA did not specifically address any of this newly acquired evidence, and it did not point to any evidence refuting Zhou\u2019s claim of changed country conditions. In deciding that Zhou had failed to demonstrate \u201cchanged circumstances in the country of nationality,\u201d the BIA concluded that Zhou</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">has not submitted evidence which tends to demonstrate that conditions in China have deteriorated since the time of [her] hearing. The evidence does not tend to show that Chinese officials\u2019 treatment of dissidents is more severe at this point. Finally, we note that the Immigration Judge found that [Zhou] was not credible, a finding not overturned on appeal. In this motion, the respondent\u2019s claims were not adequately supported by documentary evidence concerning current conditions in China and her assertions on this issue are not credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-6\"><em>J.A. </em>at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">When evaluating the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion, this Court is \u201c \u2018not foreclosed from determining whether the BIA followed proper procedures and considered and appraised the material evidence before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>510 F.3d 405, 412 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Sotto v. INS, </em>748 F.2d 832, 837 (3d Cir.1984)); <em>see also Sevoian, </em>290 F.3d at 177 (quoting <em>Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d at 583). As the <em>Sotto </em>Court noted, \u201c[t]o determine whether the administrative action was arbitrary, the courts must be apprised why evidence, relevant and persuasive on its face, was discredited.\u201d <em>Sotto, </em>748 F.2d at 837; <em>see also Shardar v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>503 F.3d 308, 314-16 (3d Cir.2007) (concluding that the BIA abused its discretion when it offered no explanation for its rejection of evidence offered to show changed country conditions). \u201cIf the administrative record fails to reveal that such evidence has been fairly considered, the proper course is to remand the case to the INS so that the Service may evaluate such evidence and consider its effect on the application as a whole.\u201d <em>Sotto, </em>748 F.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Based on its perfunctory denial of Zhou\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA abused its discretion in rejecting her claim of changed country conditions. It failed to explain why newly acquired evidence, most notably the State Department\u2019s 2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China and the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cMeasures for Administering the Release of News and Information in China by Foreign News Agencies,\u201d was discredited or disregarded. Indeed, this Court, in assessing the adequacy of the BIA\u2019s consideration of evidence, has specifically pointed to the failure to consider State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices as a ground for remand. <em>Thu, </em>510 F.3d at 407 (holding that IJ failed to consider all evidence, especially the Department of State\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Burma); <em>see also Mansour v. INS, </em>230 F.3d 902, 907-08 (7th Cir.2000) (concluding that BIA failed to conduct sufficient review of claim where it incorrectly described petitioner as Syrian Christian rather than Assyrian Christian and declined to address the U.S. Department of State\u2019s report detailing persecution of Assyrian Christians in Iraq). Nevertheless, the BIA\u2019s failure to mention a State Department report specifically does not automatically render its decision an abuse of discretion. <em>See Toussaint v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>455 F.3d 409, 416-17 (3d Cir.2006) (concluding that BIA\u2019s decision was adequate even though \u201cthe evidence ... included country reports and various articles\u201d that the BIA \u201cfailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>mention specifically\u201d). In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court determined that the BIA\u2019s asserted consideration of \u201cbackground evidence\u201d satisfied it \u201cthat the BIA considered the country reports and [other] articles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA\u2019s rejection of Zhou\u2019s motion was supported by conclusory statements asserting that Zhou\u2019s \u201cclaims are not adequately supported\u201d and that Zhou \u201chas not submitted evidence which tends to demonstrate that conditions in China have deteriorated since the time of the respondent\u2019s hearing.\u201d <em>J.A. </em>at 54. This analysis does not satisfy us that the BIA \u201c \u2018considered and appraised the material evidence before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Sevoian, </em>290 F.3d at 177 (quoting <em>Tipu, </em>20 F.3d at 583).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">One observation the BIA did offer in support of its denial of Zhou\u2019s motion to reopen was the IJ\u2019s previous adverse credibility determination. Nevertheless, an initial adverse credibility determination does not automatically taint subsequent applications for relief. <em>Guo, </em>386 F.3d at 562-63. Instead, each adverse credibility assessment must be supported \u201cwith statements or record evidence specifically related to the issue under consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562 (\u201cNor does one adverse credibility finding beget another.\u201d). While the IJ\u2019s credibility assessment stemmed from Zhou\u2019s initial claim of religious persecution, Zhou based her subsequent motion to reopen on changed country conditions in China regarding persecution of political dissidents; there is no indication that the claims asserted in the motion to reopen are related to Zhou\u2019s earlier claims of religious persecution. Further, the BIA offered no explanation of why it found the assertions in Zhou\u2019s motion to reopen based on fear of political persecution to be incredible. <em>See Shardar, </em>503 F.3d at 313 (\u201cFacts presented in the motion to reopen are \u2018accepted as true unless inherently unbelievable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 987 (9th Cir.2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">\n<em>B. Convention Against Torture</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Zhou asserts that the BIA erred in failing to consider whether she established a prima facie case for withholding of removal pursuant to the CAT. Because the BIA\u2019s denial of Zhou\u2019s motion contained no specific analysis of the claim for relief under the CAT, it appears that the BIA concluded that it was unnecessary to address the issue based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings and the stated insufficiency of Zhou\u2019s proffered evidence of conditions in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">An alien is entitled to relief under the CAT if she shows that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). In considering a claim under the CAT, \u201call evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. This inquiry is independent of the inquiry required for consideration of claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184 (2d Cir.2004). As this Court has observed, \u201c \u2018claims for relief under the [CAT] are analytically separate from claims for asylum ... and for withholding of removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 467 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Kamalthas v. I.N.S., </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001)). Accordingly, the BIA erred in failing to consider Zhou\u2019s claims under the CAT separately.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>BIA\u2019s apparent reliance on an adverse credibility assessment was inappropriate. <em>Zubeda, </em>333 F.3d at 476 (finding that petitioner\u2019s credibility with respect to asylum and withholding claims should not \u201cbleed through to the BIA\u2019s consideration of her claim under the [CAT]\u201d); <em>see also Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cA CAT claim cannot be denied solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding since a CAT claim may be established using different evidence and theories than those used for asylum claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">\n<em>G. Changed Personal Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The BIA did not address Zhou\u2019s contention that she is permitted pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) to bring a successive asylum application based on changed personal circumstances in connection with her motion to reopen. Because we hold that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Zhou\u2019s untimely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the BIA may find it appropriate to consider Zhou\u2019s successive asylum application based on her changed personal circumstances if it concludes that her motion to reopen based on changed country circumstances should be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant the petition for review and remand the matter to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\">. Around the same time, Zhou filed with the BIA a motion to reconsider its denial of her motion to reopen, which the BIA denied on October 4, 2007. Because Zhou did not file a separate petition for review, that denial is not before this Court. <em>Nocon v. INS, </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1032-33 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">. Zhou also submitted the 2006 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China. This report was not submitted to the BIA until after it denied Zhou's motion to reopen on June 28, 2007. <em>J.A. </em>at 5-51. Because our review is limited to the record that was before the agency when it issued the decision under review, we may not consider the 2006 U.S. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in China. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (providing that reviewing court must decide the petition \"only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d); <em>Al-Fara v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 733, 743 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201d[I]t is axiomatic that we may not foray outside the administrative record in considering this appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-6\">. \u2018\u2018[J]udicial review of an agency\u2019s decision is limited to the rationale that the agency provides.\" <em>Konan v. Att'y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 497, 501 (3d Cir.2005). In rejecting Zhou\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA focused on Zhou\u2019s failure to establish changed country conditions and did not consider whether Zhou established a prima facie claim for relief under the CAT. Accordingly, this Court cannot consider in the first instance whether Zhou estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>lished a prima facie claim for relief under CAT. <em>See Konan, </em>432 F.3d at 501 (\u201cA reviewing court is powerless to decide in the first instance issues that an agency does not reach.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b896-22\">. We note that the BIA recently ruled that an alien unable to prevail on a motion to reopen is barred from filing a successive asylum application under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). <em>In re C-W-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N.
