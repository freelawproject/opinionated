On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the following issues: (1) whether Elliott received ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (2) whether the Government committed prosecutorial misconduct; and (3) whether Elliott was erroneously sentenced. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Elliott\u2019s claims that she received ineffective assistance at her plea and sentencing hearings are belied by the record. Moreover, we find no ineffective assistance conclusively appearing on the record, as required to establish the claim on direct appeal. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Next, Elliott claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct by telling her that if she did not pled guilty, the Government would pursue a twenty-year sentence against her. We note that a prosecutor is allowed to threaten a defendant with increased punishment if a defendant refuses to accept a plea agreement. <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978). Based on Elliott\u2019s prior drug felony and the Government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2006) notice, Elliott was eligible for a twenty-year minimum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2006). Thus, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Finally, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Elliott. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). In particular, we find no error in the calculation of her criminal history. <em>See U.S Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.1 comment. (n.3) (2003) (counting criminal history points based on prior sentences occurring within ten years of commencement of the instant offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the issues raised in Elliott\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
