We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying default judgment against defendants XL Capital or The Hartford, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a) (default judgment rule); <em>Ackra Direct Mktg. Corp. v. Fingerhut Corp., </em>86 F.3d 852, 856 (8th Cir.1996) (standard of review), or in not sanctioning defense counsel, <em>see Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 23, 37 (1st Cir.2004). Parniani\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal present no basis for reversal. Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-16\">. The Honorable Patrick J.
