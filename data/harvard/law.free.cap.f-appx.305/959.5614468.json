Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). The Board\u2019s broad discretion will be reversed only if its decision \u201clacked a rational explanation, departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\u201d <em>Jean, </em>435 F.3d at 483 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Noman-Aslam presents no argument relevant to whether the Board abused its discretion in denying her motion for reconsideration. Therefore, we find the issue has been abandoned on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cIt is a well settled rule that contentions not raised in the argument section of the opening brief are abandoned.\u201d); <em>Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001) (stating failure to raise an issue in an opening brief results in abandonment of that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">To the extent that Noman-Aslam\u2019s brief can be construed to challenge the Board\u2019s alternative holding that the motion should be denied as a second and untimely motion to reopen proceedings, the claim fails. An alien may file one motion to reopen within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(A), (C) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2008). We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006). This court will reverse a denial of a motion to reopen only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 745 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">In denying the motion on this alternative reasoning, the Board did not abuse its discretion. Construed as a motion to reopen, the motion was plainly numerically barred; the Board denied the first motion to reopen less than three weeks before the motion was filed. Moreover, as the Board noted, the motion was also time-barred, as it was filed almost five months after the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Noman-Aslam </em>(B.I.A. Nov. 30, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
