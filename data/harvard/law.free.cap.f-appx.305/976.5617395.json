Because the Millers failed to provide more than speculative evidence regarding the contamination of their home, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">In January 2003, the Millers bought a tract of land in Centreville, Maryland from Appellee Mandrin Homes, Ltd. (\u201cMandrin\u201d), and entered into a contract of sale for a house to be built on the land. They claim that the lot was previously part of a solid and hazardous waste dump; that Mandrin and other Appellees knew or should have known this; and that by grading the land and disturbing its groundwater, Mandrin and other Appellees caused the release of hazardous substances onto the land. Appellee Champion Realty, Inc. served as the Millers\u2019 agent in the purchase. The Millers took possession of the house in late January 2003 and vacated it in November of the same year. They claimed that after moving in, they noticed an offensive odor coming from the basement and experienced respiratory, digestive, and other physical ailments. The Millers also discovered a punctured pipe in their basement, which was corrected by Mandrin, and claimed to notice structural defects and mold growth in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Between May 2002 and May 2003, thirteen environmental and structural inspections were completed on the house at the instigation of the Millers, Mandrin, and the Millers\u2019 home insurance carrier. The test results were mixed. Several tests found no problems; indeed, one reported that the air in the house was cleaner than the air outside. Another test recommended the sanitation of the carpets and HVAC system in the house, and noted that the illnesses reported by the family had the characteristics of allergenic reactions to mold, mildew, and bacteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">The Millers claimed that laboratory tests and groundwater analyses showed the presence of volatile organic substances (\u2018VOCs\u201d) in their sump water. They hired a hydrologist, Dr. Lome Everett (\u201cDr. Everett\u201d), to interpret the test results. Dr. Everett, who never visited the house, analyzed the studies and tests performed by third parties as well as aerial photographs of the house and surrounding area. He opined that the photos revealed significant land disturbances between 1952 and 1957 in the surrounding area \u201cconsistent with\u201d a dump or landfill. He stated that \u201cthe detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the semivolatile compound, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>phenol, in water from the sump at [the property] is indicative of groundwater contamination under the property.\u201d Dr. Everett also provided a \u201cRebuttal Affidavit\u201d in response to an affidavit submitted by the Appellees\u2019 expert, Dr. Jack Snyder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Dr. Snyder\u2019s affidavit stated that all the chemicals detected in the Millers\u2019 house were common substances \u201cfound around the average household and in sources other than contaminated groundwater.\u201d He also testified that the chemical concentrations found in the sump water would not pose a health risk even if the sump water was ingested and that \u201cthe presence of a contaminant in sump water at the concentrations indicated does not establish either the origin of the contaminant or that the residents of the house were exposed to the contaminant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">In November 2005, the Millers filed a Complaint alleging violations of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq., and making state law claims under Maryland law for breach of implied warranties, unfair competition and deceptive acts under Maryland Commercial Law, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellees after ruling that the Millers did not present evidence showing a triable issue of fact as to contamination. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. <em>Wickwire Gavin, P.C. v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>356 F.3d 588, 591 (4th Cir.2004). We consider the record de novo and address properly-preserved arguments raised by the appellant, as well as properly-preserved alternative bases for affirmance, to determine whether the evidence shows a genuine issue of material fact that requires a trial. <em>Beverati v. Smith, </em>120 F.3d 500, 503 (4th Cir.1997). This court applies \u201cthe same legal standards as the district court and view[s] the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Hanifi, </em>145 F.3d 170, 177 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">The Millers acknowledge that all of the counts in their Complaint rest on the CERCLA claim stated in Count I. If the district court correctly found that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the CERCLA claim, then it properly granted summary judgment on all counts in the Millers\u2019 Complaint. To prevail on a CERCLA claim, a plaintiff must show, among other elements, that a \u201crelease\u201d or \u201cthreatened release\u201d of a \u201chazardous substance\u201d has occurred. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607; <em>see Axel Johnson, Inc. v. Carroll Carolina Oil Co., </em>191 F.3d 409, 414 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Md. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>632 F.Supp. 573, 576 (D.Md.1986). All of the Millers\u2019 legal theories rely on the contamination of their home by toxic substances. Thus, their case hinges on the evidence of contamination they put forward, namely the October 2006 Declaration and the December 2006 Rebuttal Affidavit of Dr. Everett. They argue that these two documents show a genuine issue of material fact. The district court disagreed, holding that, to the contrary, Dr. Everett\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">The Millers claim that the district court wrongfully disregarded Dr. Everett\u2019s testimony as speculative. Under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, </em>they contend, the court should have scrutinized the methods and principles employed by their expert -witness rather than his conclusions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). They are correct, of course, that a trial court must decide whether an expert\u2019s testimony is admissible under <em>Daubert.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The analysis, however, does not end there. Even if expert testimony meets the <em>Daubert </em>admissibility standards, the question remains whether the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact, i.e., one that would allow the jury to find for the non-moving party on an essential element of the claim. If no genuine issue of fact exists, summary judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In <em>Daubert, </em>the Court explained that when a trial judge \u201cconcludes that the scintilla of evidence presented supporting a position is insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true,\u201d the judge \u201cremains free ... to grant summary judgment.\u201d 509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786. A fair reading of the district court\u2019s opinion shows that the court had doubts about the admissibility of some or all of Dr. Everett\u2019s testimony, but also that it considered his testimony, taken at face value, insufficient to create a triable issue of fact. The court reviewed Dr. Everett\u2019s statements and found that a reasonable jury could not logically base a verdict for the Millers on his testimony. We agree that the opinions of Dr. Everett are not sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to find for the Millers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In the Fourth Circuit, proof of a necessary element offered to escape summary judgment \u201cmust be such as to suggest probability rather than mere possibility, precisely to guard against raw speculation by the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Sakaria v. Trans World Airlines, </em>8 F.3d 164, 172-73 (4th Cir.1993) (citations and internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Textron Inc. ex rel. Homelite Div. v. Barber-Colman Co., </em>903 F.Supp. 1558, 1565 (W.D.N.C.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">The Millers claim that Dr. Everett\u2019s expert conclusions, when viewed in the light most favorable to them, would allow a reasonable juror to infer that groundwater contamination existed on the lot when it was owned by Mandrin, and that the contamination was a result of leachate from a nearby landfill. Dr. Everett\u2019s testimony, though, was speculative as to the presence of a landfill and as to the existence of contamination. In his opinion, \u201cthe detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the semivolatile compound, phenol, in water from the sump at 127 Cypress Street is indicative of groundwater contamination under the property.\u201d According to Dr. Everett, who studied the reports of others but did not personally visit the property, this contamination occurred via leaching from a dump or a landfill, the presence of which is indicated by aerial photographs that show an \u201cobserved pattern of land disturbance ... consistent with a dump or a landfill.\u201d Likewise, he stated in his affidavit that \u201cthe occurrence of [chlorinated VOCs and phenolic corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>pounds] is consistent with contamination migrating in groundwater from a landfill source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Such claims, even if they would be admissible under <em>Daubert, </em>indicate no more than a mere possibility that the Millers\u2019 theory of contamination is true. The closest Dr. Everett\u2019s affidavit comes to stating an opinion in a manner that would allow a reasonable jury to find for the Millers by a preponderance of the evidence is his statement that the detection of VOCs \u201cis indicative\u201d of groundwater contamination. This phrase, however, does not show that Dr. Everett believed there actually was groundwater contamination or, more to the point, that he could testify that it was his scientific opinion that groundwater contamination existed. Dr. Everett stated his opinion in a passive manner that suggests his finding falls in the realm of the possible rather than the probable. He stated that one fact \u2014 the detection of VOCs \u2014 is indicative of the existence of a second, required fact \u2014 groundwater contamination. The testimony provides no yardstick by which to measure the strength of this claim. The detection of VOCs could be \u201cindicative\u201d of any number of things, including other sources of contamination. Indeed, other evidence in the record states unequivocally that all of the chemicals detected in the Miller\u2019s house also can be found around the average household. Dr. Everett\u2019s testimony would not allow a jury to find groundwater contamination by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Moreover, none of the other links in the chain of inferences supporting the Millers\u2019 landfill leachate theory was stated as anything more than a scientific possibility. The Millers also produced no evidence of medical causation; Dr. Everett is not a medical doctor and thus did not posit his expert opinion as to the causation of the Millers\u2019 claimed injuries. In short, the Millers have suggested only possibility, rather than probability, on an element essential to their claims. The district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">. The Millers originally filed suit on behalf of their minor children as well. On February 22, 2007, the district court granted the Millers\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims of their minor children without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the use of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQh\"><em>Daubert </em>requires a two-part analysis to determine whether proposed expert testimony is admissible. First, the court must determine whether the expert's testimony is grounded in the scientific method and reflects scientific knowledge. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590, 593, 113 S.Ct. 2786. Second, the court must determine whether the evidence proffered is relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
