Miranda Pena, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) orders dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s deportation order (No. 06-73336), and denying his motion to reopen (No. 07-71065). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss the petition for review in No. 06-73336 and deny the petition for review in No. 07-71065.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">We lack jurisdiction over the untimely petition for review in No. 06-73336. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(l) (1994); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 969, 979 (9th Cir.2007) (petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u201ccannot be construed as seeking judicial review of his final order of removal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Miranda Pena was not entitled to equitable tolling where Miranda Pena\u2019s motion to reopen was filed nearly twelve years after the BIA\u2019s prior order and Miranda Pena did not demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in discovering former counsel\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (equitable tolling available \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud or error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Miranda Pena\u2019s motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status as untimely because he did not file the motion within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s prior order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>see also Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">No. 06-73336: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">No. 07-71065: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
