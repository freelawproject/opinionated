Although Armstrong\u2019s attorney requested $5,892.93 in fees, the district court awarded only $1,937.40. On appeal, the only issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in reducing and determining its award. <em>United States v. Truesdale, </em>211 F.3d 898, 905 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 563, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Armstrong\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees claimed that he spent 36.5 hours on Armstrong\u2019s case. It sought $5,892.93 in attorneys\u2019 fees, reflecting a rate of $125 an hour and a cost-of-living adjustment. Three days after the motion was filed, and before the Commissioner could respond, the district court entered an order that awarded only $1,937.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees. The order provided no explanation for the award. Armstrong\u2019s attorney filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied, stating that \u201c[tjhis case just was not that complicated.\u201d The district court summarized that 34 out of the 36.5 hours were spent preparing a motion for summary judgment, and called the notion that the motion required such time \u201cunacceptable.\u201d But the district eoui\u2019t provided no factual or legal rationale for its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">The district court should have made findings as to Armstrong\u2019s attorney\u2019s hours and rates in the light of the factors, to the extent they are relevant, typically used in determining what constitutes reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in such cases as these.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stating that the case was not complicated and calling Armstrong\u2019s attorney\u2019s hours \u201cunacceptable\u201d do not amount to a factual and legal finding that Armstrong\u2019s attorney earned no more than only $1,937.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees. We are here \u201cwithout benefit of the lower court\u2019s reasons for deciding as it did.\u201d <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">Because we have no basis from which we can review for abuse of discretion, we VACATE the award and REMAND to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>district court to articulate factual and legal reasons for its award.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-13\">. We point out that the twelve factors set out in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974), are equally relevant to calculating an attorneys\u2019 fees award under the EAJA as under the Civil Rights Act. <em>See Hall v. Shalala, </em>50 F.3d 367, 369 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
