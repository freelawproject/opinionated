Shappert, United States Attorney, Adam Morris, Assistant United States Attorney, Charlotte, North Carolina, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b97-12\">Before SHEDD, DUNCAN, and AGEE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b97-13\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b97-14\">Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">Ross Lance Price pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to manufacture and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (2006), and one count of possessing with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2006). On appeal, he claims the district court erred in arriving at the drug quantity for sentencing purposes. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 1B1.3 (a)(1)(B) (2007), in determining the proper base offense level to apply to a defendant involved in a drug conspiracy, the defendant is responsible for his own acts, as well as for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts\u201d of his co-conspirators taken in furtherance of the joint criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1013 (4th Cir.1993). The Guidelines do not require precise calculations of drug quantity, as the district court\u2019s approximation is not clearly erroneous if supported by competent evidence. <em>Randall, </em>171 F.3d at 210. If the district court relies on the drug quantity included in the PSR, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the information is incorrect, as \u201cmere objections are insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-19\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination. <em>United States v. Fletcher, </em>74 F.3d 49, 55 (4th Cir.1996). In determining relevant conduct, the district court may consider any relevant and reliable evidence before it, including hearsay. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Bowman, </em>926 F.2d 380, 381-82 (4th Cir. 1991). In fact, hearsay alone can provide sufficiently reliable evidence of drug quantity. <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1019 (4th Cir.1992). Hearsay statements of co-conspirators may be considered reliable. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 607 (4th Cir.1998). The Government has the burden of establishing the amount of drugs used for sentencing calculations by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>76 F.3d 596, 604 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We find the district court did not clearly err in arriving at the drug quantity. Price\u2019s arguments on appeal challenging the drug quantity are too general, speculative and without evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
