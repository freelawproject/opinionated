We dismiss the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). Petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency violated their due process rights by disregarding certain hardship evidence is not supported by the record and therefore does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-25\">The evidence petitioners presented with their motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds previously considered by the agency. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship for purposes of cancellation of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-26\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b425-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
