The district court sentenced him to a 120-month term of imprisonment, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. On appeal, counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether the district court committed plain error in accepting Vazquez-Escalara\u2019s guilty plea. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based upon Vazquez-Escalara\u2019s waiver of appellate rights. We deny the motion to dismiss and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Amaya-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Vazquez-Esealara knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes our review of the sentence, the waiver does not preclude our review of any errors in Vazquez-Escalara\u2019s conviction that may be revealed by our review pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>Our review of the transcript of the plea colloquy leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting VazquezEscalara\u2019s guilty plea. The district court ensured that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily and was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Thus, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues not covered by the waiver. We therefore affirm Vazquez-Escalara\u2019s conviction. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">. <em>Anders v.
