R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Robin Tyler applied for Social Security Disability Insurance on the basis of physical impairments to her neck, shoulders, arms, and hands, as well as depression. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied benefits. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and applies the correct legal standard. <em>Howard ex rel. Wolff v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1011 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Astrue. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">The district court properly declined to evaluate whether the ALJ\u2019s second decision satisfied the demands of the Appeals Council\u2019s remand. The law of the case doctrine does not apply because the Appeals Council remanded to the ALJ to make further findings; it did not decide any issues of fact or law itself. Additionally, federal courts only have jurisdiction to review the final decisions of administrative agencies. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). When the Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s second decision, it made that decision final, <em>Ramirez v. Shalala, </em>8 F.3d 1449, 1451 (9th Cir.1993), and declined to find that the ALJ had not complied with its remand instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The ALJ did not err by discounting Tyler\u2019s subjective reports of pain. A claimant must submit \u201cobjective medical findings establishing a medical impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1407 (9th Cir.1986). Once a claimant meets the Cotton test, \u201cthe ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so,\u201d unless there is evidence of malingering. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996). Substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">The ALJ\u2019s determination that Tyler\u2019s mental impairment was not severe adhered to the guidelines set out in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a. The ALJ employed the specific language required by \u00a7 404.1520a and supported his findings with substantial evidence from the record. Thus, the ALJ did not err when he found that Tyler\u2019s mental impairments were not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">Tyler\u2019s concern that the ALJ\u2019s discussion of Tyler\u2019s husband\u2019s testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>limited to his testimony in the second administrative hearing is misplaced. Tyler\u2019s husband had a full opportunity during the second hearing to testify about Tyler\u2019s mental and physical impairments and the ALJ did not discredit his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Finally, the employment hypothetical the ALJ provided the vocational expert accurately captured Tyler\u2019s impairments. An ALJ may omit limitations from a hypothetical that he does not find credible as long as he has made specific findings to that effect. <em>Light v. SSA, </em>119 F.3d 789, 793 (9th Cir.1997). The ALJ previously made findings discounting Tyler\u2019s pain reports and so was justified in omitting them from the hypothetical. Although the ALJ placed Tyler in the \u201clight level of exertion\u201d category, he modified the category so that Tyler was limited to lifting \u201cno more than five pounds.\u201d This modification put the hypothetical with the scope of the most generous of medical assessments of Tyler\u2019s lifting ability. The vocational expert specifically eroded his job estimates to account for the lifting modification. Additionally, the ALJ further modified the hypothetical to account for Tyler\u2019s pain. Thus, the ALJ did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In sum, the district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
