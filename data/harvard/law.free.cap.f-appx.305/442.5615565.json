Peer appeals from the 235-month sentence imposed, on remand, for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">Peer contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider the disparity between his sentence and the sentences of his co-defendants. We reject this contention. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Marcial-Santiago, </em>447 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">Peer also contends that the district court erred under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 when it applied certain sentencing enhancements based on facts found in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and in special jury verdicts instead of making its own independent findings. We conclude that the district court sufficiently stated its findings on the record as to any disputed facts, and that the court did not otherwise err in relying on the PSR or the special verdict findings. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>488 F.3d 1154, 1158-59 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Cabaccang, </em>481 F.3d 1176, 1186 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b468-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
