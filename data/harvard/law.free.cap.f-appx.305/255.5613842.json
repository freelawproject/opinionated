He argues that the BIA should have exercised its authority under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) to reopen the removal proceedings against him <em>sua sponte. </em>The BIA denied Karim\u2019s motion, finding that no exceptional circumstance warranted the exercise of its authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen Karim\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">This court cannot undertake review of an agency\u2019s discretionary determination where there is \u201cno meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). There are no guidelines directing the BIA\u2019s decision whether to reopen removal proceedings on its own motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Karim\u2019s motion for a <em>sua sponte </em>reopening of his removal proceedings. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004). <em>See also, e.g., Lenis v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2008) (citing cases). We decline Karim\u2019s invitation to revisit this court\u2019s holding in <em>EnriquezAlvarado. See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>1999) (\u201cIt is a firm rule of this circuit that in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court, a panel cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision\u201d). Additionally, we note that the denial of Karim\u2019s motion for reopening under \u00a7 1008.2(a) does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, 435 </em>F.3d <em>547, 550 (5th </em>Cir.2006) (holding that a discretionary decision to deny a motion to reopen does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Accordingly, Karim\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
