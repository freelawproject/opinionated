Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>accord Ollman v. Special Bd. of Adjustment No. 1063, </em>527 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir.2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">1. <em>Discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">Gupta submits that the district court erred in concluding that he failed, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>matter of law, to demonstrate <em>-prima facie </em>race or age discrimination in defendant\u2019s failure to promote him on two occasions and its decision ultimately to terminate his employment as part of a reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d), while promoting and retaining younger and/or white employees. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Woodman v. WWOR-TV, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 69, 76 (2d Cir.2005). Notably, the district court ruled that Gupta did \u201cnot allege[ ] any animus, any derogatory comments, or anything else\u201d that would raise an inference of discrimination. <em>Gupta v. N.Y. City Sch. Coustr. Autk, </em>04 CV 2896, 2007 WL 1827418, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Jun.25, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Gupta contends, however, that discrimination could be inferred because the employees who were promoted or retained were \u201cless academically qualified with less pi'ofessional experience\u201d than he. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5. The district court correctly dismissed this allegation as mere speculation. <em>See Lipton v. Nature Co., </em>71 F.3d 464, 469 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201ca party may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore, even if we accept that the qualifications described in the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s provided by Gupta constitute all of the relevant credentials, Gupta still has not enabled an inference that any adverse employment decision was made for discriminatory reasons. The employees who were selected for promotion or retained during the RIF were eminently qualified, even in direct comparison to Gupta, and we \u201cmust respect the employer\u2019s unfettered discretion to choose among qualified candidates.\u201d <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, Bd. of Educ., </em>243 F.3d 93, 103 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Gupta acknowledges that the analysis SCA conducted to determine whether its layoff policy as part of the RIF would result in a disparate impact against any racial, age, or gender group showed a disparity of less than two standard deviations between the minority and majority groups, which is generally insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination. <em>See Malave v. Potter, 320 F.3d 321, </em>327 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cThe District Court should also consider whether [a plaintiff] can show a statistically significant disparity of two standard deviations.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). He nevertheless argues that there would have been greater diversity had he not been fired. Federal anti-discrimination laws, however, do not mandate perfect diversity or a certain ratio of minority and majority groups in the workplace. They prohibit only discriminatory employment actions on the basis of a protected ground. Without evidence raising an inference of discrimination, Gupta cannot make out a discrimination claim. We therefore conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment on the failure to promote and unlawful termination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">2. <em>Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Gupta alleges that SCA unlawfully retaliated against him for filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and bringing a lawsuit by refusing to rehire him to his previous position as Managing Architect. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d). The district court dismissed the retaliation claim because Gupta never submitted an application for the Managing Architect position, and the law requires \u201ca plaintiff to allege that she or he applied for a specific position or positions and was rejected therefrom, rather than merely asserting that on several occasions she or he generally requested pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>motion.\u201d <em>Brown v. Coach Stores, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 706, 710 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Gupta argues that he had \u201cbeen persistent in [his] efforts to get a job\u201d \u201cthrough the help of the EEOC, various employment agencies and by contacting Elan Abneri\u201d at SCA. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5. But asking the EEOC for help in getting his SCA job back, submitting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s through a private employment agency, or making one phone call to a former colleague that was never answered or returned do not amount to a \u201cspecific application.\u201d <em>Petrosino v. Bell Atl., </em>385 F.3d 210, 227 (2d Cir.2004). To hold otherwise would place an \u201cunfair burden\u201d on SCA, <em>Petrosino v. Bell Atl., </em>385 F.3d at 226-27, \u201cto keep track of all [former] employees who have generally expressed an interest in [being rehired] and [to] consider each of them for any opening for which they are qualified but did not specifically apply,\u201d <em>Brown v. Coach Stores, Inc., </em>163 F.3d at 710. Because Gupta cannot claim retaliation based on defendant\u2019s failure to rehire him for a position for which he did not apply, this claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We have considered all of Gupta\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the award of summary judgment in favor of defendant is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
