Jan. 8, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA\u2019s regulations require an alien seeking to reopen proceedings to file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Zhu\u2019s July 2007 motion was untimely where the agency issued its final order of removal in September 2002. However, there is no time limit for filing a motion to reopen \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). Here, the BIA properly found that Zhu\u2019s motion did not qualify for such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">It is well-settled that a change in personal circumstances, such as Zhu\u2019s newly commenced participation in the China Democracy Party, does not excuse the time limit for filing a motion to reopen. <em>See Li Yovg Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, the BIA reasonably found that Zhu\u2019s evidence did not demonstrate changed country conditions in China related to the treatment of political dissidents. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir.2006). Indeed, much of Zhu\u2019s evidence concerned dissidents in China rather than dissidents in the United States who return to China. Finally, contrary to Zhu\u2019s argument, he was not eligible to file a successive asylum application independent of the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Matter of C-W-L-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 346, 352-53 (BIA 2007). We therefore need not reach Zhu\u2019s assertion that the BIA abused its discretion in failing to consider his CAT claim. <em>Cf. Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184-85 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
