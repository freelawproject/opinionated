The district court dismissed the complaint, finding that Owens\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations; that Owens failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; and that \u00a7 1983 protects employees only from unlawful conduct by state actors, not private entities such as labor unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">On appeal, Owens has submitted nothing more than a hodgepodge of documents including photocopies of receipts relating to his workers\u2019 compensation claim, earlier state court filings, medical records, EEOC paperwork, and a previously denied request for appointment of counsel. However, an appellate brief must contain legal argument, citation to legal authority, and a statement of the issues presented for review. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). And even pro se litigants must present identifiable arguments. <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). Nowhere does Owens address the district court\u2019s decision, or assert factual or legal error related to this suit. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
