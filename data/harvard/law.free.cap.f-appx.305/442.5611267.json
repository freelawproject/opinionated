Because Mr. Howard is a state prisoner, we may not disturb his confinement unless the California courts\u2019 resolution of his claims was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>unless their factual findings were unreasonable in light of the evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Applying this standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Mr. Howard argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments \u201cso infected [his] trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). To prevail in such a claim, Mr. Howard must show a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jury based its verdict on the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements. <em>Brown v. Payton, </em>544 U.S. 133, 143-44, 125 S.Ct. 1432, 161 L.Ed.2d 334 (2005) (internal citation omitted); <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380-81 &amp; n. 4, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Most of the prosecutor\u2019s statements Mr. Howard wishes to challenge, however, were not objected to at trial. We have held that failure to comply with California\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule results in a procedural default of a prosecutorial misconduct claim. <em>Rich v. Calderon, </em>187 F.3d 1064, 1069-70 (9th Cir.1999). Because the state\u2019s procedural default rule would require the same result whether or not the federal claim were meritorious, it is an adequate and independent ground supporting the judgment that bars federal habeas relief. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729-32, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The only statement to which Mr. Howard contemporaneously objected was the prosecutor\u2019s erroneous suggestion that if the jury concluded Mr. Howard had committed reckless driving, it must <em>a fortiori </em>convict him of murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As California\u2019s Third District Court of Appeal properly held, however, any prejudice caused by the prosecutor was cured by the trial court\u2019s prompt corrective action. Immediately after the prosecutor misstated the law, Mr. Howard\u2019s counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection. After a recess, the judge went a step further, issuing a curative instruction (to which Mr. Howard offered no objection) correctly explaining the difference between the mental states required for the two offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 14. In addition, the court\u2019s jury instructions admonished the jury that the arguments of counsel are not authoritative, <em>id. </em>at 26, and the Supreme Court has cautioned that jurors should not be presumed to be easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>confused into thinking they should rely on counsel\u2019s explanation of the law instead of the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Boyde, </em>494 U.S. at 384-85, 110 S.Ct. 1190. In short, the prosecutor\u2019s remark \u201cwas but one moment in an extended trial and was followed by specific disapproving instructions.\u201d <em>Donnelly, </em>416 U.S. at 645, 94 S.Ct. 1868. In view of the entire record, <em>see id. </em>at 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, it did not deprive Mr. Howard of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Mr. Howard also claims that his lawyer\u2019s failure to investigate fully and present evidence of his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). But the district court concluded that Mr. Howard failed to exhaust his state remedies with respect to this claim as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A) requires. The district court noted that the California Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Howard\u2019s claim with a citation to <em>Ex parte Swain, </em>34 Cal.2d 300, 209 P.2d 793 (1949), and <em>People v. Duvall, </em>9 Cal.4th 464, 37 Cal.Rptr.2d 259, 886 P.2d 1252 (1995). In California, a <em>Swain/Duvall </em>dismissal affords the petitioner the opportunity to refile an amended pleading that \u201callege[s] with sufficient particularity the facts warranting habeas relief.\u201d <em>King v. Roe, </em>340 F.3d 821, 823 (9th Cir.2003), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Evans v. Chavis, </em>546 U.S. 189, 126 S.Ct. 846, 163 L.Ed.2d 684 (2006), <em>as recognized by Waldrip v. Hall, </em>548 F.3d 729 (9th Cir.2008). Mr. Howard\u2019s failure to do this renders his claim unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Nevertheless, the district court proceeded to exercise its discretion to dismiss the unexhausted claim as non-color-able, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2); <em>Cassett v. Stewart, </em>406 F.3d 614, 623-24 (9th Cir.2005), and we affirm that dismissal. A lawyer\u2019s informed decision not to present medical evidence at trial for valid strategic reasons is \u201cvirtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Cacoperdo v. Demosthenes, </em>37 F.3d 504, 508 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052); <em>see also Siripongs v. Calderon, </em>133 F.3d 732, 734 (9th Cir.1998). It appears from the record that Mr. Howard\u2019s lawyer indeed began an investigation into his client\u2019s ADHD early on in the case. Counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue the subject is adequately justified by the double-edged nature of the ADHD evidence: had counsel presented evidence of this disorder, the prosecutor could have, and expressly indicated that he would have, countered with evidence of Mr. Howard\u2019s antisocial personality, evidence that Mr. Howard acknowledges could have been damaging. It is not our task to reexamine the wisdom of taking (or not) a calculated risk at trial; counsel\u2019s election to avoid such a risk does not amount to ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b469-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. The prosecutor\u2019s confusion apparently stemmed from the similarity between the <em>mens vea </em>requirements for the greater and lesser offenses with which Mr. Howard was charged. In California, a defendant can be convicted of murder on a theory of implied malice when he acts \"with conscious disregard of [a] danger to <em>human life.\" People v. Knoller, </em>41 Cal.4th 139, 59 Cal.Rptr.3d 157, 158 P.3d 731, 741 (2007) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 188; <em>People v. Watson, </em>30 Cal.3d 290, 179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279, 283, 285 (1981). By contrast, vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence requires only an <em>objective </em>risk to human life plus unlawful driving. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 192(c); <em>Watson, </em>179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d at 283. In Mr. Howard\u2019s case, the government sought to establish unlawful driving by proving that his conduct amounted to the offense of reckless driving, which is defined as operating a vehicle \u201cin willful or wanton disregard <em>for the safety of persons or property.\u201d </em>Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 23103(a) (emphasis added). The result is that the difference between murder and manslaughter turned on how Mr. Howard subjectively perceived the risk he created; if he ignored a known risk to life, he committed murder; if he ignored only a perceived risk to safety or property, he committed manslaughter. Though Mr. Howard\u2019s briefs attempt to challenge the clarity of this distinction, along with the jury instructions that explained it, the district court's Certificate of Appealability does not comprise that issue, so we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
