In April 2000, the district court sentenced Morgan to a total of 151 months\u2019 imprisonment to be served concurrently with a state sentence. Morgan filed a motion for clarification in May 2008, in the federal district court in the Western District of Virginia, claiming that the Bureau of Prisons improperly failed to credit him with a portion of the time he served on his state sentence while awaiting sentencing on the federal charges. The district court denied Morgan\u2019s motion for clarification, finding that Morgan failed to exhaust administrative remedies with the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-27\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court should have treated Morgan\u2019s motion as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), because he attacked the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>of his sentence. A \u00a7 2241 petition, however, must be brought in the district of incarceration. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a); <em>In re: Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 332 (4th Cir.2000). Morgan is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, which lies in the Eastern District of North Carolina. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a) (2000). The district court in the Western District of Virginia therefore does not have jurisdiction over this \u00a7 2241 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the court to determine whether transferring Morgan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to the proper federal district court would serve the interests of justice, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000), or whether the action should be dismissed without prejudice to Morgan\u2019s right to file his action in the appropriate district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
