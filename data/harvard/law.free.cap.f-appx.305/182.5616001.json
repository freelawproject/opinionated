Construing the facts under the appropriate pre-trial standards, the district court found that the law was clearly established that Martinez was entitled to procedural protections under Texas law for either his superintendent contract or, if that contract was void, his administrator contract; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>light of this, it was objectively unreasonable for the defendants-appellants to deny him such process.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We agree with the district court and we AFFIRM its judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
