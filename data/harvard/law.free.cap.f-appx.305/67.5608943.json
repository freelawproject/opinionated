Counsel for Hunter has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that she has found no meritorious issues for appeal but asserting that the district court may have improperly calculated Hunter\u2019s Guidelines range. Hunter was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government has declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. After a thorough Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing at which Hunter admitted his guilt, the district court sustained one of Hunter\u2019s objections to his presentence investigation report and adopted the remaining findings contained therein, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, and sentenced Hunter to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>States v. Farrior, </em>535 F.3d 210, 224 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cA statutorily required sentence ... is per se reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Hunter in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hunter requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may motion this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hunter. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
