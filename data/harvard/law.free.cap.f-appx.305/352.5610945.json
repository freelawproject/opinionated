We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">A motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days after the date of the BIA\u2019s final decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA \u201cmay at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), and will do so in \u201cexceptional situations.\u201d <em>In re J-J- </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Petitioners allege that here, ineffective assistance of counsel constituted an exceptional situation that should excuse their tardy filing. However, petitioners did not raise this claim before the BIA, and even if they did, we would not have jurisdiction to review the denial of sua sponte reopening. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>Ekimian v.
