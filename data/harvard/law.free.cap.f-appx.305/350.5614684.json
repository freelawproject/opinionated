Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-24\">A party may file only one motion to reconsider a BIA decision, and that motion must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of that decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Further, a party is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days after the final administrative decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider or reopen as untimely because it was filed on January 22, 2008, more than 30 or 90 days after the March 21, 2007 final administrative decision. Accordingly, we deny this petition for review in part because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The motion for a stay of removal pending review is denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b376-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
