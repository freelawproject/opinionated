Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-23\">Damo does not challenge the agency\u2019s determination that she cannot establish the good moral character required for cancellation of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B); therefore, the agency acted within its broad discretion in declining to reopen her removal proceedings, <em>see Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d). We need not reach Damo\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to consider her hardship evidence because the good moral character ground is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-24\">The agency also acted within its discretion in denying Damo\u2019s motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-25\">Damo failed to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s failure to provide a transcript of her removal proceedings. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to succeed on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-26\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Damo\u2019s contention that the IJ abused her discretion and violated due process by denying Damo\u2019s adjustment application because Damo did not petition for review of that agency order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>1258 (9th Cir.1996) (petition for review of the denial of a motion to reconsider does not confer jurisdiction over underlying final order of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b506-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
