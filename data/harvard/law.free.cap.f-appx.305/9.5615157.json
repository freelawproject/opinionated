Totaro, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-23\">In October 2001, a jury sitting in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota convicted Totaro of 61 counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, engaging in unlawful money transactions, and racketeering. The District Court sentenced Totaro to thirty years in prison and $2.3 million dollars in fines. Upon review, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the conviction and sentence, and the United States Supreme Court denied Totaro\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-24\">In April 2004, Totaro sought collateral relief by filing a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court determined, however, that the motion was barred by the applicable one-year statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of limitations and dismissed it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The Court of Appeals denied Totaro\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability, and the Supreme Court denied his petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Totaro next sought relief by filing the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where he is now incarcerated. In the petition, Totaro alleged that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crimes of which he was convicted, and that, because the limitations period for filing a petition under section 2255 has expired, section 2255 is an \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d means to challenge the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court rejected the latter argument, and dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126-27 (3d Cir.2002). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The District Court did not err in dismissing Totaro\u2019s petition. A federal prisoner can seek relief under section 2241 only if the remedy provided by section 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). Section 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the one-year statute of limitations for a petition under that section has expired. <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539 (explaining that section 2241 \u201cexists to ensure that petitioners have a fair opportunity to seek collateral relief, not to enable them to evade procedural requirements\u201d). Rather, as we explained in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 1997), a prisoner may resort to section 2241 only in extremely limited circumstances, such as when an intervening change in law has decriminalized the conduct underlying the petitioner\u2019s conviction. Totaro argues that he was denied his \u201cconstitutional right to prove his actual innocence\u201d because of structural defects at trial, and that he should be permitted to assert such a claim under section 2241. (Memorandum of Law, at p. 2.) Such claims must be raised under section 2255; they do not bring him within the narrow <em>Dorsainvil </em>exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed Totaro\u2019s petition seeking relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the petition. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">. In support of his argument that he should be permitted to assert a claim of \"actual innocence\u201d under section 2241, Totaro relies on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Martin v. Perez, </em>319 F.3d 799 (6th Cir.2003). (Memorandum of Law, at p. 2.) In that case, the Court of Appeals recognized that a prisoner can proceed under section 2241 if he can show that an intervening change in the law establishes his \"actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804. Totaro does not, however, allege that the law governing his conviction has changed since he filed his section 2255 motion; rather, he alleges that errors took place during his trial and sentencing proceedings. Therefore, he does not satisfy the requirements for proceeding under section 2241 described in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
