GUY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b284-22\">Plaintiff Mike Fitzpatrick appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants, the City of Frankfort, Kentucky, and its Fire Chief Wallace Possich, on plaintiffs claim of retaliation in violation of his First Amendment rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that it was error to conclude that he could not state a claim under Pickering\u2019s two-part test for First Amendment retaliation claims by public employees. <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 149-55, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). The district court found that although plaintiff engaged in at least some protected activity, his interests were outweighed by the defendants\u2019 interests in promoting the efficiency of the public services provided by fire department employees. After review of the record and the applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Mike Fitzpatrick was employed from July 1989 until May 31, 2006, as a firefighter and EMT/paramedic with the Frankfort Fire Department. Plaintiff helped organize the Firefighter\u2019s Local 1017 in 1997, although the union is not recognized by the City for collective bargaining purposes. Plaintiff served as union president from 1997 until 2000. Wallace Possich was appointed Fire Chief with the support of the union in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Plaintiff described himself as a \u201cstrong and vocal advocate of the civil service system, a vocal and active participant in the union, and a proponent of issues related to firefighter safety and job security.\u201d The district court more pointedly characterized this action as \u201cthe unfortunate culmination of a very difficult working relationship.\u201d Summarizing, the district court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">From 1996 on, Fitzpatrick brought numerous complaints to the Fire Department\u2019s attention challenging department policies and personnel matters, raising allegations of discrimination and preferential treatment of department employees, critiquing the department\u2019s treatment of the firefighter\u2019s union, and advocating for greater inclusion of the civil service system in the department hierarchy. These complaints were variously brought through official written grievances, problem resolution forms, and letters to officials of the Fire Department and the City of Frankfort, as well as through statements during department and union meetings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The district court also observed that Fitzpatrick\u2019s employment record revealed \u201ca generally antagonistic and uncooperative attitude towards his superiors and department policies, and that this attitude [was] exhibited throughout his tenure at the Fire Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Among the many complaints were: plaintiffs objections to his being required to do additional training in 1996; his grievance about the decision to eliminate age-based differences in physical agility standards in 1996; and his questioning of changes to the fitness test and job description in 1997. In 1998, plaintiff initiated a complaint alleging abusive conduct by Lt. Larry Tucker against another firefighter and the failure of the chain of command to act. Chief Possich\u2019s investigation concluded, among other things, that plaintiffs complaints were unfounded and not based upon personal knowledge. Possich added that plaintiff had \u201cdemonstrated an uncooperative and antagonistic attitude during a meeting to attempt to resolve this issue.\u201d Plaintiff also persisted in complaints regarding the decision to exempt two \u201cgrandfathered\u201d firefighters from ambulance \u201cride time\u201d hours. Fitzpatrick takes credit for the subsequent change in that policy, as well as for the fact that those firefighters later became certified EMTs. None of these complaints, however, were identified as protected speech or as motivation for the alleged retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Rather, plaintiff argues that he engaged in protected speech in challenging the decisions concerning the positions of EMS Director, EMS Shift Supervisor, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, and Assistant Fire Chief over the course of several years preceding his retirement. The district court concluded that, at least with respect to the proposal to remove the Assistant Fire Chief position from the civil service, plaintiffs speech touched on matters of public concern. As is discussed later, the district court also assumed for purposes of summary judgment that plaintiffs speech concerning the duties of the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, a position created outside the civil service, addressed matters of public concern. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>fendants do not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusions or assumptions in this regard, nor does plaintiff appeal from the determination that much of the speech involved internal personnel disputes that did not touch on matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Three specific instances of alleged retaliation were identified by plaintiff: an oral reprimand in July 2005; a change in supervisors in November 2005; and a written reprimand in May 2006. Apart from these actions, plaintiff was also disciplined for falling behind in the required \u201cride time\u201d hours during the summer of 2005. In September 2005, the matter was resolved by allowing plaintiff to drop from primary to secondary paramedic status without having to make up the missed \u201cride time\u201d or return the premium pay he had collected. This discipline, however, was not alleged to have been retaliatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The first incident of alleged retaliation occurred in July 2005, when Possich called plaintiff into the fire station\u2019s kitchen, asked plaintiff what his \u201cproblem\u201d was with Deron Rambo, .and threatened to charge him with insubordination when plaintiff claimed ignorance. It was later revealed that another employee had made the inquiry about Rambo that prompted this exchange, and the matter was dropped. Still, the district court noted that plaintiff claimed to have been repeatedly scolded and verbally reprimanded for questioning Rambo\u2019s appointment as Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The second allegedly retaliatory act was the decision in November 2005 to change the supervisor on plaintiffs crew while plaintiff and a few other firefighters were away helping with Hurricane Katrina relief. The decision to transfer plaintiffs supervisor, Lt. Ray Travis, to an open vacancy on another crew was allegedly made over Travis\u2019s objections and contrary to the department\u2019s past practice of assigning a newly promoted supervisor to the existing vacancy. Plaintiff was told that the newly promoted Lt. Ben Boggs announced on his first day that he had been \u201csent down here to straighten Mike Fitzpatrick out ... [with] the blessing of the Chief.\u201d Boggs denied making this statement, while Possich testified that the transfer decision was jointly made based on the recommendation that Boggs would be \u201cbest at Station 2.\u201d Someone else allegedly told Battalion Chief John Unger, who was one of the decisionmakers, that Boggs and Fitzpatrick did not get along, and Unger allegedly responded, \u201cI know, it\u2019s great, it won\u2019t last a day.\u201d Unger denied making that statement, however. Recognizing that the facts were disputed, the district court viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff and assumed that the change in supervisors was made with plaintiffs protected activity in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Third, the reprimand in May 2006 involved plaintiffs use of leave time. Plaintiff requested permission to attend the three-month state legislative session during January, February, and March 2006 to lobby on behalf of the Kentucky Professional Firefighters. Chief Possich granted the request, with the stipulation that plaintiff work on the crew whenever possible and maintain the required monthly training hours. When the legislative session concluded, plaintiff took vacation for most of the month of April, worked one shift on April 24, and then called in sick for the next three shifts for which he was sehed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>uled to work (April 27, April 30, and May 1). Even with this time off, plaintiff managed to voice objections to the proposal that the Assistant Fire Chief position be removed from the civil service. Plaintiff also prepared and distributed a response to another firefighter\u2019s resignation from the union with what the district court appropriately referred to as a \u201ccall to arms\u201d to union members to fight the department\u2019s \u201cassaults\u201d on the civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Possich prepared a written reprimand on May 4, 2006, charging plaintiff with abuse of sick leave and requiring, by way of discipline, that plaintiff provide a physician\u2019s statement in order to use sick time in the future. In addition, because plaintiff had taken an excessive amount of time off work during the previous 16-month period, Possich notified plaintiff that he would not be approved for any further trade time, vacation, or holiday leave for the remainder of the year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff was called in on May 4, presumably to receive the reprimand, but he refused and then did not report for his next shift on May 9. Possich and another firefighter delivered the reprimand to plaintiffs home on May 10, after which plaintiff filed a lengthy complaint alleging retaliation and harassment. Plaintiff retired May 31, 2006, and filed this action in state court on June 2, 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">After removal of the case to federal court and an opportunity for discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on several grounds. On October 3, 2007, 2007 WL 2900454, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motions, entered summary judgment in favor of defendants on the First Amendment claim, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. Plaintiff filed a timely motion to alter or amend judgment, which was denied in orders entered on November 7 and 13, 2007, 2007 WL 3396474. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">II.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). When an appeal is from the grant of summary judgment and the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider that decision, our review of both decisions is <em>de novo. Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 286, 289 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Smith v. Ameritech, </em>129 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">To state a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>plaintiff must show that he engaged in constitutionally protected speech, that he was subjected to adverse action or was deprived of some benefit, and that the speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action. <em>Brandenburg v. Hous. Auth. of Irvine, </em>253 F.3d 891, 897 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)). A public employee must meet additional standards to establish that the speech is constitutionally protected. <em>Leary v. Daesehner, </em>349 F.3d 888, 897 (6th Cir.2003). Specifically, the public employee plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that he was speaking as a citizen addressing matters of public concern; and (2) that his interest in addressing those matters of public concern outweighs his employer\u2019s interest \u201cin promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <em>see also Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 143, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). Although there may be factual questions about what expression occurred, we have recognized that both the issue of whether the speech addresses a matter of public concern and the application of the balancing test are questions of law that we review <em>de novo. Leary, </em>349 F.3d at 898; <em>Farhat v. Jopke, </em>370 F.3d 580, 589 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A. Matter of Public Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In general, speech addresses a matter of public concern when it \u201cinvolves \u2018issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to make informed decisions about the operation of their government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brandenburg, </em>253 F.3d at 898 (citation omitted). This is in contrast with internal personnel disputes or complaints about an employer\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Brown v. City of Trenton, </em>867 F.2d 318, 322 (6th Cir.1989)). \u201cWhether an employee\u2019s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684. While motivation is relevant, \u201cthe pertinent question is not <em>why </em>the employee spoke, but <em>what </em>he said.\u201d <em>Farhat, </em>370 F.3d at 591.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">This court has assumed that the classification of positions in public employment within or outside the civil service is a matter of public concern. <em>Dotson v. Abramson, </em>No. 93-6542, 1995 WL 9267 (6th Cir. Jan.10, 1995) (unpublished). Indeed, in <em>Connick, </em>the Court noted the \u201cdemonstrated interest in this country that government service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service.\u201d 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S.Ct. 1684. While defendants have not challenged the district court\u2019s findings in this regard, a brief summary is helpful in weighing the competing interests under <em>Pickering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">We turn first to the speech concerning the EMS Director and EMS Shift Supervisor positions, which the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>found did not touch on matters of public concern. In early 2003, it appeared that the EMS Director position might be filled by Deron Rambo. Plaintiff raised a number of objections to Rambo\u2019s eligibility for the position, and applied for the position himself. Plaintiff was interviewed, but no one was selected at that time. The position ultimately went to Greg Moore, a member of the union. As the district court found, the written documentation revealed that \u201cFitzpatrick\u2019s concerns were primarily over the perceived bias in favor of Rambo specifically, not over the future of the position within the civil service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Similarly, the district court found that the objections plaintiff voiced concerning the designation of three EMS Shift Supervisors did not mention civil service concerns. The Board of Commissioners ultimately rejected plaintiffs complaint, explaining that Shift Supervisor was only a temporary duty assignment. The district court added that even if civil service concerns underpinned plaintiffs objections, those concerns could not be objectively perceived to be the point of the grievances plaintiff brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Next, Possich created the position of Emergency Preparedness Coordinator outside the classified civil service, and selected Rambo to serve in that capacity. Plaintiff explained in his deposition that he never complained about the decision to create the position, only that Rambo was allowed to perform firefighting duties. This dispute, however, was also included in the letter that was the \u201ccall to arms\u201d to defend the civil service. As a result, the district court assumed that plaintiffs speech regarding this position touched on matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Plaintiffs opposition to the proposal that the Assistant Fire Chief position be removed from the civil service was the only speech specifically found to address a matter of public concern. In a March 2006 letter resigning from the union, Greg Moore charged that the union was pressing \u201cmainly personal agenda items often tearing at our department.\u201d Plaintiffs response, set forth in the open letter already mentioned, restated the disputes regarding the EMS Director and Shift Supervisor positions, defended the union\u2019s objections to the scope of the duties of the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, and characterized the proposed change to the Assistant Chief position as an \u201cassault\u201d on the civil service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Finally, a public employee\u2019s speech, activity, or association does not address a matter of public concern merely because it is union related. <em>Boals v. Gray, </em>775 F.2d 686, 692 (6th Cir.1985). Here, plaintiff does not contest the district court\u2019s determination that even when his speech addressed union issues, it was directed at personnel or internal policy issues rather than a matter of public concern. \"While plaintiffs union membership was recognized as expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, claims of retaliation for expressive association are analyzed under Pickering\u2019s two-part balancing test as well. <em>Id.] see also Akers v. McGinnis, </em>352 F.3d 1030, 1036 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">B. <em>Pickering </em>Balancing Test</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Once it is determined that at least some speech or association is protected, <em>Pickering </em>instructs us to balance Fitzpatrick\u2019s interest in addressing these matters or associating with the union against the City\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency and maintaining discipline in the public service. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150, 103 S.Ct. 1684; <em>Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. The Court has explained that the government \u201cmust have wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs,\u201d including \u201cthe pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>rogative to remove employees whose conduct hinders efficient operation,\u201d because \u201c [prolonged retention of a disruptive or otherwise unsatisfactory employee can adversely affect discipline and morale in the work place, foster disharmony, and ultimately impair the efficiency of an office or agency.\u201d 461 U.S. at 151, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). These interests have particular resonance in the context of public safety departments, where loyalty, discipline, and workplace harmony are especially important. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. City of Trenton, </em>867 F.2d 318, 322-23 (6th Cir.1989); <em>McMurphy v. City of Flushing, </em>802 F.2d 191 (6th Cir.1986). The district court, referring to these interests as \u201cesprit de corps\u201d concerns, found plaintiffs protected expression was disruptive to discipline and workplace harmony such that defendants were justified in taking the actions plaintiff alleges were retaliatory. <em>See Meyers v. City of Cincinnati, </em>934 F.2d 726, 730 (6th Cir.1991) (\u201c[W]e look for evidence of the impact of the statement on the city\u2019s legitimate organizational interests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Plaintiff argues on appeal that it was clear error to find his speech and association impaired the \u201cesprit de corps\u201d of the department. In support, plaintiff relies on testimony from several superiors, including: the statement from plaintiffs captain that he never had cause to reprimand or discipline plaintiff; the opinion of Lt. Travis that plaintiff was a team-oriented person who was good in the station and with the public; and the acknowledgment by Possich and Unger that many of the issues raised were valid concerns about safety that involved staffing levels, equipment upgrades, and policies and procedures. This evidence, however, does not undermine the district court\u2019s finding that the protected speech and association undermined Possich\u2019s authority and impaired the \u201cesprit de corps\u201d of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The government\u2019s burden to show adequate justification for its acts varies depending on the nature of the employee\u2019s protected expression. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 150, 103 S.Ct. 1684. That is, the greater the extent to which the speech involves matters of public concern, the stronger the employer\u2019s showing must be. <em>Id. </em>It is not necessary, however, \u201cfor an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 103 S.Ct. 1684.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment that the record reflects the disruptive nature of plaintiffs repeated objections and grievances concerning Rambo\u2019s position as Emergency Preparedness Coordinator and the proposal to remove the Assistant Fire Chief position from the civil service. Plaintiff testified that he brought these issues up in union meetings and got the union to support his complaints. With plaintiffs later distribution of the \u201ccall to arms\u201d letter to union membership in the workplace, plaintiffs speech openly encouraged dissension by inciting the union membership to \u201cfight\u201d the department\u2019s decisions on these issues. Plaintiffs letter announced that the union was seeking legal advice about blocking the change to the Assistant Chief position. It is also beyond dispute that plaintiff used his association with the union as a vehicle for voicing opposition to Possich\u2019s decisions. The district court did not err in finding that this showing met defendants\u2019 burden. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 153, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (emphasizing that \u201c \u2018the employing agency\u2019s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employee\u2019s message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Further, we can not ignore evidence of dissension in the department, disharmony between eoworkers, and impairment of discipline reflected in the opposing letters sent in the wake of plaintiffs \u201ccall to arms.\u201d In early April 2006, an unsigned letter on union stationary was written to the Board of Commissioners to express the union\u2019s \u201cextreme displeasure\u201d with the leadership provided by Possich and asking that they intervene on behalf of the firefighters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That letter complained specifically that there were firefighters working in supervisory roles without testing through the civil service process. This \u201cno confidence\u201d letter summarized by saying that Possich\u2019s inaction on several issues \u201chas produced feelings of distrust and disrespect throughout the ranks of the department and the inconsistencies in his leadership have caused a severe lack of confidence in his future capacities to take the department forward progressively and professionally.\u201d A response dated April 21, 2006, was sent to commissioners and city officials to express confidence in Possich\u2019s leadership and attribute the \u201clatest attack\u201d on Possich to a few disgruntled employees. This letter also blamed the drop in union membership to fewer than half of the firefighters on \u201cseveral [other] letters of similar tone and nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Finally, plaintiff argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants because there is a \u201cclassic genuine issue of material fact\u201d regarding the motivation for the change in supervisors. Plaintiff specifically emphasizes that Possich, Boggs, and Unger denied making the statements relied upon to draw the inference of retaliation. This argument misapprehends the issue. While it is true that the evidence was disputed on this point, we, like the district court, have assumed that there was a \u201cmanipulation\u201d of the supervisory assignments in retaliation for plaintiffs protected speech or association. This is clear from the district court\u2019s conclusion that if the assignment of Boggs to supervise plaintiffs crew was motivated by a \u201cdesire to \u2018straighten Fitzpatrick out,\u2019 i.e., suppress his disruptive speech, then it is clear that the Defendants reasonably relied on the \u2018esprit de corps\u2019 objective in authorizing the transfer.\u201d If the decision was made, as Unger apparently suggested, only to more effectively supervise plaintiffs \u201cride time\u201d and training hours, that would not be actionable retaliation for First Amendment purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-17\">. Plaintiff does not separately challenge the decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims for constructive discharge, outrageous conduct, and punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">. This resulted in a complaint by another firefighter, who characterized plaintiff's shortfall in hours as a result of a failure of supervision, accused Possich of giving plaintiff preferential treatment, and complained that this resolution further undermined already poor morale. Possich acknowledged these concerns as legitimate, but stood by the determination that it was best if plaintiff no longer worked as a primary paramedic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. Possich reported, and plaintiff does not dispute, that although scheduled for 122 days in 2005, plaintiff only worked 23 full duty shifts (8 of which were doing Hurricane Katrina relief work) and 16 partial duty shifts during that year. Over the previous 16 months, plaintiff worked a total of 29 full duty and 17 partial duty shifts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. It appears that plaintiff had decided to retire sometime before April 27, 2006, but it is not clear when Possich became aware of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">. Possich also argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity because the plaintiff's First Amendment rights were not clearly established at the time. Concluding, as the district court did, that plaintiff cannot demonstrate a constitutional violation, we do not reach this issue. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The first step in the qualified-immunity analysis is to determine whether the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, show that a constitutional violation occurred. <em>Feathers v. Aey, </em>319 F.3d 843, 848 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. The Supreme Court has clarified that a public employee does not speak as a citizen on matters of public concern when the expressions are made \"pursuant to his or her official responsibilities.\" <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 424, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). Here, defendants conceded that the speech at issue was not made pursuant to the official duties of plaintiff's employment. <em>Compare Weisbarth v. Geauga Park Dist., </em>499 F.3d 538, 542-47 (6th Cir.2007) (holding that plaintiff's comments made to a consultant hired by the employer to perform a departmental evaluation were not made as a citizen as required for First Amendment protection).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">.

Similarly, to the extent that plaintiff may argue that the reprimand in May 2006 was not driven by a retaliatory motive, the disciplinary action is irrelevant to this retaliation claim. The district court reasoned that if plaintiff's allegations about selective withholding of leave time are accurate, then the reprimand restricting and denying plaintiff leave may be seen as punishment intended to curtail plaintiff's disruptive speech. The district court explained that: \"The fact that these reprimands did not explicitly focus on limiting the scope of Fitzpatrick\u2019s speech does not cast doubt on the \"esprit de corps\u201d motivations. When an employer decides to discipline an employee in the hope of reducing the employee's disruptive behavior, and thus promote workplace harmony, the employer may pursue the discipline in many different ways. It is not the duty of the courts to require government employers to utilize the most optimal, or even the most obvious, ways of promoting \u2018esprit de corps.' Instead, the courts are instructed to defer to government employers' judgment on their disciplinary and personnel decisions.\u201d 7 draft.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
