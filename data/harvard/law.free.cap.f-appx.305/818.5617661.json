Kevin Castel, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Defendant-appellant Ramiro Lopez-Imitola<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the June 6, 2006 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Patterson, J.), convicting him, upon a plea of guilty, of one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and one count of conspiracy to import heroin into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 968, and sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of 40 years and, thereafter, 5 years of supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the case\u2019s procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We do not decide whether Lopez-Imitola has standing to assert the rule of specialty as a basis to challenge his sentence because his argument fails on the merits. <em>See United States v. Cuevas, </em>496 F.3d 256, 262 (2d Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Banks, </em>464 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Baez, </em>349 F.3d 90 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam) compels the conclusion that the rule of specialty was not violated in this case. Even if the district court\u2019s sentence of 40 years were deemed to be a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment,\u201d the sentence did not breach the Diplomatic Note that preceded appellant\u2019s extradition from Colombia because it, like the note in <em>Baez, </em>\u201cexpressly contemplated the possibility that a sentencing court might impose a term of life imprisonment and assured Colombia that, if that occurred, the executive authority of the United States would seek to have the sentence commuted to a term of years.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Lopez-Imitola does not argue that the Government breached its commitment \u201cto seek to have the sentence commuted to a terms of years,\u201d nor could he, because the sentence is plainly for a term of years. As the District Court noted, Lopez-Imitola\u2019s argument that the Government breached the agreement by seeking a sentence of 60 years, which he asserts is the functional equivalent of life imprisonment, fails for the same reason. Had the respective governments intended the Diplomatic Note to be an assurance that the U.S. government would not request a determinate sentence exceeding Lopez-Imitola\u2019s expected lifespan, they could have drafted the note to say that. They chose instead to require simply that the government seek a sentence of \u201ca term of years\u201d rather than \u201clife imprisonment.\u201d The Government fulfilled that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-16\">. Lopez-Imitola\u2019s name is misspelled as \u201cLopez-Imitalo\u201d on the official caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
