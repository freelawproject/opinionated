Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review legal and constitutional issues de novo. <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss the petition for review in No. 05-75321, deny the petition for review in No. 05-76721, and dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review in No. 06-71133.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In his opening brief, Mariscal-Caro fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Mariscal-Caro failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). Moreover, Mariseal-Caro\u2019s contention that the IJ violated his due process rights by disregarding evidence is not supported by the record and therefore does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We also lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of voluntary departure. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f). Mariseal-Caro\u2019s due process claim regarding the denial of voluntary departure is not colorable. <em>See Martinez-Rosas, </em>424 F.3d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Contrary to Mariseal-Caro\u2019s contention, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the hardship standard in his case falls within the broad range authorized by the statute. <em>See Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004-06 (9th Cir.2003); <em>cf. Alvarez Figueroa v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 487 (9th Cir.2008). Mariseal-Caro\u2019s contention regarding moral character is unavailing because the agency denied cancellation of removal solely on the ground of hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Because the BIA reissued its July 5, 2005 order dismissing Mariseal-Caro\u2019s appeal, Mariscal-Caro has not demonstrated prejudice from the BIA\u2019s alleged failure properly to notify him of its decision. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Finally, we dismiss the petition for review in No. 05-75321 as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">No. 05-75321: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">No. 05-76721: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">No. 06-71133: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b401-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
