We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Marcu v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1080-81 (9th Cir.1998), and we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that country conditions had changed sufficiently to rebut any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution that Gaysinskiy had as a Jew in Ukraine. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-25\"><em>As </em>Gaysinskiy failed meet his burden to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-26\">Because both the IJ and BIA failed to consider Gaysinskiy\u2019s CAT claim, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>mand for the agency to determine it in the first instance. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A-a\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
