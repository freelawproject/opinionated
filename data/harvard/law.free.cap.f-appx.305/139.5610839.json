Applewhite\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the calculation of Applewhite\u2019s criminal history and the reasonableness of his sentence. Although advised of his right to do so, Applewhite has declined to file a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Applewhite first contends the district court erroneously ascribed two criminal history points for convictions he did not sustain. Because Applewhite did not raise this issue before the district, court, our review is for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Applewhite provides no evidence suggesting the two challenged convictions were improperly counted, and there is no basis in the record on which to find the district court committed any error\u2014let alone plain error\u2014in calculating Applewhite\u2019s criminal history. Accordingly, we reject this basis for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">We further conclude Applewhite\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The Supreme Court has instructed that, \u201c[rjegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate courts are charged with reviewing sentences for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 597. Reasonableness review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>In determining whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we first assess whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range. Id at 596-97. We must then consider whether the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors and any arguments presented by the parties, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the selected sentence. <em>Id </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). Finally, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). We afford sentences that presumption of reasonableness, <em>see id, </em>a presumption permitted by the Supreme Court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The district court properly calculated Applewhite\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and invited counsel to make any relevant argument pursuant to the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. After hearing counsel\u2019s arguments, permitting Apple-white the opportunity to allocute, and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Applewhite to a total of fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment, which is within the properly calculated Guidelines range. As our review of the record reveals no procedural or substantive defect in Applewhite\u2019s sentence, we conclude Applewhite cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2459, 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Although not raised by counsel, we further note there was no infirmity in Applewhite\u2019s conviction. The district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in conducting Apple-white\u2019s plea hearing. The district court advised Applewhite regarding his rights under federal law, the nature and elements of the charges to which he was pleading guilty, and the applicable statutory mandatory minimum, statutory maximum, and period of supervised release. The court also questioned Applewhite to ensure he was competent to plead guilty. Apple-white informed the court that, prior to signing the plea agreement, he had discussed it with his attorney, with whom he was satisfied. The district court further accepted the written factual basis of Applewhite\u2019s guilty plea. There simply was no Rule 11 error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entirety of the record and found no meritorious issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We further deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from representation. We require that counsel inform Applewhite, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Applewhite requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Applewhite. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\"> The district court calculated that Applewhite\u2019s total adjusted offense level for Counts 7 and 9 was fourteen, and that he had four criminal history points. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2B1.1 (a)(1)(B), (b)(1)(F) (2007). Thus, with a category III criminal history, Applewhite\u2019s advisory Guidelines range on Counts 7 and 9 was twenty-one to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. USSG ch. 5, pt. A, sentencing table. Applewhite also faced a mandatory twenty-four month consecutive sentence on Count 8. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l); USSG \u00a7 2B1.6 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
