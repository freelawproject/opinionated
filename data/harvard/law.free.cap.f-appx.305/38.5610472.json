Johnson pleaded guilty to, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The District Court sentenced Johnson to 60 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release and a $100 special assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Johnson contends his sentence is unreasonable because the District Court failed to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors in its sentencing decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">To withstand appellate review, sentences must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, for a sentence to be procedurally reasonable, the record must indicate the' sentencing court engaged in a \u201cmeaningful consideration of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 203 (3d Cir.2007). But, a district court need not \u201cdiscuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d so long as \u201cthe record makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Second, to establish substantive reasonableness, the sentence must be \u201cpremised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006). We give deference to a district court\u2019s sentencing decision out of recognition that the trial court is \u201cin the best position to determine the appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. Deference to the sentencing court is particularly strong when a sentence falls within the Guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that a reasonableness presumption for within-Guidelines sentences \u201creflects the fact that ... <em>both, </em>the sentencing judge and the Sentencing Commission ... have reached the <em>same </em>conclusion as to the proper sentence in the particular case,\u201d and \u201cdouble determination significantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">First, we conclude the District Court\u2019s sentencing decision was procedurally reasonable. Johnson contends the District Court failed to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when determining his sentence, and instead focused all its attention on Johnson\u2019s use of marijuana during the sentencing continuance. The transcript negates this claim. The District Court conducted a thorough sentencing hearing, at the conclusion of which the Court expressly stated it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and addressed a number of those factors specifically. The District Court considered Johnson\u2019s history of hazardous conduct and drug convictions, his danger to society, the seriousness of his offense, and specific deterrence. We find the District Court engaged in a \u201cmeaningful consideration of the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors,\u201d <em>Lessner, </em>498 F.3d at 203. Accordingly, its sentencing decision was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Second, the sentence is substantively reasonable. Johnson contends the evidence he had used drugs during the sentencing continuance clouded the District Court\u2019s judgment such that his sentence does not reflect a reasonable application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Johnson\u2019s argument is not consistent with the record. As the transcript makes clear, the court recognized its <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing discretion and, based on reasonable application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the circumstances of Johnson\u2019s case, imposed a sentence that falls within the recommended Guidelines range:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>This court has considered all the factors set forth in the guidelines under 18 United States Code Section 3553(a), and has considered the characteristics of the defendant as articulated here at the sentencing. This court finds that this defendant\u2019s sentence, which does not include departure, because the court, understanding its discretion, has rejected the departure, is sufficient, but not more than reasonably necessary to meet the goal of sentencing in this offense. The sentence reflects the sei\u2019ious nature of the defendant\u2019s crime and the defendant\u2019s prior criminal history [and reflects the need] to punish the defendant as well as to deter him from future criminal acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Accordingly, taking into account the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and recognizing \u201cthe trial court is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, we conclude the sentence imposed by the district court \u201cfalls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 218 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-14\">. At the sentencing hearing, Johnson requested a sentence below the range recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The basis for his request was twofold: First, Johnson attempted to persuade the court that he was not in danger of recidivism because he stopped using drugs and turned his life around. Second, Johnson requested the court be sympathetic in light of his need to arm himself because of death-threats he received from neighborhood rivals. The District Court decided to postpone the sentencing hearing and allow further investigation into the veracity of Johnson\u2019s arguments. The sentencing hearing was reconvened approximately 6 weeks later. At that time, the court considered additional arguments and evidence\u2014including evidence Johnson had used marijuana during the continuance\u2014which militated against Johnson\u2019s earlier pleas for lenience. Sentence was imposed at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">.
