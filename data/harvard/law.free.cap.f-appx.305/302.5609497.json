United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). Miller pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In his appeal, Miller argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was an armed career criminal, subject to the statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and by enhancing his advisory guideline range based on his possession of a firearm in connection with another felony, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Prior to the instant offense, Miller had sustained three prior felony convictions for theft of a motor vehicle, two for attempted theft of a vehicle, and two for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, all in Minnesota. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.52, subd. 2(17). Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), a statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment applies if at least three of Miller\u2019s prior convictions are \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). In a prior opinion, we held that Miller\u2019s three convictions for auto theft qualified as violent felonies and affirmed the judgment of the district court. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>223 Fed.Appx. 522 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2047, 170 L.Ed.2d 789 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">After this case was remanded, another panel of this court, relying on <em>Begay, </em>overruled circuit precedent and held that auto theft in Missouri is not a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>537 F.3d 969, 974-75 (8th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>546 F.3d 961 (8th Cir.2008). Miller was prosecuted under the theft statute in Minnesota, which provides that a person commits theft if he \u201ctakes or drives a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner or an authorized agent of the owner,\u201d knowing or having reason to know that consent was lacking. Minn-Stat. \u00a7 609.52, subd. 2(17). In light of <em>Williams, </em>our court has held that auto theft in Minnesota is not a crime of violence for purposes of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>United States v. Aleman, </em>548 F.3d 1158, 1167-68 (8th Cir.2008). The <em>Williams </em>opinion stated that the inquiry applicable to \u00a7 4B1.2 also governs whether an offense is a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e), and thus effectively abrogated circuit precedent holding that auto theft in Missouri is a violent felony. <em>See United States v. Sprouse, </em>394 F.3d 578, 581 (8th Cir.2005). It follows from <em>Williams </em>and <em>Aleman </em>that Miller\u2019s conviction for auto theft in Minnesota is not a violent felony, and that <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>406 F.3d 1074, 1076 (8th Cir.2005), is no longer controlling. The convictions for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, which were based on the same statute, and for the lesser included offense of attempted auto theft, also do not qualify. Accordingly, Miller should not have been sentenced as an armed career criminal, and the statutory minimum of sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for resentencing. We decline at this juncture to address Miller\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory guideline range. <em>See United States v. Huber, </em>404 F.3d 1047, 1063 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
