McCarthy seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision upholding a removal order issued by an immigration judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>McCarthy was ordered removed to Jamaica on the ground that he was an alien subject to removal because of his conviction for a federal crime that qualified as an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii) (providing for the removal of aliens \u201cconvicted of an aggravated felony\u201d); <em>id. </em>(B)(i) (same for aliens convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>federal controlled substance violations \u201cother than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of <em>30 </em>grams or less of marijuana\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Although we lack jurisdiction to review removal orders against criminal aliens, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we have limited jurisdiction to consider \u201cconstitutional questions or questions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). On appeal, McCarthy raises such questions, and we review them de novo. <em>See Abou-Haidar v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 206, 207 (1st Cir.2006) (so stating with respect to the question whether an alien has been naturalized); <em>accord Julce v. Mukasey, </em>530 F.3d 30, 33 n. 3 (1st Cir.2008) (whether a conviction constitutes an aggravated felony); <em>Urena-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir.2003) (whether a conviction constitutes a controlled substance offense); <em>Gonz\u00e1lez-Mes\u00edas v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir.2008) (constitutional questions). Finding no merit in any of McCarthy\u2019s arguments, we deny the petition in part and otherwise dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">1. McCarthy\u2019s strongest point in support of his argument that he is a United States national \u2014 and not an alien subject to removal \u2014 is that he is a lawful permanent resident who swore allegiance to this country and filed an application for citizenship. But McCarthy\u2019s failure to complete the naturalization process dooms his argument. <em>See Abou-Haidar, supra, </em>437 F.3d at 207-08. We have rejected the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit case that McCarthy relies on, <em>id. </em>at 207 n. 4 (disagreeing with <em>United States v. Morin, </em>80 F.3d 124, 126 (4th Cir.1996)), and the Fourth Circuit itself has concluded that <em>Morin </em>is no longer authoritative. <em>See Fernandez v. Keisler, </em>502 F.3d 337, 347-48 (4th Cir.2007) (majority opinion), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 65, 172 L.Ed.2d 62 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">2. McCarthy\u2019s conviction for possessing with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) \u2014 for which he received a 121-month prison term, as his written criminal judgment shows \u2014 satisfied the prerequisites in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), and so constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>See id. </em>(defining an \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201ca drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18)\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (defining \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to mean \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.)\u201d). McCarthy\u2019s arguments to the contrary are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Conteh v. Gonzales, </em>461 F.3d 45, 59, 62 (1st Cir.2006) (majority opinion) (concluding that in removal proceedings the government need only show that an alien has been convicted of a crime involving \u201cevery element\u201d of the relevant \u00a7 1101(a)(43) offense and may rely on the conviction records to meet its burden of proof), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3003, 168 L.Ed.2d 732 (2007); <em>Julce, supra, 530 F.3d </em>at 35-36 (concluding that an alien in removal proceedings has the burden of show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ing that the marijuana misdemeanor described in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(4) applies; and that if he fails to meet his burden, then a \u00a7 841(a)(1) conviction is deemed \u201cpunishable as a felony\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D)).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">3. The government bears the burden of proving that the statutory controlled substance exception for \u201ca single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana\u201d does not apply. <em>Medina v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 1063, 1065 n. 5 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Sandoval v. INS, </em>240 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir.2001)). Contrary to McCarthy\u2019s contention, it satisfied that burden by submitting McCarthy\u2019s conviction records documenting his 121-month sentence. His sentence would have been capped at 60 months if his offense had involved \u201c30 grams or less\u201d of marijuana. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) (providing for a statutory <em>maximum </em>of 5 years for offenses involving \u201cless than 50 kilograms\u201d of marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">4. For present purposes, we assume that McCarthy properly exhausted his constitutional and international law arguments opposing his removal on the ground that it would deny him his right to \u201cfamilial integrity.\u201d <em>See Royal Siam Corp. v. Chettoff, </em>484 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir.2007) (indicating that this court has sometimes bypassed problematical jurisdictional questions in immigration cases where \u201cprecedent clearly adumbrates the result on the merits\u201d). A recent decision by this court shows that McCarthy cannot prevail on his claims. <em>See Payne-Barahona v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 1, 2-4 (1st Cir.2007) (concluding that an \u201cotherwise valid deportation\u201d does not violate constitutional due process, that the international conventions at issue here do not have \u201cthe force of domestic law,\u201d and that, in any event, their conflicting provisions would give way to the \u201cclear intent of Congress\u201d found in the immigration statute\u2019s removal provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\n<em>The petition for revieiv is denied in part and otherwise dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">. On November 4, 2008, the government filed a notice of intent to remove McCarthy \"on or after November 20, 2008.\u201d Given the collateral consequences of being removed as an aggravated felon, McCarthy\u2019s removal would not moot his petition for review. <em>Leitao v. Reno, </em>311 F.3d 453, 456 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
