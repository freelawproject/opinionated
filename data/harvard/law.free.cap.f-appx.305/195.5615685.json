He appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Hatcher argues that he is entitled to tolling of the one-year limitations period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) for filing a \u00a7 2254 application because the combination of two factors establishes rare and exceptional circumstances that warrant equitable tolling: (1) His trial counsel refused to provide him with a copy of counsel\u2019s file, and (2) the state habeas court denied his request for an order compelling production of the file or alternatively for a hearing. Hatcher contends that the state habeas court\u2019s action constituted a state-created impediment to the timely filing of his \u00a7 2254 application. Hatcher, who filed his application on November 17, 2006, does not contest the district court\u2019s determination that, absent tolling, the one-year limitations period expired on October 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">. The limitations period runs from the latest of several dates, including \u201cthe date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). Thus, under the statute, the impediment must be unconstitutional for tolling to apply. See <em>Flanagan v. Johnson, </em>154 F.3d 196, 198-99 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The state habeas court granted Hatcher\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing with respect to his effort to obtain a copy of his trial counsel\u2019s file. Although Hatcher complains that the hearing was done by affidavits rather than live testimony, he did not allege that the state habeas court created an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d impediment that prevented him from timely filing his federal habeas application. In the absence of such an allegation, the statutory exception in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) does not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The limitations period may be equitably tolled, but only in rare and exceptional circumstances. <em>Felder v. Johnson, </em>204 F.3d 168, 170-171 (5th Cir.2000). Hatcher has not shown that not having possession of his trial counsel\u2019s file prevented him from filing his application, as opposed to proving his claims. <em>See Flanagan, </em>154 F.3d at 199 (holding that \u00a7 2244(d) \u201cdoes not convey a statutory right to an extended delay ... while a habeas petitioner gathers every possible scrap of evidence that might, by negative implication, <em>support </em>his claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Hatcher was able to file his state habeas application without first obtaining a copy of his trial counsel\u2019s file, and he ultimately, if belatedly, also filed his \u00a7 2254 application without first obtaining a copy. <em>See id. </em>at 198-99. He has not shown that lack of possession of the file prevented him from filing his application on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Hatcher has not carried his burden of establishing rare and exceptional circumstances for equitable tolling. <em>See Felder, </em>204 F.3d at 170-71. He has not established that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for tolling. <em>See Larry v. Dretke, </em>361 F.3d 890, 897 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
