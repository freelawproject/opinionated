Davis argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1. The enhancement was based, in part, upon two convictions that Davis received in 2006:(1) a conviction in Maryland state court for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, for which Davis failed to appear for sentencing, resulting in issuance of a bench warrant for his arrest; and (2) a conviction in South Carolina state court for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, for which he was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment, all of which was suspended, and 30 months\u2019 probation. He contends that the convictions in 2006 did not disrupt his ongoing criminal conduct because he was never imprisoned for them, and because he was never sentenced for the conviction in Maryland and could still move to withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing. Accordingly, he avers the state convictions did not constitute prior convictions under the Guidelines but rather relevant conduct associated with his federal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">In assessing whether a district court properly applied the Guidelines, we review the lower court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Chacon, </em>533 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2008). The provisions of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 are applicable to the counting of prior convictions for career offender purposes. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n. 3. \u201cThe term \u2018prior sentence\u2019 means <em>any sentence </em>previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) (emphasis added). The term \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d is separately defined in USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Conduct is part of the instant offense if it is relevant conduct under guideline section 1B1.3. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) cmt. n. 1. Under guideline section lB1.3(a)(2), relevant conduct includes acts that were part of the \u201csame course of conduct or common scheme or plan\u201d as the offense of conviction when the offenses are the type which would be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). However, as noted by Application Note 8 to USSG \u00a7 1B1.3, \u201coffense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d When a defendant has been convicted of an offense, but not yet sentenced, the conviction shall be countable if a sentence resulting from that conviction otherwise would be countable. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 (a)(4). A defendant is \u201cconvicted of an offense\u201d under this provision when guilt has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">We hold that the district court did not err in sentencing Davis as a career offender based upon his prior convictions in 2006. The guidelines do not require that a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d be imposed in order for a prior conviction to be counted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>part of a defendant\u2019s criminal history. An offense for which a defendant has been convicted, by guilty plea or otherwise, but not yet sentenced, may nonetheless be counted for purposes of determining the defendant\u2019s criminal history. The guidelines do not indicate that counting a prior conviction resulting from a guilty plea can be impacted by the possibility of withdrawing the plea. Moreover, we note that the state offenses at issue each occurred in different states from each other and from the federal offense, and were separated in time from the'federal offense by eleven months and eighteen months, respectively. Accordingly, the district court properly viewed the state offenses as prior offenses rather than relevant conduct associated with the federal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the' materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
