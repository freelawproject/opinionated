Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the agency\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the beatings Miroyan received and the death of his son were not shown to be conducted by the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>or persons the government is unable or unwilling to control. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005). He therefore has not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Because Miroyan failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review Miroyan\u2019s contention regarding his membership in the social group of individuals who observed irregularities in voting because he failed to make that argument before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b421-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
