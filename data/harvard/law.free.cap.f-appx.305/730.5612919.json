Mar. 12, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 156 264 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">When the BIA adopts and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Passi v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen was not credible. As the IJ found, while Chen testified that he was released from jail after his father paid a fee of 10,000 RMB, he omitted that assertion from his asylum application. The IJ also properly found that while Chen submitted a document purporting to be a dismissal notice from his employer, he did not testify that he was fired, nor did he include that assertion in his written application. Chen failed to provide a sufficiently compelling explanation for these omissions. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Because Chen\u2019s alleged dismissal from his job represents one of two incidents of harm that he experienced as a result of Falun Gong, its omission was not the type of \u201clegally irrelevant fact\u201d that should be excused by this Court. <em>See Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>cf. Heui Soo Kim v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 40, 47 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">The IJ also properly found implausible Chen\u2019s testimony that in order to depart China, he used a passport provided by a smuggler with Chen\u2019s name, date of birth, place of birth, and address, but bearing someone else\u2019s photograph. In light of Chen\u2019s testimony that he had failed to keep two appointments with public security officials, the IJ properly found it implausible that he left the country using his own name and biographical information. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">The IJ also found that Chen\u2019s testimony was not believable because it appeared to be highly scripted and because he was unable to testify in \u201chis own dialect,\u201d Foo Chow. We accord particular deference to such assessments of demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Finally, the IJ properly found that Chen\u2019s failure to provide evidence to corroborate his claim that he practiced Falun Gong in the United States bolstered the IJ\u2019s view that Chen was not credible. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Ultimately, the IJ was entitled to rely on the cumulative effect of her findings regarding Chen\u2019s demeanor, material omissions, implausible aspects of Chen\u2019s testimony, and Chen\u2019s failure to submit corroboration of a central aspect of his claim. <em>See Tu Liu v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). Because the only evidence of a threat to Chen\u2019s life or freedom was his own testimony, the adverse credibility determination as to that testimony precludes his success on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, all three of which claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Chen asserts that the IJ should have adjourned proceedings to explore the possibility that he had a \u201cmental\u201d disability that caused him to testify inconsistently. However, while Chen\u2019s attorney did raise the possibility of a learning disability before the IJ, as the BIA found, neither Chen nor his attorney objected to proceeding with the hearing in Mandarin. In any event, Chen\u2019s argument, which we construe as a due process challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application, fails because he does not show how he was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s decision to go forward with his case. <em>See Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir.2008). Moreover, while Chen suggests that his attorney before the IJ had rendered ineffective assistance, such a claim should have been made in the first instance to the BIA. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2007); <em>Stewart v. U.S.I.N.S., </em>181 F.3d 587, 596 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
