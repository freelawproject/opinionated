We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 618 (9th Cir.2006), we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-24\">An intervening change in the law requires us to remand. In <em>Ibarrar-Flores, </em>we held that administrative voluntary departure under threat of deportation breaks the accrual of continuous physical presence only where the alien is informed of the terms of the departure and knowingly and voluntarily accepts them. <em>See </em>439 F.3d at 619-20; <em>see also Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997, 1004 (9th Cir.2005). There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>indication in the record that MartinezRoldan was informed of the terms of his departure or that he accepted them knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The agency \u201cshould be given the first opportunity to assess the consequences of [Martinez-Roldan\u2019s] departure under the \u2018knowing and voluntary\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Ibarra-Flores, </em>439 F.3d at 620. We therefore grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b422-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
