Lu is a citizen of China from Fujian Province who entered this country illegally no later than in 1993<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and unsuccessfully applied to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) for asylum on November 28, 1993. Lu has remained in this country since his entry even though an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) ordered him removed on April 16, 1997, and the BIA on May 29, 1998, upheld that order. While remaining in this country since his illegal entry he has asserted in four unsuccessful attempts to reopen his proceedings that he was eligible for asylum but has shifted his theories advanced to establish that claim to include persecution under China\u2019s family planning policies, membership in Falun Gong, and participation in the Chinese student pro-democracy protests. Nevertheless all of his applications have failed because of his lack of credibility. But he has not departed this country, and neither the INS nor the Department of Homeland Security has removed him physically.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">Lu\u2019s brief on this petition is remarkable because in his statement of the case, after describing the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his original appeal, its next statement is that \u201cPetitioner\u2019s most recent motion to reopen his proceedings was denied by the BIA on July 13, 2007.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s br. at 2. It then goes on to tell us that the motion now before the Court is predicated on \u201cnew facts that are material and crucial, but were previously unavailable to [him] at the time of his previous motion to reopen,\u201d the new facts relating to forced abortions and sterilizations pursuant to China\u2019s family planning policies. <em>Id. </em>Thus, a person reading Lu\u2019s brief might believe that this petition involves Lu\u2019s second attempt to reopen his asylum proceedings rather than his fourth such attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">The record indicates that Lu has engaged in serial frauds in this country related to his entry and attempt to avoid removal. Thus, the evidence shows that he submitted a counterfeit passport and used another person\u2019s name and passport to enter the country and testified falsely at subsequent hearings. Moreover, his use of shifting theories to explain why he is entitled to asylum demonstrates that he will attempt to stay in this country without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>regal\u2019d for the truth of his evidence supporting his attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In its decision and order of June 13, 2007, after pointing out that it had denied Lu\u2019s previous motions to reopen in 2000, 2003, and 2004, the BIA set forth its decision that Lu\u2019s current \u201cmotion to reopen is untimely and number barred and will be denied in the exercise of discretion.\u201d App. at 2. The BIA explained that the time and number limits do not apply to motions to reopen predicated on material and previously unavailable evidence of changed circumstances in the country of nationality. It explained that the question whether Lu\u2019s present motion fell within an exception to the time and number limits depends on whether he had presented evidence that \u201cdemonstrates changed circumstances in China that are material to his claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In a critical aspect of the case reflecting Lu\u2019s alleged sterilization concern, the BIA noted that he had submitted his personal affidavit and a letter \u201cpurportedly\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the Village Committee in Changle City in Fujian directing that he \u201cmust report to [the] family planning office within one week of [his] arrival and undergo [a] sterilization procedure on an appointed date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The BIA also indicated that Lu had submitted other documents in support of his motion. The BIA then said that it would \u201cdeny the motion in the exercise of discretion,\u201d citing our opinion in <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 561-62 (3d Cir.2004), as support for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In exercising its discretion the BIA described Lu\u2019s history of filing motions to reopen and indicated that he never had \u201caddressed the prior adverse credibility determination.\u201d App. at 3. It then said that \u201cgiven the prior document fraud filing, we are not persuaded as to the reliability of [Liu\u2019s] affidavit and the letter from the village committee.\u201d App. at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Ultimately the BIA concluded its decision by indicating that Lu\u2019s motion was time-barred and did not meet an exception to the restrictions on motions to reopen. It then stated dual bases for denial of Lu\u2019s motion. First it said that neither it nor an IJ \u201chas jurisdiction to consider a new application for asylum in proceedings that are administratively final and where the standards for reopening are not satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Then it indicated that \u201cwe deny the motion in the exercise of our discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The BIA had jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), and we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. There are two standards of review applicable to this petition. First we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Guo, </em>386 F.3d at 562. Second, again using a deferential standard, we uphold the BIA\u2019s factual determinations if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Thus, we can reject the BIA\u2019s factual findings only if \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id.; 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">We will deny the petition for review. How could we do anything else? Clearly the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen brought by this serial litigator. Moreover, in reaching our result we are aware of the Supreme Court in <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), which indicated that motions to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>open are disfavored because delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">We recognize the point that the Attorney General makes in his brief that \u201c[w]ithholding of removal is mandatory once the Attorney General determines that [the] alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened because of a protected trait or activity.\u201d Respondent\u2019s br. at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, it is possible that if Lu had met the burden of proof for withholding of removal that, notwithstanding his abuse of the system, he would be entitled to that relief. But he did not meet that burden of proof because in an unassailable finding the BIA rejected his critical evidence on the point, the letter from the Village Committee stating that he would have to report for sterilization when he returned to China. The BIA did not accept the legitimacy of this letter and we cannot overturn this action under our standard of review. Thus, even taking into account Lu\u2019s other evidence, he did not establish a \u201cclear probability,\u201d meaning that it was more likely than not, that he would suffer persecution under China\u2019s family planning policies if he returned to that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review of the decision and order of the BIA entered July 13, 2007, will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A6K9\">. According to Lu\u2019s brief he \"arrived in the United States in May of 1998 to seek asylum from persecution in China on account of his political opinion and involvement with Falun Gong.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s br. at 1-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-11\">.
