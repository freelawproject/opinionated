They were sentenced to 26 months and 42 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. On appeal, counsel have filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which they state there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but question whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Hunter\u2019s guilty plea and whether the sentence it imposed on Jones was reasonable. Hunter and Jones were informed of their right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but neither has done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Because Hunter did not move in the district court to withdraw her guilty plea, her challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the transcript of the plea colloquy leads us to conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Hunter\u2019s guilty plea and that any omissions did not affect her substantial rights. Critically, the district court ensured that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily and was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Further, Hunter does not suggest that she would have declined to plead guilty had the district court\u2019s Rule 11 colloquy been more exacting. Accordingly, we discern no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Turning to Jones\u2019 sentence, Jones conceded at the sentencing hearing that the Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for the bank fraud conviction was properly calculated and that she was subject to a statutorily mandated consecutive sentence of 24 months for each of the aggravated identity theft convictions. The district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Jones after considering the Guidelines range, the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2006 &amp; Supp.2008) factors, counsel\u2019s arguments, and Jones\u2019 allocution. Thus, we conclude that Jones\u2019 within-Guidelines sentence for the bank fraud conviction and statutorily required consecutive sentence for the identity theft convictions <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> are reasonable. <em>See United States v. Farrior, </em>535 F.3d 210, 224 (4th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform their clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-5\"> As authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(b)(4) (2006), the district court permitted the two 24-month sentences imposed upon Jones\u2019 identity theft convictions to run concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
