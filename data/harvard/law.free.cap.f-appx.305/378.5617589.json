We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-20\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that due process requires their case be remanded to the BIA for clarification of the grounds upon which the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision is not persuasive where the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision in its entirety, citing <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (stating that a <em>Burbano </em>affirmance signifies that the BIA has conducted an independent review of the record and has determined that its conclusions are the same as those articulated by the IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-21\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA erred by engaging in fact finding is not persuasive, where the BIA did not make factual findings, but rather explained that the new evidence presented on appeal was neither new nor material. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating when the BIA may remand a case to the IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b405-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
