The procedural history of this case and the details of Jackson\u2019s claims are well known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Jackson filed a complaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act alleging that several items of his property went missing when he was transferred to the Special Housing Unit. The District Court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss and declined to exereise jurisdiction over any negligence claims arising under state law. Jackson filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">The District Court held that Bureau of Prisons officers were \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). That section provides an exception to the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising from the detention of property by law enforcement officers. The Supreme Court recently held the same in <em>Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity for Jackson\u2019s claims, the District Court did not err in dismissing Jackson\u2019s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-20\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>marily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6. Appellee\u2019s motion to stay the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-12\">.
