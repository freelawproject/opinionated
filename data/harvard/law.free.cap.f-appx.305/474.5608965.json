We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding of no past persecution because the harms suffered by Vardanyan do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1185-86. Even if Vardanyan is a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and thus a member of a disfavored group, she has failed to demonstrate the required individualized risk of future persecution in Armenia. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 928 (9th Cir.2004). Further, petitioners\u2019 contention that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Armenia, is not supported by the record. Therefore, petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Because Vardanyan failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Vardanyan has failed to show it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if she returns to Armenia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b500-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
