Riley, in this civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-25\">LeBlanc alleges that the appellees violated his constitutional rights in seeking, issuing, and executing an arrest warrant against him for stealing a car. The title for the car was held by James Hatcher, a former Collision Masters employee. LeBlanc was a manager for Collision Masters, and he claims that Hatcher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>fraudulently transferred title for the car to himself from Advantage Automobile Sales, an entity related to Collision Masters.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">On September 20, 2005, LeBIanc caused a towing company to repossess this car from Hatcher, who reported the car as stolen. Police investigation revealed that despite the fact that it was accompanied by due paperwork, the repossession was unlawful, as Hatcher in fact produced valid title to the vehicle and thus lawfully possessed it. On September 21, 2005, Detective Riley of the Watauga Police Department reviewed the case and managed to get the vehicle back to Hatcher. He also spoke with LeBIanc, but the conversation did not go well. The record provides conflicting accounts of the conversation, but the upshot is that Riley informed LeBIanc that he considered the car stolen. For his part, LeBIanc conceded that he had not filed a theft report about the vehicle. He then tried to do so but was only allowed to make out an Information Report because, he was apparently told (for reasons not clear from the record), his complaint about Hatcher was a civil matter only.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On September 23, Riley contacted Assistant Tarrant County District Attorney Alfredo Valverde, recited the facts to him, and after Valverde opined that prosecution of LeBIanc was warranted, prepared a warrant for LeBlanc\u2019s arrest. On November 24, Thanksgiving Day, an Arlington police officer pulled LeBIanc over for speeding and arrested him based on the outstanding warrant. Ultimately, LeBlanc\u2019s case was no-billed by the grand jury. On November 21, 2007, LeBIanc filed suit in federal court, which granted summary judgment against him on May 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We exercise plenary review of grants of summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment should not be granted unless there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We construe LeBlanc\u2019s pro se brief liberally.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even so, amidst many arguments, he fails to point out any error in the judgment of the lower court or any violations of his rights committed by the appellees, and he has therefore put no material fact at issue. On the record, he was arrested pursuant to a valid warrant for which there was probable cause. He repossessed a car, the title of which was held by another. Even if, as he maintains (without having provided documentation), the car was fraudulently transferred to Hatcher, his chosen self-help remedy exposed him to the legal consequences that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
