We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-24\">Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in determining that petitioner failed to allege changed circumstances in India that would exempt him from the time and numerical limits for filing a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004).
