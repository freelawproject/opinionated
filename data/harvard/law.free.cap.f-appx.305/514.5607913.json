HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">Petitioner-Appellant Roger Drach, a Kansas state prisoner, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in order to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus as untimely. Mr. Drach concedes that he did not file his petition within one year of the date on which his judgment became final, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Instead, he argues that the limitations period is an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. We find that no reasonable jurist could conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal was incorrect. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2258(a), we DENY Mr. Drach\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">On August 19, 1994, Deanna Drach, the wife of Petitioner Roger Drach, died in their home from a gunshot wound to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>chest. Mr. Drach was charged with her murder and tried in Finney County, Kansas. He has always maintained that he is innocent and that his wife committed suicide. On October 31, 1997, Mr. Drach was convicted by a jury of first-degree premeditated murder, aggravated battery with great bodily harm, and criminal possession of a weapon. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in (1) refusing to allow his expert witness to testify regarding a purported suicide note, (2) refusing to find that a prosecutor had a conflict of interest, (3) allowing a \u201csurprise witness\u201d to testify for the state, and (4) admitting hearsay testimony. On April 18, 2000, the Kansas Supreme Court entered its final opinion, affirming the conviction. <em>State v. Drach, </em>268 Kan. 636, 1 P.3d 864 (2000). Mr. Drach chose not to seek review by the Supreme Court of the United States. His conviction became final on July 17, 2000, when the time to file a petition for certiorari expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Mr. Drach took no further action until April 16, 2004, when he filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Kansas law. The motion was denied. <em>Drach v. Bruce, </em>281 Kan. 1058, 136 P.3d 390 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1278, 127 S.Ct. 1829, 167 L.Ed.2d 317 (2007). He then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. His claims of error are largely the same as those he raised on direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Drach conceded that the limitations period for filing a habeas petition expired in July 2001. He also admitted that \u201che could not establish an \u2018actual innocence\u2019 claim in the manner prescribed by the Supreme Court ... because he had no \u2018new evidence.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. Br. at 25. Finally, he admitted that there were no \u201crare and exceptional circumstances beyond his control necessitating equitable tolling of \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s statute of limitations.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 26 (quotation marks omitted). Mr. Drach\u2019s only argument is that the limitations period, as applied to him, is an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Relying on our decision in <em>Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998), the district court rejected his claim. It dismissed Mr. Drach\u2019s petition and denied his motion for a COA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">A state prisoner cannot appeal the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus unless a COA is issued, first. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). In order to receive a COA, a prisoner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the petition is denied on procedural grounds, the prisoner must show that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">There is a one year period of limitations on petitions for writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). As relevant here, the limitations period runs from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The statute is tolled while any state post-conviction proceedings are pending. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). It is uncontested that Mr. Drach\u2019s conviction became final in July 2000 and that the limitations period expired well before Mr. Drach filed his first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>motion for post-conviction relief in April 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Mr. Drach argues that the limitations period is unconstitutional. The Constitution guarantees that \u201c[t]he privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. But not every restriction on the writ rises to the level of a suspension. <em>Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (\u201c[\u00bf(judgments about the proper scope of the writ are \u2018normally for Congress to make.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Lonchar v. Thomas, </em>517 U.S. 314, 323, 116 S.Ct. 1293, 134 L.Ed.2d 440 (1996)). We have previously recognized that, in some cases, there may be \u201cserious constitutional questions\u201d about the limitations period. <em>Miller, </em>141 F.3d at 978. Nonetheless, \u00a7 2244(d)(1) is constitutional, provided it does not \u201crender[ ] the habeas remedy \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 977 (quoting <em>Swain v. Pressley, </em>430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977)). \u201cThe burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate inadequacy and ineffectiveness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Mr. Drach cannot carry this burden. In order to avoid any unconstitutional applications, we have held that \u00a7 2244(d)(1) is \u201cnot jurisdictional and ... may be subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>141 F.3d at 978. Tolling is limited to \u201c \u2018rare and exceptional\u2019 circumstances\u201d and \u201cshould not be used to thwart the intention of Congress in establishing a statute of limitations for habeas claims.\u201d <em>Burger v. Scott, </em>317 F.3d 1133, 1141 (10th Cir.2003); <em>see also Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Tolling] is only available when an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d). Mr. Drach concedes that there are no exceptional circumstances that would warrant tolling the limitations period in this case. In fact, he has failed to give any reasons for why he waited nearly four years before seeking post-conviction relief. Absent any explanation, he cannot show that the opportunities he voluntarily passed up were inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Mr. Drach attempts to distinguish <em>Miller, </em>noting that Miller admitted his guilt and was only challenging the length of his sentence. He argues that the constitutional concerns are more acute when, as here, the question is whether an innocent man has been wrongly convicted. It is true that our holdings do not foreclose the possibility that \u00a7 2244(d)(1) might be unconstitutional in cases of actual innocence. <em>Miller, </em>141 F.3d at 978. But Mr. Drach concedes that he cannot establish actual innocence. \u201cActual innocence\u201d requires more than the prisoner\u2019s continued insistence that he did not commit the crime. He must produce credible, new evidence, not presented at trial, sufficient to establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 537, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006) (quoting <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995)). Mr. Drach has no new evidence to present. His declaration of innocence, by itself, does not lessen his burden to prove that the limitations period renders habeas relief inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Finally, Mr. Drach argues that the application of the limitations period violates his due process rights. He claims that \u00a7 2244(d)(1) \u201ccreates a system which bars review of continued unconstitutional imprisonment in any meaningful form.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 57; <em>see also Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (\u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Mr. Drach\u2019s due process argument, however, amounts to no more than a repackaging of his suspension clause argument. Consequently, this argument is unavailing. The essence of his complaint is the same\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that \u00a7 2241(d)(1) unconstitutionally prevents him from contesting his unlawful imprisonment. As noted, Mr. Drach has failed to offer any explanation as to why he did not file his petition within the limitations period. He admits that he has no new evidence of his innocence. Nor has he suggested that there has been an intervening change in the law. The arguments in his habeas petition basically are the same ones that he raised on direct appeal. Instead, Mr. Drach has simply failed to take advantage of the opportunity to file a habeas petition until it was too late. Since he cannot establish that a year was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality\u201d of his conviction, he also cannot show that he was denied \u201cany meaningful form\u201d of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In light of our previous holding in <em>Miller, </em>the district court correctly concluded that the application of \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s limitations period was not unconstitutional. No reasonable jurist could have found otherwise. Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Drach\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-12\"> This Order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this matter. <em>See </em>Fed.
