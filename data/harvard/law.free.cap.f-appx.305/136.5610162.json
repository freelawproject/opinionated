We have already decided Hunt\u2019s appeal from the underlying order, in which the district court dismissed Hunt\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) suit. In that case, we affirmed the district court\u2019s order as to all Defendants except Dr. Thompson. As to Thompson, we vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Hunt v. Sandhir, </em>295 Fed.Appx. 584 (4th Cir.2008) (unpublished). Hunt\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion reargued the claims raised below and made in his first appeal. Thus, for the same reasons outlined in our prior opinion, we affirm the district court\u2019s order as to all defendants except Dr. Thompson. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>regard to the claim against Thompson, because the cause of action has already been remanded for further consideration, the portion of the appeal contesting the district court\u2019s treatment of this claim is moot. Accordingly, we dismiss this part of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
