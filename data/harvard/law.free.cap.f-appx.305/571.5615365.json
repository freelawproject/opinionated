Lewis argues that: (1) an individual serving a statutory mandatory minimum sentence should not be foreclosed from relief under the amendment in light of Supreme Court precedent, and (2) his constitutional right to Equal Protection was violated by the refusal to apply the amendment\u2019s Guidelines reduction to all crack cocaine offenders, including those sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). Where the issue involves a legal interpretation, however, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1 to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately\u2019 was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline ' range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). This occurs where the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (noting that defendant is not eligible for reduction, even if amendment is listed in subsection (c), if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d); <em>see United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The record reveals that Lewis\u2019s total offense level was 40, his criminal history category was VI due to his career offender status, and his resulting calculated guideline range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. However, a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment applied as a result of Lewis\u2019s prior felony drug convictions, and the district court therefore sentenced Lewis to life imprisonment. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851. Because the applicable guideline imprisonment range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment was lower than the statutory mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment that applied based on Lewis\u2019s prior felony drug convictions, the statutory mandatory minimum became the guideline sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (\u201c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d). As a result, Lewis\u2019s sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. Lewis is therefore precluded from receiving a reduction in his sentence, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion on this issue. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Moreover, to the extent that Lewis raises an Equal Protection claim regarding the application of Amendment 706, jurisdiction to resentence a defendant is limited to certain motions by the Bureau of Prisons, a Rule 35 motion by the government, or a Guidelines amendment that lowers the sentencing range of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Because an alleged Equal Protection violation is none of those, \u00a7 3582 is not an appropriate vehicle for raising such a challenge. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that the district court properly declined to consider an Eighth Amendment argument because section 3582(c) does not grant \u201cjurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">. We have noted that \u201cCongress has only authorized departures from statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums in limited circumstances.\" <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007). The only two circumstances in which a court can depart downward from a statutory minimum sentence are when the government files a motion to recognize a defendant's substantial assistance pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), or a defendant falls within the provisions of the \u201csafety valve\u201d embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). <em>See id. </em>Neither circumstance arises here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\">.
