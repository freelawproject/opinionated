O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">Plaintiff Harold R. Little appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-23\">Mr. Little owned an independent insurance company and worked under a contract with the defendant State Farm companies as an insurance agent for more than thirty years. In 2000, State Farm made a demand on its agents to sign new agreements containing trade secret and non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>compete provisions. Mr. Little resisted pressure from State Farm to sign the new agreement. In December 2000, he joined other agents in a class action lawsuit in California state court challenging the propriety of State Farm imposing the new terms. In an attempt to compromise with State Farm, however, he signed the new agreement, but added a provision reserving his rights under his original contract. State Farm refused his offer and terminated his contract effective October 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On October 26, 2007, Mr. Little filed this suit against State Farm in Utah state court, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unlawful termination of contract in violation of Utah law and public policy. State Farm removed the case to federal court. The district court held that although the California litigation ultimately resulted in a January 4, 2007, decision from a California Court of Appeal holding that State Farm\u2019s new trade secret and non-compete provisions were improper, the at-will nature of Mr. Little\u2019s original contract allowed State Farm to terminate it, defeating his claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In addition, the district court held that Mr. Little\u2019s claim for unlawful termination under state law was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We review a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \u201caccepting all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Howard v. Waide, </em>534 F.3d 1227, 1242-43 (10th Cir.2008). To withstand State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss, Mr. Little\u2019s \u201ccomplaint must contain enough allegations of fact \u2018to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robbins v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201c\u2018Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp., </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Mr. Little argues on appeal that: (1) State Farm used the termination process to enforce a breach of the other provisions of his contract; and (2) State Farm\u2019s defense that it could terminate Mr. Little\u2019s contract at will is not tenable in these circumstances. We have carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s order in light of the parties arguments, the record on appeal, and the governing law. Mr. Little does not dispute that his contract with State Farm was terminable at will, and we are therefore unpersuaded by Mr. Little\u2019s arguments that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint. We affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
