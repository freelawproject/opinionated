INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Lin argues that the Board failed to consider all the evidence he introduced regarding his religious persecution. We grant Lin\u2019s petition, and we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal decision of the Board. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review its findings of fact to determine if the decision is \u2018\u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). Credibility determinations are likewise reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 817. \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this [C]ourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the Board with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003)(citing <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The record does not compel a finding that Lin\u2019s testimony was credible. There were discrepancies in Lin\u2019s application and his testimony at the asylum hearing regarding the number of Bibles that he smuggled inside China. Lin alleged that Jiahui Ye asked him to travel to Xiamen to transport the Bibles, but Ye\u2019s letter allows an inference that Lin instead went to Xiamen to proselytize. Lin also testified that he was beaten severely in the reeducation camp, but his application stated only that he had \u201csuffered a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The Board failed, however, to make a clear or cogent finding as to Lin\u2019s evidence that he was detained in the reeducation camp on the basis of his religious activity. The Board could not rely on its adverse credibility determination to deny the application when it failed to consider all of Lin\u2019s corroborating evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). Lin offered excerpts from the 2005 County Report and 1998 Profile of Asylum Claim and Country Conditions that stated that the government had harassed and detained members of unregistered churches. Lin also submitted a government document stating that he had been incarcerated in a Chinese reeducation camp because he had \u201cparticipated in an unregistered church.\u201d The immigration judge found these documents credible and entitled to \u201cgreat weight.\u201d The Board offered no response to Lin\u2019s evidence that he was incarcerated for his religious practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The Board erred by failing to consider all the evidence Lin submitted to substantiate his allegation of religious persecution. We GRANT Lin\u2019s petition, VACATE the order that dismissed Lin\u2019s appeal, and REMAND for the Board to consider all corroborating evidence submitted by Lin to determine whether Lin was incarcerated on the basis of his religious activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
