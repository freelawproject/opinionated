The Saezes simultaneously sued a local dealership in state court alleging the same causes of action. After the state court dismissed the Saezes\u2019 claims with prejudice, the District Court permitted defendants to amend them answer to allege collateral estoppel and then granted summary judgment on this basis. The Saezes appeal both these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-24\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294. We review a district court\u2019s grant of leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>to file an amended pleading for abuse of discretion. <em>Urrutia v. Harrisburg County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>91 F.3d 451, 457 (3d Cir.1996). Our review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Riley, </em>352 F.3d 804, 806 n. 3 (3d Cir.2003). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). \u201cAmong the grounds that could justify a denial of leave to amend are undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, prejudice, and futility.\u201d <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir.1997). The Saezes contend that the District Court should have found undue delay, bad faith, and prejudice because defendants could have moved to amend earlier but waited until after the close of discovery. The Saezes did not, however, seek leave to conduct additional discovery after defendants filed their motion, and they have not explained how such discovery would have affected defendants\u2019 collateral estoppel defense. The Saezes also contend that the collateral estoppel defense is meritless and, thus, that amendment was futile. Since we will also affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on grounds of collateral estoppel, we reject this contention. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">Nor do we find error in the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Apart from the jurisdictional allegations and the names of the parties, the Saezes\u2019 claims in state court were identical to those alleged in the instant action. The state court specifically held that the allegedly defective product could not, as a matter of law, be found defective or unreasonably dangerous and that no warning was necessary about its shape, size, or weight. This holding was not limited to the particular defendants in state court, and mutuality of parties is not a requirement for collateral estoppel. <em>See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 332-33, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). Contrary to the Saezes\u2019 assertion, it is of no moment that the parallel cases were dismissed at different stages since a full and fair opportunity to litigate was afforded in both. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. d (1982). Finally, the Saezes\u2019 proposed expert opinion evidence relates solely to a factual issue \u2014 whether the product was defective \u2014 while the District Court\u2019s decision was based solely on the purely legal principle of collateral estoppel; the opinion evidence not considered by the District Court was thus irrelevant to the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
