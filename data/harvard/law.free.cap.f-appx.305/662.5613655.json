R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed July 8, 2008 be affirmed. The district court properly concluded that appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. It is apparent from the face of the complaint that appellees did not force appellant to work by means of physical or legal coercion. <em>See United States v. Kozminski, </em>487 U.S. 931, 943, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988) (\u201c[I]n every case in which this Court has found a condition of involuntary servitude, the victim had no available choice but to work or be subject to legal sanction.\u201d). To the extent appellant alleges violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, the district court properly dismissed these claims, because there is no private right of action under these criminal statutes. <em>See Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, </em>511 U.S. 164, 190, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994) (refusing to infer a private right of action from a \u201cbare criminal statute\u201d); <em>see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Widnall, </em>57 F.3d 1162, 1164 (D.C.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-24\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>hearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
