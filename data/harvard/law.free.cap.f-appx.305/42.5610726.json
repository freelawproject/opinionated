He appeals this sentence as unreasonable and contrary to his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. We disagree, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">On July 9, 2007, Columna-Romero, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty to a single count of reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no plea agreement. Based on ColumnaRomero\u2019s offense level and criminal history category, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 41-51 months. Neither party objected to the PSR. The District Court held a sentencing hearing on October 30, 2007. Prior to this hearing, Columna-Romero submitted a sentencing memorandum requesting a downward variance, based both on his personal circumstances and on the fact that he was arrested in a district that lacked a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>fast-track program for handling offenses such as his. Had this fast-track program been available, Columna-Romero asserted, he would have participated in it and received a lower sentence. This created a disparity in sentencing treatment that supported a variance from the PSR\u2019s advised range. Columna-Romero reiterated these arguments at his sentencing hearing. Having heard from Columna-Romero and the Government, and having considered the PSR and the sentencing recommendations of the Probation Department and the Government, the District Court found that \u201call the evidence before [it] supports a reasonable sentence to be imposed within the guideline range.\u201d Accordingly, the court imposed a sentence of 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment (which was waived). This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Columna-Romero\u2019s first contention on appeal is that the District Court misunderstood the extent of its sentencing authority when it denied his request for a downward variance based on the absence of a fast-track program in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. According to ColumnaRomero, the court erred in two respects: by declining to find that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the absence of a fast-track program created an \u201cunwarranted sentence disparity]\u201d between himself and other \u201cdefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d; and by failing to account for the absence of this program in its analysis of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. These errors, Columna-Romero contends, demonstrate that the District Court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), thereby rendering his sentence procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">As the District Court recognized, this matter is governed by our decision in <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>477 F.3d 94 (3d Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 199, 169 L.Ed.2d 134 (2007). Vargas, like Columna-Romero, was sentenced under \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). He contended the District Court should have considered the disparity between fast-track and non-fast-track districts in fashioning his sentence. We surveyed our sister circuits and held, as \u201cthe Second and Fourth through Eleventh Circuits\u201d had, \u201cthat a district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. We found that, since Congress had authorized the scheme for creating fast-track districts, <em>see </em>PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(m)(2)(B), 117 Stat. 650, 675 (2003), the sentence disparities that may result from the implementation of that scheme could not be \u201cunwarranted\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>See Vargas, </em>477 F.3d at 100. Furthermore, we noted that, to prove such an \u201cunwarranted disparity,\u201d \u201cthe burden [is] on the defendant to demonstrate similarity by showing that other defendants\u2019 \u2018circumstances exactly paralleled\u2019 his.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Charles, </em>467 F.3d 828, 833 n. 7 (3d Cir.2006)). We found \u201c[t]here has been no such showing here, and a court should not consider sentences imposed on defendants in other cases in the absence of such a showing by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we pointed out that \u201c[a] court should not create its own fast-track program or substitute its own sentencing guidelines for those of the Sentencing Commission,\u201d as \u201cthe establishment of fast-track programs is a matter left to Congress and the Attorney General, and the review of national sentencing practices and formulation of advisoi'y sentencing guidelines is a matter left to the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lastly, we concluded that \u201ceven if we were to find that Vargas had shown that fast-track programs created an unwarranted disparity with similarly situated defendants under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), ... the District Court exercised its discretion by considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. This exercise of discretion is further evidence that Vargas\u2019 sentence was reasonable, even in light of any disparity created by fast-track programs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The District Court relied on <em>Vargas </em>in rejecting Columna-Romero\u2019s fast-track contention. Under <em>Vargas, </em>it found, \u201cthe burden is upon the defendant to demonstrate similarity by showing the other defendants\u2019 circumstances were exactly parallel.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[a]s a trial judge, I should not create \u2014 or a trial court \u2014 cannot create its own fast-track program or substitute its own sentencing guidelines for those of the Sentencing Commission.\u201d And lastly, \u201c[tjhe Third Circuit has rejected the disparity between fast-track and non-fast-track sentencing, because Congress has expressly approved them.... Such a disparity, therefore, could not be considered unwarranted.... \u201d The District Court then moved from \u00a7 3553(a)(6) to the rest of the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, noting that it \u201cha[s] been asked to consider the same argument of the fast-track disparity under the remaining ... 3553(a) factors. And I find the argument unpersuasive for the reasons previously stated and the reasons that I will explain now.\u201d The court then reviewed Columna-Romero\u2019s personal history and circumstances in light of those factors, concluding that \u201ca sentence within the guidelines is sufficient but not greater than necessary to accomplish the penal goals of punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We see no procedural error in this determination. The District Court explicitly acknowledged \u201cthe United States Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, but are advisory pursuant to <em>[Booker].\u201d </em>It found no unwarranted disparity under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), and then considered the remaining \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of all of the relevant evidence and arguments before it, including Columna-Romero\u2019s fast-track argument. It recognized its authority to impose a sentence below the advised range, but it determined a sentence within the Guidelines was reasonable and a downward variance was inappropriate. Columna-Romero contends the District Court\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing do not adequately demonstrate that it understood its authority to consider his fast-track argument in its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. We disagree. We have recognized that \u201cbecause district court judges render sentencing decisions orally and spontaneously from the bench after the presentation of numerous arguments, we do not expect them to deliver \u2018a perfect or complete statement of all of the surrounding law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vargas, </em>477 F.3d at 101 (quoting <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 n. 8 (3d Cir.2006)); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority. Nonetheless, when a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>(citation omitted)). Here, the District Court made sufficiently clear that it had considered Columna-Romero\u2019s fast-track argument with respect to all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but had found the argument unpersuasive in light of the evidence before it. This was a proper exercise of discretion under <em>Booker, </em>and resulted in a procedurally reasonable determination of Columna-Romero\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">According to Columna-Romero, however, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), calls into question whether fast-track programs cannot create \u201cunwarranted disparities\u201d because Congress has explicitly approved their creation and scheme of implementation. We recognize that <em>Kimbrough </em>has prompted reconsideration of the role fast-track programs may play in a sentencing court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, and whether disparities resulting from the fast-track sentencing scheme may now be considered \u201cunwarranted\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>Compare United States v. Rodriguez, </em>527 F.3d 221, 229 (1st Cir. 2008), <em>with United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-63 (5th Cir.2008), <em>and United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2008), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>548 F.3d 980 (11th Cir. 2008). But we do not reach that issue here. As the District Court noted, in proving an \u201cunwarranted disparity\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), Columna-Romero bore the burden of putting forth evidence of other defendants with parallel circumstances who have received lower sentences pursuant to a fast-track program. <em>See Vargas, 477 </em>F.3d at 100. The record does not reflect such evidence. Columna-Romero has made general assertions regarding the existence of fast-track programs in other districts and the availability of lower sentences through such programs. But he has not identified other defendants, with parallel circumstances and records, who were eligible for and received such lower sentences. Thus, as the District Court found, Columna-Romero has not carried his burden in showing an \u201cunwarranted disparity\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>Kimbrough, </em>even if relevant to <em>Vargas, </em>would not alter this determination. As to the rest of the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, the District Court considered Columna-Romero\u2019s fast-track argument, and <em>Kimbrough </em>would not require that the court find this argument any more persuasive than it already has. Accordingly, the District Court understood and exercised its discretion properly in this ease, and did not commit procedural error in imposing Columna-Romero\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Columna-Romero also contends that, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the District Court\u2019s consideration of his prior conviction in its sentencing decision under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, as the prior conviction was neither charged in the indictment nor admitted at his guilty plea. As Columna-Romero acknowledges, and as we also found in <em>Vargas, </em>this challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>451 F.3d 154, 159-60 (3d Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1137, 127 S.Ct. 991, 166 L.Ed.2d 748 (2007); and <em>United States v. Ordaz, </em>398 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir.2005). <em>See Vargas, 477 </em>F.3d at 104-05.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we find the sentence reasonable and will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-11\">. At the plea hearing, Columna-Romero reserved the right to challenge the imposition of a sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), based upon a prior conviction of an aggravated felony. Columna-Romero had previously been convicted of attempted robbery in New York. The Presentence Investigation Report factored this prior conviction into its calculations. Columna-Romero's sentencing memorandum attested to the conviction, and his counsel acknowledged it at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review the District Court's sentencing decision for abuse of discretion, to ensure that the court committed no significant procedural error and that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217-18 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">.
