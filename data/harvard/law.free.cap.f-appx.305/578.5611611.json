Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Harkness, a convicted felon, worked as a security guard at a motel in Orlando, Florida. Sergeant Arnold Alvarez learned that Harkness allegedly carried a taser at work and decided to investigate because state law prohibits a convicted felon from possessing a taser. Sergeant Alvarez and another officer drove to the motel and Harkness approached the car and began speaking with the officers. Harkness carried a pellet gun and taser on his belt. Alvarez seized these items and asked if Harkness had any other weapons on him. Harkness indicated that he had a knife in his front pocket, which he allowed Sergeant Alvarez to remove, and minutes later he indicated that he had a knife on a chain around his neck, which Alvarez also removed. Alvarez next obtained permission to search Harkness\u2019s nearby car where police uncovered two more knives and an extendable metal baton. Harkness was then placed under arrest for possession of the taser. He was not given <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">Upon arrest, Harkness again was asked if he had any weapons on him, and he indicated that he did not. A subsequent search uncovered no other weapons and Harkness was placed in the patrol car. Shortly thereafter, Harkness\u2019s girlfriend arrived and the police officers permitted Harkness to step out of the car and speak with her. Harkness asked an officer if he could give his girlfriend a package. When told by the officer that \u201cit depended on what it was,\u201d Harkness admitted that he had a gun in the crotch area of his pants and that he did not want Sergeant Alvarez to know about it. Sergeant Alvarez was summoned and began to search Harkness, who told the sergeant, \u201cBe careful. It has a ham trigger on it.\u201d The search revealed that Harkness was wearing a bullet-proof vest and had a loaded .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol concealed inside his jockstrap. Harkness was then transported to the police station. On the way there, the police officer did not ask Harkness any questions, but Harkness made several statements, including that he found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>gun the day before and was planning to turn it in to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Harkness was indicted in federal court for his possession of a firearm, ammunition, and body armor. Prior to trial, Harkness moved to dismiss the body armor charge, on the grounds that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931 does not contain a jurisdictional element, and therefore the statute was void under the Commerce Clause,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, in the alternative, the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. Harkness also moved to exclude statements made and physical evidence seized after the arrest on the bases that the statements were given in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>All of the aforementioned motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Among the witnesses at trial was William Leggett. Leggett testified that on September 19, 2006 he purchased a .22 caliber revolver for Harkness because Harkness worked in a \u201cless than desirable area of town.\u201d Harkness later told Leggett that this gun had an \u201cexposed hammer\u201d that could catch on his clothing, so the two men met at a gun store on September 29, 2006 and Leggett purchased another firearm for Harkness, later identified as the .380 handgun seized by police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Leggett testified that after Harkness was arrested, Harkness telephoned Leggett and told him that he lied in his \u201cdaily log sheet\u201d by writing that he found the gun on the motel grounds. Harkness asked Leggett to report the gun \u201clost or stolen\u201d in order to corroborate his story. Leggett complied with this request and attempted to bolster the story by stopping into several local stores and inquiring if they had found a gun that he lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Angel Rivera, the property manager at the motel where Harkness worked, also testified at trial. Rivera indicated that following Harkness\u2019s arrest on October 2, Harkness\u2019s girlfriend turned over the security log, master key, and other motel property. After Harkness\u2019s release, Harkness delivered additional papers to add to the security log, but Rivera could not recall which papers were added. An entry in the security log dated October 1, 2006 corroborated Harkness\u2019s statement that he found the .380 handgun on motel property and planned to turn it in to the police department. Rivera also testified that Harkness tried to convince him to write a letter indicating that the motel approved the taser for Harkness\u2019s use, even though this was false. A resident of the motel similarly testified that although she had seen Harkness with a gun, Harkness asked her to write a letter indicating that she had never seen him with any weapons or guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Harkness asked that the court instruct the jury on the defenses of justification and innocent possession. Both motions were denied. The jury subsequently found Harkness guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">A Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) was prepared and presented at sentencing. The charge with the highest offense level of the two counts, Count 1, possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, carried a base offense level of 24. The PSI also suggested an upward adjustment of 2 levels for obstruction of justice and a Chapter Four enhancement because Harkness qualified as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d (\u201cACC\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Harkness\u2019s total offense level, therefore, was 33. The corresponding criminal history categoi\u2019y of V yielded a guideline sentence of 210-262 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harkness objected to the PSI, arguing that: (1) the obstruction of justice increase was improper; (2) he did not have the \u201cpredicate convictions\u201d required for qualification as an ACC; and (3) he was entitled for a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court overruled all objections and imposed a sentence of 210 months\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">On appeal, Harkness raises the following arguments: (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a)(1) is an unconstitutional use of Congress\u2019s powers under the Commerce Clause; and (2) the district court erred by (a) denying Harkness\u2019s motion to suppress his statements and physical evidence; (b) refusing to instruct the jury on justification and innocent possession; (c) determining that Harkness should be sentenced as an ACC; (d) applying the enhancement for obstruction of justice; and (e) refusing to decrease Harkness\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">I. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Federal law prohibits felons convicted of crimes of violence from purchasing, owning, or possessing body armor. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a)(1). Harkness argues that this section is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him because the statute contains no jurisdictional element and he did not cross state lines with the body armor.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2001). Congress may regulate three broad categories of activity under the commerce power: (1) the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities with a substantial relation to interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). In <em>Lopez, </em>the Court- held that a statute that made it a federal offense to possess a firearm in a school zone was unconstitutional because it did not fit within any of the three above categories and did not contain an express jurisdictional provision. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (explaining that the statute contained \u201cno express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">We need not decide whether this ease fits into any of the above three categories because this court has held that an express jurisdictional element to a statute immunizes it from a facial constitutional attack. <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1273. Body armor is defined as, \u201cany product sold or offered for sale, <em>in interstate or foreign commerce, </em>as personal protective body covering intended to protect against gunfire.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(35) (emphasis added). Therefore, Harkness\u2019s facial challenge to \u00a7 931\u2019s body armor restriction must fail, as the statute contains an express jurisdictional element.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Moreover, Harkness\u2019s as applied challenge also fails because an employee of the manufacturer of the body armor testified that the yarn of Harkness\u2019s vest was made in Virginia, woven into fabric in South Carolina, woven into a vest in Florida, and then shipped to a distributor in New Jersey. The vest was thereafter sold by the New Jersey distributor and ended up in Harkness\u2019s hands in Florida. There is therefore no doubt the body armor was \u201csold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u00a7 921(a)(35); <em>see United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201c[because the government demonstrated that the firearm possessed by McAllister previously had travelled in interstate commerce, [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) ] is not unconstitutional as applied to him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We conclude that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a)(1) is a constitutional use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>Motion to suppress statements and physical evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Harkness identifies several statements and pieces of evidence that he argues the district court should have suppressed, including: (1) statements to the police about the existence and location of the gun; (2) the fruit of these statements, i.e. the gun itself; and (3) the inculpatory statements made on the way to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\u2018We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, examining the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. King, </em>509 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2007). <em>\u201cMiranda </em>forbids the prosecution from using statements made by a defendant during a custodial interrogation unless the defendant had first been advised of [his] constitutional rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Paskett, </em>950 F.2d 705, 707 (11th Cir.1992). A custodial interrogation occurs when the police engage in express questioning or its functional equivalent \u201cthat the police should know [is] reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Both parties agree that Harkness was in custody when he made the inculpatory statements and that he had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The only issue, therefore, is whether he was interrogated. Turning first to the statements to the police about the existence and location of the gun, the district court accepted that Harkness was interrogated, but concluded that this situation fit under the public safety exception to the <em>Miranda </em>requirement, as articulated in <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">We need not address the district court\u2019s consideration of exceptions to the <em>Miranda </em>requirement because we conclude that Harkness was not interrogated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Harkness was given permission to speak to his girlfriend and then asked the officer if he could give her a package, to which the officer responded that \u201cit depend[s] on what it [is].\u201d Harkness then indicated that he had a gun in his crotch area. This conversation does not implicate the concerns expressed by the <em>Miranda </em>Court. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>723 F.2d 1527, 1532 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201c[t]he whole purpose of <em>Miranda, </em>and thus of its rule, is to protect the privilege against self-incrimination from coercive questioning by the police and to ensure that any waiver of that right is made \u2018voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently\u2019 \u201d). Here, the officer did not initiate the conversation, nor was there any objective evidence to indicate that the officer should have expected Harkness to incriminate himself. \u201cIt dependfs] on what it [is]\u201d was a natural response by the officer to Harkness\u2019s unprompted question, and the officer had no reason to believe that his response was \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>from the suspect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682; <em>see Garcia v. Singletary, </em>13 F.3d 1487, 1491-92 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that a spontaneous reaction to a startling event, although \u201caccusatorial in tone ... was not an interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>\u201d). Thus, Harkness\u2019s statements and the gun were not the product of an illegal interrogation and were therefore properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We similarly conclude that Harkness\u2019s statements made on the way to the police station were unprompted declarations and are therefore admissible because they were not made in response to an interrogation or its functional equivalent. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (\u201cvolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>Requested jury instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Harkness next argues that the district court erred in its decision not to instruct the jury on the defenses of innocent possession and justification. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWe will find reversible error only if (1) the requested instruction correctly stated the law; (2) the actual charge to the jury did not substantially cover the proposed instruction; and (3) the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Turning first to justification, this court has held that the affirmative defense of justification is available to felon-in-possession charges under \u00a7 922(g)(1), but only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1297 (11th Cir.2000). A defendant must show the following four elements to establish a justification defense in the context of \u00a7 922(g)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">(1) that the defendant was under unlawful and present, imminent, and impending threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) that the defendant did not negligently or recklessly place himself in a situation where he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (3) that the defendant had no reasonable legal alternative to violating the law; and (4) that there was a direct causal relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the threatened harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\"><em>Id. </em>These elements \u201crequire[ ] nothing less than an immediate emergency,\u201d <em>United States v. Rice, </em>214 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000), and \u201cif there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law, a chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm, the defense[ ] will fail.\u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 410, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">In this case, even if we ignore Leggett\u2019s testimony and accept Harkness\u2019s description of events as true, it is undisputed that Harkness had a cellular telephone on him at the time he allegedly found the firearm; therefore, he could have immediately contacted law enforcement to report the gun. <em>United States v. Presley, </em>487 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2007) (the district court did not err in a felon-in-possession case in declining to instruct the jury on justification or necessity because the defendant had two cellular telephones on him at the time he allegedly found the gun). Accordingly, the district court properly refused to instruct the jury on the defense of justification because Harkness had a reasonable alternative to keeping the gun in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">We also reject Harkness\u2019s innocent possession argument. This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u201cnever before recognized the availability of an \u2018innocent transitory possession\u2019 defense in a firearm possession case,\u201d <em>Palma, </em>511 F.8d at 1316, and we need not decide today whether such a defense exists in this circuit. Where this defense is recognized, it requires proof of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">(1) the firearm was attained innocently and held with no illicit purpose and (2) possession of the firearm was transitory i.e., in light of the circumstances presented, there is a good basis to find that the defendant took adequate measures to rid himself of possession of the firearm as promptly as reasonably possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-I\"><em>United States v. Mason, </em>233 F.3d 619, 624 (D.C.Cir.2000). As noted above, Harkness had a cellular telephone, so he clearly did not \u201crid himself of possession of the firearm as promptly as reasonably possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, even if we recognized this defense, the district court did not err in declining to instruct the jury on the defense of innocent possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\n<em>Sentenced as an ACC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Harkness was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), which requires a minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for a violator of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) that has three previous convictions for \u201ca violent felony or serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Harkness acknowledges that two of his convictions are considered violent felonies under the ACCA, but contends that his felony conviction for leaving the scene of an accident should not be considered \u201cviolent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular offense constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Rainey, </em>362 F.3d 733, 734 (11th Cir.2004). A violent felony is any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). After Harkness was sentenced, the Supreme Court interpreted \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). In holding that a conviction for a felony offense of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) is not a violent felony within meaning of the ACCA, the Court placed particular emphasis upon the fact that the violent felonies listed in subsection (ii) are all forms of \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1586.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">The government concedes that under this new precedent, the district court erred in labeling Harkness\u2019s felony conviction for fleeing the scene of an accident a violent felony. Although purposeful, his actions were not \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201caggressive,\u201d and are therefore unlike the felonies listed in subsection (ii). Harkness therefore does not have the requisite three violent felony convictions to bring him within the ambit of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Accordingly, we vacate Harkness\u2019s sentence under the ACCA and remand to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">\n<em>Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Harkness also argues that the district court erred in concluding that he obstructed justice when, at the detention hearing, he told the magistrate judge that he found the gun on motel property and had intended to turn it over to the police. He contends that this was not obstruction because he admitted possessing the gun, and in any event his misstatement was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the imposition of an enhancement for obstruction of justice for clear error, and the district court\u2019s application of the factual findings to the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Uscinski, </em>369 F.3d 1243, 1246 (11th Cir.2004). An obstruction of justice enhancement applies when the defendant provides \u201cmaterially false information to a judge or magistrate.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(f)). Leggett\u2019s testimony at trial established that he purchased the gun for Harkness, and that Harkness\u2019s statements to the magistrate judge that he found the gun and planned to return it were therefore false, notwithstanding the fact that he admitted possession. Moreover, the false statements were material. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6) (a material statement is one where, \u201cif believed, [it] would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination\u201d). The issues of how Harkness acquired the gun and whether he intended to promptly turn the gun over to the police were certainly material to both his guilt and sentence. In fact, the defense\u2019s theory at trial was that Harkness found the gun. We therefore find that the district court did not err in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\n<em>Acceptance of responsibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Finally, Harkness argues that he was entitled to a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. He argues that he acknowledged from the start that he was a felon and was not supposed to have a gun, but merely went to trial to raise constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A defendant bears the burden of showing that he is entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction, and we review the district court\u2019s findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>23 F.3d 368, 369 (11th Cir.1994). This court has acknowledged that a defendant is not to be punished for exercising his constitutional rights and \u201cif a defendant has shown some sign of remorse but has also exercised constitutional or statutory rights, the sentencing judge may not balance the exercise of those rights against the defendant\u2019s expression of remorse to determine whether the \u2018acceptance\u2019 is adequate.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>959 F.2d 193, 197 (11th Cir.1992). Harkness\u2019s argument, however, is belied by the record. He did not simply argue that evidence obtained by the police should have been excluded. Instead, his argument to the magistrate judge and his theory at trial were that he found the gun and planned to return it to the police. At no time did he admit to illegally obtaining the gun from Leggett or take responsibility for his actions. As such, the district court did not commit clear error in declining to assess a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as to all issues except the determination that Harkness qualified as an Armed Career Criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). We therefore remand on that issue to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\">. <em>Miranda v.
