The final judgment includes, <em>inter alia, </em>an order granting the City\u2019s motion to dismiss South Coast\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 causes of action and a subsequent order granting summary judgment in favor of the City on South Coast\u2019s Sherman Act claim. South Coast appeals as the assignees of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee, the named plaintiff, who disclaimed his interest in this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing South Coast\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 causes of action. South Coast lacked standing to challenge the franchise ordinance because it never applied for a franchise. <em>Madsen v. Boise State Univ., </em>976 F.2d 1219, 1220 (9th Cir.1992) (collecting-cases). While South Coast argues that it would have been futile to have applied for a franchise, this issue was resolved against it in a related state court proceeding. Thus, South Coast is precluded from relitigating the issue here. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 95-96, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Nor did the district court err in granting summary judgment in favor of the City on South Coast\u2019s Sherman Act cause of action. The City and its employees acting in them official capacity are immune from antitrust damages under the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984 (\u201cLGAA\u201d). <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a). Moreover, South Coast may not avoid the LGAA\u2019s restrictions by asserting a \u00a7 1983 claim for damages based on alleged violations of the Sherman Act. The existence of express and more limited remedy provisions in the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15), is a clear \u201cindication that Congress did not intend to leave open a more expansive remedy under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>See City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, </em>544 U.S. 113, 121, 125 S.Ct. 1453, 161 L.Ed.2d 316 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
