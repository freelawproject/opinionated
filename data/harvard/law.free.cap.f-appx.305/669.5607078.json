The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(b). The defendants\u2019 argument regarding the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1 is waived. <em>See, e.g., Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. FERC, </em>347 F.3d 964, 970 (D.C.Cir.2003) (finding an argument waived where its proponent \u201cfailed to develop it fully until its reply brief\u2019). The defendants seeking to vacate their guilty pleas have not shown that the error at the plea colloquy affected their substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). As to all the defendants\u2019 other contentions, we see no error. Therefore, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgments of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this Court, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
