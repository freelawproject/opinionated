The NLRB cross-applies for enforcement of its order of February 19, 2008 in this matter. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that he had erroneously allowed into evidence recordings surreptitiously made by two union officials does not undermine the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations, which he explicitly based upon his observations of the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and corroboration with other testimony. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Dinion Coil Co., </em>201 F.2d 484, 487 (2d Cir.1952) (\u201c[Sjince observation of [demean- or] is open to a trier of the facts when witnesses testify orally in his presence, and since such observation is not open to a reviewing tribunal, that fact-trier\u2019s findings, to the extent that they comprise direct or \u2018testimonial\u2019 inferences, are ordinarily unreviewable.\u201d (citation omitted)). Nowhere in his decision does the ALJ rely on corroboration by the recordings, which were made after Cooperman was terminated. Moreover, we cannot say that Cooper-man\u2019s testimony was \u201chopelessly incredible or flatly contradicts either a so-called \u2018law of nature\u2019 or undisputed documentary testimony.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Columbia Univ., </em>541 F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir.1976) (quoting <em>Dinion Coil Co., </em>201 F.2d at 490).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">Accepting Cooperman\u2019s testimony as credible, we conclude that substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>dence supports the NLRB\u2019s determination that Lorge discharged Cooperman because she refused to help cause the resignations or constructive discharges of Piceigallo and Rouse, and thereby violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). Although Lorge has identified evidence suggesting that other factors played a role in Cooperman\u2019s dismissal, there is substantial evidence supporting the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that Lorge did not carry its burden of establishing an affirmative defense that Cooperman would have been terminated in any event because of those other factors. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Transp. Mgmt. Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 397, 402-03, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983) (citing <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. 1083 (1980)), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, </em>512 U.S. 267, 276-78, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is DENIED and the application for enforcement of the February 19, 2008 order of the NLRB is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
