Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss in part this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">Respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further arr gument. See <em>United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-20\">A review of the administrative record demonstrates that petitioner David Robert Salazar De Dios has presented no evidence that he has a qualifying relative for purposes of cancellation of removal as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner David Robert Salazar De Dios was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-21\">Petitioners\u2019 claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) and for withholding of removal failed to present evidence of changed country conditions in Mexico that are material to petitioners and their circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Because petitioners have failed to meet their burden of establishing a prima facie CAT or withholding of removal claim to support reopening, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-22\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s February 8, 2008 order. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also Membreno v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1227, 1230 n. 5 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b374-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
