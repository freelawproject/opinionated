We find these documents to be the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal, since they gave the \u201cpertinent information\u201d and \u201cplainly evidenced] an intention to appeal.\u201d <em>Campiti v. Matesanz, </em>333 F.3d 317, 320 (1st Cir.2003). As respondent acknowledges, the appeal is thus timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">Petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence showing that he was in constructive possession of a stash of cocaine, which was found in the basement of the house in which he and his wife lived. Proof of constructive possession under Massachusetts law requires two elements: (1) knowledge, and (2) the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Sespedes, </em>442 Mass. 95, 810 N.E.2d 790, 793 (2004). At trial, petitioner sought to rebut this theory by arguing that the house was a two-family dwelling and the basement was a common area. The Appeals Court held that the evidence on this point, although \u201csomewhat inconsistent,\u201d was sufficient to warrant submission to the jury. <em>Commonwealth v. Pimental, </em>67 Mass.App.Ct. 1103, 852 N.E.2d 136, 2006 WL 2355482, at *2 (Mass.App.Ct.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">As an aside, we note that petitioner\u2019s challenge would likely fall short even on the arguendo assumption that the house <em>was </em>a two-family dwelling. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Velasquez, </em>48 Mass.App.Ct. 147, 718 N.E.2d 398, 402 (1999) (\u201cThat others in the building also had access to the basement and might have hidden drugs in the basement does not require a finding of not guilty in favor of Velasquez.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 571 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>N.E.2d 1372, 1383 (1991) (similar). But no such assumption need be made here, for when the record \u201csupports conflicting inferences,\u201d a federal habeas court \u201cmust presume ... that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We can thus proceed on the assumption that the house was a one-family dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is governed by the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Jackson: </em>\u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (emphasis deleted). As the district court properly observed, \u201cthe inquiry is not whether the Appeals Court was correct in finding the evidence of constructive possession sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather whether its judgment amounted to a decision that unreasonably applied <em>Jackson.\u201d Pimental v. Spencer, </em>2008 WL 2066967, at *3 (D.Mass.2008) (applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)); <em>accord, e.g., Hurtado v. Tucker, </em>245 F.3d 7, 14-20 (1st Cir.2001). For the reasons enumerated by the district court, the Appeals Court cannot be said to have unreasonably applied the <em>Jackson </em>standard. <em>See Pimental, </em>2008 WL 2066967, at *3-*4 (describing circumstantial evidence of guilt and noting lack of any indication \u201cthat the Appeals Court ignored material evidence or failed to give appropriate weight to all of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Petitioner properly acknowledges in his brief that he faces a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in seeking habeas relief based on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In <em>Hurtado, </em>we stated that, \u201cas a general rule,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">federal courts should be particularly cautious about issuing habeas, on grounds of the objective unreasonableness of a state court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence is sufficient, where there has been a verdict of guilt by a jury of a defendant\u2019s peers, where the defendant\u2019s credibility was evaluated by the jury hearing his testimony, where that verdict has been affirmed on appeal in the state system, and where there is no claim of constitutional error in the conduct of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">245 F.3d at 19-20. Although one distinguishing factor is that petitioner here did not testify, we nonetheless find this cautionary note equally applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
