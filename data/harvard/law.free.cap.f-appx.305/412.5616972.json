Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review legal determinations de novo, <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2007), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The BIA correctly determined that Kim was ineligible for relief because her conditional lawful permanent resident status was terminated on May 15, 2002, more than 10 months before removal proceedings were initiated. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (an alien previously admitted for lawful permanent residence is ineligible for a 212(h) waiver if the alien has not \u201clawfully resided continuously in the United States for a period of not less than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We lack jurisdiction over Kim\u2019s contention that the IJ denied her due process by pretermitting her adjustment of status application because she did not raise the claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (exhaustion of claims within the agency\u2019s competence is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b438-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
