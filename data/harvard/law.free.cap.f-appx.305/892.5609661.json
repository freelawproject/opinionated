After SBC settled a <em>qui tarn </em>action with the United States,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Longmont United Hospital (\u201cLongmont\u201d), a Medicare participant located in Colorado, filed a class action suit, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>four violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On June 26, 2007, 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>WL 1850881, the District Court granted SBC\u2019s motion to dismiss Longmont\u2019s RICO claims under Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6) because it held that Longmont\u2019s complaint failed to show both proximate causation and SBC\u2019s participation in a RICO \u201centerprise.\u201d Because we agree with the District Court that SBC\u2019s conduct was not the proximate cause of Longmont\u2019s injuries, we will affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with this case, we need not repeat the factual or procedural background.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Under the civil RICO statute, \u201cany person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). In order for the plaintiff to have standing to assert a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), the alleged RICO violation must be the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U.S. 451, 457, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006); <em>Holmes v. Secs. Investor Prot. Corp., </em>503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). \u201cWhen a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Anza, </em>547 U.S. at 461, 126 S.Ct. 1991. The motivating principles behind this need for \u201csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged\u201d include: 1) the difficulty in ascertaining damages caused by remote actions; 2) the risk of duplicative recoveries; and 3) the prospect that more immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to pursue their own claims. <em>Id. </em>at 457-60, 126 S.Ct. 1991; <em>see also Holmes, </em>503 U.S. at 269-70, 112 S.Ct. 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Here, we have no difficulty finding that SBC\u2019s conduct was not the proximate cause of Longmont\u2019s injuries. According to Longmont, SBC\u2019s scheme reduced Longmont\u2019s Medicare reimbursements by both increasing the cost threshold necessary to qualify for \u201cOutlier Payments\u201d \u2014 payments designed to compensate hospitals for treating especially costly patients \u2014 and decreasing the amount of those payments. It is clear from Longmont\u2019s complaint, however, that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) stands between SBC\u2019s conduct and Longmont\u2019s injuries. As Longmont acknowledges, CMS is \u201cthe agency that interpreted the Medicare Act, promulgated and enforced Medicare payment regulations, and through its agents administered Medicare payment[s].\u201d (Class Action Compl. at 8 n. 1.) The \u201cOutlier [Payment] Threshold is the amount established annually by CMS.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>1149.) CMS also \u201cassignfed] the [statewide average] to a hospital when its [cost-to-charge ratio fell] below the National Threshold____\u201d <em>(Id. </em>1154.) This CMS policy \u201cgenerate[d] excessive Outlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Payments\u201d because the \u201chigher [statewide average] is then applied\u201d to the formula used to calculate Outlier Payments. <em>(Id. </em>H 58.) It also allowed SBC to continue receiving excessive Outlier Payments despite auditing. <em>(See id.) </em>Therefore, SBC\u2019s alleged inflation of hospital costs did not cause Longmont\u2019s injuries; instead, it was CMS\u2019s response to this behavior \u2014 reimbursing SBC for its inflated costs without ensuring that they were justified and raising the qualification threshold for Outlier Payments in subsequent years \u2014 that led to a decrease in Longmont\u2019s Outlier Payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Longmont argues that CMS \u201cmerely occupied a \u2018spatially intermediate position\u2019 between SBC and the plaintiffs.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 32.) Longmont focuses on the fixed loss threshold (\u201cFLT\u201d) that CMS used to calculate the qualifying threshold for Outlier Payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Longmont, \u201cthe rise in the FLT was a necessary, automatic and foreseeable consequence of SBC\u2019s fraud, a consequence required by the rules governing the outlier pool.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 28.) Longmont asserts that, in response to SBC\u2019s inflated cost reporting, CMS had to increase the FLT, which in turn raised the threshold for Outlier Payments, because CMS was \u201cmandated\u201d to keep Outlier Payments at 5.1 percent of the projected total budget for Medicare payments. <em>(See id. </em>at 29.) Longmont, however, has not identified the source for such a mandate, nor what other \u201crules governing the outlier pool\u201d made the rise in FLT \u201cnecessary, automatic and foreseeable.\u201d This is not surprising. No such mandate or rule exists. CMS\u2019s governing statute only required it to keep Outlier Payments between five and six percent of estimated total Medicare payments for that year. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(A)(iv). CMS certainly had the authority to keep FLT constant as long as total Outlier Payments fell within that range.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Additionally, Longmont overstates the importance of CMS\u2019s FLT-setting methodology to our proximate cause inquiry. Separate and apart from its calculation of FLT and the Outlier Payment threshold, CMS\u2019s policy of substituting a statewide average in place of below-threshold cost-to-charge ratios in calculating Outlier Payments and its failure to adequately scrutinize the accuracy of SBC\u2019s inflated cost reports are crucial in any attempt to link SBC\u2019s conduct to Longmont\u2019s harm. Indeed, regulations enacted in 2003 allowed CMS to prevent conduct like SBC\u2019s from ever harming hospitals like Longmont by \u201cadjusting] Outlier payments retroactively once hospitals\u2019 cost reports are audited\u201d and forcing those who violate the rules to \u201crepay the money they receive[d] improperly.\u201d <em>(See </em>Class Action Compl. U 71.) This underscores that government discretion played a significant role in causing Longmont\u2019s alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Longmont also overlooks the significant temporal delay that occurred between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>SBC\u2019s reporting of inflated costs and Longmont\u2019s injury. At the May 8, 2007 hearing on SBC\u2019s motion to dismiss, Longmont\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cwhat Congress has mandated that CMS do is to project the costs in the following year and to project what the outlier pool will consist of, but they use two-year-old data. So in 1999, they would be using 1998 data to project the 2000 year pool.\u201d (J.A. 641-42.) This means that SBC\u2019s conduct would not have influenced the amount of Outlier Payments that Longmont received until two years after SBC submitted the' inflated cost report, and even then only if CMS made no changes to the way that it calculated Outlier Payments, had not discovered SBC\u2019s allegedly fraudulent actions, nor otherwise adjusted the Outlier Payments made to SBC so that they were not excessive. Finding proximate causation here would require stretching the concept past its breaking point.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The three motivating principles at the heart of the proximate cause requirement support our holding in this case. First, it would be nearly impossible to ascertain the amount of Longmont\u2019s damages attributable to SBC\u2019s reporting of inflated costs, as opposed to CMS\u2019s interpretation of the Medicare Act, promulgation and enforcement of Medicare payment regulations, and administration of the Medicare payment regime. Second, it may well be that there is an appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries here, <em>see Holmes, </em>503 U.S. at 269, 112 S.Ct. 1311, but even if there is not, our disposition remains unchanged, <em>see Anza, </em>547 U.S. at 459, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (finding no proximate causation \u201c[njotwithstanding the lack of any appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries ... \u201d). Third, although Longmont disputes whether the government was a more direct victim of SBC\u2019s alleged fraud, it cannot deny that the government was a direct victim. Here, the government has already \u201cvindicated the laws by pursuing [its] own claims,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 460, 126 S.Ct. 1991, and entering into a $265 million settlement with SBC on June 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">At best, Longmont suffered harms indirectly related to SBC\u2019s alleged \u201cturbocharging.\u201d Any impact that SBC\u2019s conduct had on Longmont hinges entirely upon CMS\u2019s administration of the Medicare reimbursement system. Since \u201c[t]here is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit RICO suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 460, 126 S.Ct. 1991, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant SBC\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-11\">. The settlement agreement expressly provided that it was not an admission of SBC\u2019s liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-12\">. Specifically, Longmont alleged that SBC committed two RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), and participated in a conspiracy to commit those RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). The \u201cracketeering activity\" asserted was multiple instances of mail and wire fraud, and criminal transporting and receiving stolen or converted money. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343, 2314, and 2315.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">In addition to SBC, Longmont also named as defendants ten hospitals associated with SBC and the officers and trustees of SBC. The complaint claimed unfair competition against SBC and the hospitals, and negligence against all defendants. Longmont withdrew the negligence claims before the District Court made a ruling on SBC\u2019s motion to dismiss, and has not appealed the District Court's decision to dismiss its unfair competition claim. SBC is the only named defendant remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"AdT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Finally, Maine Coast Memorial Hospital, a plaintiff in the action before the District Court, has not appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to grant SBC's motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review the District Court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, see Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2008). In doing so, we must \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233 (internal quotations omitted). Because we hold that Longmont failed to show proximate cause, we do not need to decide whether Longmont\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleged SBC\u2019s participation in a RICO \"enterprise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-6\">. The qualifying threshold for Outlier Payments is equal to the FLT \u201cadjusted to apply to each hospital on the basis of an area wage adjustment and an adjustment for the type of area in which the hospital is located.\u201d (Class Action Compl. 1145.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">. Longmont has not alleged facts sufficient to show that SBC's cost inflation, by itself, would have required CMS to raise FLT in any given year in order to meet its statutory obligations. Although Outlier Payments during the relevant time period may have ranged from 7.6 to 7.9 percent of total Medicare payments, <em>(see </em>Class Action Compl. 1164) these Outlier Payments resulted from \"the behavior of a few hundred hospitals\u201d that \"took advantage of the outlier program,\u201d <em>(id. </em>H 70), while SBC was only alleged to have owned or operated ten different hospitals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
