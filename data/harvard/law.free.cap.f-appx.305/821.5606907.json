Cooley contended in his complaint that his constitutional rights were violated on March 7, 2007, when, both during and after his criminal sentencing before Judge Cunningham in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, sheriffs used excessive force while removing him from the courthouse. Cooley also alleged that county sheriffs used racial slurs against him and that prison officials denied him medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">Cooley filed numerous pre-trial motions in the case. A magistrate judge, who is presiding over pretrial matters, denied several of Cooley\u2019s motions. The motions included a motion to appoint trial counsel, a motion for leave to amend his complaint, and several discovery-related motions. Following the magistrate judge\u2019s orders denying the motions, Cooley sought review with the district judge. The district judge, upon review of the appeal, issued a June 26, 2008 Opinion and Order of the Court affirming the magistrate judge\u2019s prior determinations. He also denied motions filed by Cooley seeking to recuse the mag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>istrate judge and to obtain a default judgment against defendants for their alleged failure to produce certain discovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy. See <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Ct., </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Within the discretion of the issuing court, mandamus traditionally may be \u201cused ... only \u2018to conf\u00edne an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). A petitioner must show \u201cno other adequate means to attain the desired relief, and ... a right to the writ [that] is clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>See In re Patenaude, </em>210 F.3d 135, 141 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Cooley, in filing his petition for writ of mandamus, seeks in essence to obtain interlocutory review of the district judge\u2019s June 26, 2008 Order denying Cooley\u2019s various pretrial non-dispositive motions. Mandamus is not a substitute for appeal, however. <em>See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct., </em>542 U.S. 367, 380-81, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004); <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996). Cooley has not demonstrated that he is without other adequate means for relief. <em>In re Patenaude, </em>210 F.3d at 141. At a later time, on appeal (if necessary), Cooley may renew his arguments about the district court\u2019s rulings. Indeed, mandamus is \u201cavailable only when necessary to prevent grave injustice.\u201d <em>Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>738 F.2d 587, 591 (3d Cir.1984). We perceive no \u201cgrave injustice\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The only issue in Cooley\u2019s Petition for Writ of Mandamus over which this Court might provide mandamus review is the District Court\u2019s denial of Cooley\u2019s motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 to recuse the magistrate judge. <em>See In re Sch. Asbestos Litig., </em>977 F.2d 764, 776-78 (3d Cir.1992). Cooley\u2019s motion for recusal and belief that the magistrate judge showed bias are based primarily upon the magistrate judge\u2019s rulings on various motions that he filed. As the District Court correctly noted, judicial rulings rarely constitute a basis for recusal. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). We are not persuaded that the magistrate judge\u2019s rulings demonstrate any kind of bias, let alone one justifying mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">For the foregoing reasons, mandamus relief is not appropriate here. We will deny the petition. Petitioner\u2019s motion to intervene and demand for stay are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">. In a matter docketed at C.A. No. 08-3184, we address Cooley's interlocutory appeal of the district judge\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
