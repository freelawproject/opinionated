We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">Ortiz contends that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(A). We reject this contention because the district court properly found that Ortiz\u2019s conviction under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 13-3405 for transportation of marijuana for sale qualified as a predicate drug trafficking felony under the modified categorical approach. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Almazan-Becerra, </em>537 F.3d 1094, 1100 (9th Cir.2008). In addition, Ortiz\u2019s contention that the judicially noticeable documents introduced by the government to satisfy its burden under the modified categorical approach referred to his co-defendant is contradicted by the undisputed presentence report. <em>See United States v. Snipe, </em>515 F.3d 947, 955 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-19\">Ortiz also contends that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it failed to explain its rejection of his various departure requests, or to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We conclude that the district court did not commit procedural error and that Ortiz\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 994-95 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">The Government\u2019s motion to strike portions of Ortiz\u2019s reply brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b455-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
