We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Ayala contends that the district court erred by denying him a minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because it misinterpreted the Guidelines and improperly concluded that a courier convicted of importing drugs cannot qualify for a minor role reduction. We conclude that the district court did not misinterpret the Guidelines and did not clearly err in declining to apply a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Rosales-Rodriguez, </em>289 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436-37 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Ayala further contends that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because the district court relied on erroneous facts and imposed a sentence that was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals. We conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, and that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b465-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
