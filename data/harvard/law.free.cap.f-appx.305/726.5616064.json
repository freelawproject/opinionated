Nelson, which denied Gao-Zhu\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Bingen Gao-Zhu, </em>No. A98 595 847 (B.I.A. Mar. 18, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 595 847 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Jian Hui Shao v. B.I.A., </em>465 F.3d 497, 500 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). Questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact are reviewed <em>de novo. Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-19\">Upon our review of the record, we find no error in the IJ\u2019s denial of Gao-Zhu\u2019s application for asylum. As the IJ found, Gao-Zhu failed to establish past persecution where he was never physically harmed by the police, he was able to avoid police detection by relocating within the country, and his only encounter with the police was a single incident in which the police came to his house and arrested his mother but had no contact with him because he hid elsewhere in the house. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Kambolli v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 454, 457 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We further conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Gao-Zhu failed to establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, which requires that an applicant show a subjective fear of persecution that is objectively reasonable. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). A fear is objectively reasonable \u201ceven if there is only a slight, though discernible, chance of persecution.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)). On the other hand, a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Here, the IJ determined that Gao-Zhu did not provide sufficient evidence showing that his fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable. Gao-Zhu, who admittedly is not a Falun Gong practitioner, offered little testimony or evidence regarding the threat that he would be arrested in China for distributing Falun Gong leaflets on one occasion. As the IJ found, the letters Gao-Zhu submitted from his mother and grandmother failed to substantiate his general and meager testimony. Further, Gao-Zhu failed to submit a letter from his father, who allegedly had the most specific information regarding the police visits to Gao-Zhu\u2019s home in China. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) (an IJ may require corroboration of \u201cotherwise credible testimony ... unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d). Gao-Zhu\u2019s explanation for failing to provide such a letter, that his father is a poorly educated farmer who \u201cdoesn\u2019t really have time,\u201d was reasonably found insufficient by the IJ. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 79-80 (2d Cir.2005). Because there is no \u201csolid support\u201d in the record for Gao-Zhu\u2019s contention that he will be persecuted if returned to China, we will not disturb the IJ\u2019s finding that he did not demonstrate an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. <em>See Jian Xing Huang, </em>421 F.3d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Because Gao-Zhu was unable to show the objective likelihood of future persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Turning to Gao-Zhu\u2019s claim for CAT relief based on his illegal departure from China, aside from general country conditions evidence, he failed to provide any particularized evidence demonstrating that similarly situated individuals have been tortured upon removal to China. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005). For that reason, as the IJ found, Gao-Zhu failed to meet his burden of proving he would be tortured when he returns to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
