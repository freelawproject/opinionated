De-Fonzo, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Tian Ming Huang, </em>No. A95 709 990 (B.I.A. Feb. 25, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 709 990 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 28, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements it, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). Questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact are reviewed <em>de novo. See Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">We conclude that the agency did not err in finding that Huang had not demonstrated eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. Huang failed to show that at least one \u201ccentral reason\u201d for any persecution he suffered was \u201con account of\u2019 his political opinion, <em>i.e., </em>his opposition to China\u2019s coercive population control policy. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00ae; <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 (2d Cir.2005) (an \u201capplicant must also show, through direct or circumstantial evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that the persecutor\u2019s motive to persecute arises from the applicant\u2019s political belief\u201d). Indeed, it appears that the \u201ccentral reason\u201d he and his family suffered mistreatment was that he, at the age of 21, impregnated and absconded with his Village Chiefs 18-year old daughter, and the Village Chief pursued Huang as a disapproving father, not on account of Huang\u2019s political opinion. In addition, Huang was not eligible for relief based on his girlfriend\u2019s forced abortion, and Huang had not engaged in \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s coercive population control policy. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308-10 (2d Cir.2007). Because Huang failed to show persecution on account of his political opinion, the agency did not err in denying Huang asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-56 (2d Cir.2006) (withholding claim necessarily fails if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">With regard to Huang\u2019s claim for CAT relief, the agency properly concluded that Huang failed to show that he will more likely than not suffer torture upon return to China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
