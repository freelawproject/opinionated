On appeal, Perlaza argues that the government breached his plea agreement by introducing post-arrest, incriminating statements he made in a proffer, which his plea agreement barred the government from introducing. He also argues that the district court erred in determining the amount of drugs for which he was responsible because it based the calculation on the post-arrest statements, which his plea agreement forbade the court from considering, and because the court made no finding that his actions were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as his offense of conviction. Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">I. Breach of Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">We review whether the government beached a plea agreement <em>de novo, </em>but we review the district court\u2019s factual findings as to the scope of a plea agreement for clear error. <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 288, 172 L.Ed.2d 150 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\"><em>\u201cA </em>material promise by the government, which induces a defendant to plead guilty, binds the government to that promise. Whether the government violated the agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement when he entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>487 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">Because the plea agreement does not reflect an agreement that the government could not use incriminating statements Perlaza had already made to state officers in calculating his guideline range, the government did not breach the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">II. Drug-Quantity Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs properly attributable to a defendant for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1347 (11th Cir.2002). Objections to sentencing issues that are not raised in the district court are reviewed for plain error and can only be corrected if there is an error, that is plain, and that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). If these criteria are met, a court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>has the discretion to correct the error, but \u201cshould\u201d correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, 507 </em>U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cWhere errors could have cut either way and uncertainty exists, the burden is the decisive factor in the third prong of the plain error test, and the burden is on the defendant.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">To determine a defendant\u2019s offense level, a district court may consider \u201cquantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.12). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), the base offense level is to be determined based on acts \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.3) (providing that \u201cmultiple counts of conviction are not required for subsection (a)(2) to apply\u201d). \u201cFor two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus operandi.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Because Perlaza admitted in his plea agreement that he was involved in four other cocaine deliveries and because the government presented evidence that each delivery involved three kilograms of cocaine, the district court did not clearly err in determining that he was responsible for at least five kilograms of cocaine. Perlaza\u2019s argument \u2014 that the court failed to make a finding that his actions were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as his offense of conviction \u2014 fails because the district court implicitly made this finding by adopting the probation officer\u2019s drug quantity calculations and because the court was entitled to make this finding implicitly. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
