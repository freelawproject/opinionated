The district court sentenced him to a 100-month term of imprisonment, the bottom of the advisory sentencing guidelines range. Maness appeals his sentence on two grounds. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">Maness first contends that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by increasing his sentence based upon the uncharged conduct of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine where that conduct was neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Maness\u2019 claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 322-23 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cWhen applying the Guidelines in an advisory manner, the district court can make factual findings using the preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1121, 169 L.Ed.2d 951 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">Maness also asserts that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense-possession with intent to distribute 1.6 grams of crack cocaine. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) (2006). He contends that the amount of crack was not large enough to infer an intent to distribute and notes that the crack was not packaged for distribution and that he did not possess drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">We review a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe first step in this review requires us to \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such... as improperly calculating ... the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2525, 171 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008). We then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. Id.; <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001) (reviewing for clear error enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense). \u201cClear error occurs when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 336-37 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The clearly erroneous \u201cstandard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Section 2K2.1 (b)(6) provides for a four-level enhancement if the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. This finding encompasses two requirements: that the defendant committed \u201canother felony\u201d and that he possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the other felony.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 410 (4th Cir.2003). \u201c \u2018Another felony offense\u2019, for purposes of subsection (b)(6), means any federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(C); <em>see United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing elements of offense of possession with intent to distribute controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">With these standards in mind, we have carefully reviewed the record on appeal. Our review leads us to conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement in USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6). See <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\"> Maness does not challenge the \u201cin connection with\u201d element on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
