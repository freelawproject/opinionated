We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Rostomian v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners did not establish they suffered past persecution based on general incidents of discrimination and a single incident of robbery that occurred in 1974. <em>See id. </em>(acts of random violence during periods of civil strife do not establish persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish a fear of future persecution because, even as members of a disfavored group, petitioners did not demonstrate the requisite level of individualized risk in order to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
