Mar. 18, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). An alien seeking to reopen proceedings must file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the issuance of a final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, an applicant may be excused from compliance with the 90-day time limit if he submits evidence establishing changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">Here, it is undisputed that Wu\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely where it was not filed until September 2007, more than ten years after the BIA issued its final order of removal in August 1997. Wu does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that the birth of his U.S.-born children constituted a change in personal circumstances, rather than a change in country conditions and has therefore waived any such challenge. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005). Rather, Wu contends that the reopening of his proceedings was warranted based on new, previously unavailable evidence that established changed country conditions. He argues that the BIA erred by: 1) fading to recognize that his evidence was new and previously unavailable, and 2) failing to recognize that a change in China\u2019s family-planning policy constituted a material change in country conditions. However, neither of Wu\u2019s arguments addresses the actual basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>BIA\u2019s decision \u2014 its finding that his affidavit, which was the only evidence of changed country conditions that Wu submitted, was vague and uncorroborated and thus insufficient to establish that the family-planning policy in Wu\u2019s hometown had actually changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Wu raises no challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding that his evidence was insufficient to meet his heavy burden of demonstrating changed country conditions warranting reopening of his proceedings. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (finding that an alien bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d of proof in establishing that reopening of his removal proceedings is warranted). Thus, Wu has waived any argument he might have had that the BIA abused its discretion in concluding that his affidavit did not demonstrate changed country conditions in China or establish Wu\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
