Moore, an African-American male, alleges that his former employer, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (the \u201cDEA\u201d), denied him a promotion because of his race and gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. Moore now appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary, judgment to the United States Attorney General (the \u201cGovernment\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">The following facts are presented in the light most favorable to Moore. <em>See Howard v. Winter, </em>446 F.3d 559, 562 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006). Moore was employed by the DEA from 1985 until he retired in 2004. At all times relevant to this appeal, Moore was a GS-13 Information Technology Specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-15\">Deborah Roberts, a white female \u2014 and the DEA employee who received the challenged promotion at issue in this appeal\u2014 became a GS-13 Information Technology Specialist with the DEA in 1998. Prior to accepting that position, Roberts was employed as a Programmer Analyst/Senior Consultant with a government contractor from 1990-1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">In January 2003, one of Roberts\u2019 and Moore\u2019s supervisors, Dennis McCrary, a white male, temporarily promoted Roberts to Acting Unit Chief of the DEA\u2019s Enterprise and Field Systems Unit (the \u201cSISE\u201d). At the time, Roberts was a GS-13 employee in SISE and the temporary promotion, which was only scheduled to last 120 days, elevated her to the GS-14 pay scale. The permanent SISE Unit Chief position was vacant ' because McCrary had reassigned the Unit Chief, Kenneth Tyskowski, a white male, to another section. In explaining why he gave Roberts the temporary promotion, McCrary stated that \u201cshe had some of the more visible and difficult projects in that organization and she was doing them very well.\u201d J.A. 326-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">McCrary terminated Roberts\u2019 promotion in May 2003 to comply with federal regulations requiring that temporary details last<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ing longer than 120 days be subject to a merit promotion program. The salary increase associated with Roberts\u2019 temporary promotion also ended in May 2003, and she was returned to GS-13 pay. However, McCrary allowed Roberts to continue performing the duties of Acting Unit Chief until November 2003. During this time period, Moore told McCrary that it would be unfair if he did not allow other employees to serve as Acting Unit Chief. McCrary replied that \u201c[l]ife isn\u2019t fair.\u201d JA. 788. McCrary later explained that he allowed Roberts to continue serving in an acting capacity \u201cto maintain continuity and reduce turmoil\u201d in the unit. J.A. 392. While serving as Acting Unit Chief, Roberts supervised employees who would ultimately compete with her for the permanent Unit Chief position, and she had the opportunity to attend and participate in certain management meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In August 2003, the DEA sought applicants to fill the SISE Unit Chief position on a permanent basis. One of the DEA\u2019s Human Resources Specialists advertised the vacancy, reviewed all of the applications, and compiled a \u201cbest qualified list\u201d (\u201cBQL\u201d) for the vacancy. The BQL listed all of the applicants who possessed at least the minimum qualifications necessary for the permanent position. In this case, the BQL listed Roberts, Moore, and five other individuals: Patrick Duffy (white male), Terry Ford (African-American male), Evelyn Kelley (African-American female), Dorretha Tumlin (African-American female), and Mark Kirksey (African-American male).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Next, one of the DEA\u2019s Unit Chiefs, Ruth Torres (white female) convened an interview/evaluation panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) to interview the seven candidates and make a hiring recommendation to McCrary. Torres selected three other DEA Unit Chiefs \u2014 one white male, one African-American female, and one Asian-Anerican male \u2014 to serve on the Panel with her. The Panel developed interview questions and asked each of the seven candidates the same questions. After every interview, each Panel member independently rated the candidates\u2019 responses to the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">After completing the interviews, the Panel ranked all seven candidates. The Panel unanimously agreed that Roberts was one of the top two candidates; specifically, two panelists ranked Roberts first and two panelists ranked her second. The Panel concluded that Roberts had in-depth working knowledge, experience, and managerial potential, which she demonstrated through her resume, interview, and work experience. J.A. 229-30, 377-79. The Panel also concluded that Roberts demonstrated her ability to manage multiple complex tasks in a highly efficient and effective manner. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the Panel recommended three candidates to McCrary: Roberts, Tumlin, and Kirksey. The Panel did not rank Moore as one of the top three candidates, and it did not recommend him to McCrary for the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Upon receiving the Panel\u2019s recommendation, McCrary ranked the three candidates in order of his preference: (1) Roberts, (2) Tumlin, and (3) Kirksey. McCrary then forwarded this list to his supervisor who allowed him to promote Roberts to SISE Unit Chief. Roberts was promoted in November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, Moore filed this action alleging that he was intentionally discriminated against and denied a promotion to the SISE Unit Chief position because of his race and gender. In response, the Government moved for summary judgment, arguing that Moore was not denied a promotion or otherwise discriminated against because of his race or gender. The district court entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>summary judgment in favor of the Government on the grounds that (1) the DEA offered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for not promoting Moore, and (2) Moore failed to establish that the DEA\u2019s stated reasons were pretext for race or gender discrimination. Moore timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Garofolo v. Donald B. Heslep Assocs., Inc., </em>405 F.3d 194, 198 (4th Cir.2005). At the same time, however, such inferences must \u201cfall within the range of reasonable probability and not be so tenuous as to amount to speculation or conjecture.\u201d <em>Thompson Everett, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Cable Adver., L.P., </em>57 F.3d 1317, 1323 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The relevant inquiry in a summary judgment analysis is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Indeed, there must be \u201csufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party. If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative,\u201d summary judgment should be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 249-50,106 S.Ct. 2505 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In general, a Title VII plaintiff may defeat summary judgment through one of two avenues of proof. First, a plaintiff may establish through direct or circumstantial evidence that race or gender was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the adverse employment action. <em>Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., </em>354 F.3d 277, 284 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc). Second, a plaintiff may proceed under the \u201cburden-shifting framework\u201d adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Hill, </em>354 F.3d at 285, 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">On appeal, Moore confines his argument to the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 285. If the plaintiff carries this initial burden, then \u201cthe burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis burden, however, is a burden of production, not persuasion.\u201d <em>Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 208, 214 (4th Cir.2007). \u201cAssuming the employer meets this burden of production, \u2018the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework-with its presumptions and burdens-disappear[s], and the sole remaining issue [is] discrimination <em>vel non.\u201d\u2019 Hill, </em>354 F.3d at 285 (quoting <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)). In other words, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s stated reasons for taking the employment action were not its true reasons, but rather \u201cpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>text\u201d for unlawful discrimination. <em>Hill, </em>854 F.3d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Even under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, however, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the employer\u2019s actions were discriminatory. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 507-08, 511-12, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). Indeed, \u201c[r]egardless of the type of evidence offered by a plaintiff as support for her discrimination claim (direct, circumstantial, or evidence of pretext), ... [t]he ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>354 F.3d at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Applying these principles to this case, Moore can establish a prima facie case of discriminatory failure to promote by establishing: (1) he is a member of a protected group, (2) he applied for the position in question, (3) he was qualified for the position, and (4) the DEA rejected his application under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. <em>Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>406 F.3d 248, 268 (4th Cir.2005). For purposes of our analysis, we will assume, without deciding, that Moore has established a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the burden then shifts to the DEA to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for selecting Roberts instead of Moore. In this regard, the Government states that Roberts was a better qualified candidate. It supports this assertion by noting, inter alia, (1) Roberts was highly recommended to McCrary by the Panel; (2) Roberts had in-depth working knowledge, experience, and managerial potential, which she demonstrated through her resume, interview, and work experience; and (3) Moore was not among the top three candidates recommended by the Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">As a threshold matter, Moore contends that summary judgment should not have been granted because the Government failed to rebut his prima facie case. Moore argues that the Government\u2019s articulated reason for not promoting him\u2014 namely, that Roberts was better qualified \u2014 is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason because it is not credible. In Moore\u2019s view, Roberts gained her experience and qualifications in an unlawful manner and, therefore, she was not actually a better qualified candidate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, Moore argues, there is no need to proceed to the pretext stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis. In pressing this claim, however, Moore misapprehends the Government\u2019s burden. As noted above, the Government\u2019s burden at this stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis is one of production, not persuasion; it \u201ccan involve no credibility assessment.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>509 U.S. at 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742. Rather, the Government need only articulate \u201creasons for its actions which, <em>if believed by the trier of fact, </em>would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507, 113 S.Ct. 2742. Applying this standard, we conclude that the Government satisfied its burden. If Roberts was better qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>than Moore, then promoting her on that basis would be legitimate and non-diseriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Because the Government satisfied its burden under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the burden now shifts to Moore to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government\u2019s stated reasons were pretext for unlawful discrimination. \u201cA plaintiff alleging a failure to promote can prove pretext by showing that he was better qualified, or by amassing circumstantial evidence that otherwise undermines the credibility of the employer\u2019s stated reasons.\u201d <em>Heiko v. Colombo Savings Bank, F.S.B., </em>434 F.3d 249, 259 (4th Cir.2006). Moore offers several arguments which, in his view, establish that the Government\u2019s stated reasons were pretext. Mindful of our obligation to draw all reasonable, non-speculative inferences in Moore\u2019s favor, we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that Moore has not carried his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">First, Moore contends the Government\u2019s stated reasons were pretext because he was better qualified than Roberts. Moore argues that he had a superior educational background,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been employed by the federal government for a longer period of t\u00fane, and had experience supervising enlisted reserve members as a Leading Petty Officer of a Naval Reserve Unit. However, Moore undercuts this argument by stating that Roberts\u2019 applicable work experience\u2014 and, in particular, her experience serving as Acting Unit Chief \u2014 \u201cmade Roberts <em>as qualified as Moore.\u201d </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20 (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at 13 (stating that Roberts\u2019 experience placed her \u201con a level playing field with Moore\u201d). Under our case law, a Title VII plaintiff cannot rely on his qualifications to establish pretext if he asserts that his qualifications are similar or only slightly superior to those of the person ultimately selected for promotion. <em>See, e.g., Heiko, </em>434 F.3d at 261 (\u201cWhen a plaintiff asserts job qualifications that are similar or only slightly superior to those of the person eventually selected, the promotion decision remains vested in the sound business judgment of the employer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Further, Moore cannot rely on his qualifications to establish pretext because he has not presented evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he was better qualified than Roberts. The undisputed facts establish that both Moore and Roberts were at least minimally qualified to serve as SISE Unit Chief. It is also undisputed that the Panel \u2014 which was composed of a diverse group of four current DEA Unit Chiefs \u2014 interviewed all seven candidates and unanimously concluded that Roberts was one of the top two candidates and recommended her for the promotion. Moreover, the Panel rated Roberts, but not Moore, \u201chighly in the key areas of project management, potential for leadership and overall understanding of [applicable] ... business processes.\u201d J.A. 229. It is also undisputed that the Panel did not rank Moore as one of the top three candidates for the promotion. Even construed in the light most favorable to Moore, our case law makes plain that Moore\u2019s self-assessment of his superior aptitude for the position fails to rebut the Government\u2019s legitimate explanation. <em>See, e.g., Anderson, </em>406 F.3d at 269 (holding that a Title VII plaintiff \u201ccannot establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>her own criteria for judging her qualifications for the promotion\u201d but \u201cmust compete for the promotion based on the qualifications established by her employer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Next, Moore contends that McCrary\u2019s decision to use the Panel establishes pretext. In particular, Moore alleges that the Panel was not a lawful part of the promotion process, but rather a \u201csham\u201d designed to exclude Moore from competition and to conceal McCrary\u2019s unlawfully discriminatory animus. Beyond his assertions, however, Moore offers no evidence that would allow us to conclude that McCrary\u2019s use of the Panel was either unlawful or pretext for illegal discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the evidence establishes that the Panel was part of the DEA\u2019s normal promotion process. <em>See </em>J.A. 133-85, 544-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Finally, Moore argues that the Government\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for promoting Roberts were pretext because McCrary unlawfully preselected her for the promotion. In particular, Moore alleges that McCrary promoted Roberts to Acting Unit Chief and allowed her to serve in that capacity for longer than 120 days in violation of federal law so that she could gain the experience necessary to compete with Moore and, ultimately, outperform him during the Panel\u2019s interviews. In response, the Government argues that McCrary did not violate federal law because Roberts\u2019 temporary promotion, as well as her salary increase, did not last longer than 120 days. According to the Government, McCrary merely allowed Roberts to continue to perform the duties of Acting Unit Chief beyond 120 days to maintain continuity and reduce turmoil in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">We conclude that Moore\u2019s argument regarding preselection does not establish that the Government\u2019s stated reasons were pretext for unlawful discrimination. Indeed, rather than undermining the credibility of the Government\u2019s stated reasons for not promoting Moore, his argument actually supports the Government\u2019s assertion that McCrary promoted Roberts because she was better qualified than him due, in part, to the experience she gained during her temporary promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Importantly, there is no evidence that McCrary preselected Roberts on the basis of race or gender. Consequently, even if McCrary preselected Roberts by promoting her in violation of governing regulations \u2014 a question we do not decide \u2014 this type of preselection would be insufficient in this case to establish pretext. <em>See, e.g., Anderson, </em>406 F.3d at 271 (\u201c[WJhile preselection may establish that an employee was unfairly treated, it does not by itself prove racial discrimination.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Kennedy v. Landon, </em>598 F.2d 337, 341 (4th Cir.1979) (\u201cAlthough the pre-selection of Hardy may have violated the rules and regulations of the Department of Corrections, it does not evidence the type of discrimination that is prohibited by Title VTI.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As established above, the Government articulated legitimate, non-diseriminatory reasons for not promoting Moore. In turn, Moore did not present sufficient evidence to establish that the Government\u2019s stated reasons were pretext for race or gender discrimination. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to enter summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">. Moore alleges that Roberts gained her experience and qualifications for the Unit Chief position in an unlawful manner because McCrary elevated her to the Acting Unit Chief position and allowed her to stay in that position longer than 120 days in violation of federal law. Without this experience, Moore contends, Roberts would not have been better qualified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. Moore earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Science from the University of the District of Columbia and a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Business Management from the University of Maryland. Moore also served as Leading Petty Officer of a Naval Reserve Unit from 1984-1995 where he supervised 15 other reserve members. Roberts earned a high school diploma in 1974 and had 66 hours towards an Associate\u2019s Degree in Business Administration at Charles County Community College.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. In this regard, we note that one of the three candidates recommended by the Panel shared the same race and gender as Moore, and another one of the three shared the same race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. <em>Accord Mackey v. Shalala, </em>360 F.3d 463, 468-69 (4th Cir.2004). Relatedly, and as noted above, Moore states that he informed McCrary that there were concerns about not rotating different DEA employees into the Acting Unit Chief position. According to Moore, he told McCrary \"|i]t would be unfair if no one else was given the opportunity to serve in that capacity\u201d and Moore purportedly responded: \"Life isn\u2019t fair.\u201d J.A. 788. We conclude that this exchange is insufficient to establish that the Government\u2019s articulated explanations were pretext for unlawful discrimination because, inter alia, this evidence does not allow anything other than speculation about McCrary\u2019s motives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b144-6\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ADt9\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The majority\u2019s opinion invites us to overlook the Government\u2019s incredible deviation from its own regulations and procedures and the Appellant\u2019s evidence that this deviation was racially motivated. Because I believe that Mr. Moore\u2019s preselection theory of pretext has significantly more merit than the majority accords it, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The Government has a minimal burden to rebut a Title VII plaintiffs prima facie case under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting scheme.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, I will assume here that the Government\u2019s explanation that Roberts was better qualified suffices as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. But, even once the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>presumption has dropped from the case, we must still deal with Moore\u2019s contention that the only reason that Roberts was more qualified than other applicants was that she was allowed to remain in the Acting Chief position for months beyond the 120 days specified in the federal regulations. The majority dismisses this theory of pretext, suggesting that Moore\u2019s \u201cargument actually supports the Government\u2019s assertion that McCrary promoted Roberts because she was better qualified than him due, in part, to the experience she gained during her temporary promotion,\u201d <em>supra. </em>The majority, it seems, sees nothing wrong with the fact that the very advantages that Roberts had in the bid for the Unit Chief position were advantages that she had gained in apparent violation of federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Office of Personnel Management regulations specify that competitive procedures must be used for all details \u201cfor more than 120 days to a higher grade position or to a position with higher promotion potential.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.103(c)(ii) (2008). The DEA\u2019s own personnel manual echoes this language. <em>(See </em>J.A. 854 (\u201cTemporary assignments (details) to higher-graded positions or to positions with promotion potential for more than 120 days must be made under competitive promotion procedures.\u201d).) The Government suggests that it complied with these regulations by terminating Roberts\u2019 salary increase as Acting Chief after 120 days. But the regulations are not concerned with the length of non-competitive details simply because of the pay increases that accompany them. The regulations make clear that competitive procedures are needed to select longer-term detailees to both higher-graded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>positions <em>and </em>positions with \u201chigher promotion potential.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.103(e)(ii) (2008). Thus it is the increase in pay <em>and </em>the increased opportunity for promotion that prompted OPM to mandate that competitive procedures be used for long-term details. In other words, the regulations anticipate and seek to avoid just the outcome that we find in this case \u2014 a situation where a detailee who was not competitively selected is allowed to stay past 120 days, albeit at her normal salary, in a position that she is essentially being groomed to assume permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">While the Government has suggested that there was some need to maintain continuity and to reduce turmoil while the unit was going through a reorganization, these assertions, without more, cannot justify leaving Roberts as Acting Chief for eleven months \u2014 almost three times the length allowed under the regulations. Roberts\u2019 extra time in the Acting Chief position undoubtedly advantaged her unfairly in the promotion process. It was in these months as Acting Chief that Roberts \u201cdemonstrated [the] managerial potential\u201d that qualified her for the Unit Chief position. (J.A. 229.) Several members of the evaluation panel that interviewed her were fellow unit chiefs, with whom she met routinely for management meetings. During her time as Acting Chief, Roberts also had access to valuable leadership training opportunities that Moore and other applicants did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">McCrary was clearly aware that others had interest in being rotated into the Acting Chief position. Moore himself had informed McCrary that it was unfair not to</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">allow others to serve in that capacity, to which McCrary\u2019s only response was, \u201cLife isn\u2019t fair.\u201d (J.A. 651, 788.) This kind of insensitive and provocative response belies the Government\u2019s contention that Roberts was kept on as Acting in order to reduce turmoil in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Of course, preselection, however unfair it may be, does not by itself suffice to prove racial discrimination. <em>See Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>406 F.3d 248, 271 (4th Cir.2005). But I disagree with the majority\u2019s contention that \u201cthere is no evidence that McCrary preselected Roberts on the basis of race or gender,\u201d supra. Moore alleges in both his EEO affidavit and in his deposition testimony that, in the last twenty years, no African-Americans have been promoted above the GS-13 level in the DEA\u2019s Systems Applications Section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See J.A. 792, 670.) These statements remain uncontroverted on the record before us. Moreover, of the six intra-agency candidates listed on the BQL for the Chief position, four of them \u2014 Moore, Terry Ford, Evelyn Kelley, and Doi\u2019retha Tumlin \u2014 were AfrieanAmeriean.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without the experience she gained as a result of improperly being kept on as Acting Chief beyond the 120-day limit, Roberts may well have not been qualified, or at least not better qualified than others, for the permanent position. Thus, the evidence permits an inference that McCrary, as Moore himself puts it, \u201cknew there was a reasonable chance than an African-American would be Unit Chief, unless he made Roberts equally qualified by giving her the opportunity to gain experience, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that he could select her.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Based on this evidence, a jury could very well find that McCrary preselected Roberts for the Unit Chief position and that her preselection was racially motivated. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">The factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons will <em>permit </em>the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination, and ... no additional proof of discrimination is <em>required.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">(internal citation and quotations omitted) (emphasis in original); <em>accord Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <em>Anderson, </em>406 F.3d at 269 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">There is sufficient evidence under Moore\u2019s preselection theory to establish that the \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d that the Government proffered for promoting Roberts was pretext for racial discrimination, and I would, accordingly, reverse the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Government. Thus, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\">. The majority's opinion assumes without deciding that Moore has established his prima facie case. In fact, Moore's prima facie burden is easily met because (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he applied for the SISE Unit Chief position; (3) he was qualified for that position, as evidenced by his placement on the BQL; and (4) he was rejected from that position under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>See Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>406 F.3d 248, 268 (4th Cir.2005). This last element can be satisfied by demonstrating that the position was filled by a similarly qualified applicant outside the protected class, <em>Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., </em>354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), and, in this case, the position was filled by Roberts, a Caucasian woman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">. Moore himself was promoted to a GS-13 in 1989, and he was never promoted again before his retirement in 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. I will exclude Mark Kirksey from this analysis since he applied from outside DEA and would not have factored into McCrary\u2019s calcuius of the odds of an African-American applicant being selected for the Unit Chief position at the time McCrary decided to keep Roberts on as Acting beyond the 120-day limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-10\">. It is worth noting that McCrary himself regarded Tumlin as the next most qualified for the job, and that Roberts and Tumlin tied for first in the rankings of the evaluation panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
