A76 130 702, A70 697 710, A70 868 482 (B.I.A. Sept. 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A76 130 702, A70 697 710, A70 868 482 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 10, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both decisions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">As an Initial matter, because Petitioner's failed to challenge before this Court the agexxcy\u2019s denial of their CAT claims, we deem any such ai'guments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Regai\u2019ding Petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. For instance, it was not improper for the agency to find it implausible that Zheng would visit a government hospital to confirm her third pregnancy given her testimony that she had previously been warned that she could face aboi'tion or stexilization. See <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-68 (2d Cir.2007). While some of the IJ\u2019s findings \u201crelie[d] on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to [Petitioners\u2019] claim, ... the cumulative effect\u201d was \u201cconsequential.\u201d <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). Notably, the agency properly relied on significant discrepancies \u2014 and possible fraud \u2014 relative to a medical document bearing Zheng\u2019s name that was submitted in support of Zou\u2019s 1996 application for advance parole. Although Petitioners offered explanations for these (and othei') discrepancies, no i'easonable adjudicator would have been compelled to accept them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Ultimately, because the agency\u2019s credibility findings were \u201cbased upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice,\u201d we will not disturb them. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>ovemled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">In light of the foregoing, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was not improper. Furthermore, because Petitioners based their claims for withholding of removal on the same factual predicate, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination precludes success on those claims as well. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for i\u2019eview is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-11\">.
