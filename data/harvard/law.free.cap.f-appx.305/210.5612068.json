He argues that the sentence was unreasonable and that the district court incorrectly factored the length of waiting lists for drug rehabilitation programs within the Bureau of Prisons when choosing a sentence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">When a defendant violates a condition of probation, the district court, after a hearing and after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a), may revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant under the general provisions of subchapter A, taking into account the non-binding policy statements of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual Chapter 7. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565; <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.1997). A sentence imposed after a revocation of probation will be affirmed unless it is unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005) (revocation of supervised release); <em>see also United States v. Cloud, </em>194 Fed.Appx. 255, 257 (5th Cir.2006) (revocation of probation), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2934, 168 L.Ed.2d 265 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In this case, it was undisputed that Weathersby failed several drug tests while on probation. Twice before the hearing giving rise to this appeal, the district judge gave Weathersby another chance \u2014 first by sending him to a halfway house and then by allowing him to enroll in an inpatient treatment program. Within two months of completion of that program, he again tested positive for cocaine. At the hearing giving rise to this appeal, the district judge carefully went over the details of Weathersby\u2019s situation. She noted the numerous squandered opportunities he had been given to handle his problem and the length of time that had passed without benefit. In light of numerous factors, including the need to promote respect for the law and deterrence of similar conduct, she arrived at a sentence above the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">The defendant does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the guidelines or its analysis of his situation. Instead, he says his sentence is unreasonable, given the disparity between the sentence and the guidelines range as well as the guidelines sentence for the original offense (two to eight months). He argues that any delay by the Bureau of Prisons in putting him into treatment should not be a factor in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">A district court is not prohibited from considering, along with other factors, a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs in determining the length of a sentence of imprisonment upon revocation. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095, 1097 (5th Cir.1994)(addressing revocation of supervised release). While the district judge mentioned the fact that delays occur in obtaining treatment, she also stated that a five-year sentence was necessary to \u201ccompletely break the pattern of conduct and habit.\u201d This decision was not made in a vacuum \u2014 the same judge had repeatedly given this defendant opportunities to bring himself into compliance with his conditions of probation, to no avail. Moreover, the judge did not rely solely on this factor; instead, she carefully articulated several other factors. Indeed, the court very meticulously discussed Weathersby\u2019s individual situation and the section 3553 factors in light of <em>Gall\u2019s </em>admonition that an individualized assessment is necessary. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Weathersby has not shown that his sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
