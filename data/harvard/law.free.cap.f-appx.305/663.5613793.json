The court has determined that the issues presented no need for oral argument. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">Sunworld International Airlines petitions for review of the NTSB\u2019s order affirming the decision of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to revoke Sun-world\u2019s Air Carrier Certificate. Federal law requires an ah- carrier to obtain a Certificate, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44705, which the FAA may issue \u201cif ... [it] finds that the applicant\u201d meets several criteria, including possession of \u201ceconomic authority ... issued by the Department of Transportation,\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 119.39(a). Loss of economic authority is a ground for revocation of a Certificate, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 119.5(i); <em>Casino Airlines, Inc. v. NTSB, </em>439 F.3d 715, 716 (D.C.Cir.2006), as is termination of operations, <em>see Adm\u2019r v. Air Illinois, Inc., </em>6 N.T.S.B. 436, 440 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">Sunworld has not flown since the only aircraft on Sunworld\u2019s operating specifications was repossessed on November 11, 2004. Consequently, on November 15, 2004 the Department of Transportation (DOT) suspended Sunworld\u2019s economic authority. On June 6, 2005, the FAA notified Sunworld that it was going to revoke the airline\u2019s Certificate, but withdrew that notice on November 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">After inspecting Sunworld\u2019s facility in Florence, Kentucky, the FAA issued an order on September 12, 2006 revoking Sunworld\u2019s Certificate. In a subsequent action before the NTSB, in which Sun-world challenged the FAA\u2019s decision, Sun-world nominally denied the allegation that the DOT had suspended its economic authority, asserting that its authority was \u201cdormant\u201d and that it had pending a notice of intent to resume service. Sunworld, however, did not submit any evidence that controverted the November 15, 2004 letter from the DOT suspending its economic authority. The Administrative Law Judge granted summary judgment for the FAA, which the NTSB affirmed, reasoning that \u201c[t]he Board has long held that revocation of an am carrier\u2019s operating certificate is the appropriate sanction when the carrier ... has effectively terminated its operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">Sunworld argues the NTSB\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because neither any alleged regulatory violation nor the NTSB\u2019s precedent supported revocation. Sunworld also argues the FAA arbitrarily failed to explain why it changed the position it had taken in its letter of November 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The record contains substantial evidence, <em>viz. </em>the DOT\u2019S November 15, 2004 letter, to support the NTSB\u2019s determination that Sunworld lacked economic authority and therefore was not entitled to retain its Certif\u00edcate. Nor do we fault the NTSB\u2019s application of its precedent. Because Sunworld had neither possessed nor flown the only aircraft on its operations specifications for nearly two years when the FAA issued its order, the case for revocation was as strong as in <em>Air Illinois, </em>6 N.T.S.B. at 440. Sunworld\u2019s claimed intention to resume operations is irrelevant because \u201cthe Board\u2019s decision ... must be rendered on the basis of the record as cui'rently constituted, which clearly shows [Sunworld\u2019s] lack of qualifications.\u201d <em>Adm'r v. Sun Airlines, Inc., </em>1 N.T.S.B. 1859, 1861 (1972). In light of the foregoing, we need not decide whether the NTSB correctly concluded the FAA had proved other regulatory violations that would have justified revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Finally, the NTSB reasonably addressed Sunworld\u2019s argument that the present enforcement action was an unexplained change of position from the FAA\u2019s letter of November 2, 2005. The FAA\u2019s decision to revoke Sunworld\u2019s Certificate after previously having stayed its hand \u201cinvolve[d] a complicated balancing of a number of factors\u201d peculiarly within the province of the agency, including how best to use its resources, <em>see Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 881, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985), and the record supports the NTSB\u2019s decision to defer to the FAA\u2019s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. By the time the FAA revoked Sun-world\u2019s Certificate in September 2006, the airline had gone an additional ten months without a flight, making it even more apparent that Sunworld had ceased operations and therefore should not be permitted to retain its certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Sunworld\u2019s other arguments are frivolous or nearly so. The NTSB\u2019s stale complaint rule, which bars a complaint based upon offenses more than six months old, is not applicable to a complaint that demonstrates a lack of qualification. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33(b). The NTSB\u2019s rules do not require a party to support its motion for summary judgment with affidavits or sworn statements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 821.17(d). Finally, assuming, as Sunworld claims, that FAA personnel facilitated the repossession of its plane, Sunworld gives us no reason to believe that bars the FAA from revoking its certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">It is therefore ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the petition for review be DENIED. The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
