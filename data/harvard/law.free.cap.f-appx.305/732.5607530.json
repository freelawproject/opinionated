Chew denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Cai Fang Zheng, </em>No. A96 336 585 (B.I.A. Apr. 18, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 336 585 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 13, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">In evaluating an adverse credibility determination, we consider \u201cwhether the determination was supported by substantial evidence and based on specific, cogent reasons bearing a legitimate nexus to the determination.\u201d <em>Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 626 (2d Cir.2007). The agency may properly base an adverse credibility determination on a discrepancy in the petitioner\u2019s evidence if the discrepancy in question goes \u201cto the heart\u201d of the applicant\u2019s claim for relief, <em>see Xu Duan Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 182 (2d Cir.2004)), that is, if a \u201clegitimate nexus\u201d exists between the applicant\u2019s claim of persecution and the discrepancy identified by the IJ, <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Here, the discrepancies relied upon by the IJ were not minor or ancillary clerical errors. They had a \u201clegitimate nexus\u201d to Zheng\u2019s claim for relief. <em>See id. </em>Zheng alleged that she suffered past persecution in the form of a forced abortion, and she testified that she was subjected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>forced abortion because her attempt to go into hiding before family-planning officials could apprehend her was frustrated by a bicycle accident that resulted in her husband\u2019s hospitalization and partial paralysis. Thus, the timing of the forced abortion and the bicycle accident were of central importance to Zheng\u2019s claim that she had suffered past persecution. <em>See Xu Duan Dong, </em>406 F.3d at 112. The different dates on the documents that Zheng submitted in support of her application undermined her testimony that the family-planning officials were waiting at her home to take her for an abortion when she returned there after her husband\u2019s hospital admission and thus cast into doubt her claims regarding the timeline of her alleged persecution. Accordingly, the discrepancies between Zheng\u2019s testimony and her supporting documentation with respect to the dates of her abortion and her husband\u2019s hospitalization went to the heart of her claim, and the IJ did not err in using them as the basis of his adverse credibility determination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Zheng attempted to explain the discrepancies by testifying that her family had obtained the records for her and that, \u201c[b]ecause [she] thought everything was true,\u201d she did not \u201cpay that much attention\u201d to the contents of the documents. However, the IJ acted reasonably in declining to accept this explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005). The IJ therefore did not err in denying Zheng\u2019s asylum claim based on an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">To the extent that Zheng\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief were based upon the same factual predicate as her asylum claim, those claims were necessarily doomed by the adverse credibility determination in this case. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155 (2d Cir.2006). Zheng has abandoned her CAT claim to the extent that it was based on her illegal departure from China. <em>Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, we DISMISS the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-11\"><em> </em>The REAL ID Act of 2005 abrogated this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Secaida-Rosales </em>that a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). However, the credibility provisions of the REAL ID Act apply only to asylum applications filed after May 11, 2005. Zheng filed her application prior to that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
