Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen and review de novo ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">We agree with the BIA that Gomez-Villasenor\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because she did not establish that the outcome of her removal proceedings may have been adversely affected by her former counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 902 (9th Cir.2003), or by her notary\u2019s advice to file an asylum application, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Gomez-Villasenor\u2019s motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence Gomez-Villasenor submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review Gomez-Villasenor\u2019s contention that the birth of her third child warrants reopening. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (the court lacks jurisdiction over claims not presented in the administrative proceedings below).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b393-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
