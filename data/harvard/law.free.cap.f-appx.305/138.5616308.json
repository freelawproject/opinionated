We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-23\">On appeal, Stephenson argues that the sentence imposed is plainly unreasonable because it does not further the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, and that the district court erred by failing to explain adequately its imposition of a sentence outside the Guidelines range. Stephenson does not contest the district court\u2019s decision to revoke his supervised release or its Guidelines calculations. The Government responds that the district court\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-24\">Because Stephenson did not object to the sentence or the district court\u2019s failure to articulate the reasoning, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), we held that \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d We recognized that analysis of a sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release involves both procedural and substantive components. <em>Id. </em>at 438. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>district court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements and the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (2006), \u201cthe court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although a sentencing court must provide a sufficient explanation of the sentence to allow \u201ceffective review of [its] reasonableness\u201d on appeal, <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007) (probation revocation), the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3353(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Our review of the record in this case leads us to conclude that the district court\u2019s reasons supporting its sentencing decision are sufficiently apparent from the record. We conclude that the sentence is neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 297 (4th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), in reviewing a sentence to determine if it is plainly unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">We therefore affirm Stephenson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
