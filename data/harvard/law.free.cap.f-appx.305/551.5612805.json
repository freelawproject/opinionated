On appeal, Olivera argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was clearly erroneous, and further asserts that he established past persecution, and a well-founded fear of future persecution so as to qualify him for asylum relief, and that he was eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-22\">Where, as here, the BIA issues its own decision, our review is limited only to that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). An IJ\u2019s credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, which provides that an IJ\u2019s decision will not be reversed, unless the evidence compels a reasonable factfinder to find otherwise. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted). We must affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Bigler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 728, 732 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and quotation omitted). \u201cThe trier of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>must determine credibility, and [we] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d D-Muhumed <em>v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The fact that an applicant provides \u201ctenable\u201d explanations concerning the \u201cimplausible aspects of his claim\u201d does not compel a finding that the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, particularly where the applicant does not provide corroborating evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233. When an asylum applicant produces no evidence other than his testimony, an adverse credibility determination is alone sufficient to support the denial of an application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). On the other hand, if the applicant produces other evidence of his persecution, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ [or BIA] to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, because Olivera failed to provide corroborating evidence in support of his claim, the adverse credibility determination is sufficient to support the denial of is petition. Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
