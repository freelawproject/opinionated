Jimenez-Zuniga first argues that this court should limit its review to the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA implicitly adopted the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning. This court reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Beltran-Resendez v. I.N.S., </em>207 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2000). Because the BIA in this case provided its own reasoning as to why it agreed with the IJ\u2019s final result, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">The BIA held that Jimenez-Zuniga\u2019s Florida state conviction for aggravated child abuse constituted a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT), thereby rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), this court has jurisdiction to consider Jimenez-Zuniga\u2019s challenge to the legal question of whether his conviction constituted a CIMT. However, in keeping with his assertion that this court should review only the IJ\u2019s decision, JimenezZuniga\u2019s main argument focuses solely upon the alleged inadequacy of the IJ\u2019s decision. To the extent that Jimenez-Zuniga has failed to challenge the BIA\u2019s decision, he has abandoned the merits of his petition. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, 324 </em>F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">Nevertheless, to the extent that Jimenez-Zuniga\u2019s argument may be construed as challenging the BIA\u2019s decision because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion, Jimenez-Zuniga has failed to show that he warrants relief. When reviewing whether an alien has committed a CIMT, this court utilizes a two-part test and categorical approach, as set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Amouzadeh v. Winfrey, </em>467 F.3d 451, 455 (5th Cir.2006). Our review of the relevant Florida statutes indicates that the BIA\u2019s determination that Jimenez-Zuniga\u2019s conviction for aggravated child abuse constituted a CIMT was reasonable. <em>Hamdan v. I.N.S., </em>98 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Jimenez-Zuniga\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
