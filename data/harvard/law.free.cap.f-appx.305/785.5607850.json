Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, the district court ordered Gorglione hospitalized for mental health treatment \u201cuntil he is no longer in need of such custody for care or treatment or until the expiration of the sentence of imprisonment of five (5) years, whichever occurs earlier.\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that Gorglione\u2019s due process claim fails because it relies on his contention that the district court found that he violated the supervised release condition of \u201ccommission of another federal, state, or local crime,\u201d rather than \u201cfailure to participate in mental health treatment.\u201d However, adopting this viewpoint would require us to ignore the district court\u2019s judgment, which notes the sole reason for revocation as \u201cfailure to participate in mental health treatment,\u201d and its statements during court proceedings, in the face of Gorglione\u2019s objections to a finding of a violation based on commission of a crime, that it had an alternative basis on which to revoke Gorglione\u2019s supervised release. Although the district court did not hold a formal hearing regarding Gorglione\u2019s failure to participate in mental health treatment, Gorglione never raised an objection to the absence of a hearing and the record is clear that he failed to take his medication. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no plain error. <em>See United States v. Joseph, </em>542 F.3d 13, 25 (2d Cir.2008). Further, to the extent that the district court placed undue emphasis on the alleged crime, any error in failing to explicitly engage in the interest-of-justice determination of Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is harmless. <em>See United States v. Aspinall, </em>389 F.3d 332, 346 (2d Cir.2004), <em>abrogated on other grounds </em>as <em>recognized in United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 99 n. 5 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">We have considered all of Gorglione\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
