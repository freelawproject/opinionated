We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-24\">We lack jurisdiction over Zaragoza Hernandez\u2019s petition for review because it was filed more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s reissued decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Zaragoza Hernandez has not established that he was misled about the need for a timely petition for review of the reissued decision or that the BIA improperly mailed its reissued decision to him. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188-89 (9th Cir.2003) (court lacked jurisdiction over late petition where BIA mailed decision to petitioner\u2019s address of record and counsel had not filed a notice of appearance with the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b418-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
