The local by-laws of Branch 283 provide for elected shop stewards. For many years, Kessinger was elected, and by virtue of obtaining the most votes, served as chief shop steward. One of Kessinger\u2019s responsibilities as chief shop steward was processing member\u2019s grievances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">In 2002, Kessinger ran for branch president, but was beaten by Patsy Grace. As branch president, Grace stripped Kessinger of the title of chief shop steward and appointed a different shop steward to handle grievance processing. Grace justified her action by pointing out the 300-griev-ance backlog that Kessinger had amassed, many of which were not meritorious. After his demotion, Kessinger remained in his elected shop steward position, maintaining his other shop steward responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Kessinger brought suit against Branch 283 and the National Association of Letter Carriers alleging that they violated his free speech and due process rights under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosures Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Kessinger alleges that Grace retaliated against his free-speech exercise of running for president by stripping him of his grievance processing responsibilities and that the deprivation was without the due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>required under the LMRDA. After Kessinger presented his case to a jury, Defendants made a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the district court granted. Kessinger now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Kessinger contends essentially two points of error. First that he put forward sufficient evidence to present a question to the jury on whether Grace retaliated against him for exercising his free speech rights protected by the LMRDA; and second, that he put forth sufficient evidence to present a question to the jury on whether his due process rights were violated when he was \u201cotherwise disciplined\u201d -without written notice, time to prepare a defense, and a hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review the grant of a Rule 50 motion <em>de novo </em>and only affirm the grant if \u201ca party has been fully heard on [the] issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We AFFIRM because Kessinger\u2019s claims are legally deficient. In <em>Finnegan v. Leu,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that discharge of a union\u2019s appointed business agent by the union president does not violate the LMRDA. In interpreting the statute, the Court drew a distinction between union <em>members </em>and a union\u2019s appointed <em>employees, </em>wherein only the former are protected from arbitrary action by the union or its officers, who thereby retain the ability to \u201cchoose a staff whose views are compatible with [their] own.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This case is indistinguishable from <em>Finnegan. </em>As in <em>Finnegan, </em>Branch 283\u2019s bylaws give Grace, as branch president, the responsibility for and authority to delegate the chief steward title and grievance process responsibilities. Accordingly, Kessinger\u2019s LMRDA claim hinges on the loss of an <em>appointed </em>position; because <em>Finnegan </em>teaches that the LMRDA is \u201cnot concerned -with perpetuating appointed union employees in office at the expense of an elected president\u2019s freedom to choose his own staff,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> his claims fail, both in regards to their merits and the process due.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
