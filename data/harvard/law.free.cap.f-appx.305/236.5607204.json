Johnson has appealed his sentence, contending that the district court clearly erred in calculating the drag quantity applicable for sentencing and in imposing a two-level enhancement for an aggravating role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The appellant argues that the district court \u201cdouble counted\u201d in calculating the drug quantity for sentencing purposes and that the court should not have used the presentence report\u2019s estimated weight of .2 grams per rock of crack cocaine. The district court may adopt the factual findings in the presentenee report if those findings bear sufficient indicia of reliability to support their probable accuracy. <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.2006). It may extrapolate the drug quantity attributable to the defendant from relevant and sufficiently reliable evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 267. Johnson presented no evidence rebutting the probation officer\u2019s findings. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 832 (5th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding was not clearly erroneous because it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutieirez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">In challenging the imposition of the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for an aggravating role, Johnson argues that the evidence reflects that he was a mere supplier of drugs and that the evidence does not suggest that he supervised, managed, or organized the sale of drags. A defendant qualifies for an adjustment under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) if he was the \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of at least one other participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 390 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual finding that the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for clear error. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The record reflects that Arthur Jones sold crack cocaine for Johnson, Johnson provided the location for the drug sales, and Johnson received all of the proceeds from Jones\u2019s drug sales. The district court\u2019s finding that Johnson occupied an aggravating role is plausible in light of the record as a whole and is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 330 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Johnson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
