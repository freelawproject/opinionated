He contends that the district court erred in dismissing seven claims regarding his continued confinement in a \u201cSecurity Housing Unit\u201d and in concluding that his Eighth Amendment claim was barred by the statute of limitations. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\">We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Weilburg v. Shapiro, </em>488 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>1202, 1205 (9th Cir.2007). For the reasons stated by the district court in its order of March 9, 2006, we affirm the dismissal of Manriquez\u2019s first through seventh claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We review de novo the dismissal of a claim on statute-of-limitations grounds. <em>Cabrera v. City of Huntington Park, </em>159 F.3d 374, 378 (9th Cir.1998). As the district court concluded, Manriquez\u2019s complaint, deemed filed on November 6, 2005, was untimely under the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 335.1. He knew or had reason to know of the injuries that were the basis of his Eighth Amendment claim by the end of January 2003. <em>See TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that \u00a7 1983 claim accrues when plaintiff knows or has reason to know of injury). He completed the inmate appeal process, and thus finished exhausting administrative remedies, in May 2003. <em>See Brown v. Valoff, </em>422 F.3d 926, 943 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that statute of limitations is tolled while prisoner completes mandatory exhaustion process). Manriquez is not entitled to additional, equitable tolling until the time his claim under the California Tort Claims Act was denied in December 2003 because this claim was not part of the prison administrative process. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b497-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
