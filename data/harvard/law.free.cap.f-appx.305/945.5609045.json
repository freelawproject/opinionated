Stoyanov appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2000), the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1214, 1221 and 2302 (2006), and various state law tort claims, as well as its order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. <em>See Stoyanov v. Winter, </em>No. l:06-cv-01244-AMD (D.Md. Aug. 11, 2008; Aug. 27, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
