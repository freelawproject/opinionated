The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Hand received ineffective assistance of counsel. Hand contends that he received ineffective assistance in three ways: (1) counsel failed to properly investigate an insanity defense in his murder trial; (2) counsel\u2019s fee agreement created a conflict of interest by requiring counsel to pay all costs and witness expenses; and (3) counsel erroneously argued that Hand and the murder victim were seen together shortly before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, but we review the underlying state court\u2019s determination under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d standard established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. <em>See Marquard v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>429 F.3d 1278, 1303 (11th Cir.2005). Under the AEDPA, federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief on claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits by a state court where the state court\u2019s decision: (1) was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); or (2) was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State Court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2254(d)(2). \u201cA federal habeas court may issue the writ under the \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in our cases, or if it decides a case differently than we have done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). \u201cUnder the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [Supreme Court] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The state court\u2019s application of the principle must be more than incorrect, it must be \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>535 U.S. at 694, 122 S.Ct. at 1850 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are governed by <em>Strickland v. Washing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>ton, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under <em>Strickland, </em>counsel\u2019s performance must be deficient and that deficiency must have prejudiced his defense. <em>See id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Hand first contends that his counsel, Daniel Ciener, was ineffective in failing to properly investigate an insanity defense. He argues that the state court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>Therefore, for Hand to succeed, he must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was objectively unreasonable. <em>See Bell, </em>535 U.S. at 694, 122 S.Ct. at 1850 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Under <em>Strickland, </em>counsel owes a duty \u201cto make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes said investigation unnecessary.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Hall, </em>542 F.3d 1253, 1273 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066). \u201c[A] particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Here the state court concluded that Ciener\u2019s decision not to pursue an insanity defense was a strategic one. Specifically, the state court detailed six reasons that Ciener provided for why he had decided against pursuing an insanity defense. These included Ciener\u2019s belief that insanity \u201cis a bad defense and is used as a last resort\u201d and his belief that an insanity defense would have been unsuccessful in Hand\u2019s case because the facts showed that the murder was intentional. Further, Ciener testified that he would have had to waive his speedy trial motion to pursue an insanity defense. Ciener, who was also Hand\u2019s counsel in a related attempted murder case, had successfully opposed the state\u2019s efforts to consolidate the murder and attempted murder trials. He sought a speedy trial on the murder charge because if Hand were convicted of attempted murder first, that conviction could be introduced as an aggravating factor during the sentencing phase of the murder case to support imposing the death penalty. Delaying the trial of the murder case was not a good idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">This case is not like <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), where \u201ccounsel chose to abandon their investigation at an unreasonable juncture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 123 S.Ct. at 2538. Nor was Ciener\u2019s decision not to pursue an insanity defense in the murder trial \u201cthe result of inattention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 123 S.Ct. at 2542. He was aware of the potential for an insanity defense based on Hand\u2019s cocaine use and his history of brain damage, but Ciener decided to rely on a strategy of reasonable doubt about factual guilt, which he felt was the best theory. Unlike in <em>Wiggins, </em>here additional investigation would not have revealed significant information about Hand\u2019s mental history or troubled background. <em>See id. </em>at 531-33, 123 S.Ct. at 2540-41. Ciener knew the relevant facts but declined to seek out expert testimony to support a theory that he believed would be rejected. Moreover, pursuing that theory would have come at the cost waiving his motion for a speedy trial, which increased the risk of the death penalty if Hand were convicted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>murder charge. <em>Strickland </em>states that \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Hand also contends that the he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on Ciener\u2019s fee arrangement, which provided representation for a fixed fee, with all costs and expenses to be paid by counsel. The state court found that the fee arraignment created a conflict but also concluded that Hand was not prejudiced. Hand argues that the state court\u2019s conclusion is contrary to the clearly established federal law of the <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) decision. Although it is true that <em>Sullivan </em>held that prejudice is presumed for actual conflicts of interests, that case involved a conflict of interest based on the representation of multiple defendants. <em>See id. </em>at 337, 100 S.Ct. at 1712. Since <em>Sullivan, </em>the Supreme Court has clarified that whether <em>Sullivan </em>applies outside of the scope of multiple concurrent representation is an open question. <em>See Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 175-76, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1245-46, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002). In light of <em>Mickens, </em>we have held that \u201ca decision that <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>limited presumption of prejudice does not apply [outside the context of multiple concurrent representation] is not \u2018contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u2019 Nor is a failure to extend the <em>Sullivan </em>rule to [a] new context unreasonable either.\u201d <em>Schwab v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 1308, 1327 (11th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). Because the alleged conflict in this case does not involve the representation of multiple defendants, the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the <em>Sullivan </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Finally, Hand contends that he is entitled to federal habeas relief based on an allegedly inaccurate statement Ciener made during closing argument. Ciener referred to a still image taken from a tape made by a convenience store\u2019s surveillance camera. That image showed Hand and Traffer together on the day before Traffer\u2019s murder and Traffer paying for items with his credit card. According to the State, it introduced the image as evidence that Hand\u2019s motive for killing Traffer was to steal his credit card. Ciener argued in closing that the fact that Hand and Traffer were together on the day before the murder demonstrated that the two were friends and Hand would not have murdered his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In his post-conviction proceedings, Hand contended for the first time that the person in the still image is not him. He does not, however, assert that during the course of the trial he ever told Ciener that he was not picture in the image. Nor did he assert that Ciener refused to make that argument during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">In the state collateral proceedings, the court determined that Hand could not demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>It noted that the evidence of Hand\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. That evidence included Hand: telling his drug dealer that he was going out on the night of the murder to get more money to buy more cocaine; riding his bicycle to Traffer\u2019s house; calling a cab to pick him up outside of Traffer\u2019s house thirty minutes later; telling his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Mends that he had just killed someone; and using Traffer\u2019s credit cards to buy jewelry and electronics, which he sold in order to buy more cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Furthermore, the state court noted that the trial judge had instructed the jury that the attorneys\u2019 statements during closing argument were not evidence. The evidence was the still image itself, and it was for the jury to determine whether Hand was in the picture. We have held that a proper jury instruction can cure an inaccurate statement by an attorney during closing argument. <em>See Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156 (11th Cir.2001). In light of those circumstances, we conclude that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>to this issue was not unreasonable, and we defer to the state court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\">. Although the state trial court cited to <em>Occhicone v. State, </em>768 So.2d 1037 (Fla.2000) for the ineffective assistance standard, that case applies the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington. See id. </em>at 1044-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
