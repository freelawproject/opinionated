He also argues that he was deprived of due process based on the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance after his labor certification was approved and his visa petition was denied but was still pending final consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">\u201cThe grant of a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the IJ, who may grant a continuance for good cause shown.\u201d <em>Masih v. Mukasey, </em>586 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. Although the decision is discretionary, we have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion for a continuance. <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006). We review a decision to grant or deny a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>Masih, </em>536 F.3d at 373. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 680 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">Sun\u2019s labor certification was approved, but his visa petition was denied. At the time of his last hearing when he sought his tenth continuance, Sun was not eligible for the diseretionaiy relief of adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 438 &amp; n. 3 (visa petition must be approved to be eligible for relief under \u00a7 1255(i)); <em>see also Masih, </em>536 F.3d at 374 (To be eligible for adjustment of status, alien needs labor certification and visa petition approved and a visa must be immediately available.). The IJ granted nine continuances and allowed Sun nearly three years to pursue his adjustment of status until Sun\u2019s visa petition was ultimately denied. When Sun\u2019s visa petition was denied, the IJ concluded that proceedings needed to go forward and that good cause was no longer present to justify yet another continuance. The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying a continuance because Sun lacked good cause, given his ineligibility for removal relief. <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Sun also contends that he was \u201cdeprived of due process when the Immigration Judge declined a short continuance.\u201d Sun did not make this due process argument before the BIA in his Notice of Appeal, asserting only that the immigration judge abused his discretion. Sun has not exhausted his administrative remedies regarding this due process argument, and we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue on appeal. See <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
