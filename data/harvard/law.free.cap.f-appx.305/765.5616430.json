Nov. 21, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">The BIA properly denied Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where it was filed more than ninety days after the final order of removal was issued in his case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Zheng does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that his motion was untimely, waiving any such challenge. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Zheng failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Neither in his motion nor in his brief before this Court does Zheng show that (1) his alleged detention was directly related to his own opposition to China\u2019s family planning policy; and (2) even if it was, that the alleged detention rose to the level of persecution. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-310 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">. Judge Sotomayor continues to believe that the majority opinion in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>was in error to the extent that it applied beyond unmarried partners, <em>see Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 327 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), but notes that the Attorney General has since adopted the Court\u2019s construction of the statute and overruled the BIA's former <em>per se </em>rule of spousal eligibility, <em>see In re: J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
