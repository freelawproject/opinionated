Amlee\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are <em>no </em>meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in sentencing Amlee. Amlee has filed a supplemental pro se brief addressing these issues and asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AV1\">Because Amlee did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any challenge to the propriety of the Fed. R. CrimJP. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Before accepting a plea, the district court must ensure that the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him, the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences, and various other rights, so it is clear the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily entering his plea. The court also must determine whether there is a factual basis for the plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1991). Our review of the plea hearing transcript reveals that the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 eolioquy, ensuring that Amlee\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary and that there was an independent factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"AAn\">This court reviews the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). When sentencing a defendant, a district court must: (1) properly calculate the guideline range; (2) treat the guidelines as advisory; (3) consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008); and (4) explain its reasons for selecting a sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. We presume that a sentence within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of correctness of within-guideline sentence). Here, the district court followed the appropriate procedures in sentencing Amlee, and we find no abuse of discretion imposition of the 46-month sentence, We therefore find that Amlee s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">Amlee contends that the district court erred by failing to downwardly depart from the guideline range pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.13 (2007), based on his diminished capacity, This ruling is not reviewable unless the district court was under the mistaken impression that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 371 (4th Cir.2008) (no authority to review denial of downward departure, even after <em>Booker); see also United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases declining to review a district court\u2019s decision not to depart, even after <em>Booker). </em>Here, the district court clearly understood its authority to depart; therefore, this claim is not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">Amlee also asserts a challenge to the effectiveness of his trial attorney. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). We find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Amlee\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Amlee, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Am-lee requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Amlee. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
