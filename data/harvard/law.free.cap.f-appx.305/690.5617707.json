Feb. 28, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). Questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact are reviewed <em>de novo. Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">As a preliminary matter, Jiang has waived his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief by failing to raise them in his brief, and we therefore decline to consider them. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">With respect to Jiang\u2019s asylum claim, the BIA properly concluded that, insofar as it was based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion, it failed under our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10, 313 (2d Cir.2007). Jiang does not dispute that finding. Instead, he argues that the agency should have granted him asylum because he is the spouse of an applicant who obtained that relief and because his proceedings were consolidated with those of his wife. He asks this Court to remand his proceedings to the agency for consideration of his eligibility for derivative asylee status based on his wife\u2019s application. Because we lack jurisdiction to do so, we dismiss the petition for review to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">A petition for review is not the appropriate vehicle for an application for derivative asylee status. An alien whose spouse is granted asylum may, if not otherwise ineligible for relief, be granted the same status as his spouse as a derivative applicant. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a); <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 312 (stating that, although an alien is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based on persecution suffered by his spouse, an alien whose spouse has been granted asylum on the basis of having undergone a forced abortion is automatically eligible for derivative asylum). When an asylee\u2019s spouse is present in the United States, but was not included in the asylee\u2019s application, the asylee must submit a separate application, Form 1-730, requesting that his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>spouse be granted derivative status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(c). The Form 1-730 must be submitted within two years of the date on which the asylee was granted asylum. <em>See id. </em>Thus, if Jiang is to receive derivative status, his wife must file an I-730 form with the agency upon the entry of an order granting her own asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\">. In its decision, the BIA rejected the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, reversed the denial of relief to Jiang\u2019s wife, and affirmed the denial of Jiang\u2019s application for asylum on alternate grounds. <em>In re Kai Jiang, </em>No. A79 190 076 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 17, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
