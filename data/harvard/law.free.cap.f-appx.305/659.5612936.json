Because the Board properly dismissed Ms. Davis\u2019s claim, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-31\">\n<em>1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-32\">The present case is on appeal from this court\u2019s remand in <em>Davis v. Department of Homeland Security, </em>2007 WL 1551204 (Fed.Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cDavis I\u201d). </em>The facts surrounding Ms. Davis\u2019s adverse action claim are set forth in great detail in that opinion. Accordingly, this opinion will only discuss those facts necessary to understand the limited issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-33\">In <em>Davis I, </em>this court upheld the Board\u2019s decision to deny the admission of the EEOC hearing transcript into evidence after the record was closed on May 23, 2005. However, faced with a potential inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tency with another agency opinion, this court concluded that the Board should have considered the EEOC final decision in rendering its opinion. On that point only, this court remanded to the Board for further consideration. This court cautioned that \u201cremand does not necessarily require that the Board reach a different result; for example, the Board could find that the sexual harassment was too far removed in time from Ms. Davis\u2019s resignation to have rendered that resignation involuntary, or that her resignation was voluntary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">On remand, after reviewing the EEOC final opinion for any inconsistency and considering the parties\u2019 submissions on the issue, the Board again found that Ms. Davis\u2019s resignation was voluntary. The Board found that the alleged sexual harassment of Ms. Davis occurred more than a year prior to her resignation and did not establish that, under the circumstances, a reasonable employee would have been compelled to resign. The Board also concluded that the involuntariness of the petitioner\u2019s resignation was not identically before the EEOC or necessary to resolve the sexual harassment claim. Thus, the EEOC\u2019s finding that Ms. Davis involuntarily resigned was dicta and not binding on the Board. The Board reinstated its prior decision and dismissed Ms. Davis\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Ms. Davis timely appealed to this Court. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">This court possesses limited authority to review a Board decision. The Board\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless it is: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>see Briggs v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>331 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2003). Whether the Board has jurisdiction to hear an appeal presents a matter of law, which this court reviews without deference. <em>Middleton v. Dept. of Defense, </em>185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those areas delineated by statute, rule, or regulation. <em>Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed.Cir.1985). This court has recognized that the Board is without jurisdiction over voluntary resignations. <em>Cruz v. Dept. of Navy, </em>934 F.2d 1240, 1248 (Fed.Cir.1991). Because employee resignations and retirements are presumed to be voluntary, this presumption may only be rebutted by a showing of sufficient evidence to establish that the retirement or resignation was involuntary. <em>Middleton v. Dept. of Defense, </em>185 F.3d at 1379. Thus, the former employee bears the heavy burden of pleading and proving that her resignation was involuntary, and thus, within the jurisdiction of the Board. <em>Id. </em>This can be shown with evidence that the resignation was the product of: (1) misinformation or deception by the agency, or (2) coercion by the agency. <em>Staats v. United States Postal Service, </em>99 F.3d 1120, 1123-1124 (Fed.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Coercion may occur when \u201cworking conditions [are] so intolerable for the employee that he or she is driven to involuntarily resign or retire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1123. A three-part test is used for determining whether coercion or duress renders an apparently voluntary resignation or retirement involuntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">(1) that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>result of coercive acts of the opposite party....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"><em>Middleton v. Dept. of Defense, </em>185 F.3d at 1379. The most probative evidence of involuntariness \u201cwill usually be evidence in which there is a relatively short period of time between the employer\u2019s alleged coercive acts and the employee\u2019s retirement.\u201d <em>Terban v. Dept. of Energy, </em>216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">On appeal, Ms. Davis argues that the Board erred in failing to consider evidence that her x-esignation was involuntary. However, these ax\u2019guments have already been considered and fall outside the limited scope of this court\u2019s remand. The remand instx\u2019uction was narrow: consider the EEOC final decision and resolve any inconsistencies with the other agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The Board did exactly that and reached the same result. The Board reconsidered the recox\u2019d in view of the EEOC final opinion \u2014 and again concluded that Ms. Davis\u2019s resignation was voluntary. Because nothing in the EEOC final opinion overcame the presumption that her resignation was voluntaxy, the Board\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Ms. Davis further argues that the Board is bound by the EEOC final opinion\u2019s language x-egarding the issue of involuntary resignation. Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when (1) the issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the px\u2019ior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessax\u2019y to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action. <em>Mayer/Berkshire Corp. v. Berkshire Fashions, Inc., </em>424 F.3d 1229, 1232 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">As the Board reasoned in its decision, the issues before the EEOC and the MSPB were not identical. The issue of involuntary resignation was not litigated before the EEOC and it was not necessary to x\u2019esolve the sexual harassment claim. Even the EEOC final opinion acknowledged that the issue of involuntary resignation was not befox\u2019e it. Thus the Board correctly concluded that it was not bound by the EEOC final opinion\u2019s dicta regarding the involuntariness of Ms. Davis\u2019s resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">For these reasons, this court affix-ms the Board\u2019s dismissal for lack of juidsdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
