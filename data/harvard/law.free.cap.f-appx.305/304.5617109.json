United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). Counts was sentenced to a statutory minimum term of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment for unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon. The sentence was based on the district court\u2019s determination that Counts qualified as an armed career criminal within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because he had sustained three prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2). One of those convictions involved the offense of tampering with a vehicle by operation in Missouri. <em>See </em>Mo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 569.080. In a prior opinion, we affirmed the judgment of the district court, including its determination that Counts\u2019s prior conviction for tampering by operation was a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See United States v. Counts, </em>498 F.3d 802 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2049, 170 L.Ed.2d 790 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-29\">After this case was remanded, another panel of this court, relying on <em>Begay, </em>overruled circuit precedent and held that auto tampering by operation in Missouri is not a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>537 F.3d 969, 974-75 (8th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>546 F.3d 961 (8th Cir.2008). The <em>Williams </em>opinion stated that the inquiry applicable to \u00a7 4B1.2 also governs whether an offense is a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e), and thus effectively abrogated circuit precedent holding that tampering by operation is a violent felony. <em>See United States v. Bockes, </em>447 F.3d 1090, 1092-93 (8th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>2006). In light of <em>Williams, </em>Counts\u2019s prior offense of tampering by operation is not a violent felony, and Counts does not qualify as an armed career criminal based on his prior conviction for this offense. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
