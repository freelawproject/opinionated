Dawson relies on four constitutional bases for suppression: (1) that, during his initial encounter with police officers, he was unconstitutionally seized; (2) that there was no probable cause for his subsequent warrantless arrest by those officers; (3) that the officers conducted an unconstitutional warrantless search of his residence and only then decided, based on evidence found, to seek a search warrant; and (4) that the search warrant ultimately secured by the officers was not supported by probable cause and could not be relied on by the officers in good faith. As explained below, we reject Dawson\u2019s contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">On March 9, 2006, the grand jury in the District of Maryland indicted Dawson for possession with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in contravention of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (the \u201cdrug offense\u201d), and for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (the \u201cfirearm offense\u201d). On October 26, 2006, Dawson filed his motion to suppress evidence, which he thereafter supplemented three times. The district court heard evidence on the suppression motion over the course of three days in January 2007, and it denied the motion by oral ruling of February 1, 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-18\">During the evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion, John Jendrek, a detective in the Baltimore City Police Department detailed to the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) Task Force, testified that, in January 2005, the DEA Task Force was in the midst of an ongoing investigation of several Baltimore stores, including the Ayrdale Variety Store, suspected of selling drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, Jendrek knew that the owner of the Ayrdale Variety Store had previously been convicted of a drug distribution of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fense, and Jendrek had information\u2014from confidential informants and from numerous arrestees in other drug cases\u2014about drug paraphernalia (particularly glass vials) being sold at the store. Jendrek explained that the illegal purpose for the glass vials is to package powder and crack cocaine for street distribution, but acknowledged that there are legal purposes for the vials, and that the vials\u2019 packaging reflects that they are for storing perfume. Jendrek had never been in the Ayrdale Variety Store, but he could see through the door that it also displayed tee shirts, presumably for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The investigation of the Ayrdale Variety Store included periodic surveillance. Detective Jendrek testified that the officers conducting the surveillance watched for customers who stayed in the store for \u201ca very short period of time\u201d\u2014\u201cnot like they were looking around for different items\u201d\u2014 and then left with a black plastic bag about \u201cthe size of a football\u201d that appeared to have \u201csubstantial weight.\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. 18-20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such bags had been shown to contain approximately 500 glass vials each, typically packaged in small cardboard boxes, fifty to a box. Indeed, by January 18, 2005, the officers had stopped Ayrdale Variety Store customers fitting the targeted description on more than ten occasions, and such customers \u201calways had ... glass vials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">On January 18, 2005, a Tuesday, Detective Peter Sullivan was conducting surveillance on the Ayrdale Variety Store, and Detective Jendrek was in his car about a block away. At approximately 12:30 p.m., Sullivan informed Jendrek by radio that he had observed a man\u2014later identified as defendant Dawson, but unknown to the officers at that time\u2014enter and soon thereafter leave the store with a black plastic bag about the size of a football. It was then decided to follow Dawson (who drove off in a Dodge Intrepid with Maryland tags) in the hope that, as in prior cases with other suspects, he would drive to his \u201cstash house\u201d and police could develop probable cause to enter such premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Dawson was followed by three officers\u2014 Detectives Jendrek, Sullivan, and Keith Gladstone\u2014driving three separate unmarked vehicles. Dawson drove through the Ayrdale Variety Store neighborhood (a residential and small business area in northwestern Baltimore), then headed north on Liberty Heights Avenue/Liberty Road (the main north-south corridor through the area), into Baltimore County and toward Interstate 695 (the Baltimore Beltway). Just south of Interstate 695, Dawson drove into another residential neighborhood and then pulled to the side of the road. Dawson stopped for about five minutes, without leaving his car. Jendrek testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">this is a technique that, with my experience, drug dealers or drug traffickers often pull to the side of the road to see if anybody is following them, or they will see if the same car may drive past them two or three times, to find out whether someone is trying to, you know, see what they are doing, follow their activities or what have you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">J.A. 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">When Dawson resumed driving, he travelled back through the residential neighborhood to Liberty Road, and then headed south on Liberty back to the city. At a red light at Callaway Avenue (near the Ayrdale Variety Store), Dawson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>stopped next to Detective Sullivan, who, according to Detective Jendrek,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak2u\">thought that Mr. Dawson looked at him and kind of shook his head, like acknowledged that [Dawson] knew [Sullivan] was there. Whether [Dawson] knew [Sullivan] or knew he was a police officer, I don\u2019t know, but Detective Sullivan felt that our investigation had been compromised. He thought Mr. Dawson knew that we were following him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">J.A. 32-33. Sullivan similarly testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">Mr. Dawson looked over at me, stared at me for maybe 15, 20 seconds. Then when I looked at him, he kind of smiled and nodded at me, and I took that as if, in my opinion and expertise, I took that as if he believed that he had recognized me and figured that I was following him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">I told Detective Jendrek and Gladstone that I believed that I had been burnt, which is a term that we use for being noticed as part of the surveillance, and told him that I was going to back off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAYy\"><em>Id. </em>at 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Next, Dawson drove across town to the east side of Baltimore, ordered food at a Wendy\u2019s drive-through, and then parked in the Wendy\u2019s parking lot and ate the food. At that point, DEA Special Agent Bernard Malone joined the surveillance team. Dawson thereafter drove to a spot across from the main entrance to Johns Hopkins Hospital, parking on McElderry Street at its intersection with Wolfe Street. By this time, it was between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m., and the officers had been following Dawson for about an hour. According to Detective Jendrek, McElderry is a public street, and there was a lot of vehicle and foot traffic in the area. Jendrek drove past Dawson, who was getting out of his car. The officers then decided to approach Dawson. Jendrek parked his vehicle on McElderry three spaces away from Dawson\u2019s vehicle. Jendrek and Malone\u2014both in plainclothes with firearms concealed (and Jendrek with a visible detective badge on a chain around his neck)\u2014approached Dawson at about the same time. Detectives Sullivan and Gladstone were also in the area, but out of Dawson\u2019s sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Detective Jendrek and Special Agent Malone met Dawson at the corner of McElderry and Wolfe, across the street from the hospital entrance. According to Jendrek,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">I said to Mr. Dawson, I said can I speak to you? Sir, excuse me, can I talk to you for a minute? He said yeah, what\u2019s going on. I explained to him that I was a police officer and that I was conducting a narcotics investigation and that I thought he might be involved in narcotics trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">He said I don\u2019t have anything to do with drugs. I don\u2019t know what his exact words were, but he said he had no involvement with drugs or narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUZQ\">At that time I said, sir, can I have consent to search your person and your vehicle for narcotics, and he said yeah, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">J.A. 38. \u201c[E]ither just prior [to] or just after asking\u201d Dawson for consent to search, Malone asked Dawson \u201cfor his ID or his driver\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40-41. Dawson handed the officers his driver\u2019s license, which the officers held for \u201c[m]aybe 30 seconds\u201d prior to Dawson\u2019s giving of consent to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 41. Jendrek described the initial encounter with Dawson as \u201cvery polite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39 (\u201cMr. Dawson was very, very polite. We were very polite. It was not a hostile situation in any way.\u201d). Neither Jendrek nor Malone raised his voice, physically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>touched Dawson, or blocked or attempted to block Dawson from leaving. The conversation between Dawson and the officers, up to the point when Dawson gave consent to search, lasted approximately one to two minutes. During that time, Jendrek testified, Dawson did not ask to leave or for the return of his driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Detective Gladstone subsequently joined the group at the corner of McElderry and Wolfe Streets. Detective Jendrek informed Gladstone that Dawson had consented to a search of his car, and Gladstone then searched the vehicle. The officers recovered the black plastic bag, five boxes of glass vials (apparently containing fifty vials each), and five packages of vial stoppers/tops.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Thereafter, Detective Jendrek read Dawson his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked him why he had the glass vials. Dawson responded that the vials were for oils, which Jendrek understood to mean perfumes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Jendrek and Special Agent Malone called for a criminal background check on Dawson, using his driver\u2019s license (which bore a Gwynn Oak, Maryland address), and learned that Dawson had been convicted in Maryland of two felonies involving controlled substances. Dawson was then arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Maryland law and placed in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">At some point after the search, around the time of the arrest, Detective Sullivan and Special Agent Paul Neikirk arrived at the scene. Sullivan conducted the search of Dawson\u2019s person, which led to the discovery of a receipt in Dawson\u2019s wallet with a Baltimore address of 3107 Cresson Avenue, Apartment H. Dawson denied living at that address (a townhouse) or having any contact with it. The officers then drove to the Cresson Avenue townhouse with Dawson, arriving between approximately 2:30 and 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">The ensuing events are the subject of some dispute between the officers and witnesses for Dawson, including his wife, Monique Dawson, who was working at Johns Hopkins Hospital at the time of Dawson\u2019s January 2007 arrest, and Monique\u2019s niece, LaToya Cooper, who was residing at that time in the Cresson Avenue townhouse with Dawson, Monique, and them toddler daughter Indigo. It is undisputed, however, that LaToya, then sixteen years old, was alone in the townhouse when the officers arrived there, and that she answered the front door when Detective Jendrek and others knocked on it. Meanwhile, Dawson remained in a vehicle in the driveway with another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">According to Detective Jendrek, the officers at the front door identified themselves to LaToya, told her they were conducting an investigation, and asked her if they could enter the townhouse and question her. LaToya permitted the officers inside the residence and agreed to answer their questions. During the questioning, LaToya confirmed that Dawson resided in the townhouse, said that he had left the townhouse that morning, and gave a description of his car that matched the vehicle fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>lowed that day by the officers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jendrek testified that the officers, who had taken keys from Dawson, then \u201ctried his keys in the door. Once the keys operated the lock, we secured the location to get a search warrant.\u201d J.A. 222. When asked by the prosecutor at the hearing if he made the decision at that point in time to get the search warrant,\u201d Jendrek responded, Yes, sir. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">In describing how a residence is \u201csecured,\u201d Detective Jendrek explained that \u201cbasically you make sure no one else is home, and anyone who is in that residence is brought down to a common area ... and ... detained there [so that she] can\u2019t move around and damage any evidence\u201d before a search warrant is obtained. J.A. 224. In this ease, Jendrek and Detective Gladstone directed LaToya to accompany them through the townhouse for a protective sweep. While looking upstairs for anyone else in the residence, Jendrek testified, he found a firearm in plain view on a shelf in the closet of the master bedroom at the front of the townhouse. The firearm was left in place, and the trio returned downstairs. At various points, Detective Sullivan and Special Agent Malone were also in the residence. Jendrek and Sullivan began preparing a warrant application on their laptop computer in the dining room (between the living room and the kitchen), and LaToya was left in the living room with Malone. A decision was eventually made for LaToya to call her aunt Monique at work from the house phone; first LaToya, then Gladstone, spoke to Monique, Jendrek\u2019s impression of the conversation was that Monique did not want to come home, but that \u201cDetective Gladstone made it clear that this was an important matter and she needed to come home, back to the location.\u201d J.A. 280. According to Jendrek, although there was no legal requirement for Monique to be present in the residence, the officers were concerned about being alone there with LaToya, in light of the fact that she was a juvenile,</p>\n<p id=\"AC9\">Monique arrived home approximately thirty to forty-five minutes after the phone calL By that point) three more officers, including Special Agent Christopher Quaglino, had come to the townhouse. Quaglino, with Special Agent Malone as a witness, spoke to Monique first. Detective Jendrek overheard Quaglino identify himself to Monique, give her <em>Miranda </em>warnmgs, advise her that she was not under arrest, and ask for her consent to search the residence. According to Jendrek, Mo\u00f1ique responded that \u201cshe would [give consent], she didn\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d J.A. 232. Jendrek further testified, however, that he \u201cactually had no intention of using the consent to search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jendrek explained that he \u201cbelieved that Mr. Dawson lived at that location, and he wasn\u2019t going to give consent,\u201d and that Monique was asked for consent simply as a means \u201cto find out if she knew anything about any contraband that might be in the house.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Af\">Thereafter, Detectives Jendrek and Sullivan continued working on the search warrant application on their laptop computer at the dining room table. At some point, Jendrek realized that Monique was on the telephone telling someone that the police were in her house. Jendrek asked her to hang up the phone, but Monique either ignored or did not hear him, so Jendrek pulled the phone from the wall \u201c[a]s a matter of officer safety.\u201d J.A. 234. Around 5:30 p.m., once the warrant application was complete, it was printed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>residence\u2019s printer and paper. Sullivan drove the application to a state court judge for Baltimore County, and Jendrek left the townhouse to attend to a family matter. Special Agent Quaglino, again with Special Agent Malone as a witness, remained at the premises and took a written statement from Monique. The statement reflected that it was signed at 6:23 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Shortly thereafter, at 6:30 p.m., the state court judge approved the search warrant. The warrant application spelled out the expertise of Detective Sullivan, who presented the application to the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The application also included a five-page affidavit detailing the events of earlier that day, including the following: the surveillance conducted on the Ayrdale Variety Store and Dawson; Dawson\u2019s suspicious driving pattern; the initial encounter between Dawson and the officers; the search of Dawson\u2019s vehicle; Dawson\u2019s arrest and the search of his person; the discovery of the receipt bearing the Cresson Avenue address; Dawson\u2019s denial of any connection to the townhouse; the officers\u2019 visit to the townhouse and encounters with LaToya and later Monique, who both confirmed that Dawson resided there; the fact that Dawson\u2019s key fit the townhouse door; and Dawson\u2019s criminal record. According to the affidavit, once the officers confirmed with LaToya that Dawson resided in the townhouse and that his key fit the front door,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[a]t this point your Affiant believed, based on Naim Dawson\u2019s denial of living at 3107 Cresson Avenue and the recovery of the packaging material [i.e., the glass vials], Naim Dawson was utilizing 3107 Cresson Avenue as a stash house to store CDS [controlled dangerous substances] for his CDS enterprise. Your Affiant then secured the location so a search and seizure warrant could be prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">J.A. 350. Furthermore, the affidavit asserted that \u201c[i]t has been the experience of your Affiant that CDS distributors transport this CDS paraphernalia ... from Ayrdale Variety Store to locations (stash houses) where they package large quantities of CDS for street level sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">After the officers obtained the search warrant, a search of the townhouse was conducted. During that search, Special Agent Malone retrieved the firearm from the master bedroom closet and brought it downstairs. Notably, Malone corroborated Detective Jendrek\u2019s testimony that the firearm was within plain sight upon opening the closet door. The record reflects that a residue-covered mirror was also recovered from the master bedroom (though it is not clear whether it was first observed during the initial protective sweep of the premises), and that a quantity of crack cocaine was found in the townhouse during the warranted search.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">By their hearing testimony, LaToya and Monique indicated that the officers had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>engaged in a pre-warrant search of the townhouse that exceeded the permissible scope of a protective sweep. Monique testified that, after arriving at the townhouse and finding LaToya dressed only in boxer shorts and a tee shirt, she had been permitted to take LaToya upstairs, accompanied by an officer, to retrieve more clothes from the back bedroom. While upstairs, Monique looked into the master bedroom and saw \u2014 in contrast to the neat state of the bedroom when she left the townhouse that morning \u2014 that there were \u201cclothes, shoe boxes, shoes strewn all over the floor in front of my husbands closet. There was actually a mirror at the foot of my bed with a gun sitting on top of it.\u201d J.A. 127. LaToya also testified that the officers had disturbed the master bedroom, leaving the closet door open, throwing clothes on the floor, and leaving items on the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">LaToya and Monique also contradicted the officers\u2019 version of events in other ways. For example, LaToya testified that she heard keys jingling in the lock of the front door before the officers knocked on it, and that the officers entered the premises without requesting her permission or explaining why they were there. Monique asserted that the officers falsely informed her, or at least suggested, that they had a warrant to search the townhouse before they had actually obtained one. Monique also testified that she gave consent to search the premises only because she was led to believe the officers already possessed a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-25\">Finally, LaToya and Monique testified that the officers engaged in abusive behavior toward them by, for instance, using vulgar language and threats of arrest during the phone call to Monique at work, According to Monique, when she arrived home, she found LaToya (who suffers from asthma) visibly upset and hyperventilating, as well as underdressed. Monique described later making two calls from the house phone to arrange care for her toddler daughter, Indigo. During the first call, one of the officers typing on the laptop computer in the dining \u2014 room presumably Detective Jendrek or Sullivan \u2014 told Monique to \u201cshut the f* * * up,\u201d because he could not concentrate. J.A. 164. And, during the second call, one of the officers \u201cactually ripped [the phone] from the wall because [Monique] was on the phone erying.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkY\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"AVN\">As set forth above, Dawson\u2019s suppression motion rests on four constitutional grounds. First; Dawson contends the offi_ cers&gt; conduct during their initial encounter ^im amounted to an unconstitutional se\u00a1zure invaiidating his purported consent to search his car. Second, Dawson asserts that, though the officers found glass vials in the vehicle, they did not possess probable cause to arrest him. Third, Dawson maintains that the officers exceeded the scope of a legitimate protective sweep of his residence and only then decided, based on evidence (particularly the firearm) found during the illegal pre-warrant search, to seek a search warrant. And fourth, Dawson asserts that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause and could not be relied on by the officers in good faith, in that the warrant application failed to demonstrate a nexus between his residence and any alleged drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">By its oral ruling of February 1, 2007, the district court rejected each of Dawson\u2019s grounds for suppression, concluding (1) that the officers had not seized Dawson for Fourth Amendment purposes before seeking his consent to search his car; (2) that the officers possessed probable cause, in the totality of the circumstances, to arrest Dawson for possession of drug para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>phernalia in contravention of Maryland law; (3) that, even if the pre-warrant search of the townhouse exceeded the legitimate scope of a protective sweep, the officers did not rely on the firearm or any other evidence found during such search in seeking the search warrant, thus satisfying the independent source doctrine; and (4) that the search warrant was supported by probable cause, and, even if it was not, the good faith exception would apply. In the circumstances, the court declined to unnecessarily resolve disputed issues about whether the protective sweep was proper, whether LaToya or Monique gave valid consent to search the townhouse, and whether LaToya and Monique accurately described their encounter with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Following the court\u2019s ruling, the parties entered a written plea agreement in which Dawson agreed to plead guilty to the firearm offense, while preserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion, and the government agreed to dismiss the drug offense. The district court accepted the plea and, by its judgment of May 23, 2007, deemed Dawson to be guilty of the firearm offense, dismissed the drug offense on the government\u2019s motion, and sentenced Dawson to 210 months of imprisonment. Dawson then timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In an appeal, such as this one, of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we review the court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Blatstein, </em>482 F.3d 725, 730 (4th Cir.2007). We assess each of the four aspects of the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014relating to Dawson\u2019s initial encounter with the officers, his arrest, the pre-warrant search of his residence, and the subsequent warranted search thereof\u2014in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">First, the district court ruled that the officers had not seized Dawson for Fourth Amendment purposes before seeking his consent to search his car, i.e., that the initial encounter between the officers and Dawson was consensual. In so ruling, the court largely relied on our decision in <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302 (4th Cir.2002). There, we recognized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">[generally speaking, a \u201cseizure\u201d warranting protection of the Fourth Amendment occurs when, in view of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the \u201cstop,\u201d a reasonable person would not feel free to leave or otherwise terminate the encounter. Because the test is an objective one, its proper application is a question of law. Circumstances where the citizen would feel free to go, but stays and has a dialogue with the officer, are considered consensual, and therefore do not implicate the Fourth Amendment. While most citizens mil respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so without being told they are free not to respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response. In applying the totality of the circumstances test, courts look to numerous factors including the time, place and purpose of the encounter, the words used by the officer, the officer\u2019s tone of voice and general demeanor, the officer\u2019s statements to others present during the encounter, the threatening presence of several officers, the potential display of a weapon by an officer, and the physical touching by the police of the citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 309-10 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

We refused, however, to deem the retention of identification, such as a driver's license, to be dispositive. Id.; see also United States v. Analla, 975 F.2d 119, 124 (4th Cir.1992) (observing that there was no seizure where Analla voluntarily provided driver's license and car registration to officer, and officer \"necessarily had to keep [the] license and registration for a short time in order to cheek\" them, because \"Analla was free .. to request that his license and registration be returned and to leave the scene\").</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">Engaging in the totality of the circumstances assessment here, the district court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u2022 The encounter occurred in \"the middle of the day,\" at \"a busy public area across from the Johns Hopkins Hospital,\" J.A. 325;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u2022 The officers, Detective Jendrek and Special Agent Malone, \"simply parked\" their separate vehicles without blocking Dawson's car, Id.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u2022 The officers \"walked up to Mr. Dawson and identified themselves,\" without displaying their firearms or using force of any kind, id. at 325-26;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u2022 After Jendrek explained to Dawson that the officers were investigating drug activities and suspected Dawson was involved, and asked Dawson for his identification and consent to search, Dawson provided his driver's license and gave consent to search, see id. at 326;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u2022 The encounter evidently \"took [no] more than a minute or two,\" there were \"no handcuffs, no raised voices, no force,\" and, although Dawson's \"license was taken, it was taken only briefly,\" id.; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u2022 Dawson \"has at least a high school education [and] some familiarity with the criminal justice system,\" id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">In these circumstances, the court concluded, \"this was a consensual encounter between Mr. Dawson and the officers.\" Id.

With res~3ect to the taking of Dawson's driver's license, we emphasize the court's finding that, like the license and registration in Analla, \"it was taken only briefly.\" J.A. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">Next, the district court ruled that the officers possessed probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>arrest Dawson for possession of drug paraphemalia in contravention of Maryland law. On this issue, the court recognized that \u201c[t]he probable cause standard\u201d is \u201can objective standard\u201d that requires \u201cmore than bare suspicion, but less than evidence necessary to convict.\u201d J.A. 330. Indeed, we have observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">[pjrobable cause to justify an arrest arises when \u201cfacts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge ... are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979).

Lott, </em>156 F.3d 563, 569 (4th Cir.1998) (some internal citations omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-32\">In assessing whether there was probable cause to arrest Dawson for a Maryland drug paraphernalia offense, the district court identified the relevant state statute as Maryland Code Annotated, Criminal Law section 5-619, which, under subsection (c), prohibits possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia and deems such conduct to be a misdemeanor. Subsection (a) of the statute lists thirteen factors for a court to consider in determining whether an object constitutes drug paraphernalia. Such factors include \u201cany statement by an owner or a person in control of the object concerning its use,\u201d subsection (a)(1); \u201cany prior conviction of an owner or a person in control of the object under a State or federal law relating to a controlled dangerous substance,\u201d subsection (a)(2); and \u201cexpert testimony concerning use of the object,\u201d subsection (a)(13). Subsection (a) a^so authorizes consideration of other logically relevant factors.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Apt\">The district court made the following relevant findings of fact with respect to Dawson\u2019s arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asc\">\u2022 The officers were conducting surveillance on the Ayrdale Variety Store and knew from experience that bags being carried from there of a certain shape and weight, \u201cloosely described as a football size,\u201d likely contained multiple boxes of glass vials, J.A. 324;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjG\">\u2022 On January 18, 2005, a man later identilled as Dawson was seen \u201centering] the store, leaving] with a bag of this indicated size and shape, and departpng] in a Dodge Intrepid,\u201d which the officers followed in separate cars, <em>id. </em>at 324-25;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7T\">\u2022 Dawson\u2019s route, various stops, and encounter with Detective Sullivan \u201cled the officers reasonably to interpret that [Dawson] had been driving in a manner to detect surveillance and, in fact, had detected surveillance, this be-behavior that the officers in their experience believed is not unusual for people involved in narcotics dealing, ^25;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">\u2022 The subsequent consented-to search of Dawson\u2019s car yielded a bag containing \u201c250 vials and tops,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 326-27;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjZ\">\u2022 Such \u201c[v]ials certainly have been recognized as falling in [the section 5-619] definition of paraphernalia,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 329;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azh\">\u2022 After being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Dawson told the officers that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the vials for oils, but \u201c[w]hen he was asked where the oils were, he responded to the effect of not having any,\u201d <em>id. </em>at327; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALg\">\u2022 The officers then ran a criminal record check of Dawson and discovered \u201cthat he had two prior [state] felony convictions involving controlled dangerous substances, ... which the officers ... reasonably interpreted under state law as meaning sufficiently serious to be possession with intent to distribute offenses, as indeed they were,\u201d <em>id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK4\">More specifically, the district court considered, pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of section 5-619, Dawson\u2019s statement to the officers that his vials were \u201cfor oils, although he didn\u2019t have any [oils] with him.\u201d J.A. 329. The court also considered, as subsection (a)(13) expert testimony, or at least as an \u201cother logically relevant factor[ ],\u201d the officers\u2019 testimony about them experiences with the Ayrdale Variety Store and them reasons for perceiving Dawson\u2019s behavior to be indicative of drug trafficking. <em>See id. </em>at 329-30. And, the court considered, under subsection (a)(2), Dawson\u2019s two prior state felony convictions on drug offenses, which the court deemed to be \u201cvery significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. The court explained that such convictions \u201care specifically mentioned as a factor [in the section 5-619(a) analysis] and also obviously make sense in terms of trying to figure out what the intent might be of a particular individual with these empty vials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After analyzing all of these factors together, the court ruled that \u201cthe officers had probable cause to make the arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201cconsidering the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer had probable cause to believe ... that Mr. Dawson possessed these vials with the intent to use them to store, contain, or conceal [controlled dangerous substances].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVR\">2</p>\n<p id=\"A1h\">We conclude that the district court made no error in its ruling, notwithstanding Dawson\u2019s contentions to the contrary. In asserting that his arrest was not supported by probable cause, Dawson emphasizes the following: the officers merely targeted &amp;im] because of the look of the bag he carried out of the store, with absolutely no way knowing what [he] purchased\u201d; although the officers \u201cclaimed that [he] ^ove in an evasive manner in order to determine whether he was being followed[,] ... nothing about his driving violated the law or suggested that [he] might be committing any type of crime\u201d; he eventually parked near Johns Hopkins Hospital where his wife worked, not \u201cin a high-crime area or ... somewhere [else] to engage in illegal activity\u201d; \u201che was \u2018very polite\u2019 and cooperated completely with the officers,\u201d and \u201cdid not act nervously or suspiciously\u201d; and, after the glass vials were found in his car, he told the officers, without hesitation, that he planned to use the vials to store oils, which \u201cis exactly what the vials are for, as shown [on them] packaging.\u201d Br. of Appellant 24-25. According to Dawson, at the time his arrest, \u201cthe officers knew only that [he] (1) had a criminal history as to drug sales, and (2) had in his possession vials that could be used for drug sales but also had a purely legal purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. These factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>were insufficient, Dawson maintains, to establish probable cause for his arrest, Dawson further contends that his driving was an inappropriate factor in the probable cause determination, because he \u201cwas not evasive,\u201d \u201c[h]e did not speed or otherwise violate any law or traffic ordinance,\u201d and he drove \u201cin a normal, unhurried manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31 n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ALt\">Simply put, Dawsons version of the facts ignores key findings by the district court findings well-grounded in the record and otherwise focuses on irrelevancies. For example, as the district court found, the officers had experience-based reasons to believe that Dawson had purchased glass vials from the Ayrdale Variety Store. Moreover, Dawson s absence from a high-crime area, and his politeness and cooperation with the officers, did not somehow negate his other suspicious behavior. And, the officers were not required to take Dawson at his word that he planned to use the vials for oils, especially in light of his prior state felony drug eonvictions. We therefore agree with the district court that the totality of the circumstances \u2014 including the officers\u2019 experienees investigating the Ayrdale Variety Store, Dawson\u2019s apparent efforts to detect surveillance, his lack of a credible exp\u00edanation for possessing the glass vials, and his criminal record \u2014 gave rise to probable cause for Dawson\u2019s arrest. <em>See United States v. Humphries, </em>372 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir.2004) (recognizing that, in assessing totality of circumstances surrounding warrantless arrest, it is appropriate to consider, inter alia, \u201can officer\u2019s practical experience and the inferences the officer may draw from that experience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"APC\">in so concluding, we explicitly reject Dawson\u2019s contention that it was inappropriate to weigh the manner of his driving toward the probable cause determination. For such contention, Dawson relies on our decision in <em>United States v. Sprinkle, </em>106 F.3d 613 (4th Cir.1997). There, we recognized that \u201c[e]vasive conduct can, of course, assist an officer in forming reason-aWe suspicion\u00bb for an investigative stop. <em>Sprinkle, </em>106 F.3d at 6i8. A <em>Sprinkle </em>defendant drove off right after the offl. cers dy,\u201d but also \u201cright after his passenger [the second defendant] got in car\u00bb and \u201c\u00a1n a n0rmal, unhurried manner\u00bb <em>Id. </em>The district court determined \u201cthat there wasn\u2019t any evasive conduct, They did drive off, but they didn\u2019t try to run away or flee or anything before the initiai stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618 n. 2 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), We then concluded that \u201cdriving away in a normal, unhurried fashion [did not] lend itself to a finding of reasonable suspicion here. [The] passenger had just gotten jnto the car, so a prompt departure could be expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618. Clearly, <em>Sprinkle </em>was concerned with evasive driving as a means to flee police, rendering it inapposite to this matter. Here, officers surmised that Dawson was driving in order to detect surveillance (and not to flee). Thus, it makes sense that Dawson obeyed traffic laws; the point is that he was trying to ascertain if he was being followed by police, without giving the officers any reason to stop him. Accordingly, Dawson\u2019s manner of driving was an entirely permissible factor in the probable cause analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">The district court next ruled that, even if the pre-warrant search of Dawson\u2019s residence (including the discovery of the firearm) exceeded the legitimate scope of a protective sweep, the independent source doctrine was satisfied. In <em>Murray v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that \u201ca later, lawful seizure is genuinely independent of an earlier, tainted one\u201d \u2014 and the independent source doctrine applies \u2014 unless \u201cthe agents\u2019 decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry, or if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.\u201d 487 U.S. 533, 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A79\">Here, according to the district court, \u201c[t]he overall circumstances suggest that there is really no evidence that anything other than the gun and possibly [the] mirror ... had been found before the search warrant was authorized.\u201d J.A. 335. On the issue of whether the officers\u2019 decision to seek the search warrant was prompted by what they had found during the prewarrant search, i.e., the gun or the mirror, the court found \u201cthat most likely the [officers] made their decision to seek the warrant before the results of any illegal search and not because of any illegal search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. Indeed, the court observed that the events occurring upon the officers\u2019 arrival at the townhouse \u2014 including LaToya\u2019s statement that Dawson resided there and left only that morning, and the officers\u2019 use of Dawson\u2019s key to unlock the front door (all in contradiction to Dawson\u2019s denial of any connection to the premises)\u2014 led the officers to \u201cdecide[ ] to secure the Property and get a warrant, believing that there would be narcotics, essentially evidonee of what the vials were going to be connected with, in that residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332-33; <em>see also id. </em>at 338 (finding \u201cthat there was reason to secure the house, given that the officers were investigating and had ... spoken with [LaToya], and that\u2019s what finally led to the determination that they had probable cause and should get a warrant\u201d). The court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac-\">[c]learly, Detective Jendrek and the others believed that there were drugs in the house. They testified to the eombination of circumstances that led them to decide to get the warrant. There is no evidence that they had in fact found the narcotics that they believed to be in the house before they started Preparing the warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">^ at 339-40. Moreover, on the question whether information obtained during the pre-warrant search was presented to the state court judge, the district court found that \u201c[t]here was none. That\u2019s clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. Accordingly, the court ruled \u201cthat the independent source rule was satisfied in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. We agree,</p>\n<p id=\"AQb\">Finally, the district court ruled that the search warrant was supported by probable cause, and, even if it was not, the good faith exception would apply. As we have recognized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM-\">[w]hen issuing a warrant and making a probable cause determination, judges are to use a \u201ctotality of the circumstances analysis.\u201d <em>Illinois v.
