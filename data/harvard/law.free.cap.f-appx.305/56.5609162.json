A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Cole has not made the requisite showing with respect to his \u00a7 2254 claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. With regard to Cole\u2019s challenge to his continuing detention by the Department of Homeland Security, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand so that this claim may be properly considered under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) and in light of relevant precedent of the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005); <em>Demore v. Kim, </em>538 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003); <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal in part, and vacate and remand in part for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\"> Cole initially filed his habeas petition under <em>28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). However, it was construed by the district court as a \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
