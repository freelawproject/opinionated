In December 2000, Sultan and Shaheen left Pakistan and arrived in the United States, with authorization to stay for not more than six months. They remained in the country longer than authorized and were ultimately charged with removal. They conceded removability but applied for withholding of removal, asserting that they were entitled to withholding of removal based on membership in a particular social group and political opinion. The Immigration Judge denied their application for withholding of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed the appeal and this court denied their petition for review. <em>Himani v. Gonzales, </em>246 Fed.Appx. 879, 880 (5th Cir.2007). Thereafter, the petitioners filed a motion to reopen with the BIA, arguing that a change in country circumstances had arisen since their last immigration hearing. The BIA denied the motion to reopen, and the petitioners timely filed a petition for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">The petitioners argue that the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion to reopen was an abuse of discretion. They argue that a faction of the Mohajirs Quami Movement (\u201cMQM\u201d) has formed a coalition with the Pakistani government and that there is countrywide persecution of rival factions, including persecution of members of the MQM-Haqqiqui faction, of which Sultan was a member. They argue that this change in country circumstances arose since their last immigration hearing, substantiates their claims of persecution, and establishes that they will be persecuted if they return to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was not timely filed. However, the time limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>motions to reopen does not apply where the motion is based on \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii). This court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to reopen based on changed circumstances in the alien\u2019s home country. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). The grant of a motion to reopen is discretionary relief, and the Attorney General has broad discretion to grant or deny such a motion. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this court applies a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard, regardless of the basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief. <em>Id. </em>There is no abuse of discretion where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cis not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The petitioners have failed to establish that the BIA abused its discretion. First, as the BIA concluded, although the petitioners\u2019 assertions in their motion to reopen were regarding recent events in Pakistan, testimony at the immigration hearing and documentary evidence indicates that the more recent events set forth in the motion to reopen were simply a continuation of the Pakistani government\u2019s suppression of non-government supporters that has been ongoing, well prior to the petitioners\u2019 immigration hearing in May 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the evidence upon which the claim was presented was not material evidence that \u201cwas not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Second, this court previously analyzed the petitioners\u2019 request for withholding of removal and concluded that the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the petitioners\u2019 applications was proper because the petitioners had failed to establish that they would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds. <em>See Himani, </em>246 Fed.Appx. at 883. The petitioners\u2019 reliance on their claims in the removal proceedings to support them motion to reopen is not persuasive. And even assuming that the Pakistani government\u2019s anti-opposition activities had increased in frequency or intensity, the petitioners have not articulated in them motion to reopen how any changes that had occurred in Pakistan would affect them directly or make them eligible for relief. Thus, the petitioners have failed to establish that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

We note, for example, that at the May 2004 hearing Sultan testified on direct examination in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cQ: And did you have any problem with the police in Pakistan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">A: Not from the regular police, sir, but I was arrested by the rangers in the year '97.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">Q: And why did they arrest you in '97, why the ranger arrest you in 1997?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">A: Sir, the Musharraf and the (indiscernible) they got together, formed a coalition in the government and they started arresting people belonging to MQM Haqqiqui group. [AR 462]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">Q: And would you please tell us what MQM is in power for today in Pakistan or it was in power when you left Pakistan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">A: Sir, they were very powerful before, but now since they are part of the government they are ever more powerful than they have ever been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\">Q: And who had kidnapped your child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-16\">A: Mutheda MQM. [AR 466]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-17\">Q: And why are you now scared to go back home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-18\">A: Sir, right now they're very powerful because they're part of the government, they\u2019re ruling that place and people belonging to our party they\u2019re mostly in the prison or in detentions.\u201d [AR 467]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">And, counsel for petitioners argued to the IJ at the May 2004 hearing in part as follows: \"They have arrested \u2014 even Pakistan now arrested all the \u2014 all the MQM Haqqiqui members in the jail and they've been jailed for last year and a half since they've become a part of the coalition.\u201d [AR 500]</p>\n<p id=\"b257-20\">In petitioners' brief on the present appeal they assert that Musharraf \"seized power by ... a bloodless coup in October 1999.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
