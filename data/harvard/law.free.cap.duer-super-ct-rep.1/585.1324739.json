The complaint averred \u00e1 breach of an under-letting by Williams to the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-13\">Williams answered separately as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-14\">The said defendant, John Williams, by A. J. Perry, his attorney, separately answering the complaint of the said plaintiff, denies, that in violation of the said covenant, in said indenture contained, and without the consent of said plaintiff, he has under-let the said premises, or some part or parts thereof, to the defendants in said action named, or either of them, and he denies, that as he is advised, he has broken any of the covenants contained in said indenture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-15\">The cause was tried before the Chief Justice and a jury on the 16th of December, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-16\">The plaintiff proved an indenture of lease executed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>defendant, containing the covenant of which the breach was alleged, and a general clause of re-entry, and there rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">The counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit upon the grounds\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-6\">First\u2014That no evidence had been given of the under-letting averred in the coinplaint; and Second\u2014That there was no proof of an actual entry on the premises by the plaintiff before the commencement of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-7\">The Chief Justice denied the motion, and the counsel excepted to his decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-8\">A'verdict was then rendered for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a case, to be heard, in the first instance, at a general term, and with liberty to either party to turn the same into.a special verdict or bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-9\"><em>J.

The defendant, by his answer, admits that he has underlet the premises, but denies that he did it in violation of the covenant, or without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. The breach of the covenant being thus admitted, the duty of proving the matter in avoidance devolves upon the defendant; nor could the plaintiff be called upon to prove- a negative in the first instance. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Everitt, </em>3 Code Rep. 150; <em>McMurray </em>v.

Duer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJn\">In our opinion, the only reasonable interpretation of the defendant\u2019s answer, is, that it admits the fact of underletting, and denies merely that the act was a violation of his covenant, and without the consent of the plaintiff. The denial that the underletting was a breach of his covenant, as denying a conclusion of law, and not the existence of a fact, must be rejected as immaterial. And if the answer is to be construed as averring that the plaintiff gave his consent to the underletting, this was a matter of defence, the burden of proving which rested upon the defendant. The plaintiff was not bound to prove a negative, and in proving the execution and contents of the lease, gave all the evidence that under the pleadings was requisite to maintain the action. <em>(Mann </em>v. <em>Morewood, </em>5 Sand., p. 557; <em>Catlin </em>v. Gunter, ante, p. 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The objection that no proof was given of an actual entry by the plaintiff previous to the commencement of the suit, is answered by that provision in the R. S. to which we were referred on the argument (2 R. S. 2d Ed. p. 233, or p. 306), and which we construe as dispensing with the necessity of such proof in all cases whatever.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The commencement of a suit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the recovery of the land is now equivalent to an entry at common law, and the right of the plaintiff to enter and take possession is all that he is bound to prove upon the trial. It is this construction, as we read the opinion of Ch. J. Savage, which the Supreme Court gave to the statute in the case -of <em>Siglar </em>v. <em>Van Riper </em>(20 Wend. 414). It is true that the section in the R. S. containing the provision in question is found in the title which treats of the action of ejectment, and that this action, in its name and form, has been abolished by the Code; but the provision relates, not to the form of the action, but to the nature of the proof to be given on the trial, and is, therefore, in our judgment, one of those general provisions which the Code has expressly declared shall be retained (Code, \u00a7 455).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Judgment upon the verdict must be entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\"> The following is the section referred to:\u2014g 25. \u201cIt shall not be necessary for the plaintiff to prove an actual entry under title, nor the actual receipt of any profits of the premises demanded; but it shall be sufficient for him to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>a right to the possession of such premises, at the time of the commencement of the suit, as an heir, devisee, purchaser, <em>or otherwise,\u201d </em>The words \u201c or otherwise\u201d were plainly inserted to cover a conditional right of entry, since all other cases are covered by the previous words.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
