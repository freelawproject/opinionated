J., Duer, Paine, Bosworth, Emmet, J.J.)</p>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b681-9\">General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuM\">March, 1853.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b681-6\">A demurrer, since the Cede was amended in April, 1852, cannot be interposed to new matter in an answer, unless such new matter constitutes a <em>counter-claim.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b681-7\">Any new matter set up as a defence, and not constituting a counter-claim, if it do not state facts sufficient to constitute a defence, may be stricken out as irrelevant, or, if the whole answer consist of such matter, judgment may be granted on account of the frivolousness qf the answer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-10\">This case came before the court on an appeal from an order, declaring a demurrer to part of an answer t\u00f3 be frivolous, and that the defendant have judgment on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-11\">The complaint sought to charge the defendant for the alleged conversion of personal property belonging to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-12\">The answer, first, denied plaintiff\u2019s ownership, or that the defendant became wrongfully possessed of and converted the property. It next averred that defendant, as and being a constable, took it from the possession of John Connelly, on an execution against him, issued on a judgment recovered against him by William R. Lawrence and others, in the Justices\u2019 Court of the third judicial district, and that the property was in fact Connelly\u2019s. Other new' matter was alleged which it is unnecessary to mention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-13\">To such of the answer as contained new matter, the plaintiff demurred, assigning for pause that the same does not contain any statement of facts constituting a defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-14\">The defendant moved for judgment on the ground that the demurrer was frivolous, and on that motion the order appealed from was made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-15\"><em>J. D. </em>McGregor, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>J. H. Lane, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b682-4\">By the Court. Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY5\">There seems to have been a misapprehension, by both parties, of the existing provisions of the Code in relation to the cases in which a plaintiff may demur. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">There cannot now be a demurrer to new matter in an answer constituting a defence, unless such new matter sets up a' counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The allegation of new matter, not relating to a counter-claim, is not to be replied or demurred to, but <em>\u201c </em>is to be <em>deemed controverted </em>by the adverse party as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require.\u201d Code, \u00a7 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">When it contains new matter constituting a counter-claim, the plaintiff may either reply, as to such new matter, by denying the allegations of it, or by a statement of other facts constituting; a defence to it, or he may demur to it for insufficiency. Code, \u00a7 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The misapprehension has- probably arisen from the fact that while \u00a7\u00a7 153 and 168 were amended, \u00a7 154 was not modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">It should have been amended by striking out the word \u201c defence,\u201d and inserting in its place the word \u201c counter-claim.\u201d After the amendments, passed on the 16th of April, 1852, took effect, only that part of the answer constituting a counter-claim could be replied to. (\u00a7 153.) \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">A reply to new matter, not relating to a counter-claim, is not now allowed. The Code puts it in issue, and the issue is one of fact, to be tried by a jury. (\u00a7 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Section 154, to be sensible, must now be construed as speaking of new matter to which a plaintiff has a right to reply or demur at his election. , The only new matter to which either a reply or demurrer may be interposed at the election of the plaintiff, is such as constitutes a counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">\u2022 The section must be construed and applied as it would be if the word \u201c counter-claim,\u201d instead of the word \u201c defence,\u201d was contained in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">' The demurrer cannot, properly speaking, be said to be frivolous. It was wholly irregular and unauthorized, as much so as a demurrer to the plea of non assumpsit.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Ho such proceeding is authorized by the Code when an answer sets up a defence, which is not a counter-claim. If an answer contains new matter not relating to a counter-claim, and such new matter does not state facts constituting a defence, the plaintiff must either move for judgment, on account of the frivolousness of the answer (Code, \u00a7 247), or to strike out such new matter as irrelevant, if it relates to only one of several causes of action, or constitutes one of several separate defences. (Code, \u00a7 160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">If but a single defence be set up, and that applies to the\" sole cause, or to all the parses of action contained in the complaint, and the defence be frivolous, \u00a7\"243 will enable the plaintiff to obtain a judgment on motion, without the delay of a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\"\u25a0 If such defence be applicable to one only of several causes of action, or if other defences be also interposed, it can be stricken out as irrelevant, under \u00a7 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Ho order should have been made on the demurrer. The order appealed from must be reversed. As there has been an entire misapprehension by both parties as to the proper practice, in cases like that before us, and as the irregularity was one which did not, at the time, attract the attention of the court, each party must bear his own costs,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
