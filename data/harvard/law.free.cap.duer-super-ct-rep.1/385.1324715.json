C.

Rep. 407; also 9 Johns, Rep. 309; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Weed.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">Even where a note of a third party is taken at the time of the contract on a sale of goods, it is said by Whittlesey, Justice, in <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Hoff </em>(5 Denio, 362), and by Sutherland, Justice, in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Talcott </em>(1 Cowen, 383), not to be payment unless agreed to be received as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\">The note being given after the sale had been made, and there being no agreement to receive it in satisfaction of the debt, at plaintiffs\u2019 risk, it is not payment, and the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on the verdict. <em>(Tobey </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>5 John. Rep. 68; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Talcott, </em>1 Cowen, 383; <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Hoff, </em>5 Denio, 362.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-9\">The receipt given for the note and cash being <em>in full </em>of the bill, does not import that the note was taken in satisfaction. This-was decided in <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>and many other cases.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-10\"><em>H. Day, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6zk\">argued that judgment ought to be rendered in his favor upon the following grounds :</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-11\">I. The sale was not made or consummated until the 12th of October, when the delivery and payment were made; and the law regards the sale fraudulent and void until delivery or part payment is made, (Statute of Frauds, R. S. vol. ii., p. 195.) And therefore,.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-12\">II. The note of\" Howard <em>&amp; </em>Son, the note of a third party, was not given for a precedent debt, and the receipt of the note was <em>prima facie </em>evidence that it was taken in payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>debt. 1. Because it was taken without endorsement by the defendant, and his endorsement was not asked. <em>(Bank of England </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>1 Ld. Raymond, 442; <em>Whitbeck </em>v. <em>Van Ness, </em>11 John. 409; <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>15 John. 241; <em>Fydele </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1 Espinasse, 448; <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>Larned, </em>21 Wend. 452.) 2. The credit of the note to the defendant in the books of the plaintiffs, and the balancing of the books, are <em>primd faeie </em>evidence that the note was taken in payment <em>(Frisbie </em>v. <em>Larned, </em>21 Wend. 452), which case is approved and cited in the Court of Errors, 3 Denio, 410, and in this court. <em>(St. John </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>1 Sand. 9). 3. The receipt, reciting that the note with cash is received in full for the debt, is <em>.primd faeie </em>evidence that the note was accepted as payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-6\">HI. It is unnecessary to prove that an agreement was made in so many words, that the note would be received in payment. Circumstances may show it. (1 Cowen 80; <em>Whitbeck </em>v. <em>Van Ness, </em>11 John. 409; <em>Waydell </em>v. <em>Luer, </em>3 Denio, 410; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>12 John. 411; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>1 Sand. 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">TV\". All the circumstances of the transaction show that the note was tendered and accepted in payment, and that the plaintiffs took their choice of the note in' preference to giving credit to defendant. 1. The plaintiffs knew nothing of Murray or his credit. 2. There could be no object in the defendant\u2019s paying part cash and a negotiable note as security for the remainder of the debt, when he had a credit for six months, as appears in the pleadings, for he would thus lose the interest on his money, and put it out of his power to negotiate the note, so that it would not be at his risk. 3. The plaintiffs did not ask defendant to endorse the note, and he did not endorse it, which is the most common and natural way of seeming the liability of the debtor. 4. The receipt is in full for the glass.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b396-8\">By the Court. Oakley, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyV\">It is not necessary to deny that in this state the law is settled, that the acceptance by a creditor of the bill or note of a third person, even when not endorsed by the debtor, never operates as. a satisfaction of a precedent debt, unless it is expressly shown that such, at the time, was the understanding and agreement of the parties; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>it may also be admitted that this rule prevails, even when a receipt is given by the creditor, acknowledging the bill or note to have been received by him as a payment in full. But these admissions are not at all inconsistent with the position that when the seller of goods, at the time of the sale, accepts the note of a third person not endorsed by the debtor, and gives a receipt for it, as a payment, in part or in full, of the price, it is a presumption of reason and, therefore, of law, that the payment so. made was meant to be absolute and the purchaser to be wholly discharged. That this is the reasonable and legal presumption we cannot doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The error in the argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in this case, consists in assuming the existence of a debt from the defendant, when the parties met on the 12th of October; a debt arising from a sale prior to that day; but, in reality, there was no sale before that day, and, consequently, no precedent debt. The order given by the defendant, and its acceptance by the plaintiffs on the 8th of October, were evidence of a verbal agreement; but as none of the goods were then delivered, and no part of the consideration then paid, the agreement was void under the statute of frauds, so that when the parties met on the 12-th, there was no contract upon which either of them was, or could be rendered, liable to the other. The actual sale was made and completed on that day; and as the date and delivery of the goods, and the delivery and acceptance of the note, were simultaneous acts, they musty in our judgment, be considered as parts of one transaction, and the execution of an entire agreement. The sale, by the election of the plaintiffs, was not for cash, or upon credit, but partly for cash, and partly for the note; and the acceptance of the note and the discharge of the defendant thus became conditions of the purchase. All the facts in the case, the entries in the books, and, emphatically, the terms of the receipt, correspond entirely with this view of the intention nf the parties, and, as it seems to us, do not admit of any other interpretation. Whether a receipt thus given, and expressed to be for a payment in full, ought not to be held as concluding the plaintiffs, is unnecessary now to determine; but we are clearly of opinion that it cast upon them the burden of proof, and that the conclusion, which its terms necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>suggest, could only be repelled by evidence of an express agreement that the note should be held only as collateral security, and its amount be credited to the defendant only when collected. Ho such evidence was given or offered upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We are therefore of opinion, that the defence set up in the answer has been established, and that the defendant is, upon the facts, as they appear in the case, e'ntitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We remark, in conclusion, that we have not been referred, t\u00f3 any adjudged case which is in conflict with the views we have expressed. The observations in <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>Hoff, </em>and in <em>Porter </em>v. Talcott, are merely <em>dicta, </em>while, on the other hand, our present decision is fully sustained by the judgment of this court, in <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Purdy </em>(1 Sand. S. C. Rep. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Verdict for plaintiff set aside, and verdict and judgment thereon, with costs, entered for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
