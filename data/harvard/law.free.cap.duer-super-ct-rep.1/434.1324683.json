He said then all* that I deem it necessary to say now, that there was nothing in the case to prevent the application of the general rule * that a bank can only justify the payment of a check payable to order, by proving the endorsement of the payee, as well as the signature of the drawer, to be genuine. When either is shown to be forged, the bank must be liable to the person entitled to the funds wrongfully paid\u2014generally the payee is the person so entitled\u2014but the proof in this case establishes the right of the plaintiff. He therefore demands judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-10\"><em>A. W. Clason, jun., </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-11\">The issue to be tried was the forgery of the endorsements, and it was rightly held that the affirmative rested upon the plaintiff. I say rightly held, because the plaintiff is substantially the party averring the fact in dispute; because the person for whom the checks were drawn is a matter within his cogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>sanee, and not within the cognisance of the defendant, finally, because the checks bearing endorsements according to their tenor, and being paid by the defendants, the presumption of law is in favor of their being honest endorsements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-4\">Banks are responsible. for forgeries and alterations, but it would be as reasonable to require them to prove the sum in a check to be that originally written, as to prove the party to whose order a check is drawn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">The plaintiff proved by GL W. Corlies, that the endorsement was not that of his firm; the defendants proved by the same witness, that the check was not theirs. So far there was no proof of forgery, but some proof of the payee being a fictitious person; in which case the check was payable to bearer. (1 Coms. 113.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\">If G-. W. Corlies &amp; Co. were the payees, as they had no interest in the checks, the holder and the bank had a right to treat the bill as payable to bearer; or, if the check was given by the plaintiff to a third party, not Gr. W. Corlies &amp; Co., the plaintiff thereby authorized him to endorse it, and is estopped from denying the genuineness of the endorsement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-7\">By the Court. Paine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGI\">Although no explanation was given upon the trial of the purposes for which the checks were drawn, nor of the circumstances under which they passed from the possession of the plaintiff,-it seems to us, there is no reasonable ground upon which his right to recover in this action can be doubted. When a bill'or check is payable to order, to justify the application to its .payment of the funds of the drawer, \u25a0 it must be proved that the required order was in fact given\u2014in other words, it must be proved that the endorsement was genuine\u2014and the burden of this proof rests upon the person, or bank upon whom the bill or check is drawn. Where the endorsement of the payee is shown to be forged, the payment of a check by the bank is in its own wrong, and can never be set up as a defence against the person whose rights it violated, or whose funds are misapplied. In all such cases, the bank must be liable to some person to the extent of such wrongful payment. If the check at the time was the property of the payee, it is to him that the bank is liable ; but if it had never passed into his hands, and he had no interest in it whatever-\u2014and such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>are the facts in the ease before ns\u2014they are the funds of the drawer that have been misapplied, and which the bank is bound to replace. It is the plaintiff, therefore, who is entitled to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">It is impossible for us to treat these checks as payable to bearer or to a fictitious person; as the payees are real persons, the presumption of law is, that the checks were drawn with the intent of vesting the title in them,' and in them alone. Consequently, it was only from them that a title could be derived, and only upon a title given by them, and evidenced by their endorsement, that a valid payment could be made. As the checks were never delivered to them, and they were not the holder\u2019s of them at any time for value, or otherwise, it seems to us a necessary inference that it Was by the fraud of some third person that the checks were obtained and put into circulation. The loss resulting from this fraud the defendants must sustain, and against its perpetrator must seek their remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The supposition that the plaintiff delivered the checks to some third person, to whom he gave an authority to put them into circulation by endorsing the name of the payees, is something worse than gratuitous. We reject it wholly\u2014there is no proof of such a delivery, and the plaintiff could give no such authority;\u2014and, assuredly, we shall not impute to him, in order to protect the defendants, the design of enabling a third person, by means of a forgery, to effect a fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The plaintiff must have judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
