While this case was being litigated, <em>Rule 4:58-2 </em>provided that if, in an action for liquidated damages, an offer of judgment by a party designated as a \u201cclaimant\u201d is not accepted and that party obtains a verdict at least as favorable as the rejected offer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it \u201cshall be allowed, in addition to costs of suit, eight per cent interest on the amount of any money recovery from the date of the offer or the date of completion of discovery, whichever is later, and also a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee ... for such subsequent services as are compelled by the non-acceptance.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Rule </em>4:58-3 similarly provided that if, in an action for liquidated damages, an offer of judgment by a party designated as \u201ca party other than the claimant\u201d is rejected and the verdict is at least as favorable as the offer, it \u201cshall be allowed, in addition to costs of suit, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, for such subsequent services as are compelled by the non-acceptance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">This appeal involves application of the offer of judgment rule in a case where the defendant has asserted a counterclaim. The trial court concluded that because <em>Rules </em>4:58-2 and -3 deal separately with the consequences of non-acceptance of an offer of judgment by a \u201cclaimant\u201d and \u201ca party other than the claimant,\u201d a plaintiff against which a counterclaim is filed cannot submit a single offer of judgment that applies to both its affirmative claim and the counterclaim. We reject this interpretation of the offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>judgment rule and conclude that <em>Rule </em>4:58 authorizes a plaintiff against which a counterclaim is filed to submit an offer of judgment for resolution of the entire case including the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Plaintiff, which manufactures fire suppression products, brought suit for $13,017.74 on a book account against defendant, a wholesaler distributor of plaintiffs products. Defendant filed a counterclaim for $26,795.34 representing commissions plaintiff allegedly owed defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Plaintiff submitted an offer pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:58-1 \u201cto take judgment against defendant in the amount of $9,629.49 in the referenced case.\u201d Defendant rejected this offer, and submitted its own offer \u201cto take judgment in this action [against plaintiff] in the amount of $20,096.50.\u201d Before trial, plaintiff rejected this offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The case was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict for $11,488.40 on plaintiffs claim and a no cause against defendant on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Plaintiff then brought a motion pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 for the costs of suit, interest and the attorney\u2019s fees it incurred subsequent to defendant\u2019s rejection of its offer of judgment. The supporting certification and attached billing records indicated that plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees totaled $25,242.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In opposition to this motion, defendant argued that plaintiff was not entitled to any award, because its damages were \u201cunliquidat-ed,\u201d and <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 authorizes an award \u201c[i]n an action for unliquidated damages\u201d only if \u201cthe amount of the recovery is in excess of 120% of the offer,\u201d and the $11,488.40 verdict in plaintiffs favor was less than 120% of its $9,629.49 offer. Defendant also argued, in the alternative, that \u201cthe offer of judgment ... had no bearing on the counterclaim\u201d and consequently any award should be limited to the attorney\u2019s fees plaintiff incurred in proving its affirmative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiffs claim was for \u201cunliquidated damages\u201d and therefore it was not entitled to any award under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. However, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>concluded that under the language of <em>Rule </em>4:58-2, plaintiffs offer \u201cto take judgment against defendant\u201d for $9,629.49 should be considered to apply only to the affirmative claim asserted in plaintiffs complaint, and not to defendant\u2019s counterclaim, because plaintiff was a \u201cclaimant\u201d only with respect to that claim. Accordingly, the court granted plaintiffs motion, but limited the attorney\u2019s fees award to the fees plaintiff incurred in proving its claim. The court concluded that plaintiffs attorneys had expended only about one-quarter of their time in proving plaintiffs affirmative claim, and thus awarded plaintiff one-quarter of the total attorney\u2019s fees sought, which totaled $6,434.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Plaintiff appeals, arguing that its offer of judgment applied to the entire case, including defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and that the trial court erred in refusing to award the full amount of attorney\u2019s fees plaintiff incurred after defendant\u2019s rejection of its offer of judgment. Defendant cross appeals, arguing that the court should not have made any award to plaintiff under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 because its action was for unliquidated damages and its recovery was less than 120% of its offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Initially, we consider the argument presented by defendant\u2019s cross-appeal that plaintiff is not entitled to any attorney\u2019s fee award because its action was for \u201cunliquidated damages,\u201d and <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 does not allow the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in an action for unliquidated damages \u201cunless the amount of the recovery is in excess of 120% of the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u201cIn general, damages are unliquidated \u2018where they are an uncertain quantity, depending on no fixed standard, referred to the wise discretion of a jury, and can never be made certain except by accord or verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schettino v. Roizman Dev., Inc., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>476, 486, 730 A.2d 797 (1999)(quoting 25 C.J.S. <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 2 (1966)). \u201cOn the other hand, \u2018liquidated damages are those the amount whereof has been ascertained by judgment or by the specific agreement of the parties, or which are susceptible of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>made certain by mathematical calculation from known factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 730 A.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Under this test, it is clear that both plaintiffs claim and defendant\u2019s counterclaim were for liquidated damages. Plaintiffs complaint presented a straightforward claim of $13,017.74 for the unpaid balance of the contract price of goods sold to defendant, which was supported by invoices introduced into evidence at trial. Neither the fact that defendant claimed some of the invoices contained duplicate billings or that the second count of the complaint asserted an alternative claim for the \u201creasonable value of goods sold and delivered\u201d transformed plaintiffs claim on a book account into one for unliquidated damages. Similarly, defendant\u2019s counterclaim for the specific amount of $26,795.34 was based on a written agreement between plaintiff and another entity, which provided for the payment of a royalty to defendant\u2019s principal, Richard Brennan, of \u201c$.25 per 12 oz. can of product sold\u201d by plaintiff. Thus, both plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s damage claims were based on \u201cspecific agreement^] of the parties\u201d or \u201csusceptible of being made certain by mathematical calculation from known factors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, the trial court correctly rejected defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff was not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees because its claim was unliquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We turn next to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff was only entitled to an allowance under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in proving its direct case, because under the language of <em>Rule </em>4:58-2, plaintiffs offer of judgment should be considered to apply only to the claim made in plaintiffs complaint, and not to defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The court based this conclusion on the fact that <em>Rule </em>4:58 distinguishes between the consequences of non-acceptance of an offer of judgment by a \u201cclaimant,\u201d which is addressed in <em>Rule </em>4:58-2, and by \u201ca party other than the claimant,\u201d which is addressed in <em>Rule </em>4:58-3. Under this view of <em>Rule </em>4:58, a plaintiff against which a counterclaim is asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>would be both a \u201cclaimant\u201d with respect to its affirmative claim and \u201ca party other than the claimant\u201d with respect the counterclaim. Thus, if such a party wished to resolve an entire case, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Rule </em>4:58 would require it to make separate offers of judgment with respect to its affirmative claim and the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We find nothing in the language or policy of <em>Rule </em>4:58 that requires this kind of bifurcated approach to the submission of offers of judgment. Although <em>Rule </em>4:58 distinguishes between a \u201cclaimant\u201d and \u201ca party other than the claimant,\u201d it does not suggest that the same party can be both a claimant and a non-claimant. Instead, the most straightforward reading of the rule is that any party who asserts a claim should be considered to be only a \u201cclaimant,\u201d even if another party has asserted a claim against that party.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">This interpretation of <em>Rule </em>4:58 also best serves its \u201csalutary purpose of encouraging settlement,\u201d <em>Frigon v. DBA Holdings, Inc., </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 354, 787 A.2d 966 (App.Div.2002), by \u201cimposing] financial consequences on a party who rejects a settlement offer that turns out to be more favorable than the ultimate judgment.\u201d <em>Schettino v. Roizman Dev., Inc., supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 730 A.2d 797. A plaintiffs claims and defendant\u2019s counterclaims often arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions. In that circumstance, the determination of a reasonable settlement offer involves an overall evaluation of the controversy, which could be unduly complicated by attempting to assign separate values to the plaintiffs claim and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. Therefore, the offer of judgment rule\u2019s effectiveness in promoting the settlement of litigation would be undermined if it were construed to require a plaintiff against which a counterclaim is filed to submit separate offers of judgment on its affirmative claim and the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In addition, if <em>Rule </em>4:58 were construed to require separate offers of judgment whenever there are both daims and counterclaims, some parties undoubtedly would submit offers of judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>with respect to only the plaintiffs claim or the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and even if such an offer were accepted, it would not resolve the entire litigation. Such tactical use of the offer of judgment rule could pose a risk of unfairness to some litigants, <em>compare Schettino v. Roizman Dev., Inc., supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 483-86, 730 A.2d 797, and would be of only limited value in conserving judicial resources. Therefore, we conclude that <em>Rule </em>4:58 should be construed to authorize a plaintiff against which a counterclaim is filed to submit an offer of judgment for resolution of the entire case including the counterclaim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Plaintiffs offer \u201cto take judgment against defendant in the amount of $9,626.49 in the referenced case\u201d was clearly intended by plaintiff,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and understood by defendant, to apply to the entire ease, including defendant\u2019s counterclaim. Thus, the trial court erred in limiting the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the fees plaintiff incurred in proving its direct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Finally, it is unclear whether the trial court conducted an overall review of the reasonableness of plaintiffs fee application. Consequently, the case must be remanded to afford the court a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>further opportunity to consider the reasonableness of that application.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Accordingly, the order awarding plaintiff attorneys\u2019 fees under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> In an action for unliquidated damages, <em>Rule </em>4:58 establishes a different test of entii lenient to an award of aitorney's fees, interest and litigation expenses in favor of a party whose offer of judgment is not accepted. We conclude for the reasons set forth in section I of this opinion that the claims in the present case were for liquidated damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\"> By an amendment to <em>Rule </em>4:58 adopted by the Supreme Court in 2000, subsequent to the offers of judgment involved in this case, a party entitled to an allowance under <em>Rule </em>4:58 is also awarded reasonable litigation expenses following non-acceptance. This amendment also made certain changes in the structure and wording of <em>Rules </em>4:58-2 and -3 that are not material to the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> We have no need in deciding this appeal to consider whether <em>Rule </em>4:58 would allow a party to submit an offer of judgment that does not encompass all the claims asserted in an action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> Although plaintiff did not submit any certification indicating how it calculated the offer of judgment, it appears clear that plaintiff considered defendant's counterclaim in determining the amount of the offer. Plaintiff's requests for admissions suggest that its position was that any commissions for which it might be obligated were due to defendant\u2019s principal, individually, rather than to defendant, and alternatively, that even if the commissions were owed to defendant, the maximum amount of those commissions was $3,383.25. The difference between the $13,017.74 demanded in plaintiff's complaint and the $3,383.25 in commissions plaintiff implicitly acknowledged owing either defendant or its principal is $9,634.49. Plaintiff's $9,629.49 offer of judgment was $5.00 less than this figure. Therefore, there is no basis for defendant\u2019s suggestion that plaintiff assigned only nominal or token value to the counterclaim in malting its offer of judgment. <em>Compare Frigon v.
