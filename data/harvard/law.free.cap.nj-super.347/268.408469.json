However, the fact is that the trial turned almost entirely on credibility issues, there were ample bases for the jury to reach the conclusions it did, and there is no basis for reversal. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed in all respects, including the provisions thereof relating to plaintiffs complaint, those relating to defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and the trial court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The essential characters in this drama are Morris Winograd, principal of the plaintiff corporation, Satellite Entertainment, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who is an accountant and insurance broker, and also operates a bar and restaurant in Jersey City known as Wynny\u2019s, and defendant John Keaton, who worked most of his life as a mechanic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>but began operating a barbecue restaurant in Jersey City in 1993. Winograd and Keaton had known each other for many years and had a business and semi-friendly relationship. Keaton said that from the time when he was a young man, he had obtained his insurance from Winograd and over the years, the two had numerous contacts. Keaton said he thought <em>the two </em>had a good relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">As Keaton described his entry into the barbecue business, in August 1993, he realized he \u201cwas getting up in age and I knew they did not hire mechanics\u201d of that age. He also knew how to barbecue ribs and, with the encouragement of his daughter, he opened discussions with George Williams, who owned premises at 547 Martin Luther King Drive in Jersey City. Those discussions evolved into a six year lease under which Keaton occupied a portion of the premises for his barbecue business. The premises also included a bar and dance hall and a second-floor apartment in which Williams resided. The lease ran from 1993 to 1999, with a monthly rental of $700. Keaton then opened his restaurant whose \u201cspecialty was in barbecue ribs,\u201d and he continued to operate that business from 1993 until the end of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In March 1995, Winograd loaned Keaton a sum of money, and Keaton signed a note acknowledging that debt. The amount of the loan was disputed. The note is in the face amount of $6,000, and it says nothing about interest rate. Winograd said that Keaton had asked him for the loan so he could purchase ribs in large quantities and in that way save money. Winograd said further that he delivered the money, $6,000, to Keaton, in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Keaton testified that he signed the note before any of the information (including the face amount) had been inserted. He said further that the amount paid to him was just $5,000, and he further testified that in September 1995, he repaid that entire $5,000 to Winograd, in cash. Winograd, on the other hand, insisted that he had advanced $6,000 to Keaton and claimed that in September 1995, Keaton repaid him just $1,500. Thus, Winograd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>maintained that $4,500 remained owing on the note, while Keaton maintained that the note had been repaid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">That promissory note \u2014 which is not reproduced in either party\u2019s appendix \u2014 formed the subject matter of Winograd\u2019s complaint against Keaton. On that complaint, the jury returned a verdict of $1,000 in favor of Winograd, which would seem to indicate it had accepted Winograd\u2019s testimony that the loan had been for $6,000, but it had also accepted Keaton\u2019s testimony that he had repaid $5,000 to Winograd. That last conclusion seems particularly likely since, at trial, Keaton presented two apparently independent witnesses to corroborate his repayment of the note, one of whom was a teacher in a Jersey City high school who said she personally counted out the $5,000 in cash presented by Keaton and turned it over to Winograd.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">While Keaton was operating his barbecue restaurant, the owner of the real property, George Williams, told Keaton that he was having financial trouble. He asked if Keaton was interested in buying the property and when Keaton replied that he was not in a position to do so, Williams suggested that Keaton make an effort to find some other interested purchaser. Keaton thought of Winograd-indeed, he testified that Winograd was the only person he knew who might be in a position to buy the property \u2014 and he mentioned the possibility to Winograd. Winograd expressed interest. Although the chronology becomes somewhat confusing, what is clear is that Williams died at some point after his discussion with Keaton about purchasing the property, and at some time thereafter, Keaton began making his rental payments to an entity known as Mercury Capital, which may have been Williams\u2019 mortgagee. Eventually, however, Winograd purchased the property and determined to renovate the entire premises, including that portion occupied by Keaton\u2019s barbecue restaurant as well as the adjacent restaurant and bar. His plan was to open and operate a new, more elaborate restaurant and bar to be known as Wynny\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>According to Keaton, in or about September 1995, Winograd raised the question of buying out Keaton\u2019s business, and asked him for a price. Keaton said he answered by naming a price of $175,000. He said Winograd responded positively to that price and told Keaton that he would pay it. According to Keaton, Winograd also said he wanted Keaton out of the property by the end of 1995, and he wanted Keaton to help him establish and run his new enterprise. Keaton said he agreed to do so. Keaton did in fact vacate the premises by December 1995, and, beginning in or around January 1996, Winograd began renovations and also began paying Keaton a weekly salary for his services respecting Winograd\u2019s new bar and restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Keaton presented a number of witnesses to corroborate what he described as Winograd\u2019s promise to pay him $175,000 for his business. One was Rolanda Taylor, a bartender employed by Winograd, who testified that on two occasions, she heard Wino-grad agree to pay Keaton that amount. The first time, she said, was in May 1996, when Keaton asked Winograd, \u201cis he still going to pay him the hundred and seventy-five thousand for his business\u201d? She said Winograd replied, \u201cYes, you\u2019re going \u2014 I already told you that I was going to pay you. I already told you seven times I was going to pay you.\u201d The second occasion, she said, was in April 1997, at a final meeting, when Winograd terminated his relationship with Keaton, Taylor and some others who had been operating Winograd\u2019s bar and restaurant. She said at that meeting, Keaton had reminded Winograd of his obligation to pay him $175,000, and, she said, Winograd replied, \u201cI heard you, I told you I was going to pay you, and he walked out the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">A second witness presented by Keaton was Dolores Boyce, the high school teacher referred to above, who said that when she counted out the $5,000 which Keaton repaid to Winograd under the original promissory note, she also heard Keaton ask Winograd to bring him his $175,000 note, to which Winograd replied, \u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASj\">Finally, in addition to supporting testimony from his daughter, Keaton also presented the testimony of Maribelle Bonilla, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>worked as a bartender during the early days when Wynny\u2019s was beginning its operations. She too described the final meeting in April 1997, at which Winograd terminated a number of employees, including Ms. Bonilla. She said that, at the meeting, \u201cJohn Keaton approached him [Winograd] and asked him about his business. He [Keaton] said he [Winograd] owed him a hundred and seventy-five thousand for his business. Winograd said that he heard him. That he was going to pay him. He said, I heard you already. As he was walking out the door, he said he was going to pay him his money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Winograd denied ever agreeing to pay Keaton anything for his barbecue business. At trial, his counsel contended that the assets of Keaton\u2019s business had little if any value, that its earnings were negligible, and whatever value it may have had did not approach $175,000. He claimed further that Keaton had willingly terminated operation of his business so that he could accept employment as manager of Winograd\u2019s new establishment, where he would be paid $800 per week \u2014 more than he ever could have earned from his barbecue restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As noted, however, the jury accepted Keaton\u2019s version of the agreement between him and Winograd, and awarded Keaton $175,000 on his counterclaim. Since, as noted above, it awarded $1,000 to Winograd on his complaint, the result was a net award of $174,000 in favor of Keaton. The court then entered a judgment to that effect which, initially, included an award of $22,263 in prejudgment interest. Plaintiff subsequently moved to set aside the judgment and for the award of either a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. The court denied the motion, but did rule that pre-judgment interest would not be awarded. It then entered an order to that effect, denying the request to set aside the verdict but also determining that Keaton would not receive pre-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">On this appeal, Winograd claims that the verdict in favor of Keaton was against the weight of the evidence and should be set aside; that the court erred in improperly excluding evidence he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>offered in defense of the counterclaim; and that the alleged agreement calling for Winograd to pay $175,000 to Keaton should not be enforced because it did not include the essential terms of an enforceable contract. We find no merit in any of the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">First, a jury verdict should be set aside only when it \u201cclearly and convincingly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:49-1(a). <em>See Goss v. American Cyanamid, Co., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 239, 650 A.2d 1001 (App.Div. 1994). \u201cThe standard for our setting aside a verdict already sustained by the trial judge is high.\u201d <em>Horn v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 178, 615 A.2d 663 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>435, 627 A.2d 1141 (1993). Only when \u201c \u2018it clearly and convincingly appears that thee was a manifest denial of justice under the law\u2019 \u201d should such a verdict be disturbed. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6-8, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). Winograd fell far short of meeting that standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">There was ample basis on which the jury could decide to accept Keaton\u2019s version of the agreement between him and Wino-grad. Not only was Keaton himself unequivocal in describing that agreement, but Keaton presented three independent witnesses (plus his daughter) who corroborated Winograd\u2019s repeated promise to pay Keaton $175,000 for his business. Wo see no reason to assume that all those witnesses were lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Nor are we persuaded by Winograd\u2019s argument that such an agreement was inconceivable because Keaton\u2019s business did not have a value close to $175,000. Keaton argues, persuasively, that Winograd was not particularly interested in buying the tangible assets or good will of Keaton\u2019s business. What Winograd wanted, and what Winograd was willing to pay for, Keaton argues, was Keaton\u2019s occupancy and right to continue to occupy a portion of the premises in which Winograd wanted to develop and operate his new bar and restaurant. It was that space which Winograd wanted, Keaton argues, and for which Winograd was willing to pay $175,000. And, Keaton further argues, at trial Winograd testified that after he completed his purchase from Keaton, he expended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>between $700,000 and $750,000 to improve the property for his proposed new operation. Viewed in the context of that expenditure, the $175,000 which Winograd agreed to pay in order to terminate Keaton\u2019s interest in the property, was not excessive and was indeed relatively modest.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We also reject the claim that Winograd\u2019s contractual undertaking to pay $175,000 to Keaton should be invalidated for lack of specificity concerning the terms of the contract. The basic terms of this very simple agreement were clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">First, the price was firm: it was $175,000. So too was the description of what Winograd was purchasing. He was buying all of Keaton\u2019s business, including whatever tangible assets, inventory or \u201cgood will\u201d might be involved. However, as discussed above and as Keaton\u2019s attorney emphasizes, none of those assets were particularly significant to Winograd. Thus, it is not surprising that the parties did not, for example, itemize with specificity the inventory or the furniture of Keaton\u2019s business which was to be turned over to Winograd. To Winograd, those details were unimportant. The critical point, and the real reason for Winograd\u2019s payment of $175,000, was Keaton\u2019s agreement to vacate the property by the end of 1995, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Winograd also argues that the contract was too vagu\u00e9 for enforcement because there was no description of the interest rate or the due date of the note to be given by Winograd in payment for the business. Keaton concedes that the note contained no provision for interest, and thus he had no right to interest. He claims further that without a specified 'due date, the note should be regarded as due on demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">It is a settled principle that when the essential parts of a contract are spelled out, a court will not refuse to enforce that contract because some of its less critical terms have not been articulated. In such a case, the court will imply a reasonable missing term or, if necessary, will receive evidence to provide a basis for such an implication. <em>See Paley v. Barton Savings &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Loan </em>Assoc., 82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 83, 196 A.2d 682 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>602, 198 A.2d 446 (1964); <em>Comerata v. Chaumont, Inc., </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, 145 A.2d 471 (App.Div.1958). And that is particularly true when there has been part performance of the contract, or \u2014 as here \u2014 where one of the parties (Keaton) has fully performed his part of the bargain. <em>See Comerata </em>at 305-06, 145 A.2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In support of his claim of invalidity because of vagueness, Winograd relies on a number of cases in which critical, essential parts of a contract were missing and the contract was so vague or indefinite that it could not realistically be enforced. <em>See Borough of West Caldwell v. Borough of Caldwell, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>9, 24-25, 138 A.2d 402 (1958) (the terms were so vague that the intent of the parties could not be determined); <em>Weichert Realtors v. Ryan, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>427, 435, 608 A.2d 280 (1992) (the contract lacked essential terms so that the obligation of each parly could not realistically be ascertained). Winograd relies primarily, however, on <em>Malaker Corp. v. First Jersey Nat'l Bank, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 395 A.2d 222 (App.Div.1978), <em>certif. denied, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>488, 401 A.2d 243 (1979), where an alleged contract was found to be lacking essential terms necessary for enforcement. Although the missing provisions there dealt with interest rates and terms of repayment of loans, that case is markedly different from ours. It involved an alleged agreement to extend a line of credit.- Thus, the nature of the line of credit and the terms thereof, including interest rates, terms and time of repayment and such items as the need for and nature of collateral, were essential provisions that went to the heart of the alleged agreement. Here, on the other hand, the heart of the contract is the dollar amount to be paid to Keaton and Keaton\u2019s obligation to vacate the premises for Winograd\u2019s use. The incidental terms of the note to be given in payment were just that: incidental terms, which do not bar enforcement of the essential agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Finally, Winograd complains of the trial court\u2019s rejection of proffered testimony designed to show that after Keaton closed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>business and began working for Winograd, he was functioning as Winograd\u2019s manager rather than simply an employee working in the establishment. At trial, Winograd urged admissibility of that evidence for what he termed its impact on Keaton\u2019s \u201ccredibility,\u201d since Keaton had denied functioning as a manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">We agree with Winograd that, under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607, the proposed evidence was admissible and the court should have accepted it. However, we see no prejudice \u2014 and certainly no substantial prejudice \u2014 from the ruling. There was no dispute as to the salary being paid by Winograd to Keaton, and we fail to see any major significance in the title bestowed on Keaton. If Winograd\u2019s point was that Keaton had simply ended his own business venture in order to accept a more lucrative position with Winograd, then Winograd had already made that point. Any question of Keaton\u2019s title would not have advanced his argument any further. Indeed, it is difficult to believe that any aspect of the argument based on Keaton\u2019s employment was likely to have a persuasive effect. If the job offered to Keaton was attractive, then it would have been so whether or not Winograd had also offered to pay $175,000 for Keaton\u2019s business. Keaton\u2019s acceptance of the position was not inconsistent with his description of the alleged contract of sale with Winograd.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We see no need for an extensive discussion of Keaton\u2019s cross-appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of pre-judgment interest. It is clear that a trial court is vested with substantial discretion to award or deny pre-judgment interest in contract cases. <em>Bak-A-Lum Corp. v. Alcoa Bldg. Prod., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>123, 131, 351 A.2d 349 (1976). <em>See also Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 478, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988); <em>Musto v. Vidas, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 74, 754 A.2d 586 (App.Div.2000); <em>In re Estate of Lash, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 261, 747 A.2d 327 (App.Div.2000). While it would have been preferable to have a statement of the court\u2019s reasoning, and why it determined to withhold such an award, we see no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>on which we could or should conclude that the action constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\"> The judgment on appeal was entered only against the individual plaintiff, Morris Winograd, but the notice of appeal was filed in the name of both the individual and the corporate plaintiffs.
