Defendant told Chester he had worked at the Scotts\u2019 house in the past and believed the elderly couple kept a lot of money in a suitcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">On March 1, 1997, defendant, along with Chester, drove his red Cadillac and parked it down the street from the Scotts\u2019 home. He gave Chester a gun and a set of handcuffs and instructed Chester to handcuff the couple before leaving the home. Chester knocked on the door. When James opened the door, Chester said he needed to use the telephone to call a tow truck for his car. James suggested that Chester call Triple A and invited him in the house. James went to his bedroom to look up the phone number while his wife Ethel escorted Chester into their home. When James returned with the telephone number, Chester pulled a gun, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. I just want your money.\u201d James replied that they did not keep <em>money </em>in the house. Chester then moved the couple into the bedroom where he removed $40 in cash and a Visa gold credit card <em>from </em>James\u2019s wallet. Chester next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>ordered the couple into the living room, where he handcuffed James to Ethel while they sat in a chair. Chester fled the house and returned to the car where defendant waited.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Once Chester left, the Scotts tried to get out of the chair, but were unable to do so because Ethel had recently had knee replacement surgery which made it difficult for her to maneuver. After struggling for over five minutes, James managed to get to the telephone and call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Meanwhile Chester was upset with defendant due to the little money he found in the Scotts\u2019 home. Defendant drove to a Bradlees Department store where they purchased a TV, a VCR and a cell phone using James\u2019 credit card. The total sale was $572. Defendant signed James\u2019 name on the credit card record. Next the two men stopped at a liquor store and purchased several bottles of liquor and cigarettes, again using James\u2019 credit card. Defendant signed James\u2019 name on the receipt for the $200 purchase. Next the two purchased gasoline and oil with the same credit card. The gas station attendant wrote down the license plate of defendant\u2019s ear which was ADF-7428. They then went to Pathmark Supermarket and purchased groceries with James\u2019 credit card. Their final attempt to use the credit card was at a clothing store, but the card was declined by the store. Defendant and Chester later sold the TV, VCR and cell phone for $90.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Meanwhile Detective Mark Fisco of the Teaneck Police Department was dispatched to the Scott home where the Scotts explained what had occurred. Detective Fisco then called the credit card company and canceled James\u2019 credit card. He inquired about recent purchases made with the card and learned of the Bradlees, Pathmark, gas station and liquor store purchases. The police traveled to each of these locations and retrieved the credit card receipts. The receipts contained James\u2019 credit card along with his forged signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Several days later, Detective Fisco and Detective Andrew McGurr were in the Bradlees\u2019 parking lot when they observed a red Cadillac bearing the same license plate number involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>improper use of James\u2019 credit card. Detective McGurr observed defendant enter the Cadillac. The police then stopped the vehicle and arrested defendant. A search of the car revealed several bottles of liquor and two quarts of oil. Later, Detective Fisco showed various witnesses a photographic array which included defendant\u2019s picture. The Bradlees cashier identified defendant as the purchaser of the TV and VCR. In addition, Nicole Thompson, a locksmith, who had previously helped defendant several weeks before when defendant locked his keys in the car while the car was parked outside of the Scotts\u2019 home, identified defendant as the man at the Scotts\u2019 home on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In February 1998, Detective Fisco learned that Chester was a possible suspect in the March 1997 incident at the Scotts\u2019 home. Chester was arrested a short while later and agreed to give a statement. He detailed the robbery events and the subsequent use of the credit card. Prior to defendant\u2019s trial, Chester agreed to plead guilty to one count of first degree robbery and one count of theft by deception for his part in the Scott incident and agreed to testify against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">At trial Chester testified about the events surrounding the robbery. He stated he met defendant in 1986 when they were in prison together. He admitted his involvement with defendant in the robbery, and his testimony corroborated the Scotts\u2019 recollection of the incident. He also testified that he and defendant made several purchases with James\u2019 credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Defendant testified on his own behalf and denied any involvement. He also denied doing any repair work on the Scotts\u2019 home. Defendant claimed that Chester testified against him as revenge for defendant informing jail authorities that Chester was smuggling illegal drugs into the jail while they were previously jailed on unrelated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Defendant contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a mistrial on the basis of gratuitous, prejudicial remarks made by a State witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>During direct examination, Chester was asked about his relationship with defendant. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry concerning how frequently he spoke to defendant in 1986, Chester replied quite a few times \u2014 because he and defendant were \u201clocked in the same barracks.\u201d Following objection and argument to the trial judge, defendant sought a mistrial. The judge denied the motion and gave a curative instruction to the jury. The judge then instructed the jury to \u201ctotally disregard Chester\u2019s answer\u201d to the last question and directed the jury not to consider it in deciding defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The decision on whether inadmissible evidence may be cured by a cautionary or limiting instruction or instead requires the more severe response of a mistrial \u201cis one that is peculiarly within the competence of the trial judge, who has the feel of the case and is best equipped to gauge the effect of a prejudicial comment on the jury in the overall setting.\u201d <em>State v. Winter, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>640, 646-47, 477 A.2d 323 (1984). Thus, a motion for a mistrial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Here, the judge determined that a curative instruction could solve the problem with the inadmissible evidence. The judge then gave a clear instruction for the jury to totally disregard Chester\u2019s response and not to consider it at all in judging the evidence. We find nothing in the record to support the view that the jury failed to heed the judge\u2019s instruction. Nor do we find any abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s determination to cure the problem with an instruction. In short, we find no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Defendant timely moved for a judgment of acquittal or for a new trial contending that the verdict of guilty on the first-degree kidnapping was against the weight of the evidence. He makes the same argument on appeal. Specifically, defendant argues that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>conduct was not first degree kidnapping because the victims were not confined for a substantial period of time and were released unharmed and in a safe place.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-lb provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">A person is guilty of kidnapping if he unlawfully removes another from his place of residence or business, or a substantial distance from the vicinity where he is found, or if he unlawfully confines another for a substantial period, with any of the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">1) To facilitate commission of any crime or flight thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">2) To inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize the victim or another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">3) To interfere with the performance of any governmental or political function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">Recently, in <em>State v. Soto, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 73-4, 773 A.2d 739 (App.Div.2001), we noted that \u201c[t]o support a conviction for kidnapping the confinement must be \u2018criminally significant in the sense of being more than merely incidental to the underlying crime.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. LaFrance, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>583, 594, 569 A.2d 1308 (1990)(quoting <em>State v. Masino, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>436, 447, 466 A.2d 955 (1983)). The determination of whether the confinement is substantial is not determined by its duration. <em>Ibid. </em>Rather/the jury should look at the \u201cenhanced risk of harm resulting from the confinement and isolation of the victim.\u201d <em>State v. Lyles, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 526, 677 A.2d 1137 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>460, 690 A.2d 607 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">In <em>State v. Bryant, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 80-82, 524 A.2d 1291 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>202, 528 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>978, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>490, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>488 (1987), we found that elderly victims were substantially confined when they were bound and gagged for 10 minutes because their confinement increased the risk of harm to the victims. We explained that \u201c[h]ad the victims been unable to free themselves for an extended period of time ..., there was a significant possibility of additional discomfort, physical injury or even death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 524 A.2d 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\"> Thus, it is necessary to consider \u201cwhether the nature of the confinement and the duration of the victims\u2019 isolation made them more vulnerable to harm beyond that created by the robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>itself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the victims were in their eighties and were handcuffed to facilitate Chester\u2019s flight after the robbery. In his testimony, James explained that it was difficult to move around with the handcuffs, \u201cbecause my wife, she had replacement knees and it was a little rough for her to get up faster in order to get to the door, because you see she had to walk a little backwards or sideways or so to \u2014 in order for us to get there.\u201d Furthermore, there was no one to help them if they had health problems while they were confined. <em>Ibid, </em>(explaining that \u201conce the robbers left, there would be nobody to help the bound and gagged elderly victims, if they were unable to breathe or suffered a heart attack\u201d). In our view, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the conduct in handcuffing the elderly victims enhanced the risk of harm such that the elderly victims were substantially confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In sum, giving the State the benefit of its favorable testimony as well as all reasonable inferences, <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967), we conclude that a reasonable jury could find defendant guilty of first-degree kidnapping. The jury\u2019s verdict was not a miscarriage of justice under the law. <em>See State v. Sims, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>359, 373-74, 322 A.2d 809 (1974), <em>R. </em>2:10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Defendant argues that the trial judge erred in imposing an extended term sentence and the sentence imposed was excessive. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The trial judge properly found that defendant was eligible to be sentenced as a persistent offender pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-3a. This statute provides that a sentencing court may impose an extended term on individuals who qualify as persistent offenders. The Code defines a persistent offender as an individual who \u201cat the time of the commission of the crime is 21 years of age or over, who has been previously convicted on at least two separate occasions of two crimes, committed at different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>times, when he was at least eighteen years of age....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">When imposing a discretionary extended sentence, the trial judge must follow the multi-step process set forth in <em>State v. Dunbar, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>80, 527 A.2d 1346 (1987). There, the Supreme Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">First, the sentencing court must determine whether the minimum statutory-predicates for subjecting the defendant to an extended term have been met. Second, the court, must determine whether to impose an extended sentence. Third, it must weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine the base term of the extended sentence. Finally, it must determine whether to impose a period of parole ineligibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 89, 527 A.2d 13461.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Here, the trial judge found that defendant was a persistent offender under the terms of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-3a, and defendant does not dispute this findings. Rather, defendant urges that his lesser role in the commission of the offense does not justify an extended term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">We are satisfied that the sentence complied with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice. The trial judge thoroughly analyzed and weighed the aggravating factors, against the absence of any mitigating factors. In determining that the aggravating factors substantially outweighed the non-existent mitigating factors, the trial judge precisely articulated the aggravating factors of (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(1); (2) the risk that defendant would commit another offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(3); (3) defendant\u2019s prior record, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(6); (4) the need to deter defendant and others, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1a(9); and (5) a crime against elderly people, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(12) to justify the imposition of a forty-year sentence with twenty years of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">While we harbor some concern regarding the finding of the nature and circumstances of the offense, we perceive no basis to disturb the quantum of the sentence imposed or the parole ineligibility term set. Our sentencing statute contemplates a thoughtful weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>a mere counting of one against the other. <em>State v. Scher, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 273, 650 A.2d 1012 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>276, 658 A.2d 299 (1995). The judge expressed that he placed great weight on defendant\u2019s four felony convictions and fifteen arrests. Thus, even excluding the aggravating factor of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the record supports the imposition of an extended sentence. Accordingly, the extended sentence does not represent a miscarriage of justice and does not shock the judicial conscience. <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We add one additional sentencing point. The law is clear that in imposing a discretionary extended term sentence, the sentencing judge may only impose one extended term. <em>State v. Pennington, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>344, 361, 712 A.2d 1133 (1998), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5a(2). Here, the judge imposed extended term sentences on both kidnapping convictions. Consequently, we must remand to the Law Division for the entry of an amended sentence to provide for only one extended term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions related to the State\u2019s failure to disclose evidence, the substitution of a juror, and the receipt of ineffective assistance of counsel are clearly without merit and do not require extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find no <em>Brady </em>violation in the State\u2019s failure to disclose that Chester had an outstanding traffic summons. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 <em>U.S. </em>83, 85-89, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218 (1963). In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, defendant must show that: (1) the prosecution suppressed evidence; (2) the evidence is favorable to the defense; and (3) the evidence is material. <em>State v. Martini </em>(V), 160 <em>N.J. </em>248, 268-69, 734 A.2d 257 (1999). Defendant failed to satisfy the three prongs. In addition, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in proceeding with the trial after one juror failed to appear in court on the eighth day of trial and immediately before the jury charge. The judge did not excuse the juror, but elected to proceed in the absence of one juror because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>there were still thirteen jurors. Ultimately, twelve jurors decided the case. Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure of defense counsel to request discovery concerning Chester\u2019s outstanding traffic summons. We are satisfied that defendant is unable to establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 698 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We remand to correct the sentence to provide only one extended term sentence. In all other respects we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
