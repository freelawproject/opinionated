Soke, while on patrol, observed defendant, operating a black Mitsubishi 2000, cross his lane of travel after making a left turn onto Tice\u2019s Lane. Soke noticed that the driver-side window was tinted black, preventing him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>seeing inside the vehicle. Considering the tint to constitute a significant obstruction, Soke stopped the vehicle and then observed that the passenger-side window had the same extremely dark-black tint as did the driver-side window. From his observation of the windows, Soke\u2019s concluded that the tint which was applied to the windows was an after-market product. In response to a question by Soke, defendant acknowledged that he was aware that tinted driver and passenger-side windows were illegal. Soke also ascertained that defendant was under the influence, and issued summonses for driving while intoxicated (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50; reckless driving, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-96; and obstruction of windows, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>B&amp;S-WJ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, contending that the stop was not legal. The municipal court judge denied defendant\u2019s motion, after which defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to the DWI charge. Defendant was fined $250 and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for a period of six months. On a trial <em>de novo </em>appeal, a Law Division judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that the stop was justified based upon the officer\u2019s reasonable belief that the tinted windows constituted a violation of a motor vehicle statute. Defendant raises the following point on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">THE TINTED WINDOW ON DEFENDANT\u2019S CAR DID NOT PROVIDE A REASONABLY OBJECTIVE BASIS UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT FOR STOPPING DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">A. SINCE TINTED WINDOWS DO NOT VIOLATE NEW JERSEY LAW, THERE WAS NO OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE BASIS TO STOP DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">B. BECAUSE OFFICER SOKE DID NOT CHECK TO SEE IF DEFENDANT\u2019S VEHICLE HAD A NEW JERSEY LICENSE PLATE, THERE WAS NO OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE BASIS TO STOP DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 7, of the New Jersey Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion protect citizens \u201cagainst unreasonable searches and seizures....\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. IV; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, 117. Reasonableness is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 217, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984). Investigatory stops of automobiles are justified by a reduced expectation of privacy of an occupant of an automobile. <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>543, 561, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3074, 3084-85, 49 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 1116, 1130 (1976). Generally, a police officer may stop a motor vehicle where there is a reasonable or articulable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation has occurred. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>648, 663, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1391, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>660 (1979); <em>State v. Carter, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 237, 561 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989); <em>State v. Nugent, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 534, 312 A.2d 158 (App.Div.1973); <em>State v. Griffin, </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>508, 516, 202 A.2d 856 (App.Div.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The \u201ccommunity caretaking function\u201d may also be implicated where something abnormal is observed concerning the operation of a motor vehicle. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 78, 615 A.2d 279 (App.Div.1992). In <em>Martinez, </em>a motorist was observed traveling at less than ten miles per hour in a twenty-five mile an hour zone at 4:00 a.m. We observed in <em>Martinez </em>that such abnormal conduct suggests a number of objectively reasonable concerns: (a) something might be wrong with the car; (b) something might be wrong with its driver; (c) a traffic safety hazard is presented to drivers approaching from the rear when an abnormally slow moving vehicle is operated at night on a roadway, without flashers; (d) there is some risk that the residential neighborhood is being \u201ccased\u201d for targets of opportunity. <em>Ibid. </em>We also recognized that the first three concerns triggered the \u201ccommunity caretaking function,\u201d while the fourth implicated the \u201ccommon-law right to inquire\u201d based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Defendant points out that there is a split of authority in two published Law Division opinions, <em>State v. Harrison, </em>236 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>per. </em>69, 564 A.2d 128 (Law Div.1989) and <em>State v. Oberlton, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>204, 620 A.2d 468 (Law Div.1992), concerning whether <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-74, the amended charge for which defendant was initially stopped, prohibits the use of tinted windows and can form the basis for a proper stop. He contends that tinted windows are not a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 and therefore the stop was invalid. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any sign, poster, sticker or other nontransparent material upon the ... front side windows of such vehicle other than a certificate or other article required to be so displayed by statute or by regulations of the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">No person shall drive any vehicle so constructed, equipped or loaded as to unduly interfere with the driver\u2019s vision to the front and to the sides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The defendants in <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Oberlton </em>were both stopped, based upon the observations of a police officer that the vehicles they were operating had tinted windows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After each stop, the officer found handguns and the defendants were arrested for possession without a valid permit, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-5b. In <em>Harrison, </em>the judge found that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74, which was enacted in 1921 and last amended in 1937, did not proscribe tinted windows because the technology did not emanate until years subsequent to 1937, and the Legislature had not amended the statute. <em>Harrison, supra, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 71-72, 564 A.2d 128. He also concluded that the statute only prohibits non-transparent material and does not include tinted windows, which are transparent, albeit restrictive to the ability to see into the vehicle. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Judge Steinberg came to the opposite conclusion in <em>Oberlton, </em>noting that (1) <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:20-33.6,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which specifically prohibited the use of tinted material that did not meet certain standards, became effective in 1985, and (2) 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 571.205 established federal regulations governing the use of tinted windows, which preempted conflicting state motor vehicle regulations under 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1392(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Although we use this opportunity to expressly adopt Judge Steinberg\u2019s opinion in <em>Oberlton </em>insofar as it holds that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 prohibits the use of tinted windows which fail to meet the applicable standard now set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:20-33.7, we likewise agree with his conclusion that it matters not whether the equipment used violates <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74, because the fact that a defendant is later found not guilty does not denigrate the propriety of the initial stop so long as it is based upon a reasonable articulable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation has occurred. <em>State v. Williamson, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>302, 304, 650 A.2d 348 (1994); <em>State v. Murphy, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 553-54, 570 A.2d 451 (App.Div.1990); <em>Nugent, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 534, 312 A.2d 158. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:20-33.7(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">A motor vehicle ... shall not be certified which has tinted spray or plastic material added to previously approved glazing in the front windshield or windows ... because such condition changes the vision and light transmission properties of the glazing in areas where driver visibility shall not be obscured or obstructed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Here, the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion, based upon his initial observation that the windows were so darkly tinted as to obstruct vision, was confirmed after he stopped the vehicle and determined that the side windows had been darkened by an after-market product.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">In yet a third, recently published decision, a Family Part judge expressly disagreed with the decision in <em>Oberlton </em>that tinted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>material alone can justify a motor vehicle stop. <em>In re R.M. and J.M., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 156-157, 777 A.2d 1041 (2001). Although we overrule the decision in <em>R.M. and J.M., </em>insofar as it departs from <em>Oberlton, </em>we note that the judge in <em>R.M. and J.M. </em>properly found that the circumstances of the stop he was considering were not based upon the arresting officer\u2019s reasonable articu-lable suspicion that defendant\u2019s vehicle violated the provisions of either the statute or administrative code, but instead upon a personal decision to profile and stop every vehicle with tinted windows. <em>Id. </em>at 160, 777 A.2d 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We are also satisfied that the officer\u2019s belief that the darkly-tinted windows represented a significant obstruction, even if not violative of Title 39, is a sufficient reason to implicate \u201cthe community caretaking function\u201d and permit inspection of what appears to be a hazardous vehicular condition that deviates from the norm. Whether based upon the \u201ccommunity caretaking function\u201d expected of an alert police officer or \u201cthe common law right to inquire,\u201d established by a reasonably-founded suspicion that the driver has violated a motor vehicle statute, the stop which is the subject of this appeal, when balanced against the minimal intrusion involved in a simple inquiry stop, passes constitutional muster. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 78, 615 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Defendant\u2019s remaining point, that the stop was not objectively reasonable because the officer failed to check to see if defendant was driving an out-of-state vehicle, is without merit. In <em>State v. Forgione, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 625 A.2d 557 (App.Div.1993), we pointed out the exemption afforded <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-15, which allows non-resident owners of motor vehicles registered in other states irom complying with New Jersey equipment requirements, does not preclude an officer from making a stop and requiring the driver to produce registration and driving credentials when the police officer observes an out-of-state licensed vehicle with an equipment violation. Furthermore, because the federal equipment standards apply equally to out-of-state vehicles, there is no reci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>procity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-15 to an out-of-state resident who fails to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-14\"> Originally defendant was mistakenly issued a summons for selling or using unapproved equipment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-77, which was later amended without objection to obstruction of windows, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>the vehicle had tinted windows and was stopped by a New Jersey State Trooper, whereas in <em>State v.

This section, effective November 3, 1975, essentially mirrored the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74, except that it omitted the qualifying adjective \"non-transparent,\u201d on which the judge relied.
