Appellant pled guilty to first degree murder on June 19, 1974 and was sentenced on November 4, 1974 to a term of life imprisonment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:113-1 and 2, now repealed and superceded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Appellant was initially eligible for parole in 1987. He was denied release and given a twelve-year future eligibility term (FET). He became eligible for parole again in December 1994, at which time he received a twenty-year FET. That decision was appealed to the full Board on June 20, 1994 and affirmed on August 31 of that year. Appellant then appealed to us. We remanded the matter on April 30, 1997 in light of our decision in <em>Trantino v. New Jersey State Parole Board, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 687 A.2d 274 (App.Div.1997), and ordered the Board to submit a more detailed statement of its reasons for both its denial of parole and imposition of a twenty-year FET. Pursuant to our order, on June 26, 1997, the Parole Board issued an amended notice of decision, along with a confidential addenda. The Parole Board stated that pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-2.1(a), it classified as confidential certain reports,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">because they are evaluative, diagnostic and prognostic in nature and if released to the inmate could adversely affect the inmate\u2019s rehabilitation or future delivery of rehabilitative services. Specifically, the Panel is convinced that if these evaluations are released to the inmate, at future evaluations the inmate would be aware of how certain responses given to certain questions presented by the examiner could impact the evaluation. The inmate, who has a history of being less than candid to the Parole Board regarding his motivation behind committing the offense and the facts of the offense, could potentially manipulate the results of the evaluation by reviewing past evaluations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Appellant sought release of the confidential addenda, but we denied his motion on July 23, 1997. While we understand and appreciate the Board\u2019s concerns, at this time we find it more important to disclose the confidential reports so that appellant may appreciate the extent of the evidence considered by the Board in reaching its determination. In light of the Board\u2019s intention in classifying the addenda, we find no basis for not releasing it at this time. In this opinion, we refer to several reports and evaluations contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">On May 27, 1998, we again remanded the matter in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Trantino v. New Jersey State Parole Board, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>19, 711 A.2d 260 (1998), and stated that the record was unclear as to whether there was a substantial likelihood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>appellant would commit another crime if released on parole. Appellant appeared again for a hearing before the Board and on November 6, 1998, the Board denied parole and referred the case to a three-member panel of the Parole Board for determination of an appropriate FET. On January 7, 1999, the panel established a thirty-year FET. The full Board affirmed on August 2, 1999. In this appeal, we consider the August 2,1999 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">On April 22, 1973, the nude body of a seven-year-old girl was found in the crevice of a large rock formation in Harriman State Park, New York. Her head was twisted under the left side of her body. The child had bled from the nose and had marked swelling of both eyes due to fractures of both orbits. Other injuries included lacerations of her lip and chin, a cervical fracture, dislocation of both shoulders, left temple abrasions, marked swelling in the front of the skull and three loose upper teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Three days earlier, the child had left her parents\u2019 house to deliver two boxes of Girl Scout cookies to appellant, a neighbor who lived across the street with his mother and grandmother. At the time, appellant was a twenty-seven year old high school teacher with no prior criminal record. When the child failed to return home, her parents called the police. The police spoke with appellant on two occasions. When he contradicted himself, the police requested that he take a polygraph test which he did voluntarily. After he failed the polygraph, appellant requested a priest, to whom he confessed. He confessed again to the police, and revealed the location of the child\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">PSYCHIATRIC/PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">On April 25, 1973, appellant was examined and evaluated by a psychiatrist, Noel C. Galen, M.D. Appellant reported to Dr. Galen that he was cutting the grass when the child came to deliver the Girl Scout cookies he had ordered some weeks before. When he entered the house to retrieve money, the child followed. He told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Dr. Galen that he was embarrassed because he did not have the exact amount of money for the cookies, so he grabbed the seven year old and forced her into his downstairs bedroom. When Dr. Galen asked about his motive in taking the child downstairs, appellant responded that he intended to rape her. Appellant ordered the child to remove her clothes in a \u201cloud, forceful voice.\u201d He then \u201cbecame excited enough to ejaculate\u201d two or three inches from the child, though he claimed he \u201cnever completed the [sexual] act.\u201d Rather, he claimed that he ejaculated on his fingers and fondled the child\u2019s vagina. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, however, the autopsy revealed the child suffered a ruptured hymen, severe vaginal bruising and semen traces in her vagina, indicating that appellant had penetrated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Appellant then told Dr. Galen, \u201c[A]ll of a sudden I realized what I had done----If I let her go ... my whole life was gone. All I could think of was just to get rid of her.\u201d The appellant then described the murder in detail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">... I grabbed her and started to strangle her and I dragged her off the bed, tossed her into the corner of my room on the tile floor off the rugs____She was trying to, you know, scream, and was fighting back, but of course she really couldn\u2019t, since I had my hands around her throat. Uh ... she stopped struggling. Just sort of lay there. I got dressed____I had been sweating so violently____I went out to the garage. I got some plastic bags to put her in. [Returning from the garage] I saw that she was still moving so I began strangling her again and I hit her head on the floor repeatedly. She began to bleed from the nose, mouth, face, I don\u2019t know where. There was blood all over the floor. I then grabbed one of the plastic bags and put it over her head and twisted it tightly and held it there until she stopped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Appellant then put the victim in a plastic bag, wrapped her in an old couch cover, tied the bundle with cord, placed the body in the trunk of his car and cleaned up the blood with old T-shirts. Appellant then drove approximately fifty miles to New York State and dumped the child\u2019s body down an incline in Harriman State Park. He unwrapped the body, placed it under a rock ledge and put the plastic bags and couch cover in a roadside garbage can. He then returned to his home and joined the search for the child. He later said, \u201cI felt better when I went back to the house. I slept well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>In his June 6, 1973 report, Dr. Galen related that appellant \u201chas given a well-documented history of sexual attraction to young girls. This, coupled with a clearly evident picture of a dominating and overprotective mother, would strongly hint at some profound problems in [relation] to his making a normal adjustment to an adult woman.\u201d Dr. Galen speculated that \u201cyounger girls would pose no threat to his rather shaky concept of his manhood.\u201d The psychiatrist based his opinion on appellant\u2019s admission that he had been sexually aroused by young girls for about a year prior to the murder and, more specifically, that he had been aroused by his twelve year old cousin. Appellant also admitted to both masturbation and rape fantasies and attraction to ten and eleven year old girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On May 10, 1973, psychologist Emanuel Fisher, Ph.D., administered a battery of psychological tests to appellant. Dr. Fisher reported that \u201cpsychologically,\u201d Mr. McGowan emerges as \u201can exceedingly labile, tense and hysterical personality whose tendency is to act out mood and impulse in a very explosive manner. Rational controls are weak, despite the fact that he is an exceedingly brilliant individual.\u201d Dr. Fisher found that appellant had \u201ca tremendous amount of underlying, unconscious hostility\u201d and that he \u201crepressed, avoided, sublimated, and intellectualized.\u201d Although appellant came across as \u201ca very proper, conventional, conforming individual, [t]his exaggerated propriety, conventionality and conformity, constitute his defensive facade, for himself and for others, against the underlying depression and hostility of which he is unconscious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Appellant\u2019s history of attraction to young girls, as well as repression and intellectualization, was reiterated in an October 13, 1973 neuropsychiatric report by Abraham Effron, M.D. After relating to Dr. Effron his \u201cfantasies of sexual relations with little girls,\u201d appellant recalled that while working as a summer camp counselor at age nineteen, he became sexually aroused when a particular girl sat on his lap. He also repeated a detailed description of the rape and murder to Dr. Effron.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Dr. Effron interviewed appellant\u2019s mother who related that appellant\u2019s father \u201cwas much closer to the boy [than she was] and would take him out often.\u201d His father died of a heart attack while appellant was in college. After appellant completed college, he moved back home to reside with his mother and remained there until he was arrested. Dr. Effron concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">He does not show what he necessarily feels____He conceals many facets of his complex true self and his true identification and related emotional difficulties. He tries to hide his inability to truly establish his masculinity____He experiences tension whenever he gets close to the opposite sex____This passivity generates anxiety which in turn feeds on itself and results in a higher state of tension which must expiate itself in a complete loss of self-control or sexual release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">He manages to control an underlying psychosis by intellectually holding in abeyance his primitive drives to an inordinate extent, but as in the past and tragically in the recent past, he may act out again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Eugene Revitch, M.D., evaluated appellant at the State Diagnostic Center in July 1974. Addressing the psychodynamics of the offense, Dr. Revitch determined that \u201cit was not a cold-blooded murder, but something committed in a state of extreme emotional disorganization and pressure____The killing was the consequence of an additional upset and failure due to premature ejaculation.\u201d At that time, Dr. Revitch indicated, \u201c[T]here was a degree of dissociation with use of mechanism[s] of denial.\u201d Appellant admitted to Dr. Revitch that he had rape fantasies in college which were awakened by frustration and anxiety and that \u201craping a woman would give him a feeling of being better.\u201d Dr. Revitch interviewed appellant with and without using sodium amytal (commonly known as \u201ctruth serum\u201d). There was no significant change in appellant\u2019s description of the crime while he was under the influence of the drug. The most significant effect of the sodium amytal was that appellant\u2019s affect while describing the crime remained flat and did not reflect any deep seated emotions he may have attempted to mask. Moreover, appellant did not initially reveal his sexual fantasies to Dr. Revitch as he did with previous evaluators but did so while under the influence of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Dr. Revitch concluded, \u201cWe believe these events only occur once in a lifetime of such individuals. A series of circumstances are necessary to provoke the incident. If the girl had not come to his home that day or, perhaps, if he had two dollars instead of only one dollar and a twenty dollar bill, the event would not have taken place, at least at the present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Dr. Revitch\u2019s conclusion was not completely consistent with the prior reports or with appellant\u2019s earlier admission to having a history of violent outbursts. In the past, appellant said he released his anger by \u201cbreaking something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">From 1978 to 1990, eight other reports were generated regarding appellant. All appear to be based on short interviews and indicate appellant\u2019s current status based solely upon his self-reporting. None of these reports addressed the issues raised by the early psychological evaluations nor did they discuss the details of appellant\u2019s psychological profile or treatment since incarceration. The January 27, 1987, October 13, 1988 and September 30, 1991 reports recommended him for parole and indicated that he admitted his guilt and appeared remorseful.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The next in-depth psychological evaluation was done on October 7, 1993 by Kenneth McNiel, Ph.D., Principal Clinical Psychologist at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Avenel. This evaluation was done at the request of the Parole Board to assess appellant\u2019s \u201c(1) likelihood of violent acting-out; (2) general personality profile; (3) presence/absenco of severe psychological problems; and (4) treatment program recommendations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The most significant aspect of this 1993 evaluation was appellant\u2019s denial of \u201cany history of sexual fantasies or behaviors toward children prior to or subsequent to his crime.\u201d This denial was a marked change from his 1973 admissions to Drs. Galen, Effron and Revitch. Dr. McNiel noted that, \u201c[w]hile Mr. McGowan also denied any dissociative symptoms, his discussion of the present offense was notable for brief moments in which he would blank and look away while discussing the crime, which suggested a dissociative process ____ LI]t was clearly difficult for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>concentrate on specific memories of his crime.\u201d Again, this was a significant change from the 1973 evaluations in which he described the crime in vivid detail. Dr. McNiel found \u201cno evidence to indicate Mr. McGowan is at imminent risk of violent behavior,\u201d but emphasized \u201cthat in a non-struetured community setting ... his ability to manage anger, rejection and feelings of sexual inadequacy remains open to question.\u201d Significantly, Dr. McNiel concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOt\">that Mr. McGowan has made little or no progress in fully appreciating the extent of sexual deviance and violence that is apparent in his crime. Unfortunately, it appears that he continues to primarily manage such negative aspects of himself through denial and repression, similar to the time of his crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Dr. McNiel evaluated appellant again in August and September 1998 at the request of the Parole Board. At that time, appellant was \u201cemotionally over controlled and schizoid in his demeanor.\u201d Appellant again denied his earlier admissions of rape fantasies and sexual attraction to young girls. He attributed his crime to the fact that \u201cthe victim happened to come to his home during a moment of [his] abject despair in which he had been actively planning to kill himself for weeks but had been unable to follow through with his suicide plans.\u201d When appellant saw the seven year old child delivering Girl Scout cookies, \u201che became overwhelmed with unexplainable feelings of rage____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Dr. McNiel indicated that his 1998 evaluation was generally consistent with the 1993 evaluation. He found appellant\u2019s clinical presentation that of \u201ca schizoid, chronically depressed, socially avoidant individual, with a history of impulsive rage reactions.\u201d Dr. McNiel expressed clinical concerns with appellant\u2019s \u201cpotential for dissociation at times of anger, and also the likelihood of severe sexual pathology involving pedophelia and sexual violence, which he continues to deny.\u201d Dr. McNiel found that appellant had \u201cparanoid tendencies and significant violence potential.\u201d In 1998, Dr. McNiel concluded that \u201c[g]iven Mr. McGowan\u2019s continued inability to deal with the sexual aspects of his crime, it would appear that he has made very little progress in confronting the pedophilic impulses and sexual sadism that erupted in his crime. As such, he should be considered a poor risk for parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>THE OCTOBER 1998 PAROLE BOARD HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In October 1998, the Parole Board heard nearly nine hours of testimony from appellant. During this testimony, appellant claimed that he first became aware of his depressant personality and his underlying anger at his mother in 1994. He acknowledged that this anger played a pivotal role in his crime, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t really feel that discussing this was needed.\u201d As a result, he had only received about three and one-half to four hours of therapy on the subject. The therapy he did receive regarding this anger led him to \u201crealize! ] that a lot of the anger I felt towards people ... is simply because they ... directly did something that reminded me [of my mother].\u201d He testified that he failed to discuss this with the Board in 1994 because he had not \u201crealized its total influence\u201d at that time. Although appellant admitted that his \u201coverwhelming feeling of sexual inadequacy\u201d can be traced to his mother, he had never discussed that fact in therapy. He did indicate, however, that he would \u201calways remain in therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Appellant further testified that he never realized the impact of his crime on the victim\u2019s family until he saw a commercial made by the victim\u2019s mother for a gubernatorial primary election. When he first saw the commercial, he \u201calmost threw up because it was so chilling____I hadn\u2019t seen these people ... since ... 1974, and I hadn\u2019t suspected how much it affected them, but seeing that commercial really drove it <em>home, how </em>much I had taken from them, and how much pain I had caused them.\u201d Nevertheless, appellant did not discuss his reaction to the commercial in therapy because \u201c[tjhere\u2019s nothing I can do. I cannot change that, I cannot go back and bring that little girl back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">During the hearing, appellant acknowledged that he failed to mention in any of his psychological evaluations or therapy sessions that in 1970, as a teacher, he briefly dated a sixteen year old student even though he knew it was a violation of school policy and could damage his career. Even in his October 1998 parole hearing, twenty-eight years later, appellant denied the incident until he was confronted with an article from the <em>Rockland Journal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>News </em>concerning it. He claimed that he did not want to cause problems for her. When asked why he would risk his teaching career'to date a minor, appellant stated that he now understood it was a chance to be in a \u201csuperior position\u201d to the sixteen year old student. Appellant acknowledged that he lied to prior evaluators and therapists when asked if he had dated girls under eighteen when he was an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">During the 1998 hearing, appellant also denied ever having had sexual fantasies about young girls, contrary to his earlier admissions. Other than discussing the one instance when he became aroused by watching his twelve year old cousin, appellant denied ever having spoken about any pedophilic tendencies in therapy. According to appellant, the incident involving his cousin was as a \u201cpure sexual response ... age didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Appellant testified that on the day of the murder, he had been contemplating suicide because he felt he was a total failure. \u201cMy last little success in life was my teaching, and now I had just screwed that up ---- I\u2019m not dating anyone ... I have no relationships. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I mean, here it is Easter, and most of my friends are taking off on an Easter trip, either down to Florida, or Mexico, or going somewhere, and I\u2019m sitting around doing nothing.\u201d He did not kill himself, however, because he was \u201ctoo cowardly to do it.\u201d \u201cThe doorbell rings, this poor little girl is standing there, and the thought flashes across my mind, Well, you can\u2019t kill yourself. Can you kill that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">When asked by a Board member,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">Q. What\u2019s in your mind when you let her in the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">A. Thoughts of killing her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">Q. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">A. Just because I wanted to destroy____I just wanted to kill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">When asked to discuss his earlier statements that the murder was motivated by not having the correct change to pay for the Girl Scout cookies, appellant responded that it was \u201ca total fabrication.\u201d He also testified that his 1973 admissions to Dr. Galen about pedophilic fantasies were fabricated in an attempt to gain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>admission to a sex offenders unit because he had been told that \u201cafter a few years of therapy, they let you go.\u201d When asked why he lied, appellant replied, \u201cI will say almost anything when I\u2019m scared.\u201d He admitted that he had been \u201cvery, very reticent to discuss stuff with officials,\u201d including members of the Parole Board because he was concerned his disclosures would get to the media. He said he no longer had those concerns, however, since \u201cTrantino\u2019s decision.\u201d Nevertheless, appellant was still guarded in his testimony, stating, \u201cT don\u2019t want to waste time on trivia, I mean, open up a can of beans when no one cares about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">On May 28, 1999, the Board interviewed Dr. MeNiel with respect to his examination of appellant. Dr. MeNiel explained the tests referred to in his report and the results which showed high scores for overt paranoid delusional thinking and anti-social behavior. He indicated that while appellant is in the highly structured, controlled prison environment he is stable and functions quite well. He expressed great concern, however, that appellant still remains dangerous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">On the one hand you have a horrific, emotionally charged crime and on the other hand you have an individual who had no pi-ior criminal history . .. I\u2019m seeing him twenty years after being in prison and he\u2019s got no history of the impulsive acting out, aggressive impulse control problems that perhaps would help explain the violent nature of his offense____[lit <em>seems </em>that in Mr. McGowan\u2019s case, for the last number of years he has been able to do quite well in prison, obvious[ly] prison is a highly structured and controlled environment and often ... particularly a paranoid individual, who needlsj a lot ol' external controls] ,J responded very well to systems that have rigid order and in fact in talking to Mr. McGowan he described a lifestyle which is very rigid . . he was eating ... breakfast with the same individual every day, he eats all the rest of his meals in his cell, and really his day is very scheduled and very ordered ... [H]e\u2019s very calm and very intellectualized and [exhibits] very little affect in talking to Mm .... [W]hen I first asked him about his crime he was able to talk about the general nature of the crime very easily____ But he glossed over most of the details ... I spent a lot of time confronting and asking him direct questions about specific details .. . [lit was clear after a while that this became emotionally charged for Mr. McGowan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">I would say his overall insight into his character, if you will, is at least fair ... is better due to the counseling he has had in that regard. However in terms of his insight into the crime itself, he is really still unable to explain at all things like, why a little girl as opposed to someone else, why the brutality of the murder, why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sexual assault, because he denies any history of deviant sexual fantasies that involve children ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">McNiel concluded that appellant was still dangerous and \u201cat risk for acting upon [his] anger in an unpredictable irrational way if the anger were to ever become extreme and he were in a situation where there were not immediate controls on his behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">THE NOVEMBER 1998 PAROLE BOARD DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In making its decision to deny parole, the Board relied substantially on appellant\u2019s own extensive testimony and Dr. McNiel\u2019s evaluation. The Board noted that in its 1994 decision to deny parole, it made a series of recommendations for what appellant should do prior to his next hearing. In reviewing the record since the 1994 hearing, the Board noted, \u201cyour lack of progress in reducing the likelihood of future criminal behavior since your last parole hearing in 1994, and for that matter since your arrest in 1973 is stunning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The Board then reviewed the applicable factors in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b). The Board first considered the facts and circumstances of the offense and the \u201cbrutality\u201d of the crime, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b)5, and found that appellant\u2019s lack of insight into what caused him to commit this offense was \u201cextremely disconcerting.\u201d The Board was particularly concerned that appellant had made so little progress in addressing the issues that led to the commission of the crime and expressed the opinion that the reason for minimal progress was appellant\u2019s lack of candor with the various psychologists and authorities. Notwithstanding the fact that appellant had engaged in many hours of counseling and therapy, he had received only four hours of therapy focusing on his anger at his mother, which appellant believed was a \u201cprimary motivator behind the commission\u201d of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The Board also expressed concern about appellant\u2019s admissions that he was \u201cover-intellectualizing\u201d his responses to therapists regarding issues \u201cat the crux\u201d of his criminal behavior. This was compounded by his acknowledged lack of candor with authorities and psychologists, his lying about \u201cincorrect change\u201d as motivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>for the murder, whether he masturbated prior to the killing, whether he ever had pedophilic fantasies and whether he had dated a minor while teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Board also considered whether there had been any change in appellant\u2019s attitude toward himself and others. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:7L-3.11(b)ll. Citing his lack of candor with therapists and refusal to discuss issues at the core of his criminal behavior, the Board found that appellant had shown no change in the way in which he addressed questions from both the Board and therapists since his incarceration in 1974, <em>i.e., </em>appellant continued to manipulate and intellectualize his responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In discussing appellant\u2019s mental and emotional health, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b)13, the Board opined that it was not \u201cfar different than it has been in the past, and it remains substantially likely [that appellant] would commit a crime if released on parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The Board noted that appellant had no concrete plans regarding living and working arrangements and that he had \u201cno support system beyond the prison walls.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b)14. The Board found that appellant did not have \u201ca realistic view of the problems [he] will face if paroled,\u201d nor did he have \u201can adequate plan as to how to address stressful situations\u201d given his lack of non-institutional support.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Although the Board acknowledged that appellant had \u201cremained free from serious disciplinary infractions,\u201d it believed that the preponderance of the evidence showed \u201ca substantial likelihood [he] would commit a new crime if released on parole.\u201d The Board concluded that appellant was at risk to re-offend and could not be released unless he \u201ccandidly and fully\u201d discussed those issues at the heart of his criminal behavior with a therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">In its November 6, 1998 decision, the Board referred the FET determination to a three-member panel of the Board pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.21(d). On January 7, 1999, the three-member panel largely reiterated the discussions above and addressed several other factors in explaining its imposition of a thirty-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>FET. First, because of the Appellate Division\u2019s remand of its initial decision, any FET imposed would be calculated from May 1993, not January 1999. Second, statutory credits will reduce appellant\u2019s FET if he remains free of institutional infractions. Third, since appellant is entitled to an annual review hearing as a Title 2A offender, the Board may assess appellant\u2019s progress and institute a parole hearing should his situation change.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Appellant appealed administratively to the full Board and on August 2, 1999, the full Board affirmed the November 1998 decision and the January 1999 determination of a thirty-year FET.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In our May 27,1998 remand to the Board, we directed that the Board consider the. matter in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tmntino:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">The test for parole fitness ... is whether there is a substantial likelihood the inmate will commit a crime if released on parole. Rehabilitation is relevant under that test only as it bears on the likelihood that the inmate will not again resort to crime. It need not be total or full or real rehabilitation in any sense other than there is no likelihood of criminal recidivism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\"><em>[Trantino, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 31, 711 A.2d 260.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In reviewing the Board\u2019s denial of parole, <em>Tmntino </em>directs us to focus on three inquiries: (1) whether the Board\u2019s action violates express or implied legislative policies, <em>i.e., </em>did the Board follow the law; (2) whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the findings on which the Board based its action; and (3) whether in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the Board clearly erred in reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made on a showing of the relevant factors. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 711 A.2d 260. In a later decision, <em>Trantino v. New Jersey State Parole Board, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>113, 175, 764 A.2d 940 (2001), the Supreme Court noted that the Board must apply \u201cthe statutory criteria <em>to all of the relevant evidence.\u201d </em>(quoting <em>State in the Interest of C.A.H. &amp; B.A.R., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>326, 344, 446 A.2d 93 n. 5 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Initially, we note that appellant is serving a sentence imposed under Title 2A, the predecessor to the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice now codified under Title 2C. Parole fitness, however, is governed by the Parole Act of 1979, <em>N.J.S.A. 30:4-</em>123.45 to 123.79. The current standard for Title 2A inmates involves a limited consideration of rehabilitation as it affects individual deterrence; <em>i.e., </em>whether there is a substantial likelihood that the inmate will commit a crime if released on parole. <em>Trantino, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 27, 711 A.2d 260, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.56c.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record of the 1998 hearing and the Board\u2019s decision and we find that the Board applied the <em>Trantino </em>standard in determining whether to grant appellant\u2019s parole and that it considered the applicable factors in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b). In addressing each of the applicable factors in <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:71-3.11(b), the Board specifically discussed appellant\u2019s lack of rehabilitation as it related to his likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Appellant argues that the Board applied the incorrect standard in that the Board did not consider all twenty-three of the factors enumerated in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b). He argues several additional factors which he believes prove he is unlikely to commit a new crime if released. It is appellant\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s failure to address all of the factors, by itself, amounts to the application of an incorrect standard. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">There is no requirement for the Board to consider each and every factor enumerated in the Administrative Code. Rather, the Board must consider the factors applicable in each case. Here, the Board acknowledged that appellant had adjusted well to the institutional setting and that he had no significant disciplinary infractions. It also noted the several reports that recommended appellant for parole prior to 1994. As noted previously, however, those reports were not based on in-depth interviews or evaluations and were made by staff who lacked access to confidential data.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>We disagree as well with appellant\u2019s claim that the Board lacked sufficient evidence to support its denial of parole. As with any administrative decision, a parole determination, may not be disturbed if the Board\u2019s findings are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>evidence furnishing a reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s action. <em>Zachariae v. Division of Real Estate Comm., </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>60, 62, 146 A.2d 491 (App.Div.1958). There is more than sufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood the inmate will commit a crime if released on parole.\u201d <em>Trantino, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 31, 711 A.2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">We need not repeat here what we have detailed previously in this opinion. Suffice it to say that the testimony and report of Dr. McNiel is consistent with appellant\u2019s own testimony and it is his own testimony that is most revealing with respect to his lack of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending. We were particularly struck with his testimony that he lied in the 1973 evaluations with respect to his motive for the crime and by his statement that, \u201cI will say almost anything when I am scared.\u201d We were struck, as well, by his testimony that he fabricated pedophilic fantasies so he could be placed in a sex offender\u2019s unit and be released after a few years of therapy. Given appellant\u2019s admission that he has lied repeatedly over the years, how can any of his assertions be deemed reliable? Based on appellant\u2019s own testimony, a \u201creasonable mind\u201d could find the evidence sufficient to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that appellant is substantially likely to commit another crime if released. In reviewing all of the evidence, we conclude that it was sufficient to support the Board\u2019s finding that appellant has made no substantial progress in addressing the issues that led him to murder the child in 1973: he has regressed in that he now denies his earlier pedophelic fantasies and tendencies, he has lied and manipulated evaluators, played \u201cword games\u201d during parole hearings, and demonstrated a substantial risk for recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Where the Board has applied the correct legal standard, a reviewing court is limited to determining whether the denial of parole was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. See <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-580, 410 A.2d 686 (1980). Administrative actions, such as parole decisions, must be upheld where the findings could reasonably have been reached on the credible evidence in the record. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., 44 N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). A court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency, <em>In re Polk License Revocation, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>550, 578, 449 A.2d 7 (1982), and an agency\u2019s exercise of its statutorily-delegated responsibilities is accorded a strong presumption of reasonableness. <em>Newark v. Natural Resource Council in Dept. Env. Prot., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>530, 539, 414 A.2d 1304, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>983, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>245 (1980). The burden of showing that an action was arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious rests upon the appellant. <em>Barone v. Dept. of Human Serv., Div. of Med. Asst., </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 285, 509 A.2d 786 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>355, 526 A.2d 1055 (1987). Appellant has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The Parole Board has broad but not unlimited discretionary powers in reviewing an inmate\u2019s record and rendering a release decision. <em>Monks v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>238, 242, 277 A.2d 193 (1971). The Board is directed by statute not to release a prisoner merely as a reward for good conduct, but only where there is a reasonable probability that he will rejoin society without violating the law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u201cParole Board determinations are highly \u2018individualized discretionary appraisals,\u2019 and ... should not be reversed by a court unless found to be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Trantino, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 711 A.2d 260, <em>quoting Beckworth v. State Parole Board, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>348, 359, 301 A.2d 727 (1973). The test is essentially whether there was a rational basis for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Appellant argues that he has been a model inmate for almost 30 years. His behavior within the highly structured controlled prison environment, however, is not as significant as his own admissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>during his testimony that he repeatedly lied during his evaluations, that he had only begun to address his anger in 1994 and that he still had little appreciation for the nature of his crime. The Board\u2019s finding that appellant had made little or no progress in understanding or addressing the deep-seated psychological bases for his violent rape and murder of a seven year old child is well documented in the record and the Board\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Appellant argues that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.21(a) establishes a Future Eligibility Term of twenty-seven months which may be expanded to thirty-six months pursuant to part (c) of that section, that the pre-July 1999 code applies to him, and that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.21(d), effective prior to June 7,1999,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">A three-member Board panel may establish a future parole eligibility date which differs from that required by the provisions of (a) or (b) and (c) above if the future parole eligibility date which would be established pursuant to such subsections is clearly inappropriate in consideration of the circumstances of the crime, the characteristics and prior criminal record of the inmate and the inmate\u2019s institutional behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The pre-July 1999 code does apply to appellant. His interpretation of it is incorrect, however. He argues that before the Board can extend the FET beyond thirty-six months, it is required to find evidence of all three factors: (1) the circumstances of the crime; (2) his characteristics and prior criminal record; and (3) his institutional record. He claims that his \u201cclean\u201d institutional record for almost thirty years requires the Board to limit his FET to twenty-seven months. We do not agree. Nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>superceded code requires the Board to make findings on all three factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\"><em>Trantino </em>clarified the requirement that the Board focus its attention squarely on the likelihood of recidivism. That focus applies to the FET determination as well. Moreover, as the Panel noted, any FET it imposed would be measured from the Board\u2019s original decision in May 1993. The Panel noted further that, given appellant\u2019s clean infractional record, it is likely that his FET will be reduced over time resulting in a possible release date of 2010. Since appellant is entitled to an annual hearing as a Title 2A offender, the Board may assess his progress and institute a parole hearing should he show significant changes in his response to psychiatric treatment. <em>See Trantino supra, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 687 A.2d 274. The decision to impose a thirty-year FET is within the Board\u2019s discretion and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">We have carefully reviewed the extensive record before us and conclude that the Board was neither arbitrary nor capricious in denying appellant\u2019s parole and setting a thirty-year FET. The Board met its obligations under <em>Trantino </em>in (1) following the law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.45; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11(b); and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.21(d); (2) basing its decision on substantial credible evidence; and (3) applying the relevant legislative policies to the facts. We, therefore, affirm in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.21(d) was amended, effective July 7, 1999, to allow the Board to extend an FET \"due to the inmate\u2019s lack of satisfactory progress in reducing the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\u201d The amendment was intended to give the Board a broader basis for its FET determinations rather than limiting the panel to the consideration of only three factors. The prior code provision was \"deemed restrictive and, therefore, inappropriate.\u201d 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>710 (March 15, 1999). Instead, the panel is now permitted \"to consider all the factors enumerated in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:71-3.11.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The language in the amended code provision mirrors the <em>Trantino </em>holding and is meant to guide the Parole Board in making a decision under the <em>Trantino </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
