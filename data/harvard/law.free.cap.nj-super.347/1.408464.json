Plaintiff claims he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to let his expert witness refer to a pamphlet provided by the manufacturer of the valve, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>outlining the proper method for its installation. That ruling, plaintiff argues, which followed questioning by defense counsel designed to indicate that there was no professional literature which supported the expert\u2019s position, left the jury with the impression that plaintiffs expert was a \u201clone wolf\u2019 with respect to his position and that there was no professional support for his thesis. Plaintiff contends his expert should have been permitted to refer to the pamphlet under the Learned Treatise provision of the Rules of Evidence, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18), particularly after defendant had raised the issue. We agree, and accordingly we reverse and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In October 1991, plaintiff underwent surgery for implantation of a prosthetic mitral valve, which regulates the flow of blood in the heart between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The surgery was performed by defendant, Dr. Lynn McGrath, and the replacement valve was manufactured by St. Jude Medical, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">During the years following the surgery, plaintiff continued to have cardiac problems related to the mitral valve. In August 1996, he underwent corrective surgery and in January 1999, he had still more surgery. According to plaintiff, he nevertheless remains disabled. His contention is that all the problems following the initial surgery stemmed from defendant\u2019s faulty surgical technique, which improperly anchored the valve into his heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s expert trial witness was Dr. James Finnegan. He testified that proper implantation technique is to sew the replacement mitral valve to the annulus, a fibrous portion of the heart which lies at the base of the mitral valve and is the seating mechanism which holds the valve in place. Defendant, however, did not attach the mitral valve to the annulus, but rather stitched it to adjoining parts of the heart known as leaflets. According to Dr. Finnegan, the annulus \u201cis a little thicker, a little fibrous,\u201d whereas the leaflets</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">are quite thin and very floppy and pliable, if you will, normally. They\u2019re meant to do almost like sort of a parachute effect, so they have to be soft and moveable, okay? The annulus is part of what anatomists would call the fibrous skeleton of the heart. In other words, it\u2019s the base anchor tissue in \u2014 built inside the heart to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>hold everything in place. So, the annulus generally has some firmness and structure to it, whereas the leaflets tend to be soft and mobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">As Dr. Finnegan described attaching the mitral valve to the annulus, the stitches are \u201cput in place all around that ring, all around that annulus,\u201d and when the surgeon is finished, \u201cyou now have this valve sitting, sewn snugly into that annulus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Dr. Finnegan was next asked if there were \u201ccircumstances where sewing the valve not to the annulus but solely to the leaflets is appropriate.\u201d He responded that such a procedure would be appropriate in only \u201cvery rare circumstances\u201d where the annulus was \u201cfilled with calcium.\u201d In plaintiffs case, however, that did not exist and thus there was no reason not to attach the valve to the annulus.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">After that testimony, Dr. Finnegan was asked whether he had an opinion \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as to what the standard of care required with regard to implantation of mitral heart valve in October 1991\u201d? He answered that he did have such an opinion, and when he was then asked what that opinion was, he began to respond by saying, \u201cI think, if you \u2014 my opinion is that the valve should be sewed to the annulus. And, the reason I say that is, if you look at any textbook \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">At that point, defense counsel objected. He said that during pre-trial depositions Dr. Finnegan had been asked whether his opinion depended on any particular textbook or treatise in the field. His response had been equivocal, and he had said, \u201cI certainly could do that if asked,\u201d but he continued by saying that his conclusion was \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d in the field. When he had then been asked essentially the same question a second time, he had responded that, \u201cI don\u2019t recall ... that I have specifically referred to specific literature in my report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">In view of that pre-trial testimony, defense counsel\u2019s objection at trial when Dr. Finnegan began to say, \u201cIf you look at any textbook ...,\u201d was understandable. He argued that Dr. Finnegan should not be permitted to volunteer the name of a textbook or treatise that supported his opinion, when during deposition he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>not provided the title of any such work. After some colloquy between court and counsel, the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Had the matter ended there, plaintiff would have had no basis to complain. However, the matter did not end there. Instead, defense counsel set out to demonstrate that Dr. Finnegan\u2019s opinion was not supported by any authority except his own subjective notion of the best way to proceed. He asked the witness about standards that may have been promulgated by two thoracic surgical societies. Dr. Finnegan responded that those standards supported his position, but he acknowledged that he did not have copies of the standards with him. Defense counsel then asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">There is no place, is there, Doctor, that Dr. McGrath (the defendant) can go or the jury can go and say, ah-ha, here\u2019s the American College of Cardio Thoracic <em>Surgeons </em>and <em>here\u2019s the </em>standard they put forth, and you\u2019ve got to sew to the annulus? There is no place that that exists; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">To that, Dr. Finnegan replied, \u201cOh, yes, it does. And I have a document which I provided.\u201d Dr. Finnegan then said he was referring to the Technical Guide for Prosthetic Mitral Heart Valves published by St. Jude\u2019s, the manufacturer of the device used by the defendant, which specified that the valve should be sewn to the annulus rather than the leaflets. Defense counsel objected to any reference to the St. Jude\u2019s publication. When the court indicated an inclination to sustain the objection, plaintiffs counsel argued that the question from his adversary had suggested there were no published standards respecting installation of the mitral valve. He then said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">The implication has been made now that he\u2019s [Dr. Finnegan\u2019s] a lone wolf out there, that there\u2019s nowhere that one can go and see in print what he is advocating. And the facts are that St. Jude\u2019s themselves offers a guide that physicians and the (inaudible) itself says, you can suture to the annulus. There\u2019s actually a section of the guide that shows the suturing placement of the mitral valve in the annulus. So in response to Mr. Veenstra\u2019s [defense counsel\u2019s] questions about where is his opinion backed up with literature, this is the answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then noted that he had provided the St. Jude\u2019s Guide to his adversary some time ago. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">It\u2019s probably the most relevant information this jury could receive. And, given that he\u2019s |defense counsel\u2019s] opened up the door to the whole subject of \u201cwhat does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the literature say,\u201d I think this jury would be prejudiced if they didn\u2019t know that St. Jude\u2019s themselves have published a guide for how you do the surgery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The court, however, did not accept the argument. It responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">I disagree. Counsel [that is, defense counsel] did not open the door to what literature is out there or what literature exists. The only piece of literature that was referenced on direct examination \u2014 the only documentation put forth was the American College of Cardio Thoracic Surgeons. He has a right to ask whether he has that report but____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">And, the court continued, \u201cThe only thing he\u2019s [defense counsel\u2019s] asked about is the American College of Cardio Thoracic Surgeons, which he mentioned on his direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The argument continued in that vein, with no change in the court\u2019s ruling. Plaintiffs counsel pointed out that the St. Jude\u2019s document had been available to defense counsel just as it had been available to plaintiffs counsel. He added that the document \u201cspeaks directly to the issue before this jury of the standard of care. I am holding in my hands a guide put out by the manufacturer of the device on which the manufacturer says, this is how you go about anchoring it, namely to the annulus.\u201d Defense counsel responded that he was \u201cvery careful with saying that American Society of Cardio Thoracic Surgeons\u201d in his question, and he insisted that plaintiffs answer be limited to printed material from that source and no other. Plaintiffs counsel responded that, in that event, and to avoid the distorted picture he had referred to earlier \u2014 he wanted to have Dr. Finnegan discuss the St. Jude\u2019s instruction manual on re-direct examination. The court rejected that request, and Dr. Finnegan\u2019s cross-examination ended with the following question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">The question was, do you have any standards from your American College of Cardio Thoracic Surgeons which would suggest to the jury that the basis of your opinion is based on that, that says you have to sew it to the annulus and not to the leaflet? Do you have it with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">A. I do not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">The prior rulings, of course, precluded Dr. Finnegan from supplementing that answer to provide a more realistic picture, by referring to the St. Jude\u2019s brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>We agree with plaintiff that the court\u2019s ruling may well have left the jury with the incorrect impression that there were no objective standards pertaining to installation of a prosthetic mitral valve, and that Dr. Finnegan\u2019s opinion rested on nothing but his own subjective impression. While defense counsel, for obvious tactical reasons, phrased his question very narrowly and specifically-limiting it to the thoracic societies and excluding the manufacturer of the valve \u2014 there was no reason why Dr. Finnegan should not have been able to expand his answer, at least on re-direct examination, to provide a more accurate, fully rounded picture, than was presented by the limited question and limited answer pertaining to the thoracic societies. The court provided no such reason, nor do we see any reasonable basis for the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18) deals with the admissibility of statements contained in \u201cLearned Treatises.\u201d While the rule is captioned, \u201cLearned Treatises,\u201d it actually covers publications beyond what one might normally think of as a \u201ctreatise.\u201d It refers to \u201cstatements contained in published treatises, periodicals or pamphlets on a subject of ... medicine ... established as a reliable authority by testimony or by judicial notice.\u201d Certainly the pamphlet here, composed and provided by the manufacturer of St. Jude\u2019s prosthetic mitral valve, instructing as to the means of installation and the anchoring of that valve, falls squarely within the <em>rule </em>provision. Its status as a \u201creliable authority\u201d seems so self-evident as to be properly the subject of judicial notice, or, alternatively, there is no doubt that Dr. Finnegan would have testified to that effect. <em>See Morlino v. Med. Ctr. of Ocean Cty., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>563, 578-82, 706 A.2d 721 (1998), holding that package inserts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers and references in the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference were admissible in medical malpractice cases, in conjunction with expert testimony explaining the significance of the material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Defendant\u2019s argument against use of the St. Jude\u2019s manual rests on three claims, none of which we find persuasive. First, defendant notes that during his pre-trial deposition, Dr. Finnegan did not say he had \u201crelied on\u201d the St. Jude\u2019s material in reaching his expert opinion. That is true. However, it is also true that Dr. Finnegan indicated there were written standards which supported his position, and he offered to provide them if requested. And again, we note the limited proposed use of the printed material at trial. Neither plaintiffs counsel nor Dr. Finnegan referred to the printed material during Dr. Finnegan\u2019s direct testimony. Neither claimed that the doctor relied on that material in formulating his opinion. Rather, the subject arose, and reference to the material became critical, only after defense counsel had argued that there were no such standards which provided any support for Dr. Finnegan\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Second, defendant argues that the court properly barred plaintiffs attempt to discuss the St. Jude\u2019s material on re-direct examination because it had not been mentioned on direct examination. That argument, however, is circular: it ignores the fact that a basic purpose of re-direct examination is to respond to new material elicited during cross-examination of a witness. <em>See State v. Marshall, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>89, 168-69, 690 A.2d 1 (1997). That is precisely what plaintiff was attempting to do here and, even assuming the propriety of precluding Dr. Finnegan from mentioning the St. Jude\u2019s material during his cross-examination, we can .see no conceivable reason why he should not have been permitted to do so on re-direct examination in order to correct an otherwise inaccurate impression which may have been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Defendant\u2019s third argument against use of the St. Jude\u2019s printed material cites the language of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18), which refers to using such material \u201c[t]o the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>expert in direct examination.\u201d Defendant argues that neither basis for admission existed here: that the material was not \u201ccalled to the attention of [Dr. Finnegan] upon cross-examination\u201d; nor was it \u201crelied upon by [him] in direct examination.\u201d We are satisfied, however, that a realistic and common sense reading of the rule does not require the artificially narrow construction which defendant would give to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We have already noted that, notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s carefully chosen language during cross-examination, the intent and effect of that language was to bring \u201cto the attention of [the] expert witness\u201d the subject of printed material, and convey the impression that there was no such material that supported Dr. Finnegan\u2019s position. Unfortunately, when the court insisted that Dr. Finnegan answer defense counsel\u2019s question in the same restrictive language that counsel used in framing the question, the effect was to create a seemingly accurate answer, which in fact provided a very inaccurate picture. For the reasons already discussed, a fair, realistic and truly accurate response to the question would have permitted Dr. Finnegan to include in his answer a reference to the St. Jude\u2019s pamphlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Finally, we note defendant\u2019s claim that the St. Jude\u2019s material was submitted to him too late to comply with discovery obligations, and therefore it should not have been admitted at trial. That argument, however, has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">As far back as November 1997 \u2014 over two years before trial \u2014 plaintiff had provided defense counsel with the twenty-three page booklet entitled, \u201cPhysician\u2019s Manual, St. Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve,\u201d which contained the material described above relating to St. Jude\u2019s \u201cmechanical heart valve [which] is intended for use as a replacement valve in patients with a diseased, damaged or malfunctioning aortic or mitral heart valve.\u201d However, as the trial date approached, plaintiff\u2019s counsel realized that the manual he had provided bore a 1995 copyright date, which post-dated the 1991 surgery. He then set out to locate the counterpart of the 1995 brochure which had been in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>time of the 1991 surgery. As a result, he located and transmitted to his adversary the earlier version of that manual \u2014 a forty-three page manual entitled, \u201cPhysician\u2019s Manual, St. Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve,\u201d as well as additional related material. That material bore a 1988 copyright date and was in effect at the time of plaintiff\u2019s surgery in 1991. It was delivered approximately two weeks before trial. In substance, it was virtually indistinguishable from the 1995 version which had been provided to defense counsel two years earlier. Thus, the alleged late delivery was more apparent than real. It was non-prejudicial and there is no suggestion or argument that the updating of the material caused any prejudice of any kind to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">For all these reasons, we are satisfied that substantial justice required that plaintiff be permitted to present testimony concerning the St. Jude\u2019s written material, to offset and avoid what would otherwise be an inaccurate and prejudicial misapprehension with which the jury might be left: that there was no respectable published material, from an objective, impartial source, which supported Dr. Finnegan\u2019s opinion. The exclusion of that material rested on what we conceive to be an unrealistically narrow reading of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18), and also an unrealistically narrow interpretation of the critical question which defense counsel put to Dr. Finnegan as part of his suggestion that there was \u201cno place that ... [the defendant doctor] or the jury can go\u201d to find the standard to which Dr. Finnegan referred. In fact, there was such a place and there was such material, and it should have been presented to the jury. Its exclusion affected a critical part of this case, and there is no basis on which we could conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Accordingly we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18) provides that printed statements meeting the criteria of the rule are not to be \"received as exhibits\" but may be \"read into evidence.\" Here, that would certainly have satisfied plaintiff\u2019s purpose, of rebutting defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>dant's claim that there were no written professional standards concerning implantation of the artificial mitral valve.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
