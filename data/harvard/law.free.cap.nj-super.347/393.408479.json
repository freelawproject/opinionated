The parties had stipulated that the court should apply the Child Support Guidelines set forth in Appendix IX of the Court Rules, and defendant does not object to the court\u2019s use of those guidelines. Rather, he argues that the court misapplied them and, as properly applied, they should lead to an award of just $13 per week rather than $60 per week. We are not satisfied that defendant\u2019s number is correct, but we do believe the matter must be remanded to enable the court to explain its reasoning in applying the guidelines and, if necessary, modifying the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">The parties were married in 1973. The plaintiff wife\u2019s complaint for divorce was filed on April 14, 1998, and the twenty-four day trial referred to began on October 20,1999, and concluded on January 27, 2000. In a sixty-seven page written opinion, the court made extensive rulings respecting equitable distribution, custody, alimony and child support. The judgment embodying the findings and conclusions in the opinion encompassed nineteen pages and was entered on June 20,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The parties have two children, Bridget who was twenty at the time of the divorce, and Chip who was sixteen. Bridget was attending college and the court\u2019s ruling contained no provision respecting child support for Bridget.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Chip\u2019s custody was the subject of lengthy dispute at trial. Ultimately, the court accepted the recommendation of a court appointed psychologist and directed that Chip should live with his mother and his father for an equal number of days each year. During school months, he was to spend one week with one parent and then, on Friday evening, he would move to the other parent and spend the next week with that person. On vacations and during the summer, he would, again, spend the same number of days and nights with each parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Defendant is an attorney and his annual income was the subject of dispute at trial. Ultimately, the court concluded that his pretax net income was $100,000 per year, and the comparable figure for plaintiff was $60,000 per year. The court awarded plaintiff permanent alimony of $300 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">As noted, the parties had stipulated that child support should be computed according to the Child Support Guidelines. In its opinion, the court referred to those Guidelines and set out a summary of its calculations. It also attached to the opinion completed worksheets on which it set out the figures it employed in its calculations, showing how it arrived at its net calculation of $60 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The court employed formulations based on what the Guidelines term \u201cShared Parenting Arrangements,\u201d (see Paragraph 14 to Appendix IX-A), which are designed for application when a child spends different amounts of time with each of his or her parents. They are premised on the fact that, \u201ceach parent incurs expenses for the child while the child is with that parent.\u201d See Paragraph 14a. In applying the shared parenting formula, however, a critical first step is a designation of each parent as either the Parent of Primary Residence (PPR) or the Parent of Alternate Residence (PAR). As the Guidelines note, \u201cEither the PPR or the PAR may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>be the obligor of the support order depending on income and the time spent with the child. The designation of PPR and PAR is not related to the gender of either parent or the legal designation of custodial parent.\u201d See Paragraph 14b. The guidelines then set out a definition for PPR and PAR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">(1) Parent of Primary Residence (PPR)-The parent with whom the child spends most of Ms or her overnight time. The primary residence is the home where the child resides for more than 50% of the overnights annually. If the time spent with each parent is equal (50% of overnights each), the PPR is the parent with whom the child resides while attending school____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">(2) Parent of Alternate Residence (PAR)-This is the parent with whom the child resides when not living in the primary residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Those definitions of PPR and PAR, quite clearly, cannot be applied to this case. The most significant aspect of the court\u2019s custody determination was a precise equality of custodial time between plaintiff and defendant. Since the designations of PPR and PAR are premised on one parent having greater custodial time than the other, the normal definition simply does not work here. Even with the alternate, fall back, position set out in the rule \u2014 when total time is equal, the PPR is the parent with whom the child resides while attending school \u2014 is inapplicable since school nights are also equally divided between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Under the Guidelines, the designation of PPR and PAR is not an insignificant matter. It has tangible, monetary effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">A critical number in applying the Guidelines formula is what is termed the \u201cbasic child support amount.\u201d That figure is provided in a table (Appendix IX F) entitled \u201cSchedule of Child Support Awards,\u201d which sets out various amounts as representing the \u201ccombined net weekly income\u201d of a child\u2019s two parents, and then provides a \u201cbasic child support amount for a single child whose parents have a specified \u2018combined net weekly income.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>case, converting the parties\u2019 combined annual income ($160,000) into weekly amounts produces a total combined net weekly income of $2,067. For that amount, the Guidelines schedule reflects a \u201cbasic child support amount\u201d of $354 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Paragraph 14 of the Guidelines explanation, which deals with shared parenting calculations, contains a subparagraph g entitled, <em>\u201cAssumptions of the Shared-Parenting Adjustment.\u201d </em>That provision notes that the \u201cbasic child support amount\u201d set out in the Guidelines (here $354 per week) actually consists of \u201cthree broad consumption categories ... as follows: 38% [represents] fixed expenses, 37% [represents] variable expenses, and 25% [represents] controlled expenses.\u201d The provision then notes the \u201cassumption\u201d that \u201cfixed expenses\u201d and \u201cvariable expenses\u201d each represent payments which must be met, to a greater or lesser extent, by both the PPR and the PAR. Significantly, however, that is not true of \u201ccontrolled expenses,\u201d which represent 25% of the \u201cbasic child support amount.\u201d With respect to that item, the Guidelines say this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">Controlled expenses are incurred by the PPR only and, thus, are apportioned between the parents based on their income shares, not in relation to lime spent with the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The theory of that \u201cassumption\u201d \u2014 that \u201ccontrolled costs\u201d will be incurred by the PPR only and not by the PAR \u2014 is spelled out in subparagraph f of Paragraph 14 of the Guidelines explanation, which describes \u201ccontrolled costs\u201d as costs \u201cover which the PPR, as the primary caretaker of the child, has direct control. This category includes clothing, personal care, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses.\u201d The assumption that \u201ccontrolled expenses\u201d are \u201cincurred by the PPR only\u201d is consistent with the premise of the Guidelines, that the child will spend more time with the PPR than with the PAR. On that basis, it is probably reasonable to assume that the PPR would indeed incur expenses for \u201cclothing, personal care, entertainment and miscellaneous items,\u201d not incurred by the PAR. However, when both parents have the child an equal amount of time, we can see no rational basis for any such assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>As noted, the court included with its opinion a copy of the \u201cShared Parenting Worksheet\u201d it completed in reaching its conclusion that defendant should pay $60 per week in child support. Tracing the court\u2019s computation on that worksheet, along with the instructions in the Guidelines for completing the worksheet, demonstrates that the court correctly performed the required mathematical computations. It set out the respective incomes of the parties and then adjusted them to reflect $300 per week in alimony paid by defendant to plaintiff. It computed the total joint weekly income of the parties ($2067), and also calculated that the defendant\u2019s income represented 52.35% of that amount and plaintiffs 47.65%. It then applied those figures to the \u201cbasic child support amount\u201d of $354 and made appropriate adjustments to reflect the parties\u2019 shared obligations for \u201cfixed expenses\u201d and \u201cvariable expenses.\u201d As directed by the Guidelines, and consistent with the format of the worksheet, however, the court made no such adjustment for \u201ccontrolled expenses\u201d since they are presumed to be obligations of the PPR (plaintiff) and not the PAR (defendant). On that basis, the court reached its conclusion that the appropriate weekly child support was $60.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The significance of designating plaintiff as PPR, and thus affording her the benefit of a presumption that she will bear all the \u201ccontrolled expenses\u201d respecting Chip\u2019s support (25% of $354) can be demonstrated in two ways. First, note that, since \u201ccontrolled expenses\u201d are assumed to be 25% of the \u201cbasic child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>support amount,\u201d and here the \u201cbasic child support amount\u201d is $354, 25% thereof is approximately $88. If we bear in mind that the two parties will have Chip with them for an equal amount of time, and if, on that basis, we discard the assumption that the wife will bear the full cost of Chip\u2019s \u201cclothing, personal care, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses,\u201d then it would follow that in completing the worksheet calculations to compute defendant\u2019s support obligation, he should receive an additional deduction of $44 (one-half of $88) which would have the effect of reducing the $60 per week child support figure to $16 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Second, if we complete the same worksheets as the court completed here, and use the same figures and calculations as the court employed, but we substitute defendant as the PPR and plaintiff as the PAR \u2014 the result is that <em>plaintiff </em>would be obligated to pay child support to her ex-husband in the sum of approximately $33 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In short, the differences which result from two possible designations of PPR and PAR in this case are substantial indeed. And while there may be bona fide reasons why plaintiff should be designated as PPR and defendant as PAR, those reasons are not apparent from the record submitted to us, nor from the court\u2019s otherwise carefully constructed, comprehensive opinion. We do note that the cotirt assigned different responsibilities to the two parties respecting different aspects of Chip\u2019s life. However, with one minor exception, no financial responsibility was assigned with those responsibilities. Thus, consistent with the recommendation of the psychologist who testified in the matter, the court directed that plaintiff would have \u201cprimary decision-making\u201d regarding \u201cChip\u2019s health, including medical, psychological and psychiatric treatment\u201d; that defendant would have \u201cprimary decision-making regarding Chip\u2019s after school and athletic activities, including music lessons\u201d; that plaintiff would have \u201cprimary decision-making regarding items relating to Chip\u2019s high school education and religious activities and education\u201d; and defendant would have such decision-making authority \u201cregarding Chip\u2019s college education.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In addition, in the only demarcation of responsibility which included a specification of financial obligation, the court determined that the parties should pay equally for Chip\u2019s medical insurance, but plaintiff should pay the first $250 of any un-reimbursed expenses in a given year, with defendant to pay 53% of any additional amount and plaintiff to pay the remaining 47%. Since that $250 represents approximately $5 per week, it would not seem likely that the court would have determined, on that basis alone, to designate plaintiff as PPR and thus entitle her to the much more substantial benefits which flow from that designation. There is also some indication that, when defendant raised the PPR versus PAR designation issue in the trial court, plaintiffs attorney claimed that plaintiff was obliged to purchase Chip\u2019s clothing, and that obligation represented a justification for the PPR designation. Defendant, however, quite accurately responded that neither the court\u2019s opinion nor its judgment included any such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Finally, we note defendant\u2019s argument that the court should not have employed the guidelines dealing with \u201cshared parenting arrangements\u201d at all, but rather should have used the Guidelines designed for what are termed \u201csplit-parenting arrangements.\u201d The \u201csplit-parenting\u201d provisions, however, deal with a multi-child family in which one parent has custody of one or more children, and the other parent has custody of other children. We see no rational basis for attempting to squeeze this case into that pigeonhole since the two, quite obviously, are not designed to go together.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In fact, the \u201cshared-parenting\u201d guidelines seem appropriate and easily applicable to this case, provided only that the court accounts for and makes an appropriate adjustment to reflect the unusual facts respecting selection of a PPR and PAR. On remand, if the court has additional reasons for its designation of plaintiff as PPR and defendant as PAR, it should set out those considerations and its reasoning in that respect, for the enlightenment of the parties and, if necessary, this court. If that is not the case, the court should not hesitate to make an appropriate adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ment to correct what otherwise would seem to be an injustice in applying the Guidelines without accounting for the unusual fact of the equal custody time between the two parents. Dividing the \u201ccontrolled expenses\u201d between the parties or designating both parents as PPR, would seem rational methods of accomplishing that end, although, if the court has some alternative which it deems more desirable, it should not feel preempted from employing such a device. Despite the agreement of the parties to use the Guidelines, the court should not feel constrained from varying the method of applying the Guidelines in order to accomplish the underlying purpose of our family law jurisprudence, the rules of procedure and the Guidelines themselves: effecting substantial justice between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The schedule actually has six vertical columns, specifying \u201cbasic child support amounts\" depending on whether the family consists of one, two, three, four, five or six children. Here, of course, we are concerned only with one child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> In fact, the court completed two separate worksheets. In the first, it assumed that defendant would receive two income tax deductions and plaintiff one. On that basis, the worksheet calculations produced a child support obligation of $55 per week, to which the court then added an additional 14.6% because Chip was over fifteen years of age. Thus the total support obligation, on that basis, come to $63.03.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">The court then performed an alternate calculation premised on plaintiff receiving the two income tax deductions (for herself and Chip), and defendant receiving just one. On that basis, and including the 14.6% adjustment, the court reached a calculation of $57.30. It concluded that it was \"appropriate to average these two figures,\u201d which thus produced the court's final total of $60 per week.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
