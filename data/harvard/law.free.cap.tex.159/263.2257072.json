Also in failing to hold that there was no evidence of probative force that there had been sufficient compliance with the provisions of the Texas Probate Code to make the alleged nuncupative will of deceased a valid will.

Hargis. Petitioner, widow of the testator, contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The will was admitted to probate in the County Court. On appeal to the District Court, the matter was submitted to a jury on certain special issues which were answered in favor of respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On motion duly made, the District Court rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and entered judgment non obstante veredicto, denying the application to probate the will. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s judgment and rendered judgment admitting the will to probate. 311 S.W. 2d 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As indicated by the issues submitted to the jury, the will which respondent seeks to probate purports to dispose only of corporate stock in Hargis-Austin, Inc., with its principal offices in Austin, Texas, and in Hargis Company, Inc., with offices in Waco, Texas, Special Issue No. 1 also shows the nature and extent of the bequests which respondent claims were made. The value of the stock is in excess of $30.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Petitioner assigns a number of reasons why the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals admitting the will to probate is erroneous. The principal reason assigned is that the evidence offered to prove the terms of the will does not meet the requirements of Sections 65 and 86(c) of the Texas Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Section 65 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201cNo nuncupative will shall be established unless it be made in the time of the last sickness of the deceased, at his home or where he has resided for ten days or more next preceding the date of such will, except when the deceased is taken sick away from home and dies before he returns to such home; nor when the value exceeds Thirty Dollars, unless it be proved by three credible witnesses that the testator called on a person to take notice or bear testimony that such is his will, or words of like import.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Section 86(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\">\u201cWhen the value of the estate exceeds Thirty Dollars, a nuncupative will must be proved by three credible witnesses that the testator called on a person to take notice or bear testimony that such is his will, or words of like import.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The foregoing provisions of our Probate Code have been a part of our statutory law since the days of the Republic. See An Act Concerning Wills, approved by the President of the Republic of Texas on January 28, 1840, Gammel\u2019s Laws of Texas, Vol. 2, p. 167-171. As long ago as 1857 it was held by this Court that to entitle a nuncupative will to probate three witnesses \u201cmust agree, at least substantially, to the words spoken, or the dispositions made by the deceased.\u201d Mitchell v. Vickers, 20 Texas (Reprint) 377, 385. The Court further said: \u201cThere can be no will, no disposition of the property, if the witnesses cannot concur as to what, in substance, was such disposition.\u201d The rule there stated appears to be one of universal recognition. Page on Wills, Vol. 2, Sections 404 and 902; Alexander\u2019s Commentaries on Wills, Vol. 1, Section 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The reason for the rule, as well as for strict enforcement of all statutory prerequisites to the probate of nuncupative wills, is perhaps best summed up in Thompson on Wills, 3rd Ed., Section 30, where it is said: \u201cEven in jurisdictions where nuncupative wills are allowed they are not favored by the courts for the very obvious reason that they are at best uncertain productions, depending upon the attention, intelligence, memory and honesty of those surrounding the dying testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The record reflects that following a severe heart attack in Galveston, Texas, Paul Hargis, while in a hospital there and in extremis, called on Dr. E. D. Futch, one of the attending physicians, to write down what he had to say with respect to a disposition of property. The memorandum made by Dr. Futch, signed by him and by Dr. Lang F. Holland and Paul M. Schroeter, who were also present, as witnesses, and introduced in evidence on the trial is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\u201cGalveston, Texas 1-29-56 12:30 P.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Mr. <em>Paul Hargis </em>Personal stock in Austin Hargis Corp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADu\">divided as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">50% to wife 50% to employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>divided as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">1.

He testified that Paul Hargis spoke slowly and distinctly, that he requested the witness to write down what was said with respect to the disposition made of the corporate stock, and that while he also made suggestions to his wife with reference to the sale of certain other personal property he spoke no words of a dis-positive nature other than those recorded on the written memorandum. He testified that he read the memorandum back to Hargis and Hargis approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">Dr. Holland confirmed the speaking by Hargis of the dispositive words which were recorded by Dr. Futch. He testified also that \u201cthere was lots that was said that was not put down,\u201d that \u201cthere was a lot that was said that was not transcribed,\u201d that in reducing the words to writing they \u201conly hit the high spots of his conversation;\u201d but he remembered no words, other than those recorded, disposing of property. He particularly remembered no words spoken giving corporate stock to Frank Kutzenberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">Mrs. Hewett testified positively that Hargis directed that the stock in the Austin corporation be divided 50% to his wife, 25% to Paul Schroeter, and 25% to Malcolm Richberg, Walker Nance, Jimmy Attra and Gary Hanson. We here quote all of the testimony of the witness which can have any bearing on the disposition made of stock in the Waco corporation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-17\">\u201cQ. Do you recall whether he said anything about the stock in the Waco store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-18\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cQ. And what did he say about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\">\u201cA. He said a certain percent was to go to his wife, Jewel, and a certain percent to Paul Schroeter, and then he mentioned Mr. Kutzenberger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">\u201cQ. But you don\u2019t recall what the percentages were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201cA. I think he said fifty percent to Jewel, and I can\u2019t be sure what he said to Paul Schroeter. I think I know but I can\u2019t be sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cQ. You are not sure of what he said about Jewel either, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cA. Not quite. There is a little doubt about that. I think that is when I walked over there to Mr. O. D. Hargis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. O. D. Hargis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, Mr. 0. D. Hargis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">\u201cQ. He was at the far part of the room, wasn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">\u201cA. Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">\u201cQ. Where he was you couldn\u2019t hear very well, could you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t hear at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\"><em>(( % </em>* * \u00cdJS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-15\">\u201cQ. Now, talking again about what disposition that this is supposed to have made, do you recall how many shares of stock in the Waco store Mr. Paul Hargis said he wanted to go to Mr. Kutzenberger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think that was when I walked over to Mr. Hargis and I didn\u2019t get the number of shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-17\">\u201cQ. Do you recall how many shares he said he wanted to go to Paul Schroeter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-18\">\u201cA. Not definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-19\">\u201cQ. Do you recall how many shares he said he wanted to go to his wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cA. Fifty percent. No, wait a minute, \u2014 I can\u2019t be sure of that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cQ. Right now you really don\u2019t know what disposition he made of the Waco store then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I don\u2019t recall it right now. It was fresher on my mind before than it is now. I know what I think he said \u2014 I mean what disposition he made, but, as I say, I am under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cQ. But you think it was fifty percent to his wife and the rest to Paul Sehroeter and Mr. Kutzenberger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201cA. It could have been eighty-five percent to Jewel. I don\u2019t recall for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\u201cQ. And you are not sure how much he gave to Mr. Kutzenberger ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\u201cA. I am not sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">\u201cQ. So you don\u2019t really know what they put down on paper was what Mr. Hargis said or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">\u201cA. I know what he said about those shares was on that paper because I saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">\u201cQ. Are you positive that it was put down exactly like he said it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">\u201cQ. Do you think so, or are you positive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, he told them what to put down and they wrote it down immediately after he said it, and I know I was right thereby the side of the doctor, and I could see it, and he wrote it down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-18\">\u201cQ. And you are positive that they put down exactly what he said and didn\u2019t leave any out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-19\">\u201cA. The shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-20\">\u201cQ. They didn\u2019t leave any out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cA. I don\u2019t know whether they left any out. I remember seeing shares, the percentages and then names by the side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><em>(\u00ed </em>:Ji :|c #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u201cQ. Well what did he dispose of that they didn\u2019t write down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cA. He disposed of the shares of stock in his store and told them to write it down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201cQ. What else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201cA. And he mentioned the Waco store and told them to write it down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u201cQ. One more question. Did you see the writing in Galveston at the hospital while it was being written down sufficiently to know at that time and to be certain thereof now that whatever that instrument said was what Paul stated with regard to disposition of the stock in the two companies, the Austin Company and the Waco Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">\u201cMr. Lee: The answer is \u2018yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\"><em>a </em>:&gt; <em>\u00ed\\\u00ed i'fi \u00bf\u00a1t</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">\u201cQ. Mrs. Hewett, just tell us what disposition of the Waco stock was made again, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">\u201cA. I told you that I missed what he gave Mr. Kutzenberger, because I walked over there to the cot to Mr. Hargis. If I remember right now, it seems to me that it was eight-five percent to Jewel, I can\u2019t be sure of that. I think it was eighty-five per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-14\">\u201cQ. But you don\u2019t know how much he gave Mr. Kutzenberger ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\">\u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t hear that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">\u201cQ. And you don\u2019t know how much he gave Mr. Schroeter ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-17\">\u201cA. It seems to me like \u2014 I told you a minute ago that it was either eight-five or fifty to Jewel, and it seems to me it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>was fifteen percent \u2014 I think I am positive about fifteen percent to Mr. Schroeter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201cQ. Then it must have been about fifty percent to Mrs. Jewel Hargis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201cA. Likely, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201cQ. But you are not sure just what he left to Mr. Kutzenberger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">\u201cA. I know he left him something, but I didn\u2019t get the number of shares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">It will be noted that Special Issue No. 1 coupled with the instruction following left it to the jury to determine whether the testimony of the three witnesses was in substantial agreement as to the dispositive terms of the will. That question is one for determination by the judge, as evidently the trial judge in this case realized when he rendered judgment notwithstanding the verdict of the jury. It is one which the judge should and normally will decide at the conclusion of the testimony and before any issue is made for jury determination. Unless the judge finds that at least three witnesses substantially agree on the terms of the will, there is no will, and there is nothing to submit to a jury. Neither is there a jury issue as to the terms of the will if only three witnesses purport to testify thereto and their testimony is in substantial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Special Issue No. 1 was not a proper jury issue in this case. It would have been a proper jury issue only if the three witnesses had been in substantial agreement as to the terms of the will as set out in the issue and other witnesses had denied that the dispositive words were spoken or had testified to a different disposition of the property. In that event there would have been testimony measuring up to the statutory requirement for establishment of the will offered for probate but the testimony would not have been conclusive, and whether such a will had in fact been made would have been a proper issue for the jury to decide from a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The authorities are quite generally agreed that the proof to admit a nuncupative will to probate must be of the clearest and most convincing character. Lewis v. Aylott, 45 Texas 190, 200; McClain v. Adams, 135 Texas 627, 146 S.W. 2d 373; Page on Wills, Vol. 2, Section 902; Priscilla E. Yarnall\u2019s Will, 4 Rawle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(Pa.) 46, 26 Am. Dec. 115, 121 (\u201cUnless the court is morally certain of carrying the will of the deceased, and no other, into effect, it is obviously its duty not to give the will the sanction of its probate.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">The testimony of the three witnesses in this case supports the will offered for probate in so far as it purports to dispose of stock in Hargis-Austin, Inc. To that extent the will is supported by the positive testimony of Dr. Futch and the positive testimony of Mrs. Hewett. It is supported also by the testimony of Dr. Holland. We do not regard Dr. Holland\u2019s testimony that many things said by the testator were not recorded in the memorandum as indicating that the recorded dispositions were not made or that other dispositive words were spoken. He testified that the recorded dispositions were made and he remembered no others. All of the witnesses are agreed that at the time of speaking the dispositive words to Dr. Futch with respect to the corporate stock, or immediately following, the testator turned to his wife and made suggestions regarding the sale of an aeroplane and other property. The fact that the suggestions were made by the testator but were not recorded by Dr. Futch does not prevent Dr. Holland\u2019s testimony as to the dispositive words spoken from being in substantial conformity with the testimony of Dr. Futch and Mrs. Hewett.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On the other hand, the testimony of Mrs. Hewett with respect to the disposition made by the testator of the stock in Hargis Company, Inc. (the Waco corporation) is far too uncertain to form a sound basis for holding that it meets the requirements of the statute. It is not, in our opinion, in that substantial conformity with the testimony of Drs. Futch and Holland which the law requires. It is true that in answer to a general question she testified that \u201cwhatever that instrument [the memorandum] said was what Paul stated with regard to disposition of the stock in the two companies, the Austin Company and the Waco company,\u201d but it is quite clear from her testimony that she did not remember from the words spoken by the testator whether Mrs. Hargis was given eighty-five or fifty percent of the stock and it is equally clear that according to her best recollection Frank Kutzenber'ger was given some number of shares of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Applying the test hereinabove stated we must hold that the three witnesses were not in substantial agreement as to the disposition made of the stock in Hargis Company Inc. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>that they were in substantial agreement as to the disposition of the stock in Hargis-Austin, Inc. does not authorize probate of the will.
