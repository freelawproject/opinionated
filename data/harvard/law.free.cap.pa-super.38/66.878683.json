Where in an action to recover back money paid under an agreement to purchase real estate, the plaintiff alleges a purely oral agreement, while the defendant alleges that the terms of the agreement were set forth in a written memorandum signed by himself, but not by plaintiff, and the terms of the two agreements are different, it is for the jury to determine from the conflicting testimony what in fact was the agreement between the parties.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-7\">2. In such a case even if the written memorandum is shown by overwhelming evidence to have been dictated by the plaintiff, and the various terms thereof suggested by himself, this will not shift the function of determining the disputed facts from the jury to the presiding judge.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-8\">3. It does not follow that because, in a proceeding for specific performance, the production of a memoradum in writing, signed by the vendor alone, meets the requirements of the statute, the mouth of the vendee is closed from asserting that the contract evidenced by the writing is not his contract, that he never assented to it or adopted it and that it was nothing but the self-serving declaration of the party whose act alone it, on its face, purported to be.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-9\"><em>Vendor and vendee </em>\u2014 Resale\u2014Measure <em>of damages.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-10\">4. The measure of damages, where there has been a resale, is the difference between the price agreed to be paid by the vendee and that obtained on a resale.

K. Clever, the brother of the defendant, that he would not take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the property, giving as a reason that no notice had been given him that a surrender of the lease has been secured from the said lessors. Some correspondence passed between the parties addressed by Conrad Clever to Joseph Clever, and by Joseph to Conrad, and one addressed by Conrad Clever to Joseph Clever, on the day of , 1904, was offered in evidence on his behalf. Joseph also states that no hay was to be taken from the farm which had been raised upon it, as well as no straw or fodder; that no timber was to be cut or carried away, or anything removed except what belonged to the tenant, and he called witnesses to show that three loads \u00f3f hay had been removed, about three tons each, of the value of, as given by one witness, as we remember, $12.00 or $13.00 per ton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">On the other hand, the defendant came upon the stand and testified that no agreement as to the procuring of the surrender of the lease was made, except what appears in the agreement; that he did not agree to procure its surrender by the middle of the following week, and did not agree to notify him, Joseph Clever, of its surrender within that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">D. B. Russell, who prepared the agreement, also contradicts the plaintiff in this matter; he says that no time was fixed for its surrender to Clever, stating that he wanted it as soon as it could be secured. He also states that on that day he assured Joseph Clever that it would be surrendered, and that on that very night he and the Hykes met and agreed to surrender the lease, but that the paper formally surrendering the same was not executed until the day of January following. Mr. Russell also says that nothing was said about hay \u2014 that Joseph Clever was to have all except what belonged to the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-8\">D. A. Smith was also called and states that he was present when the contract of October 15 was made and written, and he stated how the parties stood about the wagon on which it was written; that he heard all that was said by the parties, and he testified also that there was no agreement that a surrender of the lease was to be secured by the middle of the week, or at any definitely fixed time, or that notice of the surrender was to be given by Conrad Clever to Joseph Clever within that time, nor was any such promise made by Conrad Clever. He states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>nothing was said about hay \u2014 all stuff on farm to go to Joseph Clever, except tenant\u2019s property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-4\">[All three of these witnesses state that after the agreement was signed, Joseph Clever stated to Conrad that if he did noti secure the surrender of the lease, he would only pay $40.00 per acre instead of $42.50, and that to this Conrad made no reply. These statements, if made, were inconsistent with the present contention of the plaintiff, and were not denied by him, as we recollect the testimony.] [16]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">S. K. Clever also testifies that on Tuesday, October 18, Joseph Clever called on him at Shippensburg, and told him that he would not take the farm, and that if he had to lose the $150 paid he would do so, or words to that effect, and that he did not then state that he was refusing to carry out his contract because of the failure of Conrad Clever to secure a surrender of the lease. He also states that the hay was removed by him; that it belonged to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">Mr. Baker testifies that on Sunday the 16th and Monday the 17th, Joseph Clever spoke to him about leasing the farm to him; that he refused to take a lease of the same, and that on Tuesday evening the 18th, he told him he had concluded not to take the farm, and had thrown it up, or words of similar import.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The defendant also offered the contract of October 15 to show that while it provides for a surrender of the lease, no time is fixed within which it should be done, except the implication that it would be required before April, when the deed was to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">The letters of Joseph Clever were offered to show that in none of them does he assign as a reason for his refusal to carry out the contract that the lease had not been surrendered by the middle of the week following the sale of October '15, or that he had not received notice of the same \u2014 certainly not explicitly. But that he denied in these letters that he had ever made a contract. This was offered as tending to show that his present claim has been an afterthought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">In this connection it may be but proper to state that Joseph Clever was called in rebuttal and denied that he saw Samuel Clever on October 18, insisting that it was on the 21st, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>it was on that day that he saw Baker, and told him that he had concluded not to take the farm, and his son was called who stated that he was husking corn that week with his father, and that he did not go to Shippensburg until Friday the 21st.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">The defendant also offered testimony showing that a deed was prepared and tendered to Joseph Clever, by letter of Mr. Johnston, dated March 27, and in person on April 1, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">[It was further shown that Mr. Clever subsequently advertised the farm at public sale, and resold the same upon practically similar conditions as to payments;] [17] that he realized but $3,825.84 therefor, thus losing the sum of $135.11 on the sale, besides interest on the money which Joseph Clever had agreed to pay from April 1, which would amount to $19.00 additional; that the costs of the second sale were $8.00 and that he paid his attorneys $30.00. He thus contends that instead of being a debtor to the plaintiff, he has lost through the default of the latter not only the $150 paid to him on October 15, but that he has in addition lost the sum of $192.91; and this he insists that the plaintiff is bound to refund him, and he asks that instead of finding a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, you should, and are required, under the evidence, to find a verdict in his favor and against the plaintiff for this loss above $150. As already stated in answer to the points presented, we do not think that under the testimony you can consider the fees paid the attorneys, and the $30.00 paid them should be eliminated, as well as the costs of the second sale, $8.00. [So that the amount that we think proper for you to take into consideration is $154.91, to wit: the loss of the $135.11, the difference in the price of the, sale, and interest from April 1, to the time of the second sale at four per cent. We think, as a matter of law, that that is the damage suffered by the defendant in this case, and the damage which we think you can take into consideration in coming to a determination.] [18]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">[We are satisfied that as no fraud, accident or mistake was alleged or shown in the'making of the written contract, that it is incompetent under the law for the plaintiff, Joseph Clever, to contradict its terms, or to materially modify the contract by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>fixing the surrender of the lease of the peach orchard at a particular date, and making that of the essence of the contract. Surely is this so when the written paper is testified by three witnesses to set forth what was agreed as to the lease, and three of whom expressly contradict the plaintiff in this matter.] [19]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">[It not being controverted that the plaintiff paid $150 to the defendant on October 15,1904, what will, therefore, be for your consideration is to determine whether Conrad Clever suffered any loss or damage by reason of the default of Joseph Clever to take the farm and comply with the conditions, and if so, how much;] [20] and also whether under the evidence that you have heard in this case, and the law as given you by the court, the defendant is entitled to set off the loss or damages against the claim for the return of the $150, and should you find his loss exceeded that sum, determine how much, and in that case, as the defendant insists, you may find a verdict in favor of the defendant for such sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">[The law is that when one enters into a contract for the purchase of a property, and refuses to comply with the conditions, there may be collected from him the loss which the owner of the property suffers by such default, and that this loss or damage may be ascertained by a public resale of the property, on the same conditions as to the payments, and if a partial payment or partial payments have been made, they may be retained to an amount sufficient to pay the owner for the loss, and should these partial payments not be sufficient to reinburse him for the loss, he may sue and recover the excess in an action at law.] [21]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">[The terms must be reasonably as advantageous at the second sale as at the first \u2014 there must be reasonable care exercised, and they must be substantially and practically the same.] [22]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">Verdict and judgment for defendant for $4.06.

No such paper appeared either in the pleadings or the evidence. The plaintiff declared that, by an oral agreement, he had undertaken to buy, from the defendant, a tract of land owned by the latter on certain terms and conditions assented to by both, and in pursuance of that agreement had paid $150 on account of the purchase money. He averred that by reason of the failure of the defendant to comply with the terms and conditions agreed upon, he had rescinded the contract, and was entitled to the return of the money he had paid. The defendant, in his affidavit of defense, admits that an agreement had been made \u201cbut denies that the same was an oral contract as alleged by the plaintiff and alleges that the said contract was wholly in writing.\u201d He then makes profert of what he alleges to be a copy of the written agreement. This, upon its face, however, purports to be nothing more than an ex parte memorandum of the defendant, signed only by him, reciting the fact that he had made a sale \u2014 \u201c I have sold this day to Joseph Clever my farm,\u201d etc.- \u2014 and reciting in turn certain terms and conditions, differing in some particulars from those averred by the plaintiff. Thus at the very threshold of the case the parties were at issue on the important question of fact whether the agreement, into which each admitted he had entered, had been reduced to a written instrument expressing the terms to which both had, in some way, indicated their assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The oral testimony delivered by each party was in support of the averments in the statement and affidavit respectively. The plaintiff in his contention was corroborated by the facts, among others, that he had not signed the paper, that it had not been delivered to him, that it did not exhibit the customary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>receipt declaring the money to have been paid on account of the alleged contract expressed in it, and that the terms therein set forth differed from those contained in a letter from defendant read in evidence. The defendant\u2019s theory was in turn supported by the testimony of those who declared the paper was written by the direction and at the dictation of the plaintiff, that he fully assented to it, that it was left in the possession of one Russell at their joint request and for their joint benefit, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Thus when the testimony closed each party was found maintaining, to the extent of his ability, the same issue of fact he had tendered to his adversary in the pleadings. That such an issue of fact could be properly disposed of only by the jury seems to 'us to be a conclusion needing no argument to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Even if, arguendo merely, we concede the correctness of the statement contained in the opening of the brief of the learned counsel for appellee, that \u201cthe evidence is overwhelming that the memorandum of October 15th was dictated by the vendee, and the various terms thereof suggested by himself,\u201d etc., this would not shift the function of determining a disputed fact from the jury to the presiding judge. And it is beside the mark to argue and cite cases to prove that if such a memorandum were to be made the foundation of a bill for specific performance, the statute of frauds and perjuries would not operate to prevent a decree. Our statute does not declare an agreement for the sale of land void \u201cif not reduced to writing and signed by the parties.\u201d It only enacts that \u201call leases, etc., made or created by livery and seisin only, or by parol, and not put in writing and signed by the parties so making and creating the same, shall have the force and effect,\u201d etc. It does not follow, therefore, that because, in a proceeding for specific performance, the production of a memorandum in writing, signed by the vendor alone, meets the requirements of that statute, the mouth of the vendee is closed from asserting that the contract evidenced by the writing is not his contract, that he never assented to it or adopted it and that it was nothing but the self-serving declaration of the party whose act alone it, on its face, purported to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The error into which the learned judge fell, in this respect, manifests itself not only in the answers to the points presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>on either side, but in the general charge as well, as the following excerpt from it shows: \u201cWe are satisfied that as no fraud, accident or mistake was alleged or shown in the making of the written contract, that it is incompetent, under the law, for the plaintiff, Joseph Clever, to contradict its terms, or to materially modify the contract by fixing the surrender of the lease of the peach orchard at a particular date, and making that of the essence of the contract.\u201d The first, tenth, eleventh, twelfth and nineteenth assignments are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">After the jury shall have determined what the contract really was they must next determine, under the evidence, whether or not, the defendant, before the rescission by the plaintiff, had failed to perform, in any material particular, the obligations imposed on him by the contract as found. If so, then rescission was the plaintiff\u2019s right and he ought to recover his money. If on this fact the finding be adverse to the plaintiff the defendant may have a verdict for any damages he suffered beyond the purchase money he received. The general rule is \u201cthat the measure of damages, where there has been a resale, is the difference between the price agreed to be paid by the vendee and that obtained on a resale. It is predicated of course of the undisputed facts in the case that the resale was a public one, fairly conducted, after full notice to the public and the vendee, upon the same or as advantageous terms as the first:\u201d Bowser v. Cessna, 62 Pa. 148; Pepper v. Deakyne, 212 Pa. 181. It was said, however, in Freeman v. Husband, 77 Pa. 389: \u201cIf the terms were materially altered upon the resale, he (the purchaser) was thereby released, for he cannot be held to conditions that did not form part of his contract.\u201d Hare v. Bedell, 98 Pa. 485; Weast v. Derrick, 100 Pa. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As the amount claimed by either party is small, the facts, although supported by contradictory evidence, within a narrow compass, and the principles of law applicable but few, a retrial, along the lines herein indicated, ought to result in a just and final disposition of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
