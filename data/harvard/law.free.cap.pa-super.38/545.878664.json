Exception for plaintiff. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">The court charged the jury in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-9\">[The question which you will have to determine is, was that \u25a0 the agreement under which this new corporation, which succeeded the partnership, was acting with the plaintiff, or did the plaintiff make a new agreement with the corporation which succeeded and took the place of the contract which he had with John E. Jeffords &amp; Company?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-10\">Is there any evidence at all in any statement of the plaintiff that he entered into a new agreement with different terms from this old one? I am speaking of the time in 1904 when he said there was a new agreement under which he was employed at $25.00 a week. It is true there are entries in the books showing salaries at the rate of $1,750 a year, but you have a period of thirty weeks running from February 1, at the very .beginning of his employment, when he was only paid $25.00 a week. There are other times when he was paid. $33.65 a week \u2014 and it is marked in the books at the rate .of $1,750 a year. Was that $1,750 a year dependent upon the corporation having a net profit of $6,000 according to the terms of the old agreement? Or do you find any evidence that they agreed to pay him $1,750 a year without regard to profit or loss?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-11\">If you find from all the evidence in the case that that was their agreement; that he was not paid what they had agreed to pay him, then you should render your verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-12\">On the other hand, if you find that this written contract was the basis of his employment and that his employment continued under that and subject to its terms and conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and was not altered by any subsequent contract, then the evidence shows, I think without dispute, that he has been fully paid and your verdict should be for the defendant.] [3]</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-C\">February 26, 1909:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-3\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

The defendant sought to prove profits of less than $6,000 per year. To do so it was incumbent to offer in evidence some facts from which the jury could draw an inference. Instead of that there was submitted only Mr. Vollum\u2019s opinion derived from facts not in evidence. This was error: Ryder v. Jacobs, 182 Pa. 624; Building Society v. Holt, 184 Pa. 572; Phila. v. Neill &amp; Lincoln Savings, etc., Co., 211 Pa. 353.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-6\"><em>Henry J.

That such evidence is competent has been decided: Jordan v.

It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s declaration and his testimony, and the evidence offered from the books of the defendant corporation in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, that a jury might have found a substantial sum in favor of the plaintiff. But under the admissions of evidence and charge of the court, the jury found a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">It appears in evidence that the plaintiff had been in the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ploy of John E. Jeffords for over one year prior to February 12, 1901, under a written contract fixing his salary.at $1,400 per annum, with an additional $350 if the business made a profit of $6,000 or more per annum. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony is quite clear that this arrangement terminated at the end of the first year, and he worked under another arrangement until Jeffords\u2019 business was turned over to the corporation on February 12, 1901. We do not find in the record sufficient evidence to warrant the court in permitting the jury to find that the plaintiff worked for the corporation under the contract above referred to. By its terms the contract was for one year from May 1, 1899; the parties were Cox and Jeffords; the business was discontinued by Jeffords in February, 1901. Nothing was shown to connect this contract with the employment of Cox after May 1,1900. On this point Cox testified: \u201c I had a contract for one year from May 1,1899, to April 30,1900. Q. And you continued right along under that contract? A. I did not. Q. When did you change? A. The first of the year. Q. The first of what year? A. 1900. December 30, 1900, my salary was entered up at $1,750 a year in their books. Q. And that is the contract under which you went to work for John E. Jeffords and continued to work for the Philadelphia City Pottery Company? A. That is the contract I worked under for John E. Jeffords for one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The first assignment of error raises the question of the admissibility of the written contract referred to, dated April 25, 1899, accepted April 29,1899, by William Cox. In our opinion, there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the court in permitting the jury to find that the plaintiff worked for the defendant corporation under that contract and, therefore, we sustain the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The second and third assignments relate to the admission of the testimony of Robert D. Yollum and the refusal to strike it out. He was an expert witness called by defendant to prove the profits and loss of the defendant company based on said contract. This for the purpose of showing that in none of the years that the plaintiff was employed by the corporation did the profits amount to $6,000. We think these assignments must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sustained on two grounds: (a) It was not shown that the plaintiff was employed under that contract, and (b) if the defendant had been entitled to prove the profits of the business, it was error in the court to allow Vollum to testify, as an expert, to what the books and invoices showed, without the same being produced and offered in evidence. Upon the latter question our attention has been called by the defendant to the following cases: Phila. v. Neill &amp; Lincoln Savings, etc., Co., 211 Pa. 353; 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), p. 428, and Jordan v. Osgood, 109 Mass. 457 (the latter case is a footnote on p. 428, vol. 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law). The exact language on this point is: \u201cAn accountant who has examined certain books and schedules which have been introduced in evidence may state the results of his computation therefrom not involving mere inferences.\u201d We also call attention to Ryder v. Jacobs, 182 Pa. 624, in the syllabus of which we find: \u201c Whether a witness be a competent expert, and whether the contention be such as calls for expert testimony, is largely in the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d See also Building Society v. Holt, 184 Pa. 572, where Mr. Justice Dean (p. 577) said: \u201cAs to the second assignment, the secretary of the society was asked if Holt had not always been recognized by the society as the owner of the stock after the alleged transfer. This question, on objection by plaintiff, was overruled. The ruling was correct; the object was to elicit an opinion formed from the entries in the society\u2019s books and the declarations in the mortgage. The court and jury were just as capable of forming an opinion from these facts as the witness, and that is what they were there for.\u201d The above cases and others recognize that the question of admitting expert testimony in a given case is largely discretionary with the court below. This principle we do not question, but from all the cases we reach the conclusion that a court cannot properly exercise its discretion as to whether or not expert testimony should be received to show, for. instance, the profits and losses of a business, without the books and invoices being produced and offered in evidence. It must be conceded in the present case that the jury passed upon the question of profits on the testimony of Vollum who had examined the books and papers, but they were not in court and of course were not in evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>It may be that the books and invoices were so plain that the court and jury could readily determine whether or not the profits amounted to or exceeded $6,000 per annum. We thus have the plain case of a court exercising its discretion in allowing expert testimony as to what profits the books and invoices showed, without seeing the same. This we think is clearly wrong. The second and third assignments are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The fourth assignment raises the question of the correctness of a portion of the charge of the. court. This part complained of is the logical result of the errors raised by the first, second and third assignments, and having sustained those, it follows that the fourth assignment must also be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We are quite clear that the evidence did not entitle the defendant to have the contract of April 25,1899, in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The assignments of error are all sustained and the judgment reversed with a venire facias de novo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
