The commonwealth produced a few witnesses, who all testified that the liquor tasted a little like beer. All the commonwealth\u2019s witnesses who had tasted the liquid, said it did not affect them, except one witness, who said: \u201cIt gave me a little of the feeling that alcohol does.\u201d This is the only evidence in the case tending to show that the liquor or beverage was intoxicating. In the judgment of counsel, this was nothing more than a scintilla of evidence and did not entitle the commonwealth to submit the case to a jury upon the allegation that the defendant had sold spirituous, vinous or malt liquors: Allred v. State, 89 Ala. 112 (8 So. Repr. 56); United States v. Ducournau, 54 Fed. Repr. 138; Weisbrodt v. State, 50 Ohio, 192 (33 N. E. Repr. 603); State v.

L. 108, \u201cTo restrain and regulate the sale of vinous and spirituous, malt, or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof,\u201d provides in its fifteenth section: \u201cAny person who shall hereafter be convicted of selling or offering for sale any vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof, without a license, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than five hundred dollars, nor more than five thousand dollars, and undergo an imprisonment in the county jail of not less than three months, nor more than twelve months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The defendant himself testified: \u201cI sold the \u2018rikk,\u2019 as has been testified. It was represented to me as nonintoxicating. It did not appear to affect anyone. I poured some bottles of \u2018 rikk \u2019 into a vessel and sent it by Solomon Hazzard to Prof. Cochran to be analyzed. I received from him a receipt for payment of the charge for making the analysis, on which was stated the percentage of alcohol found, a little over two per cent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In the appellant\u2019s paper-book is printed what purports to be \u201ctestimony given by C. B. Cochran in case of Commonwealth v. Charles H. Burns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u201cA sample of liquid marked \u2018rikk\u2019 was delivered to me by R. 0. Jefferis on July 20, 1908. I made an analysis of the sample and found it contained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cAlcohol by weight......3.12%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">Alcohol by volume......3.90%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">Total solids........3.25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">Ash........0.10%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">Maltose........0.62%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">Phosphoric acid...... 0.032%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">\u201cThe sample was a carbonated liquid and had the odor and taste of beer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">\u201cAs a result of the analysis, I concluded that the sample was a malt liquor, made as indicated on the label, from malt, yeast, hops and water. Using the term vinous in its broad sense, the sample is a vinous liquid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">The question of the defendant\u2019s guilt was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-15\">The 'only allegation of error on the part of the appellant is that \u201cThe court erred in its general charge to the jury as follows: That on the defendant\u2019s own showing, there was about two per cent of alcohol in the beverage in question. In the judgment of the court he [the defendant] was guilty as charged, if the liquor sold was either malt or vinous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">There is nothing erroneous in thus submitting the real question at issue in the case to the jury. Whether the chemist used the term vinous in its broad or restricted sense is a matter of little consequence. There was no allegation, and absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>no attempt to show, that the liquid was not a malt liquor. The label upon the bottles seemed to indicate it. The taste and smell were those of beer. Whether or not the defendant was put upon notice of the character of the drink which he sold is immaterial. It was a malt liquor. He sold it without a license and is, therefore, as the jury found, guilty under the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">The sentence was a minimum one in accordance with the provisions of the Brooks law and should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Judgment affirmed and record remitted to the court below, to the end that the sentence, as imposed, may be fully carried into effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
