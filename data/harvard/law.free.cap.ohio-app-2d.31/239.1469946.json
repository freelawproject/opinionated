Plaintiffs allege that as a result of this malicious slander, Gloria Lang was defeated in the union election, that their loss of reputation injured their chances to advancement in their employment and their union, and that both suffered impaired health.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Both plaintiffs are appealing the decision of the trial court sustaining the motion of defendants to dismiss the complaints and the court\u2019s ruling granting final judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The trial court cited as authority for his decision the case of <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon (1959), 359 </em>U. S. 236, which held on page 245 that when an activity is arguably subject to Section 7 or Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, the state as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">It is now established that state courts are not precluded from exercising jurisdiction over libel or slander actions arising from labor activities because of federal preemption under Sections 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Joint Council 53, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America </em>(1965), 415 Pa. 401, 206 A. 2d 382, <em>certiorari denied, </em>382 U. S. 897; <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers of America, Local 114 </em>(1966), 383 U.

Ed. 2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We hold that the trial court was in error in dismissing the complaints of both plaintiffs on the basis of <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-9\">O\u2019Neill, P.
