In 2004, the district court reduced Dorval\u2019s sentence to 360 months of imprisonment based on Amendment 505. The United States moves for a summary affirmance and to stay the briefing schedule. Because the \u201cposition [of the United States] ... is clearly right as a matter of law so that there [is] no substantial question as to the outcome of the case,\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969), we grant the motion for summary affirmance and dismiss as moot the motion to stay the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dorval\u2019s motion because Amendment 750 did not alter Dor-val\u2019s sentencing range. Because Dorval was, without objection, held responsible for more than 8.4 kilograms of crack cocaine, he was ineligible for a further reduction of his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (assigning a base offense level of 38 for cases involving 8.4 kilograms or more of crack cocaine). Dorval challenges the amount of cocaine attributed to him, but the district court could not disturb its earlier finding about drug quantity when considering Dorval\u2019s motion to reduce. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1997). The district court lacked the authority to further reduce Dorval\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">We AFFIRM the denial of Dorval\u2019s motion for a further reduction of his sentence, and we DISMISS as moot the motion to stay the briefing schedule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
