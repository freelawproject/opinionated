The appeal presents this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-17\">Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment against McFarlin on her race discrimination claims challenging her (a) placement on disciplinary leave; and (b) termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">The case was decided under the familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. McFar-lin failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that her placement on \u201cleave\u201d was based on racial discrimination, as she failed to show sufficiently that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably than she. Even if she had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, McFarlin did not carry her burden to show sufficiently that the proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for her placement on leave, including her perceived insubordination, were mere pretexts. Even if McFarlin established a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case that her termination was discriminatory, she did not show sufficiently that the proffered reasons for her termination, specifically the receipt of several student complaints and her perceived unwillingness to improve, were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-20\">The courts do not decide about the wisdom of the employer\u2019s decisions. And an employer\u2019s own perception of events is important. Therefore, the district court, given the evidence in this record and lack of evidence, did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
