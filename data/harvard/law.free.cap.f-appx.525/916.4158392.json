Uttermohlen\u2019s (Uttermohlen) filing under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 2010, seeking to discharge approximately $40,000.00, in unsecured, non-priority liabilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On his Schedule C, Uttermohlen filed a Schedule C exempt asset claim to a \u201c2010 Tax Refund,\u201d in an amount to be determined, under Florida law. Utter-mohlen later amended his Schedule C to claim that the amount was $10,668.00, and by definition was exempt as tenancy-by-the-entireties property under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(B), as well as Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Bankruptcy trustee Traci K. Stevenson (Trustee) objected on three grounds: (1) that the refunded tax contributions solely related to Uttermohlen\u2019s income, business income, and losses; (2) that the non-filing spouse does not work outside the home; and, (B) that the 2010 Tax Refund is not tenancy-by-the-entireties property and should be apportioned according to each spouse\u2019s\u2019 income contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">After two hearings, the bankruptcy court overruled the Trustee\u2019s Objection to Debtor\u2019s Claim of Exemptions in 2011. The bankruptcy court found that all unities required to own property as tenants-by-the-entireties existed on the date that Ut-termohlen filed bankruptcy, and that therefore the tax refund was properly claimed as exempt property.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">The Trustee appealed to the district court. In a well-reasoned, thorough opinion, the district court affirmed the ruling of the bankruptcy court. We have reviewed the record in this appeal, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-11\">. There was a jurisdictional issue in this appeal that was carried with the case. Upon review, we find that the order of the district court, affirming the bankruptcy court order overruling the Trustee\u2019s objection to an exemption claimed under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(B), is a final and appealable order. <em>See Wisz v.
