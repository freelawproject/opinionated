After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Toney has not met his burden of demonstrating that his sentence was unreasonable. His sentence was within his guidelines range and we ordinarily expect a guidelines sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The court considered the statutory factors and discussed several of them in detail, including: the nature and circumstances of Toney\u2019s offense (threatening his girlfriend, punching her pregnant daughter in the face, pointing a knife at his girlfriend\u2019s niece, and firing two gunshots in front of his girlfriend\u2019s residence); Toney\u2019s history and characteristics, including his prior convictions for several violent offenses; and the need for a lengthy sentence to promote respect for the law, deter Toney\u2019s criminal conduct, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although Toney contends that his advanced age and history of mental health issues warranted a below-guidelines sentence, the district court considered these arguments and concluded the countervailing considerations required a longer term of imprisonment. We cannot say this determination was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
