Vargas-Ramirez argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\">Vargas-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Vargas-Ramirez had an extensive criminal history that included six prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>convictions for driving under the influence, shoplifting, fleeing to elude a police officer, and various traffic offenses. And Vargas-Ramirez had been removed three times from the United States when officers discovered him again driving under the influence. The district court found \u201c[un]aeceptable\u201d that Vargas-Ramirez \u201cke[pt] entering illegally and disobeying our laws and endangering our citizenry\u201d and reasonably determined that a sentence at the low end of the recommended guidelines range of 33 to 41 months of imprisonment was necessary to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter Vargas-Ramirez from future similar conduct, and to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Vargas-Ramirez argues that the district court gave undue deference to the sentencing range that resulted from enhancing his offense level by eight points for being deported after committing a shoplifting offense, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c) (Nov.2011), but the district court took into account the enhancement by imposing a sentence at the low end instead of the high end of the sentencing range. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Vargas-Ramirez to a term of 33 months, which was well below the statutory maximum penalty of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\">We AFFIRM Vargas-Ramirez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
