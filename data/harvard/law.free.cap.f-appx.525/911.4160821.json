Parker is currently serving a 360-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a), (b)(l)(A)(ii), and (b)(l)(A)(iii). After a thorough review of the record on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Parker\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">We briefly note the procedural history of this case. In December 2000, we affirmed Parker\u2019s conspiracy conviction, but remanded for resentencing, asking the district court to determine what effect, if any, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), had on Parker\u2019s case. In March 2001, Parker was resentenced. The court ruled that Parker\u2019s base offense level was 12, which, when added to his 2-level firearm enhancement yielded a total offense level of 14. Parker had a criminal history category of I, and a corresponding guideline range of 15 to 21 months. However, the court decided to depart upward to a base offense level of 38 because the actual drug weight the court found Parker accountable for distributing was at least 266 kilograms. The upward departure, coupled with Parker\u2019s firearm enhancement and criminal history, yielded a guideline range of 292 to 365 months. Absent a jury finding as to drug quantity, the court believed that the enhanced 30-year statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reduced that range to 292 to 360 months. The district court sentenced Parker to a 360-month term of imprisonment. We affirmed that sentence in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">In 2012, Parker filed a pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion requesting relief pursuant to Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. In his motion Parker asserted that the probation officer and defense counsel at his resentencing hearing both referenced a quantity of 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. In addition, the district court at resentencing did not say how much crack cocaine Parker was responsible for in excess of 1.5 kilograms. Consequently, Parker\u2019s base offense level should be decreased from 38 to 34. Without requiring a government response, the district court denied the motion, concluding that Amendment 750 did not lower Parker\u2019s applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">On appeal, Parker again argues that at resentencing, the district court failed to state how many kilograms it attributed to him, and asserts that any finding greater than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine was an impermissible new factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The Guidelines explain that the amendment relied upon for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief must lower the \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmnt. n. 1(A). The guideline range we rely on is \u201cthe guideline range that corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>sponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to [\u00a7 ] lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In order for Parker to obtain \u00a7 3852(c)(2) relief, Amendment 750 would have had to reduce his original applicable guideline range prior to the court\u2019s upward variance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. It did not. At his 2001 resentencing hearing, the district court found that prior to any upward variance, Parker\u2019s total offense level was 14, yielding a guideline range of 15 to 21 months. After Amendment 750, Parker\u2019s total offense level remains at 14, with a corresponding guideline range of 15 to 21 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(14). The district court below found the same. It is clear that Amendment 750 did not reduce Parker\u2019s original applicable guideline range, and the district court did not err in holding so.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Finally, Parker argues that the district court held him accountable for only 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. This argument is meritless and requires no further discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">.
