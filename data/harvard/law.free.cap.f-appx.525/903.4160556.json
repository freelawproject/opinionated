In 1998, the District Court denied Rivera\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence on the ground that he lacked career offender status at sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 29, 2011, Rivera moved the District Court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) \u201cfor Appropriate Relief,\u201d contending again that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender. The District Court denied his motion and his subsequent motion for reconsideration. He now appeals both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">We are obligated to examine our subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte. Boone v. Sec\u2019y, Dept. of Corrs., </em>377 F.3d 1315, 1316 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(per </em>curiam). We review <em>de novo </em>whether the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over Rivera\u2019s motion. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). The District Court lacked jurisdiction if Rivera\u2019s motion constituted a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and this court had not authorized Rivera to file it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir. 2003) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Rivera\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We did not grant Rivera authorization to file it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Since the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it, we are powerless to consider its merits. <em>See Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1294-95; <em>Boone, </em>377 F.3d at 1316. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s denial of Rivera\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and motion for reconsideration, and remand the case with the instruction that the District Court dismiss Rivera\u2019s motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">.
