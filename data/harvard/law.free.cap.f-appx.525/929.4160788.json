After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">On January 21, 1997, Mr. Billups pled guilty to conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; 846. The pre-sentence investigation report indicated that Mr. Billup\u2019s total offense level was 31 based upon the quantity of cocaine base (between 50-150 grams) as well as a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon and adjustments for accepting responsibility and assisting authorities by providing timely and complete information. Mr. Billups, however, qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which subjected him to an enhanced total offense level of 34<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a sentencing guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Billups as a career offender to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">On November 1, 2011, Mr. Billups filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied Mr. Billups\u2019 motion because \u201ca defendant whose original sentence was based on the Career Offender Guideline ... cannot receive a sentence reduction pursuant to a Guideline amendment like Amendment 750.\u201d D.E. 95 at 2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u2018we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3528(c)(2), a district court may reduce the terms of a defendant\u2019s imprisonment if the sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. If, however, \u201ca retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>In this case, Mr. Billups was not eligible for a reduced sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. His sentencing guideline range remained unchanged because \u00a7 4B1.1 was not affected by Amendment 750. <em>See id. </em>at 1327 (holding that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 are not entitled to sentence reductions based on an amendment to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 2D1.1); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent and applies to Amendment 750).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Mr. Billups argues that he is nevertheless entitled to a sentence reduction based on the Third Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Flemming, </em>617 F.3d 252 (3d Cir. 2010). In <em>Flemming, </em>the Third Circuit decided \u201c[t]he narrow issue\u201d of \u201cwhether a career offender who receives a \u00a7 4A1.3 downward departure ... to the Guidelines range for crack cocaine offenses is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. That is not the issue in this case. First, Mr. Billups did not receive a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b); he received an adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility and assisting authorities with timely and complete information. Second, he was not sentenced within the guideline range applicable to his crack cocaine offense. Mr. Billups received a sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the guideline range for his crack cocaine offense \u2014 based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of V \u2014 was 168-210 months. <em>See </em>PSI at \u00b6 82. These are critical distinctions and, therefore, <em>Flemming </em>does not help Mr. Billups. <em>Accord Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-31 (distinguishing its facts from other decisions where downward departures were given pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In sum, the district court correctly denied Mr. Billup\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-18\">. Based on the career offender designation, Mr. Billups\u2019 base offense level increased to 37, but his three-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for the acceptance of responsibility and assisting authorities with timely and complete information still applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
