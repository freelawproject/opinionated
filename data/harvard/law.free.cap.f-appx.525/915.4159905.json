Flores argues that his sentence, imposed at the top-end of the advisory guidelines range, placed an undue burden on him and his family while accomplishing \u201cvery little\u201d with respect to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">We review sentences under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence must be both proeedurally and substantively reasonable, <em>id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, though only the latter is at issue in this appeal. In terms of substance, the district court is required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d set out in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). Reversal is only warranted \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Flores has not demonstrated that his 57-month total sentence was substantively unreasonable. The sentence was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which the district discussed at length. The district court specifically cited to and explained its consideration of Flores\u2019s criminal history, the seriousness of the instant offense, the need to provide criminal deterrence, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities. Moreover, although Flores\u2019s total sentence was at the top-end of the applicable guidelines range, it nevertheless fell within that range and far below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment \u2014 indeed, the sentence was well short of the mandatory-minimum prison term of 20 years. For these reasons, we affirm Flores\u2019s sentence as substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
