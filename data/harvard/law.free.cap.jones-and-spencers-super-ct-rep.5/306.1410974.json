He told me it was. I told him that if he would make an estimate and agree to do it for that price, that I would alter my estimate, and accept his, as it was some four or five hundred dollars below my former estimate. He wrote me it on that card. I then tore my estimate and made up another one at four or five hundred dollars lower. We then waited at the office where the committee was. Mr. Harrison was there all the time while the committee was in session. They all left, the committee, after the announcement had been made, excepting Mr. Harrison and myself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I got the work, and told the defendant that I had based the roofing estimate on his, and that I should expect him to do the job. He said he would do it; that he would go and get his plans, and go to work.\u201d The defendant afterwards refused to do the work, and the plaintiff had to procure others to do it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">All the material portions of this testimony were contradicted by the defendant. He said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">\u201cI had no conversation : I simply was there ; I had given estimates to two other carpenters, and had made out estimates for Mr. Doyle ; I did not know Mr. Dutch only by sight; didn\u2019t know him to speak to him even ; he came up to me and asked me if I had any objection to give him my figures ; I told him no ; that is all that occurred ; I had nothing more to say to him at all.\u201d The difference between the defendant\u2019s estimate for the roofing, and the sum it actually cost the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>was six hundred and thirty-three dollars and seventy-four\" cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">Several questions put to witness by the defendant\u2019s counsel, were excluded by the court, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">They were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">\u201cQ. What is the usage in regard to estimates ; are they considered binding?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">(Objected to.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">\u201cBy the trade ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-10\">(Objected to.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-11\">\u201c Q. I will add to the question\u2014Do the trade consider an estimate given binding, or is it the usage to have a separate and distinct contract made for all work done ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-12\">\u201c Q. I ask you as far as the usage and custom of the trade is concerned what was the effect of it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-13\">\u201c Q. State, if you know the usage and custom of your trade about giving estimates for work, and the effect given to those estimates ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-14\">The court charged the jury that if the plaintiff, in pursuance of the notice from the board of education, put in his proposal to do this rooting work for a certain sum, and before the proposals were opened the defendant asked him what his .proposal was, and was informed, and then told him, substantially, that if he would withdraw it and put in another for a less sum (mentioning the sum) that he (the defendant) would himself do the work for him for that sum, and the plaintiff accepted the offer and acted upon it, it was a good contract, and the defendant would be bound by such an undertaking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-15\">(To which the defendant excepted.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-16\">That if the jury believed the statement of the plaintiff it amounts to an agreement, the defendant agreeing that if plaintiff would withdraw his proposal and put in another that he would do the work for the price mentioned in the substituted proposal, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>if afterwards plaintiff called upon defendant to do the .work it was his duty to fulfill the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">To this the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">The jury found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The defendant appealed from the judgment entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASGN\"><em>James M. Smith, </em>attorney and counsel for appellant. \u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai1\">The contract was not binding on the defendant. The plaintiff at the time of the transaction between himself and defendant had no <em>right to contract </em>for the reason that he had no contract with the superintendent-H the plaintiff had not received the contract from the superintendent, the.defendant could not have recovered damages of him for not awarding it to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-9\">II. If plaintiff had received it he would not have been legally bound to give it to defendant. The agreement was <em>without consideration </em>(Burnet <em>v. </em>Bisco, 4 <em>Johns. </em>236 ; Ford <em>v. </em>Adams, 3 <em>Bard. </em>249 ; Convers <em>v. </em>Kellogg, 7 <em>Bard. 590). (a.) </em>The defendant had a legal right to put in his bid. If lowest he would have been entitled to the contract (Utica <em>&amp; </em>Syracuse R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Brinkerhoff, 31 <em>Wend., </em>139; Ingraham <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 30 <em>Bard., </em>151; Winchell <em>v. </em>Latham, 6 <em>Cow., </em>.682 ; Lester <em>v. </em>Jewett, 12 <em>Bard. 502). (b.) </em>Non-performance of a promise m ade without consideration is not a cause of action, notwithstanding the plaintiff may have sustained special damage (Thorne <em>v. </em>Deas, 4 <em>Johns. </em>84).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-10\">\u00cdII. The pretended contract or agreement was against public policy. The combination between plaintiff and defendant, as alleged by plaintiff, was in derogation of the rights \"of the superintendent of common schools. He advertised for proposals that he might avail himself of the lowest bidder. The plaintiff attempted to defeat that arrangement by ascertaining if there were lower bids than his own. His conduct was a deliberate and contemplated fraud, such a fraud as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the law does not recognize (Thompson v. Davies, 13 <em>Johns. </em>115; <em>Comp. </em>396, 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>642; Harvey <em>v. </em>Leggell, 7 <em>N. Y. </em>176; Gray <em>v. </em>Hook, 4 <em>N. Y. </em>449 ; Brisbane <em>v. </em>Adams, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>129).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">IY. The evidence of the plaintiff does not make out any legal contract, <em>(a.) </em>There was nothing said about payment, and nothing said about <em>security. </em>It cannot be <em>presumed </em>the contract was complete,, unless terms were specified. When was he to be paid 1 How was he to be paid <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">Y. The evidence as to. usage was proper, and should have been allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-7\"><em>J). M. Porter </em>and <em>L. B. </em>Gould, attorneys, and of counsel for respondent, urged :\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0I\">That the question whether there was a binding agreement between the plaintiff and defendant in respect to that estimate, was submitted to the jury upon conflicting testimony, and their verdict is conclusive (Murphy <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 <em>Robt. 1).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-8\">II. The defendant\u2019s attempt to prove that by <em>custom </em>a roofer\u2019s estimate was not <em>considered </em>binding, was properly overruled (Sipperly <em>v. </em>Stewart, 50 <em>Barb. </em>62; Wadsworth v. Alcott, 6 <em>N. Y. </em>[2 <em>Seld.] </em>64).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-9\">By the Court.\u2014Mokell, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoW\">The testimony of the plaintiff was sufficient to authorize the assumption that the defendant agreed with the plaintiff that if the latter obtained the contract for the school building the defendant would, for a named price, do the roofing of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">In-accordance with such offer, the plaintiff reduced the amount of his estimate, and was awarded the contract. Upon being informed of that, the defendant said he would do the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">I do not see why this evidence does not establish a valid contract. The jury have found the facts upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>somewhat conflicting evidence, and we must assume that the contract was as testified to by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><em>First. </em>It had the element of mutuality. The defendant was to do the work, and the plaintiff was to pay the stipulated sum. Had the defendant performed, he could have recovered, as upon an express promise to pay; and such right grew out of his own obligation to perform, and which obligation inured to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Second. </em>There was a sufficient consideration. There was both a benefit and a possible injury to the plaintiff \u2014a benefit in being able to, successfully bid for the contract, and a possible pecuniary injury if the defendant failed to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Either of these elements\u2014certainly the concurrence of both\u2014made this a valid contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">It was not a\" contract against public policy. The defendant was not a competitor for the building contract. His proposal was to the plaintiff, and not to the school commissioners, and had not and could not, have had any influence upon other bids, and it did not in any way interfere with the general competition for the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Under an estimate, reduced in amount by the de- \u2022 fendant\u2019s proposal, the plaintiff became bound to perform his contract with the school commissioners ; and I can see no good reason, in law or morals, why the defendant should be absolved from his agreement or saved from his default.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The several questions which were excluded were properly overruled. They called for proof of customs and usages, which, if they exist, cannot be allowed to alter or limit the legal effect of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">In the view we have taken, there was no error in the charge, and the verdict should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">Curtis and Speir, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
