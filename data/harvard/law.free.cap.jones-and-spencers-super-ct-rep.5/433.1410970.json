The New York &amp; Boston Express Company received from plaintiff a machine for printing in colors, attached to an ordinary Gordon press, at Boston, to transport to New York American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Institute, for exhibtion. It seems to have been well packed at Boston. It was handled six times before it was received by defendants, from New York &amp; Boston Express Company in New York, including the handling when put into defendants\u2019 wagon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\">The complaint charged the defendants with so carelessly and negligently transporting the said press and attachment, that the same was broken and damaged to plaintiff\u2019s damage, one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">The referee found as a fact, that the defendants, transported the same so carelessly and negligently that the' press and attachment were greatly broken and damaged, and were delivered to the plaintiff in so bad and damaged a condition that it was found impossible to repair them, arid that they were subsequently sold by the plaintiff for the sum of fifty dollars, that being* the highest price that plaintiff could obtain for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">And as matter of law, that the defendants are liable to pay to the plaintiff the sum of one thousand two hundred dollars, which sum is the difference between the value of the press and attachment when injured and the value of the same after the injury aforesaid, with interest thereon from October 31, 1870, being two hundred and ten dollars, amounting together to the sum of one thousand four hundred and ten dollars, for which the plaintiff are entitled to judgment in this action against the defendants, besides costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-8\"><em>Barrett, Redfield &lt;&amp; </em>Sill, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-9\"><em>James S.

Consequently, such findings, if free from error in the reception and rejection of testimony, can not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">But the exceptions disclose several errors in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On the question of damages, the plaintiffs first called Israel Gr. Rice, who testified that he was a solicitor of patents at Cambridge, Mass., and one of plaintiffs\u2019 directors ; that he could not give the exact value of the attachment; that it cost over one thousand dollars, nearly one thousand five hundred dollars, and that the attachment and press together were worth one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The plaintiffs then called Edmund Rice, the president of the company, who, after having testified that this attachment was the first one -made; that it was gotten up expressly for exhibition ; that he could not say positively whether this one was the first one sent out; that it was the first one made, and, as he believed, the first one sent away ; and that steel bars had been used for this, when cast iron had been used for the others, was asked the following question : \u201cHave you sold similar attachments to the one in question <em>f </em>\u2019 The defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the question, but the referee overruled the objection, and the witness, against defendants\u2019 exception, answered that he had. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then asked : \u201c For how much ?\u201d Defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the question on the ground, \u201cthat it called for immaterial testimony, and that which was improper, in that the market value of the machine was the only proper criterion, and this did not show the market value.\u201d The referee overruled the objection, and the witness, against defendants\u2019 exception, answered: \u201cFor two hundred and seventy-five dollars.\u201d This ruling was clearly erroneous, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>raised a collateral issue leading to a comparison between attachments -that were somewhat, but not exactly, alike (Gouge v. Roberts, 53 <em>N. Y. </em>619).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then recalled the witness, Israel G. Bice, and such witness testified as follows: \u201cThe debris of the machine was sent back to Boston to Messrs. Hartnett &amp; Solomon, who were printers\u2019 machinists at Boston. They stated that it was so injured as to be worth only fifty dollars.\u201d The defendants\u2019 counsel duly objected to the last statement as hearsay and incompetent, and moved to strike it out on that ground. But the referee overruled the objection and denied the motion, to each of which rulings the defendants separately excepted. The witness answered: \u201cThey purchased it at that sum, the highest price plaintiff could obtain therefor.\u201d There can be no doubt that these rulings involved another error.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The question therefore arises whether these errors are of sufficient importance to call for a reversal of the judgment. The referee adopted as the measure of damages in this case the difference between the value of the press and attachment when inj ured and the value of the same after the injury. It has been conceded that by this he did not mean market value. Indeed, no evidence of any market value was given. The theory of the referee evidently was, that as the machine with the attachment was a new invention and the first of its kind, it had no market value as such, and that, consequently, it was proper to adopt the value of the labor and materials expended and used in making it.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Assuming, but not deciding, that he was correct in this, for the question is not free from doubt, especially as no foundation seems to have been laid by competent proof for the application of such rule, the first error, which was committed in the reception of evidence as to the price obtained for other attachments, might perhaps be overlooked. But I do not see how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the second error can be disregarded. The case ex-, pressly states \u2022 that the testimony of Israel Gr. Rice thus erroneously admitted was all the testimony tending to show the pecuniary value after the injury. As to such value it consisted of hearsay, and as to the inability of the plaintiff to obtain more than fifty dollars, it consisted of a mere conclusion. It was clearly incompetent. But the referee not only admitted it, but he also adopted it as the basis for his finding as to such value. A new trial must therefore be ordered. Worrall v. Parmelee, 1 <em>N. Y. </em>519 ; Williams <em>v. </em>Fitch, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>546.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The decision in Murray <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 Duer, 412, as shown in Wilmot v. Richardson, 6 Duer, 328 (339), was reversed by the court of appeals solely on the ground that the admission of incompetent evidence, bearing upon the issues and duly excepted to, constitutes error which entitles the party excepting to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The judgment should be reversed, the order of reference vacated, and a new trial ordered, with costs, to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Monell, Oh. J. and Sedgwick, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
