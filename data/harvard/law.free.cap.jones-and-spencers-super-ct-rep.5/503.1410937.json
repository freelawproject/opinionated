Goodwin &amp; Company sold or delivered to the defendant, at his request or otherwise, goods, wares, or merchandise or machines, for which said defendant promised to pay the sum of six thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sand two hundred and seventy dollars, or any other sum as alleged in said complaint, except under conditions hereinafter set forth.\u201d ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-5\">For a further defense the answer averred, that in the year 1871, William H. Goodwin &amp; Company had for sale a machine and mold for the manufacture of cigars ; that to induce the defendant to ' use said machine and mold, in his own business as a manufacturer of cigars, said firm represented to him that said machine was a \u201cnew, useful and valuable machine for the purpose of such manufacture in an unusually rapid and economical matter, surpassing in all respects, in value, usefulness and efficiency any machine o then in use or known to the public ; \u201d that as a further inducement, said firm \u201cdid guarantee\u201d the defendant that said machine was in all respects a better machine than any other then in use, and that in case any improvement of any kind should be made in said machine or molds the firm would furnish to the defendant improved machines in the place of that sold to defendant, and that the firm would indemnify and save harmless the defendant against loss, damage- or expense which the defendant might incur, as a consequence of the use of said machine or from its failure in any respect in which it had been recommended by said firm ; that relying on such representations and guarantee the defendant took from the said firm a number of such machines and molds during the years 1870 and 1871,. and used them in his business; that said machines proved to be defective in many respects, and produced an article of merchandise which was unsalable, and that such machines and molds proved to, be a failure in each respect in which the same were recommended and guaranteed; that the defendant expended large sums of money .in preparing to use said machines and molds before he discovered their bad quality and failure, and that by reason of the poor quality of the cigars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>made by the machine in consequence of its defects, the defendant suffered great loss and damage in his business and business reputation; that by reason of the premises the defendant was damnified and suffered loss to the extent of ten thousand dollars, which sum this defendant counter claims and insists shall be allowed him in this action, and for which he may have judgment in his favor, and that said plaintiff shall not take anything whatsoever by reason of the several matters by him alleged and set forth in his said complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">The action was tried by a judge and jury, the plaintiff opening. The plaintiff testitied that the firm of William H. Goodwin &amp; Company formerly consisted \u25a0of himself and his brother William H. Goodwin, who was then dead. He testified to a negotiation between himself personally and the defendant, for the sale of certain machines for,making cigars. He testified \u201cthe actual sale, the bargain, -was finally consummated between my brother and Mr. Hirsch for the first fifty machines. My brother accepted the offer which I had refused.\u201d On cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, he,testified : \u201cI have not personal knowledge ofj all I have been testifying about. I take the entry on the books as to dates. The first fifty machines he bought I refused to sell at the price he offered, but my brother sold them. I was not present at the conversation and know nothing about the transaction, except as reported to me by my brother. After my first interview with Hirsch I did not see him on the subject of purchasing the machines, until he bought the seventeen. These I sold him myself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">For the defense, the defendant was examined. In his testimony he gave no evidence that the plaintiff personally had made the representations or guarantees on which the answer averred the defendant took the machines. He was asked the question: \u201cState what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>was done between you and Mr. William H. Goodwin on the subject of your taking these machines and molds?\u201d And the further question : \u201c What, if any, agreement did you make with William H. Goodwin or Eben Goodwin in regard to the receiving at' y\u00f3ur store or factory of these cigar machines and molds ?\u201d The-questions were objected to, and excluded by the court, to1 which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">At the clos\u00e9 of the testimony, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground\" that the-evidence discloses that there is a party in interest' who is not joined in the pleadings. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">; Which motion was denied by the court,- and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">The plaintiff moved the court to direct the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-8\">The defendant requested the court to submit the disputed questions of fact to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">Which request the court then and there refused, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">The defendant requested the .court to submit to the jury whether there had been an unconditional sale of, the seventeen machines as claimed by the plaintiff, and also whether they were worth the prices claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">Which request the court then and there refused,, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-12\">The court then directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff for four thousand two hundred -and twenty-two dollars and twenty-four cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-13\">To which.direction the defendant then and there-excepted.. ; \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-14\">And the. jury found a verdict accordingly.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-15\">The court directed the exceptions to be heard in the-first instance at the general term, and in the meantime,, proceedings.on the verdict to be stayed. . - \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-16\"><em>Arthur, Phelps. &amp; Knevels, </em>attorneys, and Benj <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>K. </em>Phelps, of counsel for plaintiff, urged:\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akk\">The testimony offered of conversations between Pearl and the witness Boehme were properly excluded. Conversations between two outsiders, neither of them parties to the action, could in no aspect be competent,' especially as there was no pretense that the conversation,. whatever it was, was ever communicated to either of the parties to the action. Nor is it bettered by the assumption that Pearl had an interest in the machines. It would have been equally inadmissible if it had related to conversation between plaintiff and witness. It was as to what was said before the contract or bargain was-made. It could not have influenced the defendant in making the contract, because it was not communicated to. him, and being before the bargain, it can not be used as an admission by the party in interest as to what the bargain was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">II. As to the conversations with Wm. H. Goodwin, deceased, the questions put to defendant, were all properly excluded by the court. They were all plainly within the prohibition of the Code, \u00a7 399, as amended by Laws of 1869, and as construed by all the authorities (Clark <em>v. </em>Smith, 46 <em>Barb. </em>30 ; Dyer <em>v. </em>Dyer, 48 <em>Id. </em>190; Stanley <em>v. </em>Whitney, 47 <em>Id. </em>586 ; Barrett v. Carter, 3 <em>Lans. </em>68; Hier v. Grant, 47 <em>N. Y. </em>278 ; Hoxie v. Allen, 38 <em>Id. </em>175), the objections were well taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">III. The only issue raised by the pleadings was, whether the sale was an absolute one, as claimed in the complaint, or one induced upon false representations and upon a guarantee, as claimed in the answer. After the evidence was in, there having been no application to amend the answer, the issue remained exactly the same. Unless the defendant had given evidence tending to show, and upon which the jury might find the guarantee set up in the answer, there was nothing to go to the jury, and the court was bound to direct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>verdict. There was no such evidence, and the direction was properly given. There was no evidence whatever of guarantee. If the case had been submitted to the jury, and they had found for the defendant, the court would have been bound to set it aside as against evidence, and therefore not to have directed a verdict for plaintiff, would have been error (Newkirk <em>v. </em>N. Y. <em>&amp; </em>H. R. R., 38 N. <em>Y. </em>158 ; Peo. exrel. Peck <em>v. </em>Police, 35 <em>Barb. </em>651 ; Goelet <em>v. </em>Ross, 15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>257; Deyo v. N. Y.

The injustice was committed of permitting the living partner to testify about his <em>portion </em>of the negotiation with defendant, while the latter was not allowed to give the story touching the other portions. <em>'2. </em>It was not only an injustice, but an illegality, and against the latter clause of section 399 of the Code\u2014a clause intend\u00e9d to protect such a defendant as the one at bar under all the evidence. The evidence shows that the negotiations were begun with the dead partner, and continued and perhaps consummated by the living one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">II. The court erred in excluding the testimony offered of conversation between Pearl and Boehme. It sought to adduce the declarations of an agent of plaintiff and one interested with him in the very suit being tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">III. The court erred in adjudicating that the answer admitted the making of the contract. If it did, why should plaintiff prove it ? '</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b524-9\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9p\">The defendant was asked several questions, which in their form called for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>his inferences and conclusions. These were properly excluded. It is unnecessary to give particular attention to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">He was asked other questions, which called for conversations with Wil'iam H. Goodwin, the deceased member of plaintiff\u2019s firm. These questions were properly asked if they were not excluded by the effect of section 399 of the Code of Procedure. It is not argued that these questions would have been admissible if the plaintiff had not testified as to his interview with the defendant, or that the sale was consummated in an interview between the defendant and the deceased partner. It is argued that his testifying to these matters permitted the questions, since it is provided by the last clause of the section, that the prohibition shall not extend to any transaction or communication to which any such survivor shall be examined on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">I think the plaintiff was at liberty to testify to that part of the negotiations which took place between him and the defendant personally, without opening the door to testimony as to what was done between the deceased partner and the defendant personally, and which closed the negotiations. The clause, saying that the prohibition shall not extend to a transaction, &amp;c., clearly refers to such a transaction as could not be testified to by the previous terms of the section. That is a personal transaction between a witness and the deceased. In a general sense, if the deceased acted in part of a transaction, and the survivor in the rest of it, the whole is but one transaction, andif the survivor testifies to what he took part in personally, he testifies to the transaction. This is true, however, only in legal idea or judgment; for, as a matter of fact and actual occurrence, what the one did was not a part of what the other did. The section relates to testimony to facts or actual occurrences. For the purposes of the section what was done between a defendant and a sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u25a0vivor, not being a part of what was done with the \u25a0deceased, there is no ground for saying that the plaintiff having been allowed to give part, the defendant \u25a0should have been allowed to give the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u25a0' But the plaintiff did testify to what took place between bis deceased partner and the defendant, in saying that the deceased partner accepted the offer of the \"defendant. If this had the force of evidence, the question we are considering would, without doubt, have been allowed by the court. But it appeared that the witness was not present at any interview between the deceased and defendant. He knew of it only <em>from </em>what his brother said. Clearly, this had no force \u25a0as testimony. It was not evidence against the defendant. If the case had gone to the jury, there would be room to say that they might have-been influenced by it. But the case was disposed of by the /court, in whose mind this had no weight whatever. It \u2022must be treated as if no evidence had been given as to the interview between the defendant and the deceased, and as not permitting the defendant to testify as to that interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It will be observed that the case does not call for any decision as to the result of testifying to a communication between a defendant and a living partner, which in itself contained such a reference to what was -said or done between a deceased partner and the defendant, that a knowledge of the latter would be necessary to an understanding of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">But this brings up the consideration of whether if the court did reject this hearsay testimony, and the case was left upon an incomplete negotiation between the parties, in which the price was not fixed, .and as to which there was conflicting evidence, it \u25a0was correct, to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, on the assumption that a complete contract appeared in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>case in.behalf of plaintiff, and that there was no evidence to take the defense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">. I am of opinion that the answer admitted all that the plaintiff would have been called on to maintain if the answer made an issue with the averments of the complaint.- The first paragraph of the answer is the one alone which makes any pretense to deny any allegation of the complaint. That denies that the defendant bought any goods of the firm of William H. Goodwin &amp; Company \u201cexcept upon the conditions hereinafter set forth.\u201d The complaint had averred nothing as to conditions, and the clause quoted is in no sense a denial of anything in the complaint. It is insensible unless it is construed, that he denies that he bought any goods, absolutely as stated in the complaint, but he admits he did, conditionally, and upon the condition afterwards stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">. In looking to the rest of the answer, we find no allegations of a sale upon condition. Certain representations are alleged to have been made (but not fraudulently) as inducements to the defendant to purchase, and also \u201ca guarantee\u201d in respect of the goods is alleged. These representations and this guarantee are not inconsistent with the defendant having bought the goods and promised to pay, as alleged in the complaint. They rather imply that he did. He does not claim that the price was improperly averred in the complaint. These averments of. the answer do not annul the contract of sale, stated in the complaint, but furnish an independent defense which he should affirmatively maintain. On this state of. the issue, the plaintiff had nothing to prove, but defendant was to prove his affirmative defense. He sought to do this by the questions as to the interviews between himself and the deceased partner, which we have considered to be inadmissible. He farther gave some testimony that .he made certain statements to the plaintiff. The circa m-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>stances under which they were made were such, that it would be a question for the jury whether the plaintiff\u2019s silence or replies were not virtually an admission of the truth of the statements. The defendant\u2019s evidence as to the substance of these statements was vague and disconnected. It was so uncertain that it is best not to weigh on appeal several delicate considerations' that arise from it, especially in view of the character of another exception that we now refer to.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The defendant had testified that while the preliminaries to the sale were on foot, the plaintiff saicl to him, in reference to the price of the machines, \u201cMy brother and Mr. Pearl have the entire control of this machine business, and whatever arrangement they may make, I shall be satisfied and content with.\u201d After this testi- , mony, \u00e1 witness, who proved that he was foreman of the defendant, and in charge of his shop, was asked, \u201cState when ,Mr. Pearl first- came to Mr. Hirsoh\u2019s place and spoke to you about the mode and manner in \u25a0which those machines were at your place ?\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel further offered to prove, in connection with the question, after it had been objected to and excluded, that the time referred to was before the delivery of any of the machines. The court ruled that declarations of Pearl, in the presence of William H. Goodwin or Eben Goodwin, would be allowed, but those made to another party should be excluded. The defendant\u2019s counsel then,further offered to prove by the witness, a conversation with Pearl about the contract which was to be entered hito. Exceptions were duly taken. In view of the testimony that the plaintiff had \u2022said that his brother and Pearl had sole control of the machine business, Pearl\u2019s oral statements in the course of the negotiation, might have been part of the oral agreement, or an inducement to the making of the contract. They were alleged to have been made to the defendant\u2019s foreman. If communicated to the defend-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ant by the witness, and acted upon, there can be no doubt they were evidence. It not appearing that they were so communicated that it could be left to the jury to say that they were part of the contract, or of the inducement that led to it, the general objection that was taken might have been good, if the ruling of the court had not been that Pearl\u2019s declarations to any one, except made in the presence of one of plaintiff\u2019s firm, were not evidence. This was, in substance; a ruling that defendant should not give the evidence proposed, although the declarations were communicated to the defendant. After that, the defendant could not do otherwise, than deem that to be the law of case. Moreover, from all that passed, I think we can see that no question could have been intended to be raised by plaintiff, as to Hirsclr s foreman having told Hirsc-h, what was said. Of course, questions of that character should be excluded, if it appeared that the statements of Pearl did not- make part of the contract, or of the inducement that led to the ccntracj. Mere colloquial narrations of an agent do not bind the principal.
