D. </em>McCarthy, of counsel for defendant, argued</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfK\">The term <em>agent </em>is of very extensive signification, and includes every class of persons who are employed by a <em>principal </em>to do some act for him.- The term includes factors and <em>brokers.' </em>S. M. Saunders was in fact the agent or <em>broker </em>of Joseph Spyer &amp; Co., the plaintiffs, at and previous to the time he claims to have acted as <em>agent </em>for' defendant Pisher in making the pretended purchase and sale. An agent must faithfully serve his principal.. He is bound to the exercise of all his <em>skill, ability </em>and <em>industry </em>in favor of his principal. As an agent to-sell, it is his duty to get the highest fair price, and no-<em>agent </em>or <em>trustee </em>can deal with the. subject matter of.' his trust except for the <em>benefit of his principal </em>(McDonald <em>v. </em>Lord, 26 <em>N. Y. </em>404-407). And the defendant was as much entitled to all the skill, ability, &amp;c., of Saunders, as were the plaintiffs, and his duties to each were inconsistent one with the other. A person cannot act as the <em>agent </em>of both parties in the making of a contract, &amp;c., when each is entitled to the benefit of his judgment, &amp;c. (Utica Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Toledo Ins. Co., IT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Bar. </em>133 ; N. Y. Central Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>National Protection Ins. Co., 14 N. <em>Y. </em>(4 <em>Kern.) 85 </em>; Moore <em>v. </em>Moore, 1 <em>field., </em>6 N. <em>Y. 256 </em>; Terwilliger <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>59 Bar. </em>9 <em>; </em>Same case affirmed, 44 N. <em>Y. </em>237; Reed <em>v. </em>Warner, <em>5 </em>Paige, 650; Claflin <em>v. </em>Farmers\u2019 &amp; Citizens\u2019 Bank, 24 <em>How. Pr. </em>1 ; Capard <em>v. </em>Heriman, 6 <em>Bosw. </em>8). The pretended sale being <em>for </em>upwards of fifty dollars, and no part having been delivered, and no part of the purchase price paid, and no <em>note </em>or memorandum of such pretended contrsct made in writing and <em>subscribed by the party to be charged </em>thereby, was void under the statute, &amp;c. (3 <em>R. S. </em>5th ed. 221, 222). The statute of frauds requires an <em>actual manual subscription </em>at the end of the agreement or memorandum <em>by the party </em>by whom the same is to be' made, and a printed name is not. a sufficient subscription within the statute of frauds (Viele <em>v. </em>Osgood, 8 <em>Bar. </em>180; James <em>v. </em>Patten, 6 N. <em>Y. </em>[2 <em>field.] 9 </em>; Justice <em>v. </em>Lang, 42 N. Y. 493 ; Same Case, 52 N. <em>Y. </em>323). The pretended memorandum or bill of sale and purchase is not signed by the defendant, <em>either </em>individually, nor is his name signed or appear thereto signed by any person who claims or might even had authority to do so. To bind the defendant his name must be either subscribed by himself or by his authorized agent for that purpose. Said memorandum is in fact signed individually by S. M. Saunders, and the additional words,wine and spirit broker,\u201d adds nothing\u2014is of no binding character\u2014is a <em>descriptio persona </em>(Sheldon <em>v. </em>Hoy, 11 <em>How. Pr. </em>12). Where, upon the face of the broker\u2019s note of sale, delivered to the defendant, were indorsed, \u201cI agree to this contract,\u201d and <em>signed by </em>him, and on the one delivered to the plaintiff were indorsed, \u201c we agree to accept of the draft for this .contract,\u201d and <em>signed by </em>them, held a sufficient subscription (Dana <em>v. </em>Fiedler, 1 <em>E. D. </em>Smith, 463; Same Case, 12 N. <em>Y. [2 Kern.) </em>40).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>This court has no jurisdiction. The summons was served upon the defendant at the city of Buffalo. Since the commencement of the action and the appearance of defendant, the act of 1873, conferring jurisdiction, has been declared by the court of appeals to be unconstitutional.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b109-5\">By the Court.\u2014Mouele, Oh.</author>\n<p id=\"A9d\">If this case presented the single question, whether a broker can act on behalf of both seller and purchaser of merchandise, so as to make a valid contract binding upon both, where the dual agency was unknown to one at least of the parties, and there was no subsequent recognition or ratification of the act, the verdict probably could not be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The general rule is, that, except for some purposes <em>(i. e., </em>signing a contract within the statute of frauds), a broker is forbidden to act for both parties, concealing his agency for one from the other. But the rule is confined to cases where the mutual agency is <em>concealed. </em>Under such circumstances, it is deemed to be incompatible with the duties of a broker to act for both. In the interest of the seller he would be bound to get the highest and best price; and in the interest of the buyer, to obtain the lowest price.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">But, as has been said, the rule is restricted to cases of'concealment or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">I had occasion to collect and review the cases on this subject, quite recently, in Rowe v. Stevens, decided at the January term, 1873, 35 <em>Supr. Ct. Rep. </em>139, which has since been affirmed by the court of appeals, and it is not necessary to repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The deduction from the cases is, that- if there is no concealment or fraud, and the parties are made aware that the broker is acting for both buyer and seller, the act is not incompatible with the broker\u2019s duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">If, therefore, the defendant, knowing of Saunders\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>authority to act for the plaintiffs, recognized and adopted the purchase, which had been made for him, by the same agent, such purchase was binding on the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The uncontradicted evidence established that the broker was acting on behalf of the plaintiff. The bought and sold notes contained that statement. It was communicated to the defendant, by the delivery of the sold note to him ; and he afterwards, by letter and in conversation, admitted the purchase, and with such knowledge of the broker\u2019s agency of the plaintiffs, ratified the act as that of his, the'defendants\u2019 agent, in making the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">He made no objection to the purchase on the ground of any want of authority on the part of the broker to bind him, but repudiated the sale for other and different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Under these circumstances, the purchase or the contract of purchase, was binding upon the defendant; and the motion to dismiss the complaint was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The objection that the contract was void under the statute of frauds, set up in the defendant\u2019s answer, was not taken at the trial, and, if it was important to consider it, it is too late to raise the question now.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">But Saunders had sufficient authority to bind the defendant; and his signing the contract as the defendant\u2019 s broker, took it out of the operation of the statute. To save a contract from the statute a broker may be the agent and may sign for both parties (Allan <em>v. </em>Aguira, 5 <em>N. Y. Leg. </em>Obs. 380; Dilworth v. Bostwick, 1 <em>Sweeny, </em>581).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Another objection taken at the trial, was, that this court has not jurisdiction of the person of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The summons had been served in the city of Buffalo, and it was claimed that a summons to commence an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>action in this court could not be served out of the city and county of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The act of 1828, organizing this court (\u00a7 5), gave it power to hear, try and determine all <em>local </em>actions arising within the city and county of New York, and all <em>transitory </em>actions, although the same may not have arisen therein ; and the only restriction to its jurisdiction over such actions, was, that it should have no power to send any process into any other county, except writs of subpoena, and attachments to enforce their obedience.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The act conferred no equity jurisdiction whatever; it ha d merely common law powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">By section 33 of the Code, equity powers were conferred on the court (Forrest <em>v. </em>Forrest, 25 N. <em>Y. </em>501) ; and its common law; jurisdiction extended to all actions, where <em>all </em>the defendants resided or were served in this city. In 1852, it was' further extended to cases where <em>one </em>or more of several defendants, jointly liable on contract, resided or were served therein. Under that amendment this court held, that in actions of joint liability upon contract, if <em>one </em>of the defendants <em>resided </em>in this city the summons might be served in any other place (Porter <em>v. </em>Lord, 13 <em>How. Pr. </em>254). And in actions enumerated in sections 123 and 124, this court was given co-equal jurisdiction with the supreme court, and the summons may be served in any part of the State (Kerr <em>v. </em>Mount, 28 <em>N. Y. </em>659). In that case Judge Dent\u00f3 says (p. 664), in the actions enumerated in these sections the superior court has jurisdiction <em>without regard to the defendant's residence. </em>And hence it has not, I believe, been doubted, that in these actions, not only may the process of this court be served in any county in the State, but it may be served by publication, or any of the other modes of substituted service (see also, Varian <em>v. </em>Stevens, 2 Duer, 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In giving a construction of the several acts regulat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing the jurisdiction of the court, we determined in a recent case (Van Pelt <em>v. </em>United States Metallic Spring Co., 13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>N. <em>S. </em>325), that under these statutes, this court, except in respect to the person of the defendant, had co-equal jurisdiction with the supreme court, in all cases, where an \u201c <em>action </em>\u201d could be maintained in either court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Such was the jurisdiction of the superior court, when article 6 of the constitution was agreed to in convention, and adopted by the people. The court was u <em>continued^ </em>with the powers and jurisdiction it <em>then </em>had, \u201c and such <em>further </em>civil and criminal jurisdiction as might be conferred bylaw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">.Under the power thus granted, the act of April, 1873, was passed, giving to this court, ^original jurisdiction, at law and in equity, concurrent and co-extensive with the supreme court, of all civil actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In Landers <em>v. </em>Staten Island R. R. Co. (14 <em>Abb. </em>Pr. N. <em>S. </em>346), the court of appeals has held, that an act passed in 1871 <em>(Sess. Laws </em>1871, p. 555), extending the territorial jurisdiction of the city court of Brooklyn, was unauthorized by the constitution, and in deciding that case, they have incidentally held that the act of 1873 was open to the same objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The argument of the court of appeals, is, that these city courts having been <em>created </em>local courts, were merely continued as such by the judiciary article, and could not have power given to them, to send their process into eve'ry part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">That the superior court was created a local court, with limited <em>territorial </em>jurisdiction, is not denied. But the legislature which created it, has assumed from time to time to exercise, and has exercised, the power of <em>adding- </em>to and <em>enlarging </em>its jurisdiction in respect and to the extent enumerated in- sections 33, 123, and 124, of the Code, and has authorized the court, in the enumerated actions, <em>to send its process into any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>county in the </em>State, and, as construed in Kerr <em>v. </em>Mount <em>(supra), without regard to the defendants' residence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It is to be presumed that the framers of the judiciary article understood the nature and extent of the <em>then </em>existing jurisdiction of the courts ; and that the power of the legislature over them had not been deemed inflexible. There had been added to them equity powers, and they had brought within their common law jurisdiction, a large class of cases and <em>persons, </em>other than such as were embraced within the original statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The legislature having exercised these powers when those courts remained legislative courts, the intention of the makers of the judiciary article may reasonably have been, to leave subsequent legislation as untrammeled as it had theretofore been ; and when they gave the power to add such <em>\u201cfurther\" </em>jurisdiction, they intended to authorize some <em>other </em>jurisdiction than such as it already possessed, which was then, except in the person of the defendant in some actions, co-extensive with the jurisdiction of the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Indeed, except in enlarging its <em>territorial </em>jurisdiction, in the exceptional actions, it is difficult to see, what <em>\u201cfurther\" </em>jurisdiction can be given to it. It already had jurisdiction over both local and transitory actions, and over all equity proceedings, with a limitation as to residence or service in the city only as to such actions as were not embraced in sections. 123 and 124 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The court, however, in the Landers case has, by its decision, limited the term <em>\u201cjurisdiction\" </em>to the object, and denied its application to territory or persons of suitors ; and, therefore, that \u201cfurther civil jurisdiction,\u201d has respect to the subject matter and cause of action only. This may be so, but much of the previous legislation would seem to indicate, that jurisdiction over the person, and the cases in which it could be acquired, and the mode of acquiring it, entered largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>into the views of the legislature. The <em>argumentum ab </em>inconvenienti, of \u201chauling men and women, from distant parts of the State, who had never been within the limits of the city, within its power, and subjecting them to its jurisdiction,\u201d can have but little force in view of the same result ensuing, if the action was in the supreme court, with the <em>same </em>city designated as the place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Nevertheless, the Landers case is authoritative upon this court, and following it, we must hold that the summons in this case was not so served as to give this court jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, and unless the objection has been waived, it must be held to have been well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The defendant appeared generally, and answered without alleging want of jurisdiction as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">A voluntary appearance of a defendant was long since held to be equivalent to a personal service of the summons (Mahaney <em>v. </em>Penman, 1 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>34), And section 139 of the Code, as amended in 1857, was probably suggested by the decision of the court of appeals in Burcle <em>v. </em>Eckhardt (3 <em>N.
