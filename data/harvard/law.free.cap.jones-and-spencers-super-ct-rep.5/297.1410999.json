Sanford several sums of money as security for services to be rendered, and responsibility to be incurred by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\">\u201cThatthe defendants performed services, and incurred responsibility upon the security of the said several sums, and sustained loss upon the responsibility so incurred to an amount exceeding the sums so received by them, which sums herein mentioned are the same mentioned in the said complaint.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-10\">The defendants moved for a discovery of the plaintiff\u2019s books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-11\">The petition for the discovery alleged that William H. Sanford was a former cashier of the plaintiffs, and who, as the plaintiffs aver, while acting as such cashier, wrongfully and dishonestly received and appropriated to his own use, money and other property belonging to and in the possession of the plaintiff to a large amount, and that the moneys so paid by him to the defendants were a portion of the moneys so wrongfully received and appropriated by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-12\">The petition then alleges \u201cthat all the moneys paid by said Sanford to your petitioners as security, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>their said answer stated, were paid by checks drawn by said Sanford upon the plaintiff, and that said checks were all paid by the plaintiff upon presentation, and your petitioners verily believe, and therefore aver, that the said plaintiff, that is to say. its president and director, or some of them, were well informed of the drawing and payment of said checks, as above alleged, and that the same were paid from time to time with their knowledge and assent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">\u201c Tour petitioners further show, that the said plaintiff has in its possession, or under its control various books of record and account, which contains various entries relating to the said checks and the payment thereof by plaintiff, that is to say: \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">Then follows a list of several books, and the petition concludes with the usual allegations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">The plaintiffs, in answer to the petition allege, that \u201c Sanford, their cashier, absconded in July, 1869. That certain of the books and accounts, of which a discovery was sought, were kept under the immediate direction of Sanford, and contained his original entries.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">\u201c That it was discovered that Sanford was a defaulter to a large amount, which defalcation had been concealed by false entries in said books and accounts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">The plaintiffs then alleged \u00a3\u00a3 that the delivery by said Sanford to defendants of plaintiffs\u2019 said moneys, was, so far as is known, effected by his drawing in his official capacity as cashier, a regular cashier\u2019s check upon plaintiffs, in favor' of defendants, for each sum of said moneys. That defendants took such cashier\u2019s checks from said Sanford, indorsed the same, drew the plaintiffs\u2019 money thereon, and applied it to pay said Sanford\u2019s indebtedness to them for said losses in gold and stocks, and that Sanford thereupon, in every instance, concealed and covered up his said misappropriation of said moneys by means of said false and deceptive entries, as hereinbefore stated. And depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>nent says, that the discovery and inspection which defendants now seek, is a discovery of said false and deceptive entries, except so far as their application relates to the cashier\u2019s checks themselves, and the said Sanford\u2019s individual account, and his checks drawn against the same, which last plaintiffs have been at all times ready and willing to produce and discover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">But the plaintiffs say that they believe it is not possible for them to prove by competent evidence the said false and defective entries, unless they shall be able to call, \u201c <em>and shall call </em>\u2019 \u2019 said Sanford to prove the same. And they are advised that it would be contrary to justice to compel them to discover such false and deceptive entries when the proof of their falsity can be obtained only by the evidence of said Sanford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">The motion was granted, and the plaintiffs were ordered to make discovery as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\"><em>First. </em>Copies of checks drawn upon the plaintiff by William H. Sanford, individually, during the years 1867, 1868 and 1869, and list of all checks drawn upon said plaintiff during the said years by William H. Sanford, as cashier of the plaintiff, and which were paid by Sanford to the defendants, or which are made, payable to the order of the defendants, or bear the defendant\u2019s indorsement or stamp, the list to furnish the numbers, dates, amounts, names of payees and indorsers of said checks respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\"><em>Second. </em>Copies .of the stubs of the checks so drawn by the cashier of the plaintiff upon the plaintiff during the years 1867, 1868 and 1869, to the order of the defendants, or which bear their indorsement or stamp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\"><em>Third. </em>Copies of any entry or entries of or relating to the amount or date, or date of payment by the plaintiff, of any or either of the checks hereinbefore referred to as having been paid by William H.

F. </em>Smith, of counsel for appellant, urged :\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amz\">A discovery is not a matter of strict right, but rests in discretion <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 388 ; 2 <em>Ren. Stat. </em>199, \u00a7 21; Bowne <em>v. </em>Cribb, 20 <em>Wend. </em>682).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-9\">II. The court will not grant a discovery, where the discovery will tend to deceive (See Van Zandt <em>v. </em>Cobb, 12 <em>How. Pr. </em>544). This court has said, \u201cIt (a discovery) could not be exercised for inequitable purposes, or to create or promote litigation \u201d (Wood v. De Figaniere, 1 <em>Robt. </em>681, 686 ; see also, Bailey v. Dean, 5 <em>Barb. </em>297 ; Abery v. Williams, 1 <em>Vern. </em>27).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-10\">III. It would be inequitable to give to these defendants a discovery of the credit side of the cashier\u2019s account, composed of fraudulent entries, made by or under the direction of Sanford, the cashier, when it appears that these defendants took from the cashier checks signed by him, as cashier, to make good to themselves losses by stock speculations, when they knew, from the fact that the checks were cashier\u2019s checks, that they were taking the money of the bank. To give such a discovery is, in substance, to give to confederates in the wrong of the cashier, power to use the false entries made by their confederate, as the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>dence to complete, and carry out, a fraud begun bythe delivery and acceptance of the cashier\u2019s checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">IV. The order should be modified so as to exclude the credit side of the cashier\u2019s account from the discovery, and also such entries in other books as were carried to such credit side.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-6\"><em>Edwards &amp; </em>Odell, attorneys, and <em>Hamilton </em>Odell, of counsel for respondents, urged:\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APWq\">It is not denied that this account contains evidence relating to the merits of the defense herein. Mor that such evidence is material, and will (at least) tend to establish that defense. Mor that the account is in the possession of the plaintiffs. Mor that the evidence which it contains cannot be procured except by a discovery of the account. Under such circumstances a discovery is matter of right (Hoyt <em>v. </em>American Ex. Bk., 1 <em>Duer, </em>652 ; Lefferts <em>v. </em>Brampton, 24 <em>How. Pr.</em>258; Union Co. <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Co., 3 Daly, 171 ; Case <em>v. </em>Banta, 9 <em>Bosw. </em>595). Or, if regarded as discretionary, the discretion will be exercised in favor of the petitioners, not only for the reasons above stated, but also as matter of common justice, inasmuch as the controversy is between individuals on the one hand and a corporation on the other. For the defendants may be examined before trial. And upon such examination they may be compelled, by <em>subpoena duces </em>tecum, to produce and exhibit their books, papers and accounts (Central Nat. Bk. v. Arthur, 3 Sweeny, 144). But there can be no examination of the corporation, or of its officers, before trial (Goodyear v. Rubber Co., 48 <em>Barb. </em>522). Mor can its books be brought into court, at any stage of the case, by subpoena (La Farge <em>v. </em>La Farge Ins. Co., 6 Duer, 680 ; Bank of Utica v. Hillard, 5 <em>Cow. </em>419). Mor can other parties obtain access to them\u2014or inspection \u00f3f them\u2014except by this proceeding for a discovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">II. The plaintiffs object to the discovery asked for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>because they say\u2014(1.) Their books are unreliable\u2014 untruthful\u2014full of false and fraudulent entries. (2.) That such entries cannot be proven to be false and fraudulent except by the testimony of one man, whom they are unwilling to call, because they are unwilling to trust him as a witness. As presented in the affidavit of Mr. Coles, Judge Sedgwick properly treated all this as the mere opinion of a man who had \u201cno original knowledge\u201d of the matters to which he assumed to testify. But assuming it to be1 strictly true, it affords no answer to the motion. (1.) It was the plaintiffs\u2019 duty to see that their books were kept <em>correctly. </em>(2.) These false entries were made from time to time, through a period of two years and upwards. (3.) It is fairly inferable from the affidavit of Mr. Coles, that during all that time no examination was made by plaintiffs of \u201csaid books, and of Ms (Sanford\u2019s) account with the bank.\u201d (4.) It is not pretended that the discovery of these false entries was attended with \u2022any difficulty whatever. It might have been made at any time before had not the plaintiffs been guilty of gross neglect of duty. (5.) The defendants are \"in no way connected with the alleged falsification of the books, and are not to be held responsible for, or made to suffer on account of, the plaintiff\u2019 neglect. (6.) The only answer which is admissible to an application of this sort is a denial of the possession or control of the books, &amp;c., of which discovery is sought (Southart v. Dwight, 2 <em>Sandf. </em>672; Hoyt <em>v. </em>American Exchange Bank, 1 <em>Duer, </em>652).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">III. A denial of this petition will amount to an <em>exclusion of the evidence </em>which the plaintiffs\u2019 books contain. If it is pertinent and material to the defendants\u2019 case, they are entitled to have it (Morrison <em>v. </em>Sturges, 26 <em>How. Pr. </em>.178). If for any reason it is incompetent, that objection should be made and decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>at the trial, when the merits of the whole case are put before the court.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-5\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALb\">There has been a strict compliance with the statute and rules of court in the statements contained in the defendants\u2019 moving papers; and the application is brought within the usual principles governing the discovery of books and papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In cases where the production of books can be compelled by <em>subpoena duces tecum, </em>the provision of the Code allowing the examination of parties to the action has <em>practically </em>become a substitute for the mode prescribed by the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">But an action by or against a corporation is not among the cases where a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>would be effectual to compel the corporation to bring its books into court (La Farge <em>v. </em>La Farge Ins. Co., 14 <em>How. Pr. </em>26).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The only defense to this motion is that it is inequitable and unjust to compel the plaintiffs to discover the books kept by their defaulting, cashier, containing entries of false and deceptive credits, which, if unexplained, will exonerate the defendants from liability, and which cannot be explained except by the testimony of such cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">It is necessary in these applications that the books of which a discovery is demanded contain <em>material </em>evidence, which cannot be obtained in any other way, and those are the governing tests. If the demand is by a plaintiff, it must appear that the evidence will prove or aid in proving his cause of action ; if by a defendant, it must go in support of his defense. In either case, if the evidence is material, it must necessarily, to a greater or less degree, be detrimental to the adverse party; and it could, therefore, be always urged that a party ought not to be required to furnish his adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>with the weapons of attack or defense, especially as it would throw upon such party the necessity of explaining, or relieving himself from the effect of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">But I cannot perceive that any principle of equity or justice is violated by adhering to the common rules which control these applications. Discoveries of the nature sought in this case are quite usual. The evidence contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 books \"is material to the defendants ; and it is no answer to the application to say thaf the books contain entries which the plaintiffs can only explain by the testimony of their cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The defendants, dealing with the plaintiffs, had a right to assume that the cashier was acting.under the plaintiffs\u2019 authority; and, therefore, the entry of any of the transactions was the act of the plaintiffs. Upon that assumption, the entries are competent as evidence in the defendants\u2019 favor, and unexplained, they are material. Of course, if, as was suggested, the good faith of the defendants is successfully impugned, these assumptions cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The inequity, if any exists in this case, grows out of the alleged difficulty in explaining the entries of the defaulting cashier. But that is a difficulty that surrounds more or less every case, and must be looked upon as a misfortune, and not as affording a reason for defeating the established right of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">An exception cannot be made in favor of a corporation. If it was competent to require the production of their books by a <em>subpoena duces </em>tecum, their contents relating to the transactions between these parties might be received as proper evidence against the plaintiffs. But as such production cannot be compelled in that way, resort must be had to an order for their discovery ; but the order will have no greater or other effect than to bring the evidence within the reach of the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>seeking it. Its competency, sufficiency or materiality are questions afterwards to be disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">I think the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Cuetis and Speir, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
