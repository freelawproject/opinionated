The lease contained a, clause of re-entry in case of default being made in any of the covenants therein contained, and also contained the following clause : 1 \u2018And the said party of the second part also agrees and covenants to vacate the said house and premises on having two months\u2019 notice in writing, and being paid two hundred dollars as an equivalent for moving and giving up this lease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-9\">That in April, 1868, Morrison sub-let the lot in question to the plaintiff for one year from May 1, 1868; that plaintiff erected a frame building on the lot; that-in , 1868, B.

He also charged that the plaintiff could only be removed from the premises by due course of law, to which charge defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-14\">The defendants\u2019 counsel requested the court \u2022 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>charge, that the plaintiff must elect whether he will claim for the building, or rent; and that he can not require the jury to determine for him whether he is to. have one or the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">The request was refused, and defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff for one thousand six hundred and fifty-one dollars and thirty-three cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-7\">Defendants' moved for a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes, which motion was denied, and an exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-8\">From the judgment entered on the verdict, and the denial of the motion for a new trial, defendants appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-9\">\u2022 Arnoux, <em>Hitch &amp; </em>Woodford, attorneys, and <em>Wm. Henry </em>Arnoux, of counsel, for appellants, urged: 1.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANfS\">The cause of action set forth in the complaint herein was solely injury to business, whereby the plaintiff had been deprived of great gains and profits, and his business broken up to his damage, six-thousand dollars. 1. The legal construction of the complaint will bear no other meaning. All that is stated about the destruction of the building, and the conversion of property, is in aggravation of the loss sustained by breaking up the business, and not as distinct elements of damage. The judge, therefore, erred when the cause came on for trial, in refusing to hold that upon the pleadings, the issue presented is simply damages to \u25a0business by reason of the dispossession (James <em>v. </em>McKennan, 6 <em>Johns. </em>563; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 2 N. <em>Y. </em>360; People <em>v. </em>Ryder, 12 <em>Id. </em>437; Wright <em>v. </em>Delafield, 25 <em>Id. </em>266). It will be remembered, that the action is not an ordinary action under the code, but an action on the case under the statute (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>p. 516, \u00a7 49). 2. Clearly, the loss of money could not have been proved under the pleadings. The allegation of loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>personal property meant furniture and chattels only. ' In actions for the recovery of special damage it is essential to the validity of the declaration to show the damage particularly (Butler <em>v. </em>Kent, 19 <em>Johns. </em>228 ; Dumont <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <em>Denio, </em>322 ; Westwood <em>v. </em>Cowne, 1 <em>Stark. N. P. C. </em>172). 3. Even if the complaint should be held sufficient to allow the plaintiff to recover for the value of the building, the conver- . sion of the property, and the loss to the business, it did not warrant the admission of evidence as to the value of the use of the premises. When such evidence was offered on the trial it was specifically objected to, on the ground that there was no allegation of that kind in the complaint. The objection was overruled, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. This ruling was erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-7\">II. Upon the surrender to the defendants by Morrison of his term and right to notice, and upon their purchase from Milhau of the fee, the defendants became entitled to the immediate possession of the premises in question. The term of the plaintiff was ended, and he himself was a tresp\u00e1sser. 1. The right . reserved in the lease to Morrison to have sixty days\u2019 notice of the expiration of his term, was a personal covenant with him, and did not run with the land. It was error on the part of the judge to charge that the right to sixty days\u2019 notice reserved to Morrison, in his lease, of right belonged to the plaintiff, whether he had knowledge of it at the time or not. The charge is contrary to the law as laid down in the court of appeals, where it has been held that between the lessor and under-tenant there is neither privity of estate nor privity of contract (McFarland <em>v. </em>Watson, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>286). 2. The uncontradicted testimony of Morrison is, that he never communicated to the plaintiff his right to the .sixty days\u2019 notice, and that he did make his lease to him on the sole condition that it should terminate on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the sale of the property. The property having been sold, the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy, therefore, had terminated; \u201c The party who remains upon the land of another against his will, is there <em>prima facie </em>against right, and is bound to show circumstances which make such \u2022 possession lawful\u201d (Hayling v. Oakley, 8 <em>Exch. </em>545). \u201c The only safe and just rule, I believe to be the one established by authority, that the tenant holds over his term at his peril, and the owner of the term may treat him as a trespasser \u201d (Schuyler v. Smith, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>309; Conway v. Starkweather, 1 <em>Denio, </em>113; Rowan <em>v. </em>Lytle, 11 <em>Wend. </em>616). To the same effect are the following: Allen <em>v. </em>Jacquish, 21 <em>Wend. </em>628-631 ; McKay <em>v. </em>Mumford, 10 <em>Id. </em>353 ; Garner v. Hannah, 6 <em>Duer, </em>271; Smith, v. Littlefield, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>541; People y. Schack, 48 <em>Barb. </em>551 ; Parmlee v. O. &amp; S. R. R., 6 <em>N. Y. </em>74-81; Nichols v. Williams, 8 <em>Cow. </em>13-15; Witt v. Mayor, &amp;c., 6 <em>Robl. </em>449; Danforth v. Sargeant, 14 <em>Mass. </em>491. 3. The plaintiff being a trespasser, and the defendants having the right to the immdeiate possession, they were entitled to enter, and eject the plaintiff without being liable to him in damages therefor (Jackson v. Farmer, 9 <em>Wend. </em>201 ; Hyatt v. Wood, 4 <em>Johns. </em>150 ; Ives v. Ives, 13 <em>Id. </em>235 ; 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>174 ; <em>Taylor on Landl. and T. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 523, 531-2; Livingston v. Tanner, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>66 ; Wilde v. Cantillon, 1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>123 ; Jackson v. Morse, 16 <em>Johns. </em>200; Curl v. Lowell, 19 <em>Pick. </em>25 ; and see Sampson v. Henry, 13 <em>Id. </em>36 ; Mugford <em>v. </em>Richardson, 16 Allen, 76 ; Minor v. Stevens, 1 <em>Cush. </em>485; Meader v. Stone, 7 <em>Metc. </em>147 ; Curtis v. Galvin, 1 Allen, 215 ; Walton v. File, 1 <em>Dev. &amp; B. </em>567 ; Overdeer v. Lewis, 1 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>90 ; Frible v. Frame, 7 <em>J. J. </em>Marsh, 599 ; Johnson v. Hannahan, 1 <em>Strobhart, </em>313 ; Burling v. Read, 11 <em>Q. B. </em>904). 4, The defendants are not precluded by summary proceedings from asserting this right (Gault v. Jenkins. 12 <em>Wend. </em>488). In this ease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the officers executed an unlawful warrant under, the direction of the landlord. The court held, \u201cIf the defendants had acted under any other authority than the warrant, they would have been trespassers ; but under the orders of the landlord they were protected. The procuring the warrant did not deprive him of the power which he had without the warrant, nor did it prevent him conferring authority upon the defendants \u201d (Frazer <em>v. </em>Freeman, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>566).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-5\">III. For the errors committed during the progress' of the trial, material to the case,' the judgment should be reversed. Upon' the trial, the court erred in permitting the plaintiff to claim the value of the building and the lease for sixty days\u2019 rent. The plaintiff was bound to elect which of the two lie would claim ; he had no right to both. The court erred in permitting evidence to be given of the character of the building. It was placed upon the ground, but had foundations going into the ground. It was not a fixture, and was not governed by the law pertaining to fixtures. It was a house erected upon the land, and became, by its erection a part of the freehold, and passed to the defendants by the conveyance to them of the premises without reservation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\"><em>W. C. Carpenter, </em>attorney, and <em>James Clark, </em>of counsel, for respondent, urged : I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQ7\">The reversal, on \u2022 <em>certiorari, </em>of the proceedings under which the plaintiff was dispossessed, by the terms of the statute, gave him an absolute right to recover of the defendants \u2018\u2018 <em>any damages he may hace sustained by reason of such proceedings, with costs </em>\u201d (2 <em>Rev. Stat. Edm. Ed. </em>p. 533, \u00a7 49).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">II. The ground of reversal is wholly immaterial, and in no way affects plaintiff\u2019s right to recover (Manuscript opinion of Earl, commissioner, in\" Heyden v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Florence Sewing Machine Co. recently decided by the com. of appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">III. The reversal of the proceedings under which the dispossessory warrant issued, rendered the warrant nugatory, and placed those acting -under it, and all in complicity with them, in the attitude of trespassers by force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">IY. Even had plaintiff\u2019s tenancy in fact expired, defendants had no right to dispossess him by force (Flaherty <em>v. </em>Andrews, <em>2 E. D. Smith, 529 </em>; Jackson <em>v. </em>Ellsworth, 20 <em>Johns. </em>180).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">y. But plaintiff\u2019s tenancy had <em>not </em>expired at the time of his dispossession by defendants. 1. The premises had been let to him for a year from May 1, 1888. 2. Plaintiff being in actual possession of the premises at the date of the deed from Milhau (the owner of the fee) to the defendants, the latter were chargeable with notice of plaintiff\u2019s rights, and took subject to them (Tuttle <em>v. </em>Jackson, 6 <em>Wend. </em>213 ; Grimstone <em>v. </em>Carter, 3 <em>Paige, </em>421; Wright <em>v. </em>Douglass, 10 <em>Barb. </em>97; Williams <em>v. </em>Birbeck, <em>Hoff. </em>859; Gouverneur <em>v. </em>Lynch, <em>2 Paige, </em>300; Bank of Orleans <em>v. </em>Flagg, 3 <em>Barb.

The clause in the lease from Milhau to Morrison, (plaintiff\u2019s immediate lessor), entitling Morrison to two months\u2019 notice in order to terminate his tenancy, enured to the benefit of the plaintiff; and, after Morrison\u2019s lease to him, his tenancy could not be terminated before the expiration of the year which it had to run, without the notice to which his landlord was entitled. This notice, after plaintiff\u2019s rights had become fixed by his lease, could not be waived to his prejudice by any act of his landlord.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">yi. The request of defendants\u2019 counsel that the court should adjudge that the only issue raised by the pleadings is as to the damage to plaintiff\u2019s business, was properly refused. 1. The words, <em>to his great damage, viz., six thousand dollar sJ </em>relate to all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>wrongful acts previously recited in the complaint. 2. The conclusion of the complaint, <em>\u201cWherefore </em>the plaintiff demands judgment for the sum of six thousand dollars,\u201d &amp;c., implies that that sum is demanded by reason of <em>all </em>the matters previously stated.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-5\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">The plaintiff has his action of trespass on the case by force of section 49, of the article entitled \u201c.summary proceedings, to recover the possession of land in other cases\u201d <em>(2 Rev. Stat. Edm. Ed. </em>p. 533). The section literally says, if the proceedings shall be reversed or quashed, the tenant or lessee may recover against the person making application for removal any damages he may have sustained by reason of such proceeding, in an action on the case. The plaintiff is an under-tenant. As such, however, he is entitled to the same protection as his landlord the tenant is, against an illegal attempt to remove him from land of which he is in possession. The word tenant, as used, does not necessarily negative an under-tenant being included in its meaning. An under-tenant is a tenant of a certain kind. There is nothing to indicate that the section meant to distinguish tenant or lessee from under-tenant or sub-lessee. As used, the words were evidently employed to designate the party to the proceeding that might have an action on reversal. Beginning the section with, either party that prevails, in case of an application, may have an action for costs, there was in proceeding a necessity of describing the party against whom the proceeding was taken, as the party that on reversal might have an action on the case. That description was sufficiently given by saying tenant or lessee. The proceedings were neither in an action nor on a writ, and the party defendant had no proper title. \\ The same use of the word tenant occurs in section 29. There it evidently refers to tenant, lessee,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>assigns, under-tenant, or legal representative of such tenant or lessee, a.s particularized in section 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">This construction was taken as granted to be true, in Hayden <em>v. </em>Florence Sewing Machine Company, in the commission of appeals (MSS. opinion). Indeed, I am not certain that the learned counsel for the appellant disputed this in his able argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">He did take the position, that, if irrespective of the warrant, the defendants had a right to enter arid remove the plaintiff as a trespasser or intruder, the reversal of the proceedings did not prevent his lawfully exercising that right, although he also used the warrant as his authority (Gault <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 12 <em>Wend. </em>488). We need go no further here than to look into the facts as to the plaintiff being a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">By written lease, Morrison hired, in March, 1868, three lots, of which the <em>locus in quo </em>was a part, for one year from May 1,1868. He agreed in it to \u201c vacate the said house and premises on having two months\u2019 notice in writing, and being paid two hundred dollars as an equivalent for moving and giving up this lease.\u201d He further agreed, that \u201cif default shall be made in any of the covenants herein contained, then it shall be lawful for the said party of the first part to re-enter said premises and to remove all persons therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Before May 1, 1868, Morrison let the lot (of which the plaintiff was afterward dispossessed by summary proceedings), to the plaintiff, for one year from May 1, 3868.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">About July 26, 1868, Morrison made an agreement in writing with the owner of the fee (it having in the meantime been conveyed) in consideration of three hundred dollars. The tenor of the material part is : \u201c I hereby cancel said lease or agreement, and waive any further notice, and agree to vacate said premises on or before July 1 ( ), A. D., 1868, and give the full possession thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>On the trial, Morrison swore that about the time of making this, lie told the plaintiff he must move in two months. He also swore, that at the time of giving the one year lease to plaintiff, he told him that when he, Morrison, had to move, the plaintiff had to move. Again that he told him-\u201cwhat the lease said.\u201d The jury, if they had not relied on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, would, I think, by the weight of the evidence, have been bound to find that Morrison, at the time of letting to the plaintiff, informed him of the covenant of the lease as to vacating the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Morrison could not, by 1ns cancellation of the lease, annul the lease lie had previously made to the plaintiff 14 <em>Co. </em>429, Davenport\u2019s case, and note B). The plaintiff\u2019s interest in the land remained unimpaired, subject, we may say, to the terms and conditions of the lease to Morrison. Morrison, by that, xvas only bound to vacate upon two months\u2019 notice in writing. Even if he had had this notice, and that time had elapsed, the term was not absolutely or <em>ipso facto </em>-gone, but continued until the landlord otherwise elected. The words used permit the landlord to enter, but do not provide for the term ending, at all events, upon breach of the covenant (Beach <em>v. </em>Nixon, 9 N. <em>Y. </em>37). These provisions are strictly construed. Morrison had not received the notice in writing provided, nor even had two months passed from the time he cancelled his lease. Therefore, the plaintiff, at the time he was dispossessed, was lawfully in possession, his term not-having expired. The defendants had no rights against him as a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">As to the exceptions based upon the form of the complaint in its averments of damage, we must hold that the words \u201cto his great damage, viz: six thousand dollars, and his said business broken up,\u201d comprehensively referred to all the particulars of alleged trespass set forth in the same paragraph. The plaintiff had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>right to prove these particulars, so far as it was shown they were parts of the trespass complained of. Part of this was an alleged loss of money suffered by the plaintiff. There was a specific objection taken that this ioss being in the nature of special damage, the complaint should have specially alleged it. Such is the rule where the loss is not the natural and direct consequence of the trespass ; but in the present case, the trespass itself was alleged to be, in part, the taking and conversion of \u201c personal propeity of great value, to wit: two thousand dollars.\u201d Money in bills is certainly personal property. If there was uncertainty in the averment, and the defendantueeded greater particularity to enable him to defend, the code provides that a motion to compel certainty might be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On the trial no objection was made that it did not appear that the taking of the money was either by the pelendants or their authority, or that it was not a part of dispossessing under the warrant. The objection was that it was not competent to prove under the complaint the taking of the money. As the complaint alleged that personal property was wrongfully taken, I think the plaintiff had a right to give the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The question, \u201c what was the use of the premises worth from the time you were dispossessed to the year ending May 1, 1869 ?\u201d was objected to, on the ground, first, there is no allegation of this kind in the complaint; second, that the plaintiff' claims the value of the building and the rent also. As to the first ground, the complaint alleged that the defendants had thence hitherto deprived and kept the plaintiff out of his land and premises.\u201d As to the second ground, the plaintiff in this action was entitled to all the facts going to show the jury what damage had been suffered. The value of the building was one fact. The value of the use and occupation was another. Because the plaintiff gave the two in evidence, he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>not necessarily claim that he was entitled to the whole of both. Indeed, if there were any inconsistency in the claims, he was not bound to put himself on one or the other until he was called upon to elect. This demand, however, was not made. In the charge, the judge presented the matter in such a way that the defendants were not in danger of having double damages given against them. .</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On this same point, I do not think the eleventh request to charge was correct. It was \u201cthat the plaintiff must elect whether he will claim for the building or rent, and that he can not require the jury to determine for him whether he is to have one or the other.\u201d . I do not think if it were a case to put the plaintiff to an election, that he was bound to elect, until specifically called upon to do it. It was the duty of the jury to give damages, according to the facts in evidence, under the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">It was competent to give evidence as to the way in which the house was placed on the soil, at least to-show that no injury would be done to the freehold by its removal. The court left it to the jury in a correct manner to determine if the house were the plaintiff\u2019s or not (Tifft v. Herton, 53 <em>N. Y. </em>377; Voorhis <em>v. </em>McGinnis, 48 N. <em>Y. </em>278; Loughran <em>v. </em>Ross, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>792). In any view, the defendants were not injured by proof of the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">There were several minor exceptions, not calling for detailed attention, which I think should not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">On the whole case, I am of opinion that the judgwwat should be affirmed, with costs, to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Momell, Ch. J., and Fbeemiatt J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
