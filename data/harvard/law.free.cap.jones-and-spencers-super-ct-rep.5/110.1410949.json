The patent was used in the business of building docks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">The question of partnership was left to the jury, who retired to deliberate. Returning to the court room they asked the court for instructions on the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">1. Whether the advancing of money by Harden-burgh for the enterprise, made him a partner of Smith ; and, 2d. Whether the fact that Hardenburgh owned an interest in the adventure for which this work was performed, made him liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\">By the Court.\u2014The fact that Hardenburgh owned an interest in the patent to develop which this work was performed, does not necessarily of itself make him a partner of Smith, and liable to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-9\">But if you find that a partnership agreement actually existed, or that Hardenburgh held himself out or allowed himself to be held out as Smith\u2019s partner, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then duly excepted to such part of the judge\u2019s instruction as applied to the second of the said questions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-11\">The jury, found a verdict in favor of the defendant. A motion for a new trial was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-12\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment and order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-13\"><em>Foulke &amp; Malocsay, </em>attorneys, and of counsel for appellant, urged:\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0c\">The court erred in charging the jury, that the fact that Hardenburgh owned an interest in the adventure for which this work was performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>did not necessarily make Mm a partner of Smith and liable to the plaintiff. \u201c Interest, in contracts is the right of property which a man has in a thing. In practice, interest means concern, advantage, benefit. Such a relation to the matter in issue as creates a liability to pecuniary gain or loss from the event of the suit\u201d <em>(Bouv. L. Dic. </em>\u201cInterest\u201d). Defendant owning an interest in the patent had a right to share in the profits of the adventure. Such a right is sufficient to constitute one a partner as to third persons, even though expressly agreed that it should not be so as between themselves (Manhattan Brass &amp; Man. Co. v. Sears, 45 N. <em>Y. </em>799, and authorities cited). \u201cWhen a party who renders services or advances money to \u2022another for the prosecution of a particular business, looks beyond the personal responsibility of the latter to the creation of an interest in the resulting property or its proceeds, the transaction will be regarded as a partnership\u201d (Vaugh <em>v. </em>Carver, 1 <em>Smith Lead. Cas. </em>pt. II. p. 1311, and authorities cited).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">II. The instruction of the court upon the question put by the jury, had a decided influence on their verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-6\">III. The judgment ought to be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-7\"><em>Conners &amp; </em>Lyman, attorneys, and of counsel for respondent, urged:\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB-\">The law is well established that a person who is not a partner by estoppel <em>in </em>pais, is not liable to third persons for the acts of his co-owners unless he and they are really partners <em>inter se </em>(1 <em>Lindley on Part. </em>3 ed. 44, and cases there cited). But the jury have found that there was no partnership by estoppel, and that no partnership agreement actually existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">II. Hardenburgh was simply a co-owner, with Smith, of the patent. This, of itself, did not necessarily make them partners <em>(Exp. </em>Macmillan, 24 <em>L. T. </em>N. <em>S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>143 ; Cox <em>v. </em>Hickman, 9 <em>Q. B. If. J3. </em>47: 1 <em>Li-ndley on ' Part. </em>3 ed. 40-45).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">III. The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-6\">By the Court.\u2014Mohell, Ch.j.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">It is nqt clear that in the question put by the jury, and in the answer given to it by the court, the same <em>subject </em>was referred to. The jury alluded to an interest in the \u201cadventure,\u201d and the court to an interest in the \u201cpatent.\u201d There was some evidence which would seem to have authorized either.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">But it is apparent, I think, that the jury desired to be instructed as to the legal effect of an <em>interest </em>in that which constituted the business; whether it was the adventure or the patent, is not, therefore, very material.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The learned justice instructed.the jury that an interest in the patent, to develop which the work was performed, did not necessarily of itself make Hardenburgh a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">As a proposition of law, I think the instruction was correct. A mere community of interest was not sufficient to create a partnership (Porter <em>v. </em>McClure, 15<em>Wend. </em>187; Alger <em>v. </em>Raymond, 7 <em>Bosw. </em>418, 423 Sage <em>v. </em>Sherman, 2 <em>N. Y. </em>417, 427). There must also be an agreement to share in the profits and loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The part ownership of the defendant in the patent, did not necessarily, make him a partner, and the effect standing by itself, of such evidence, was correctly stated to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">In concluding his instructions the learned justice charged the jury that if they found a partnership actually existed, or the defendant held himself out, or allowed himself to be held out, as a partner, he was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">This left it for the jury to determine the only question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>No exception was taken to the charge, and the verdict was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">I think the judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
