Horthern Indiana Railroad Company, were to be and were preserved unimpaired, and that by the said agreement of consolidation, first hereinbefore mentioned, all just debts, guarantees, liabilities and obligations existing against either of the said companies, parties to said agreement, at the time of the taking effect of the said consolidation were to be, and were by said agreement, assumed, and to be provided for, paid and discharged by the said consolidated company; and all contracts and agreements existing between either of the said parties to the said agreement of consolidation and other companies, or with any person or persons, were to be carried out and performed by the said consolidated company; and the holder of shares of either of the said companies was to be entitled to receive, on the surrender of his certificate for the shares so held by him, a certificate for an equal amount of stock in shares at par in said consolidated company, which company was without delay to issue such certificates on demand of any such stockholder; and that by the terms of said agreement of consolidation, secondly hereinbefore mentioned, all just debts, guarantees, liabilities and obligations existing against either of the said companies parties thereto, at the time of the taking effect of said last mentioned consolidation, were to be and were thereby assumed, and were to be provided for, paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>and discharged by the said consolidated company;

and there was not in such distribution to be any difference made in the relative value of the capital stock of either of the said companies; and the said new corporation was, without unnecessary delay, after the perfection of its organization, to ' issue to the stockholders of the said two companies parties to the said agreement, or to holders of stock in the companies, forming the companies which by the said agreement were consolidated, in proportion to their respective interests, certificates of stock in the said new or consolidated corporation, so to be formed as aforesaid; and. that such new certificates of stock have been issued by the said defendant to the holders or many of the holders of stock in the corporations so as aforesaid previously existing, and so consolidated as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">That the said defendants, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Augustus Schell, James H. Banker, Azariah Boody, William Williams, Henry B. Payne, Amasa Stone, Jr., Stillman Witt, William L. Scott, Charles M. Bead, John A. Tracy, Albert Keep and William H. Vanderbilt are the directors of said corporation, and the said James H. Barker is the treasurer thereof. That said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>corporation has an office and place of business in the city of New York for the registry and transfer of its stock, and the management of its business, or portions thereof, at which office meetings of said directors are held. That the said treasurer performs the* functions of his office, or some of them, at and in the said city of New York. That the said defendants Cornelius Vanderbilt, Augustus Schell, James H. Banker, Azariah Boody, William Williams, Henry B. Payne, Amasa Stone, Jr., Stillman Witt, William L. Scott, Charles M. Read, John A. Tracy, Albert Keep and William H. Vanderbilt are severally holders and owners of shares of that portion of the capital stock of the said defendant The Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company not entitled to any preference or priority in the payment of dividends, and known or denominated as common or unpreferred stock, and that they, or some of them, were, prior to such mergers and consolidations as are herein set forth, the holders and owners of shares of that part of the capital stock of -the said corporation The Michigan Southern <em>&amp; </em>Northern Indiana Railroad Company, known as the common or unpreferred stock thereof, and which, by reason and in consequence of such mergers and consolidations as aforesaid, has become, and now is, a portion of the capital stock of the said defendant corporation the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, known as the common or unpreferred stock thereof, and which is not entitled to any preference or priority in the payment of dividends. That the number of holders of shares of the said common or unpreferred stock of and in the said defendant corporation The Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company is very great, numbering many hundreds ; that many of them are unknown to the said plaintiff, and cannot with diligence be ascertained by him ; that many of the same reside without the State of New York, so that is wholly impracticable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to bring them all before the court as parties defendant to this action; wherefore, in place of joining all the holders of the common or unpreferred stock of said corporation The Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company as defendants in this action, the said Cornelius Vanderbilt and the other individual defendants above named are joined as defendants therein, as such holders of shares of the common or unpreferred stock of said corporation, and as representing all other like holders and owners of shares of the common or unpreferred stock thereof, and so that they may represent and defend for the benefit of all such other stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">That since such formation of the said corporation, the Lake Shore &amp; Southern Michigan Railway Company, the said defendant in this action, such defendant, and the directors thereof, have realized net earnings from the business of said corporation to an amount more than sufficient to have paid the said arrears of dividends upon all the said guaranteed or construction stock of the said original corporation, the Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company, then or still outstanding, together with the interest thereon, from the time when the said several installments of such dividends in arrears became, by the agreement for the issue thereof, due and payable, and which were legally and properly applicable thereto, but have at all time\u00a9 neglected, omitted and refused to pay over the same, as or for said arrears of dividends, or for the interest thereon, and have used and applied all the net earnings of said existing corporation for purposes other than the payment of said arrears of dividends and interest; and that they have, from time to time, declared regular semi-annual dividends, at and after the rate of four per cent for each half-year, upon the capital stock of the said corporation, The Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, which included, and by means whereof there was paid, a dividend upoL i-he eiock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the said Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, issued in place of, and which represented, the common or unpreferred stock of the said Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company, and that the dividends so paid by the said Lake Shore <em>&amp; </em>Michigan Southern Railway Company, upon the stock thereof, issued in place of, and which represented originally the said common or unpreferred stock of the said Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company, exceeded many times the amount which would have been necessary to pay, satisfy and discharge all the arrears of dividends, together with interest thereon, due or owing to the said guaranteed or construction stock of the said Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company, so issued as aforesaid\u2014all of which dividends were so paid by the said Lake Shore Michigan Southern Railway Company, in violation of the rights and interests of the said plaintiff, and of all who stood in the same position with the said plaintiff, and were entitled to the like rights as holders of shares of the said guaranteed or construction stock so issued as aforesaid; and prayed that the court determine, adjudge and decree that the plaintiff was and is entitled to receive semi-annual dividends at the rate of ten per cent, per annum upon all the said guaranteed stock so held by him, from the time of the original subscription therefor, to wit, from the first day of June, 1857; and was and is entitled to receive interest on the sums to which the said several dividends would have amounted from the time when the said payments ought severally and respectively to have been made, and was and is entitled to such payments, whether the net earnings of the said Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company were in each year sufficient to enable the said company to make said payments out of said net earnings or not; or if it should be held that the plaintiff could not legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>compel the said company to make such payments from year to year, except out of its net earnings, then that an account be taken and stated by, and under the direction of, this court, and that the net earnings of the said company in each year, for and during the whole of the period last aforesaid, might be ascertained, stated and adjudged: and that thereupon it might be declared and adjudged that the net earnings of said company were sufficient in each of said years to have paid, and that therefore the said company, and the directors and officers thereof, ought to have paid such dividends of ten per cent, per annum, semi-annually, on the'first days of June and December in each year, from and \u2022 after June 1, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">But if, on such accounting, it should be found that such net earnings were not sufficient for and during any year or years, or part thereof, to pay thereout such dividend, then that it might be adjudged and declared by the court that said plaintiff vjas and is entitled to such dividends, together with interest on the same from the several times when the same ought respectively to have been paid, out of the future or subsequent earnings of said company, before any part of the same could be paid as dividends to any holder of any of the common or unpreferred stock, or applied in payment or satisfaction of any claim or demand against, or liability or obligation of, the said company, created after the issue of said guaranteed or construction stock; and that the said corporation, the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, and the said directors and treasurer thereof, hereinbefore named as defendants, and their successors in office, might be, by the judgment and decree of this court, required and compelled specifically to perform the said contract and agreement, so as aforesaid' made and entered into by the said Michigan Southern &amp;

and then prayed that the defendants might be restrained by a temporary injunction and by final judgment, from declaring or paying any dividend or dividends whatsoever upon so much and such part of the capital stock of the said Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, as has been issued in place of, or which represents, the said common or unpreferred stock of the said, corporation, the Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company, as the same existed at the time of the. first consolidation hereinbefore mentioned, until the said claims and demands of the said, plaintiff and all other persons, holders of any of the said shares of the guaranteed or construction stock hereinbefore mentioned, who have rights similar to those of said plaintiff and are entitled to like relief, shall be paid, satisfied and discharged in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">The defendants, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Augustus Schell, James H.

A material part of that relief is, or may be, to enjoin and restrain those defendants, as directors and treasurer, from declaring or paying any dividends upon .the common stock of this corporation, until the arrears of dividends upon guaranteed stock are paid and satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">III. A cause of action does exist against the individual defendants demurring, as directors. It appears that the payments in question were of the technical nature of <em>u-dividends,,:i </em>to the payment of which, the act of the board of directors in declaring the dividend and making it payable, was essential. And the declaration of the dividends by the directors is essential, and therefore the directors are proper parties defendant in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">IV. The' parties demurring are also proper parties defendant, on the ground that the dividends in question are withheld, needlessly, improperly, and in violation of the contract which the original corporation had made and violated, and which the present corporation assumed, and has also violated. It was held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>supreme court of Connecticut, in Pratt <em>v. </em>Pratt, 33 <em>Gmn. </em>446, that a corporation and its directors are trustees, and as such may be called into a court of chancery, either for an account, or to restrain them from mismanagement of the corporate property, or for the purpose .of compelling the corporation and its directors to declare dividends from its surplus earnings, where such dividends are needlessly and improperly withheld.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">V. Specific performance of the contract set out in the complaint; [whichever it be; whether that set out in the stock certificate to pay the dividends out of the net earnings; or the broader contract (to make these payments absolutely), previously made, as above set forth], can be decreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\">VI.

If the plaintiff cannot have equitable relief, of the character sought in the present action, against the present corporation, what redress can he ever obtain ? In none of the cases, English or American, has it ever been held that where the contract was for the payment \u201cdividends,\u201d <em>qua </em>dividends, the stockholder could recover the amount due him, as an ordinary debt, or as damages for the non-performance of a contract. In McLaughlin <em>v. </em>Detroit &amp; M. R. R. Co. <em>(ubi supra), </em>the sum sued for was \u201cinterest\u201d and not \u201cdividends.\u201d In Bates <em>v. </em>A. &amp; K. R. R. Co. <em>(ubi supra), </em>the stock certificate stipulated for \u201cthe payment of six dollars per share semi-annually and the court held that, upon the true construction of the vote for the issuing of the preferred stock, its language was precisely equal in meaning. In each of these cases, therefore, a judgment was rendered, as at law, and for damages. But, after a somewhat careful examination, it is submitted that these are the only two reported cases, at all even kindred to the one in suit, in which judgments against corporations, as in actions at law, and as for the recovery of damages, have been permitted. In all the other cases, the proceedings have been in equity, and have, in substance, required the declaration, as well as the payment, of dividends (See cases above cited).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-6\">IX. If, prior to the mergers, no right of action existed against the M. S. &amp; N. I. R. R. Co., for the recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of damages, as damages, in consequence of the failure to declare the dividends which are in arrears, and to order and make payment of the same (as is in substance adjudged in the Prouty case, and admitted by Sedgwick, J., in his opinion), what different cause of action for damages, as damages, has arisen, or now exists, against\" the present corporation, the L. S. &amp; M. S. R. Co., by reason of the mergers and consolidations of the M. S. <em>&amp; </em>N. I. R. R. Co., with others, out of which the present corporation has derived its existence ? Prior to the consolidation, the right of action as to these dividends was equitable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\"><em>X. </em>If, when the obligation now in suit was that of a foreign corporation, of such a' character that the act of its directors in declaring the dividends and ordering payment of the same, was essential to the stockholder\u2019s remedy, and the joinder of such directors as defendants in the action was absolutely essential to authorize a court of equity in this State or Massachusetts to entertain jurisdiction of the action (as was held in the first suit of Prouty <em>v. </em>M. S. <em>&amp; N. </em>I. R. R. Co., decided by Sutherland, J., at the special term of the supreme court, in 1868, and in Williston <em>v. </em>the same, 13 Allen, 400), does the fact that the corporation, then sued as a foreign corporation, has now availed itself of the laws of New York, and become a corporation, existing not only under the laws of other States, but this State, and is now owning, operating and controlling an immense property, almost wholly beyond the territory of New York, render the directors of the changed corporation, as the same now exists, unnecessary or improper parties defendant in this suit, so that, either on their demurrer or that of the corporation itself, it can be adjudged that they are improperly joined as defendants, because no cause of action exists against them <em>% </em>The property of the old corporation, out of the earnings of which, as defendants contend, the moneys due plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>arise and are to be paid, is still beyond the limits of this State, and may perhaps be accessible only by control over the persons of the directors of the corporation. It is not in the month of such directors to say, that no cause of action can ever arise against them, and no relief be granted, as against them, in this suit, even though they do not appear to be absolutely necessary and essential parties defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-4\">XI. For, even if, since the merged or consolidated corporation has obtained .a legislative authority in this State to exist as a corporation here, the new corporation is the only absolutely necessary defendant, so that a sufficient recovery might be'had in a suit against such corporation as, sole defendant, still, the directors of such a corporation, which also exists under the laws of many other States, and the greater part of whose property and assets is beyond the territory o'f this State, and the jurisdiction of its courts, are at least proper parties defendants in this action. There is the same distinction here between necessary and proper parties; between those whom the plaintiff must join as defendants, and those whom he may, at his election, join as defendants; as is above shown in relation to making the holders of common or unpreferred stock parties defendant in their character as stockholders.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-5\"><em>Matthews &lt;&amp; </em>Foley, attorneys, and of counsel for respondents, urged :\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7d\">The complaint, stripped of its superfluities and verbiage, in which the real cause of action is buried, charges, in substance, that the Michigan Southern &amp; northern Indiana E. E. Co., being a corporation created under the laws of certain States other than this State, duly authorized the issue and issued its certain certificates of guaranteed ten per cent, stock, a copy of one of which certificates is set out in the complaint in each case; that the plaintiff is the owner of a certain specified number of shares, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>either by original award or purchase, or both ; that the Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana R. R. Co. realized net earnings sufficient either in whole or in part, during the interval between 1857 and 1863, or subsequently, to pay the dividends in arrear for such interval (this allegation is unnecessary, if it be true, as the plaintiff insists, that dividends were payable independently of net earnings); that the Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana R. R. Co. failed to pay, and the defendant company, both by merger and covenant, assumed and became bound to pay ; that there is due the plaintiff a certain sum for which, with interest, he demands j udgment. That is all that is material to present the questions involved, to entitle the plaintiff to recover. The dividends in arrear became an ascertained debt against the old company, long before the merger with defendant company, who is only liable upon the ground of its assumption, and the existence of the debt.when such assumption was made. Looking at the cases in any aspect, there is no foundation for any equitable relief. It is simply, and entirely, an action at law, and cannot be maintained upon any other theory. It is merely a legal, demand, if it is anything\u2014a liability growing out of an obligation to pay. We submit, that this is not a case calling for the equitable powers of the court; that the case must be dismissed with costs. (Note: The court will remember that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, upon the argument, substantially conceded want of jurisdiction in the court, but asked to be let off without costs.) We refer to the following adjudged cases, illustrative of the rule for which we contend : Howe <em>v. </em>Peckham, 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>232; Cropsey <em>v. </em>Sweeney, 27 <em>Barb. </em>310; S.

Bearing in mind that whatever obligation was ever contracted had its origin as against a foreign corporate body, and that this defendant company is only liable, if at all, upon the ground that it, not\u2018its directors, assumed that original obligation, the next question is, do the complainants state a cause of action as against them? We earnestly insist that they do not. The directors have contracted no obligation in the matter with which they can be personally charged. Ho foundation is laid upon which any judgment or other relief can be pronounced, as against them. They are, as regards this alleged guaranty, directors of a new and different corporation (see opinion of court of appeals, at the end of these points). They cannot be compelled to declare a dividend or dividends of a former company for past years. They cannot be compelled, under any circumstances, to. apply the present net earnings of this new company to the payment of dividends in arrear of the old company. As before stated, these dividends in arrear had ripened into a debt long before the present company had an existence.' As well might they be compelled to declare a dividend to liquidate any other obligation of the old company. As well might the directors be joined as parties in every case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>against a railroad company. What can these directors be compelled to do in this case, any more than in any other ordinary case against the company? They may be ont of office next year, but the corporation, in legal contemplation, never dies. If the company is liable, it must respond, not the directors or their successors (Smith <em>v. </em>Poor, 40 <em>Me. </em>415; Smith v. Poor, 3 <em>Wares\u2019 U. U. Rep.

It is charged that the net earnings were, in 1864 and 1865, and prior thereto, largely in excess of the amount necessary to liquidate the dividends in arrear. It, therefore, became an ascertained debt against the old company before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>merger with the defendant\u2019s company, and its liability is based upon its assumption and the existence of the debt when such assumption was made. It is a liability growing out of an obligation to -pay a legal demand, and there is no foundation for any equitable relief. \u2022 If the defendant\u2019s corporation, or its directors, became bound, and assumed any obligation, it was for a specific sum of money only. The obligation to pay being established, there can be no dispute about the amount to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The liability of the defendant depends upon the fact as well as the legal obligation assumed or incurred, and both must be established before the plaintiff can be entitled to any judgment. It clearly appears that this liability, whatever it was, was a debt existing before the creation of the present defendant company, so that the liability of the latter depends entirely upon the liability incurred by the old company, and that was fixed, if ever, before the alleged merger, and must be settled as q question involving the obligations of the old company and its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The plaintiff has not, I think, made out a case falling under any acknowledged head of equity jurisdic tion, and the court has- not the power to administer the species of relief asked for (Heywood <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo, 14 N. <em>Y. </em>537). It is well settled that no relief can be administered in equity when the remedies at law are adequate for the attainment of justice (Benefit Life Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 32 <em>How. </em>Pr. 359).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">It seems to me that the examination into the question of the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s right to any judgment must inevitably extend beyond the jurisdiction of this court, and must have reference to the obli-. gations and business of a foreign corporation in a foreign State. The examination of the questions involved relate to subjects beyond, and over which this court has no control (Williston <em>v. </em>Michigan Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>&amp; </em>Northern Indiana R. R. Co., 13 <em>Allen, </em>400; Whitehead <em>v. </em>Buffalo &amp; Lake Huron Co., 18 <em>How.

They have contracted no obligation in the matter .with which they can be personally charged. With respect to this alleged guaranty they are directors of a new and different corporation. Under no circumstances whatever could they be compelled to apply the net earnings of this new company to the payment of dividends in arrear of the old company (see opinion in Prouty v. Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, 52 <em>N. Y. </em>363). If the company is liable it must respond, not the directors or their successors. They may cease at any time to hold office ; but the corporation in legal com templation never dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The learned judge in his opinion at sp\u00e9cial term, pertinently remarks that the only ground alleged for an injunction is in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s right'to a specific performance, and if it appears \u25a0 on the face of the complaint that the defendant corporation has never had the power to specifically perform the contract, there is no equity in the complaint, and an action for damag\u00e9s is all that is left to the plaintiff. As the case stands, the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway corporation have no legal right or power, either to declare a dividend, as such, of the earnings of the Michigan Southern &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad Company, or to declare a dividend on the stock of that company out of the earnings of the consolidated company, while the plaintiff calls for a specific performance by the making of such dividend. The complaint shows that the present \u2022 defendants cannot do anything which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>give the plaintiff the dividends he claims, and it follows that an injunction against them will not permit his getting such dividends through this action. These defendants are not necessary or proper parties, and the complaint states no cause of action against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The defendants demurring, must have judgment on the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
