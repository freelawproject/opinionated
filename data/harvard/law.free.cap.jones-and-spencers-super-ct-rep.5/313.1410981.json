That by such contract such excavation was to be made of the uniform depth of ten feet below the curb of Fourth-avenue, and to extend the whole depth of one hundred feet from the front to the rear of the lots, and that the said plaintiff was to remove all the said excavations of the said rock and earth out of and from the said lots, together with all the rubbish of every description, except that the plaintiff was to leave a sufficient quantity of good, useful, \u2022 suitable and well trimmed stones from said excavated rock to make the foundation walls of eight first-class houses, to be erected by this defendant upon the said lots. And that it was also provided by the said agreement, that the plaintiff should entirely finish and complete said contract, and complete such excavation and removal, and in all thinfis perform his said contract by January 1, 1874, and that the defendant was by the said contract, upon the same being fully completed according to the terms thereof, to pay to the plaintiff therefor the sum of five thousand five hundred dollars, which sum the plaintiff agreed to do the work above mentioned for, according to the terms of the contract. That the plaintiff has failed to perform the agreement on his part. That he has not excavated the rock and earth from the said eight lots to an uniform d\u00e9pth of ten feet below the curb of Fourth-avenue, that he has not removed the rock and earth therefrom, according to the contract, that he has failed to leave upon the premises a sufficient' quantity of well trimmed stone to build foundations for said houses, although there was plenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of stone- there. That the plaintiff has left a large amount of rock and dirt on the lots. By reason of which failure of the plaintiff to perform said contract, the defendant has sustained damages to the amount of five thousand dollars, for which he demands judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">The plaintiff replied to the answer, taking issue upon the allegations therein.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">The plaintiff then served upon the defendant\u2019s attorney the following notice:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-7\"><em>\u201cSir-: </em>Please take notice that the defendant is hereby required to serve upon me a bill of particulars of the damages claimed to have been sustained by him herein, and set up as <em>at </em>counter-claim in his answer herein.\u2019*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-8\">The defendant moved at the special term for \u201can order striking out the plaintiff\u2019s demand of defendant of a bill of particulars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-9\">The motion was denied, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-10\"><em>Nelson Smith, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant, urged:\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqf\">The court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to set aside plaintiff\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars. 1. By the Code, \u00a7 158, a party may, when an account is alleged in adverse pleading, demand a bill of particulars, and the adverse party is obliged to serve it, under penalty of being precluded from giving evidence thereof at the trial. 2. In all cases the court may order a bill of particulars to be furnished by either party. 3. hfo account is alleged in defendant\u2019s answer. There are various definitions of an \u201caccount.\u201d Bouvier defines it to be \u201cthe statement of two. merchants or others, who have dealt together, showing the debits and credits between them.\u201d Webster says it is \u201ca statement of' debts and credits in pecuniary transactions, and also of other things, subject to a reckoning or review, as to keep one's \u2018account\u2019 at the \u2018bank.\u2019 \u201d Worcester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>terms it \u201cA register of debts and credits, or of receipts and expenditures, a computation applied to sums of money.\u201d Clearly, defendant\u2019s answer does not aver an account. <em>4. </em>In moving to set aside the plaintiff\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars, defendant pursued the proper course. He was in this embarrassing situation: if, acting under the advice that plaintiff had no right to demand a bill 'of particulars, he served none, and upon the trial the court should hold that he ought to have served one, he would incur the heavy penalty of being precluded from giving any evidence of his damages <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 168). The question is purely one of practice, and is at some time ,or other to be decided by the court. Preliminary questions, and questions of practice, should be brought up on motion prior to the trial (Clark <em>v. </em>Fitch, <em>2 Wend. </em>459; People v. Denison, 17 <em>Id. </em>312 ; Daniels <em>v. </em>Patterson, 3 <em>Comst. </em>47; Union Bank <em>v. </em>Torry, 5 <em>Duer, </em>626). Among the different kinds of irregularities one is where any proceedings are had which are not warranted by the particular circumstances of the case, according to the practice of the court, or for which there is no foundation (Bu<em>rrill's Pr. </em>vol. 1, p. 473 ; De Peyster <em>v. </em>Warne, 2 <em>Cai. </em>45). The remedy in such a case is to apply to the court to have the proceeding set aside <em>(Burrill's Pr. </em>vol. 1, 472 ; Harris <em>v. </em>Mason, 10 <em>Wend. </em>568).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-5\"><em>Alex. </em>Thain, attorney, and of counsel for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b328-6\">By the Coubt.\u2014Moheix, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azz\">The Code (section 158) provides two modes of obtaining a bill of particulars, each, however, applicable to a distinct class of cases. The first relates to an action upon an account, and the second to a <em>claim </em>of a party in all other actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In the first class of actions it was not necessary to set forth in a pleading \u201c the <em>items </em>of an account therein alleged,\u201d but the adverse party may demand, by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>notice in writing, a copy of the account. If the account is not furnished, the party may be precluded from giving evidence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">If the account furnished is defective, the court may order a \u201cfurther account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Code has not extended the right to a bill of particulars, to other actions than those in which it could formerly be obtained. Under the former practice, as partly regulated by the statute, the court had the power to <em>order </em>a bill in nearly, if not every, species of actions. It was not confined to the action of assumpsit, but in-included debt and covenant. So in actions <em>ex </em>delicto, such as trover (Humphry <em>v. </em>Cottleyou, 4 <em>Cow., </em>54), escape, trespass <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>case for negligence, and the like (1 <em>Burrill Pr. </em>430). And by statute, in action of ejectment (2 <em>Ben. Stat. </em>341, \u00a7 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The only essential change made by the Code, is in the manner of obtaining the bill, in a class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\"><em>In all cases, </em>under the former practice and statute, an order of the court was required (1 <em>Burrill Pr. </em>430).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">How, in actions when the items of an <em>account </em>are not set out in a pleading, they may be obtained by a mere demand in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\"><em>In all other cases, </em>an order must be procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In prescribing a difierent mode of obtaining the bill, 'in certain cases, the codifiers must have intended to give to the word \u201caccount\u201d some definite and separate meaning. So that the <em>items </em>of an account could be obtained by a mere written demand, and without an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">The most usual cases for bills of particulars before the Code, were actions of assumpsit, for work and labor ; goods sold and delivered, and the like. In such cases the declaration was general. And although the court could, as we have seen, <em>order </em>a bill in other actions, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>was in all cases wholly discretionary, and never a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The items of work and labor, and of goods sold and delivered, were frequently numerous, and ran through a large period; and there was more need for the particulars, both as to time and amount of such items, than in other actions; and it had become a matter of course to order the bill in all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The word \u201c account,\u201d in its comprehensive, sense, of course, signifies many things; but in its mercantile sense, and I may say its legal sense as applied to actions, it means the entry of debts and credits in a book\"or upon paper; of things bought and sold, of services performed, with date, and price or value. It may be of a single entry or of a great number, and for a short or long period.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In the sense, therefore, that\u2019an \u201caccount\u201d is the aggregate items of charges, more or less, for services rendered or goods sold, it is t\u00f3 be presumed that the codifiers intended to confine its meaning to the class of cases in which, theretofore, it was most usual, as well as most necessary, that the particulars of the demand or account should be furnished. For unless some such limitation is put upon it, not only can the word, by construction, be extended to.the \u201c account\u201d given in a pleading of the facts constituting a caus'e of action or defense; but it. would as well render the latter part of the section purposeless and meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u2022 Unless, therefore, the action is upon or for the recovery of such an account, as,, it seems to me, must have been intended by the codifiers, namely,' an account containing one or more items for work, labor, services, goods sold, and the like, a bill of particulars cannot be obtained by a mere demand in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">In the view I. have, taken, therefore, the plain tiff could not obtain a bill of the particulars of the \u201c dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ages\u201d set up as a counter-claim in the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The damages were for the breach of a special contract, and were unliquidated; and there could not be any <em>items </em>of an account, within the meaning I have endeavored to show was intended in the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">If I am correct, then, as the plaintiff could not procure a bill of particulars by a mere demand in writing, it follows, that the demand made in this case was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Notwithstanding that, however, the question is presented by this appeal, whether a party can rest securely upon the invalidity of the demand ; or whether he must not himself move to have the demand declared a nullity, as was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The Code provides, as a penalty for neglecting or refusing to furnish a bill of particulars, after demand, when the pleading does not set forth the <em>items </em>of an account, that the party \u201c5e <em>precluded from giving </em>evidence thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">When or in what manner he is to be precluded is not stated. It may no doubt be done, on motion, at the special term. May it not also be done at the trial <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In Kellogg <em>v. </em>Paine, 8 <em>How. Pr. </em>339, the practice was stated to be unsettled, but it was regarded as the better or more convenient practice to have the question settled <em>before </em>the trial, for the reason that \u201cit might operate as a surprise upon the party to meet an objection to the sufficiency of his account for the first time at the trial.\u201d' The former practice required the order precluding the evidence to be obtained before trial <em>(Graham Pr. </em>519). *</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">As the defendant claims that he is not bound to furnish a bill of particulars in this case at all, upon the mere demand of the party, and without an order of the court, he had the right to have that question settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>before the trial, and Ms motion to set aside the demand was therefore regular and proper. And as the plaintiff\u2019s practice is not sanctioned by the Code, the defendant\u2019s motion ought to have prevailed at the special term, and the defendant required to procure an order under the last part of section 158 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
