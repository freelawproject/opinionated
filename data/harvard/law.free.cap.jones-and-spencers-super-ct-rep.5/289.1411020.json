(1.) The general term was designed not only for the redress of legal errors occurring at the special terms, circuits or jury terms, and before referees, but those of fact likewise ; and they were also designed to redress wrongs arising from an erroneous, arbitrary or otherwise improper discretion by the former courts (Matter of Duff, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>416, Court of Appeals, citing People <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 29 <em>N. Y. </em>318, and explaining De Barante <em>v. </em>Deyermand, 41 <em>Id. </em>355, and Foot <em>v. </em>Lathrop, <em>Id. </em>358). (2.) The right of a trial in the mode and by the tribunal prescribed by law is a substantial right, and does not rest in the discretion of the court and where there is no competent evid ence upon which the court below could have decided that the trial would involve the examination of a long account, the court of appeals will review the decision (Kain <em>v. </em>Delano, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>35, Court of Appeals ; Gregory <em>v. </em>Cryder, 10 <em>Id. </em>289, Court of Appeals; Welsh <em>v. </em>Darragh, 52 <em>N. Y. </em>590).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-9\">II. The order should be reversed. (1.) The party moving for a reference must show how, and what way, the examination, of a long account will become necessary upon the trial; and where there is only a general statement in an affidavit, \u201cthat the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>issues joined will require the examination of a long accountwithout stating how, or why, this is so, it must be considered a mere opinion (Kain <em>v. </em>Delano, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>35, Court of Appeals). (2.) The statute does not authorize a compulsory reference unless the accounts are the direct and immediate object of the suit, or the ground of defense, and not merely collaterally or incidentally involved (Kain <em>v. </em>Delano, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>36, 37, Court of Appeals, citing Code, \u00a7 271; <em>Laws </em>of 1801, ch. 90, \u00a7 2; <em>1 K. &amp;R. </em>347 ; Todd <em>v. </em>Hobson, 3 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>518). 3. A referee is only required to possess the skill necessary to examine a long account; and the fact that referees may possess skill and experience equal to a justice of the court does not alter the theory and object of the statute, to leave litigation to the determination of ordinary tribunals created for that purpose, unless there is a special necessity for the use of others (Goodyear <em>v. </em>Brooks, 2 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>304, General Term of N. Y. Superior CourtX 4. The object of the,statute was to relieve the court of the tedious examination and investigation of long accounts ; but the delay in trials before referees, the refer\u00e9es\u2019 fees, the increased counsel fees, may often work a wrong, or be so oppressive upon one or the other of the parties, as to be almost a denial of justice, and in all such cases the court should not order a reference merely because its convenience or time may be disturbed (Godfrey v. Williamsburgh City Fire Ins. Co., 12 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>250, Feb. 1872, Superior Court, Special Term, Moweli,, J.). 5. .Where a complaint contains two separate causes of action, one of which may, upon trial, require the examination of a long account, and the other one will not, upon trial, require the examination of any account, the statute does not authorize a compulsory reference to hear and determine all the issues in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">III. The order should be reversed. ' The constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>secures to the parties in this action a trial by jury, in this and similar cases <em>(Const, of N.

If there is any evidence laid before the court at special term that an examination of a long account will be required, the court has power to refer ; and if that evidence is uncontradicted, then the determination must be held final and conclusive (Whitaker <em>v. </em>Desfosse, 7 <em>Bosw. </em>682 ; Bachelor v. Albany Ins. Co., 6 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>240). V. The court of appeals will not review the decision when the court below has decided this question upon competent evidence (Kain <em>v. </em>Delano, 11 <em>Abb. N.

The light to refer actions on contract, where the trial will involve the examination of a long account, is not within the limitations of the constitution in reference to trial by jury (Townsend <em>v. </em>Hendricks, Court of Appeals, 40 <em>How. </em>162).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-7\">III.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXa\">It is objected that this order is not appealable. That the action being upon <em>contraed, </em>and the issues requiring the examination of an account, the order was discretionary, and that therefore, as there was no question of the <em>power, </em>of the court to order the reference, under the uniform decisions of the courts, an appeal from the order does not lie. In the decisions referred to, the appealability of the order was ascertained by determining whether it was within the power of the court to make it. If it was wholly discretionary, it was final, but if the action, or the case made on the motion was not within the statute, the order was subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Those decisions, however, must be regarded as reversed by subsequent adjudications in the court of appeals, (Townsend v. Hendricks, 40 <em>How. Hr. </em>162; Kain v. Delano, 11 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>35 ; Welsh v. Darragh, 52 <em>N. Y. </em>592), where it is held in substance, that the question of power is always involved in these motions. The court say, that in any case a reference can be ordered only when' the examination of a long account is required, and the power of the court is to be found in that fact. If the proof before the special term does not show that the account is such as brings the action or trial within the statute, the court has no power to make the reference, and if it is made, the decision may be reviewed (Kain <em>v. </em>Delano, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">It was further objected that a reference of the issues was an infringement of the constitutional right of trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The language of, the bill of rights <em>(Cons. </em>art. 1, subd. 2), is, \u201cthe trial by jury in all cases, in which it has been heretofore <em>used </em>shall remain inviolate, &amp;c.\u201d In a literal sense, this would include any common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>action, as well actions of assumpsit involving the examination of long accounts, as actions of tort. For the former action, at all times, <em>might </em>be tried by \u00e1 jury; and, therefore, it might be claimed, that it was a case in which a trial by jury \u201chas been heretofore used.\u201d But as actions involving the examination of long accounts were referable before the adoption of any of the constitutions of this State, the clause quoted from the bill of rights has been confined by construction to such common law actions as were theretofore tried by a jury only.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">This question, however, is fully disposed of by Townsend <em>v. </em>Hendricks <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The complaint in this case contains a statement of two separate and distinct causes of action. The <em>first </em>cause of action is for goods sold and delivered; and from the number of items furnished by the bill of particulars, may involve, on the trial, the examination of a long account, within the meaning of the statute. The <em>second </em>cause of action is, the breach of a special contract, and for the recovery of unliquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In Evans <em>v. </em>Kalbfleisch (36 <em>Supr. Cf. </em>R.), this court, upon a review of the recent adjudications in the court of appeals, held that the several decisions of this court (Whitaker <em>v. </em>Desfosse, 7 <em>Bosw. </em>678; Goodyear <em>v. </em>Brooks, 4 <em>Robt. </em>682, and Batchelor v. Albany City Ins. Co., 1 Sweeny, 346), holding that if <em>any </em>of the issues required the examination of a long account, the entire action was referable, notwithstanding some one or more of the issues were such as the parties had the constitutional right of trial by jury, must be regarded as reversed by such recent adjudications. The court say, \u201cThe principle to be deduced from the decisions referred to is, that <em>all </em>the causes of action stated in the complaint must be referable. If part or one only is referable, the court cannot refer the others.\u201d In such case the party must either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>abandon his non-referable cause of action, or, possibly, after it is disposed of by a jury, the other cause of action may be sent to a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The second cause of action, as stated in the complaint, is non-referable. It is to recover unliquidated damages for a breach of contract, and, standing by itself, the court could not make a comp.ulsory reference. And this court says, in Wheeler <em>v. </em>Falconer, 7 <em>Robt. </em>45, \u201cThe Code, by expressly permitting, even where a long account is involved, the referee to be confined to passing upon a- specific question of fact involved in the issue, and by allowing an account to be taken as a separate matter, for the information of the court, not only authorized but <em>required </em>that neither party should be deprived of the benefit of a <em>trial </em>before a court or <em>a jury as to matters not in-olved in the </em>account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The right to unite in the same complaint several causes of action should, as far as is practicable, be confined to such actions as may be tried together and in the same forum. This can only be done by sending all the issues to a jury, if any of them are within the constitutional inhibition, and by refusing to send any to a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Following, therefore, the decision of this court in Evans <em>v. </em>Kalbfleisch <em>(supra), </em>the court had no power to refer the issues in this case, and hence the order of reference should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Curtis and Speir, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
