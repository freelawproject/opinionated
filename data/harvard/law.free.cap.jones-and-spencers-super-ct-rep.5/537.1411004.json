Co. v. Babcock, 42 <em>N. Y. </em>613), and though this has been done in this case,, and the said surety has disclosed sufficient property, I am nevertheless of the opinion that the objection should not be overruled. The code prescribes the form of the undertaking, and contemplates a personal responsibility on the part of the sureties. An undertaking, - executed by a married woman in the precise language of the Code, binds neither her nor her estate. In no event can she bind herself generally, and in order to bind her estate, she must add words having that effect. An undertaking containing such words, however, is an instrument of a form different from that prescribed by the Code, which the respondent may accept, if he see fit, but which he should not be compelled to take.. In lieu of the required undertaking, the appellants may deposit the amount for which such undertaking is to be given (sections 334, 335), but the acceptance of any other substitute- can not be compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The motion for the approval of the undertaking \u2022 must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
