Both petitions for rehearing assert that we overlooked certain considerations in reaching our decisions; however, having reviewed these appeals, we conclude that the issues raised in them were fully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>EMPLOYER\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The employer contends that a rehearing should be granted because we failed to address \u201c[w]hether a partially disabled Claimant who was simultaneously working as a part-time mechanic for a different employer at the time of his injury, and who returns post-injury to his part-time employer in a <em>different </em>lighter duty <em>position </em>has, in effect, marketed his residual work capacity such that the employer is entitled to a credit for all wages earned.\u201d This question contains two subparts: first, whether an employee\u2019s return to dissimilar part-time employment represents a marketing of his residual work capacity justifying a change from compensation for total incapacity to compensation for partial incapacity, and second, to what extent should the wages the employee earns in the dissimilar part-time employment be considered in determining the amount of the award for partial incapacity. We addressed both of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The first of these questions was decided by the commission in the employer\u2019s favor. The employer sought to have the commission change the employee\u2019s award from one for total incapacity, Code \u00a7 65.1-54, to one for partial incapacity, Code \u00a7 65.1-55, based on his return to dissimilar part-time employment. The commission so ordered and in doing so necessarily concluded that the employee had marketed his residual work capacity. Our opinion affirmed the commission\u2019s decision. We do not interpret the employer\u2019s appeal to challenge this aspect of the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The second of the questions concerns the extent to which the employee\u2019s wages from dissimilar part-time employment should be used in determining the amount of an award for partial incapacity. The commission modified the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d to include part, but not all, of the employee\u2019s wages from dissimilar employment in determining the amount of the employee\u2019s benefits for partial incapacity. We affirmed this award, holding that the commission correctly excluded part of the employee\u2019s wages and finding it unnecessary to address the correctness of the commission\u2019s inclusion of the remaining wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Thus, we fully addressed the issue asserted by the employer in its appeal and find no reason to grant its petition for rehearing in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>EMPLOYEE\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">For similar reasons, we find no reason to award a rehearing from the employee\u2019s appeal. He contends that we overlooked the fact that the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision deprived him of cost of living supplements under Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1 since it changed his award from one of total incapacity where the cost of living supplements were applicable to one of partial incapacity where they were not applicable. We had concluded in his appeal that since he was entitled to and received an award based upon the maximum compensation rate for his partial incapacity just as he had for his total incapacity, he had not yet been affected by'the application of the commission\u2019s rule and, therefore, we did not need to address his concern. He argues that we should have addressed his argument because the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d caused him to be deprived of cost of living supplements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">His loss of cost of living supplements was not caused by the Industrial Commission\u2019s application of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule.\u201d It was caused, instead, by the commission\u2019s finding, that he was partially incapacitated rather than totally incapacitated. The application of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d did not affect this determination; instead, the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d was applied in determining the amount of the award for partial incapacity. Even if the commission excluded all of the employee\u2019s wages from dissimilar employment in determining his award for partial incapacity, the commission would have been required to determine the average weekly wages which the employee was \u201cable to earn thereafter.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-55. The award determined in this fashion would still not be subject to cost of living supplements since it would be an award based on partial incapacity rather than total incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We continue to read the employee\u2019s appeal to challenge, not the commission\u2019s determination of partial incapacity, but its determination of compensation benefits based on a modification of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule.\u201d Therefore, we find no reason to grant a rehearing in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">For these reasons, we deny the petitions for rehearing filed on behalf of each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Cole, J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
