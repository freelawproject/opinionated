The appellant contends that by including the words \u201cpertaining to driving motor vehicles while intoxicated\u201d in the ordinance, the City excluded subsection (i) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because that subsection makes it unlawful to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more, which is not necessarily related to driving while intoxicated. The appellant similarly argues that Code \u00a7 15.1-132, which authorizes local governments to make ordinances \u201cprohibiting the driving of motor vehicles ... by any person while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d does not enable a locality to make an ordinance prohibiting the mere driving of a motor vehicle while one\u2019s blood alcohol level is 0.10% or more. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Code \u00a7 46.1-188 (since repealed) allows local governments to incorporate \u201cArticle 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2 into such ordinances by reference.\u201d A locality incorporating a statute under Code \u00a7 46.1-188 must refer with specificity to those parts of the statute it wishes to incorporate; otherwise the ordinance will be found vague and indefinite. <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Town of Gordonsville, </em>216 Va. 25, 26, 215 S.E.2d 637 (1975). City ordinance \u00a7 17-331 specifically adopts \u201c[t]he provisions of section 18.2- 266 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d This language demonstrates an intent to adopt \u00a7 18.2-266 as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Furthermore, both article 2 of chapter 7 of title 18.2 and the statute itself are headed with the words, \u201cDriving Motor Vehicle, etc., While Intoxicated.\u201d The words in the city ordinance adopting provisions of the statute \u201cpertaining to driving motor vehicles while intoxicated\u201d are words of description and do not act to exclude subsection (i) from incorporation. The appellant\u2019s argument would have us restructure the sentence and move this descriptive phrase to modify \u201cprovisions\u201d instead of \u201csection 18.2-266.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The same reasoning applies to the enabling legislation, Code \u00a7 15.1-132. The words \u201cdriving while under the influence\u201d were not meant to define the prohibited conduct, but rather to enable a locality to legislate in an area defined by the General Assembly. One only need look to Code \u00a7 18.2-266 to discover what that body has deemed \u201cdriving while intoxicated.\u201d Driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more falls into that category <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Benton, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-12\"> \u201cThe provisions of section 18.2-266 of the Code of Virginia (1950). . . <em>pertaining to driving motor vehicles while intoxicated, </em>are hereby adopted and incorporated mutatis mutandis in this chapter by reference pursuant to the authority contained in section 46.1-188 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended.\u201d (emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-13\"> In its pertinent part, \u00a7 18.2-266(i) states: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle . . . while such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
