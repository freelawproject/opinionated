Jamison, Assistant Attorney General (Mary Sue Terry, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b245-9\">BARROW, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALF\">In this appeal from a bigamy conviction, the defendant contends that (1) he should not have been convicted because he reasonably believed that he was divorced when he married a second time, and (2) he should have been convicted of entering into a prohibited marriage (Code \u00a7 20-38.1) instead of bigamy (Code \u00a7 18.2-362). We hold that a reasonable belief that one has been divorced is not a defense to a charge of bigamy, and that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney could choose to charge the defendant with the felony instead of the misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The defendant remarried without obtaining a divorce from his first wife. He married first on March 10, 1979, and married a second time on August 16, 1984. Even though his first wife initiated divorce proceedings in 1981, his marriage to her was not terminated until February 20, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The defendant testified that he thought he was divorced from his first wife because she had told him that they were divorced. In addition, the defendant claimed that she had shown him a document labeled \u201cDecree of Divorce,\u201d and he assumed that it was their final divorce decree. His first wife denied that she had told him that they were divorced and she also denied showing the defendant any document purporting to be a divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">A reasonable belief, however, that one is divorced from his or her spouse is not a defense to a charge of bigamy. The statute under which the defendant was convicted, Code \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>362<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits a married person from entering into a second marriage and contains no language requiring proof of a specific intent to violate the statute\u2019s prohibitions. Code \u00a7 18.2-364, however, provides for certain defenses, including the defense of a reasonable belief that a former spouse is dead. The statute makes no mention of a defense based upon a reasonable belief that one is divorced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The lack of a requirement of a specific intent in Code \u00a7 18.2-362 is in agreement with the majority of other jurisdictions in the United States. Although a minority of states provide otherwise, a reasonable belief that one has been divorced is no defense against bigamy in most jurisdictions. Annotation, <em>Mistaken Belief in Existence, Validity, or Effect of Divorce or Separation as Defense to Prosecution for Bigamy or Allied </em>Offense, 56 A.L.R.2d 915, 919-20 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Because the unambiguous language of Code \u00a7 18.2-362 does not require proof of a specific intent, we hold that a reasonable belief that a prior marriage has been ended by divorce is not a defense to the charge of bigamy.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The defendant also argues that he should have been convicted of violating Code \u00a7 20-38.1, a misdemeanor, rather than Code \u00a7 18.2- 362, a felony. Code \u00a7 20-38.1(1) expressly prohibits a \u201cmarriage entered into prior to the dissolution of an earlier marriage of one of the parties.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-40 provides punishment for any person who marries in violation of Code \u00a7 20-38.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The defendant may have remarried in violation of both Code \u00a7 18.2-362 and Code \u00a7 20-38.1. While the felony, Code \u00a7 18.2- 362, applies only to a person who, while already married, marries again, the misdemeanor, Code \u00a7 20-38.1, is broader in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>scope and applies to any person, whether married or not, who enters into a marriage before the dissolution of an earlier marriage of one of the parties. However, the mere fact that the defendant may also have committed a lesser offense does not preclude the Commonwealth from charging a greater offense arising out of the same act or transaction. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 484, 492, 323 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-362 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Baker, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-362 reads: \u201cIf any person, being married, shall, during the life of the husband or wife, marry another person in this Commonwealth, or if the marriage with such other person take place out of the Commonwealth, shall thereafter cohabit with such other person in this Commonwealth, he or she shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-364 reads, in part: \u201c[Section] 18.2-362 . . . shall not extend to a person whose husband or wife shall have been continuously absent from such person for seven years next before marriage of such person to another, and shall not have been known by such person to be living within that time; nor to a person who can show that the second marriage was contracted in good faith under a reasonable belief that the former consort was dead; nor to a person who shall, at the time of the subsequent marriage, have been divorced from the bond of the former marriage; nor to a person whose former marriage was void.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> We express no view whether it would be appropriate to charge both offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
