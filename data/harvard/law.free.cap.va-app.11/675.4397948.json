Hobson, did not receive a specific permanent partial disability rating from his treating physician within two years of his injury, the commission erred in awarding benefits to Hobson for permanent partial disability. Hungerford asserts this position even though Hobson timely filed and introduced at the evidentiary hearing evidence of a permanent partial disability rating. We affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">On April 17, 1987, Hobson suffered a compensable injury to his left wrist and began receiving medical treatment from Dr. John E. Grasinger. Hobson did not immediately file a request for disability benefits, but continued to work for Hungerford in a supervisory capacity while seeing Dr. Grasinger. As a part of his treatment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Dr. Grasinger twice operated on Hobson\u2019s left wrist and continued to medically manage Hobson\u2019s injury for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On April 13, 1989, Hobson filed an application with the commission for permanent partial disability benefits. Four days later, Dr. Grasinger informed the commission that Hobson \u201cwill have a permanent impairment from his injury [and that the] degree of permanency will be determined on his return visit in two months.\u201d In June, however, the doctor reported to the commission that he was uncertain as to the permanent disability rating because of continued active treatment. It was not until August 2, 1989, that Grasinger was able to specify a \u201c40 % impairment to the left wrist and a 20% impairment of the left upper extremity.\u201d At the August 16 evidentiary hearing, Hobson relied upon the treatment records that Dr. Grasinger had been filing with the commission since October 1988, which indicated that treatment began in April 1987, and was continuing. The deputy commissioner entered an award in Hobson\u2019s favor. On appeal, the full commission affirmed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The right to compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is barred unless a claim is filed with the commission within two years after the incident giving rise to an injury by accident. Code \u00a7 65.1-87. Hobson was injured April 17, 1987, and he timely filed his application for benefits within two years after the occurrence. Hungerford asserts, however, that Hobson is barred from receiving compensation because the extent of his permanent disability was not rated by Dr. Grasinger within the two year period. We find no support for Hungerford\u2019s assertion and we are unwilling to impose such a limitation upon the commission\u2019s implementation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-56 establishes presumptive ratings for the loss of particular body members and also provides that \u201cfor the permanent partial . . . loss of use of a member compensation may be proportionately awarded.\u201d Where the issue concerns a permanent partial loss of use, the commission must rate \u201cthe percentage of incapacity suffered by the employee\u201d based on the evidence presented. <em>County of Spotsylvania v. Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977). Medical evidence is not necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing. <em>See id. </em>at 569-70, 238 S.E.2d at 816. Thus, a medical rating of the employee\u2019s disability is evidence which an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>offers in order to meet the burden of proof. The Code does not require that this evidence be established before the statute of limitations expires. The timely filing of evidence in accordance with the commission\u2019s rules and the facts established by that evidence are the operative considerations in determining whether a claimant is entitled to compensation benefits. <em>See Sargent Elec. Co. v. Woodall, </em>228 Va. 419, 323 S.E.2d 102 (1984); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Stonega Coke &amp; Coal Co., </em>185 Va. 653, 40 S.E.2d 254 (1946); <em>Flavin v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>1 Va. App. 1, 332 S.E.2d 805 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">At the time Hobson filed his application for benefits, he had suffered a compensable injury by accident. His application plainly specified that he was seeking benefits for permanent partial disability. \u201cThis disability was present and existing when the application was filed; therefore the application did not anticipate a future disability and did give the employer sufficient notice of the claim.\u201d <em>Continental Forest Indus. </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>1 Va. App. 72, 74, 334 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1985). Hobson\u2019s filing, thus, fulfilled the intent of the Act \u2014 that the injured employee assert, within the limitation period, the existence of a claim growing out of a compensable injury by accident. <em>See Shawley v. Shea-Ball Constr. Co., </em>216 Va. 442, 219 S.E.2d 849 (1975). In order to recover, Hobson had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a disability which was the consequence of the injury by accident. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>5 Va. App. 374, 387, 363 S.E.2d 433, 440 (1987); <em>Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stump, </em>2 Va. App. 77, 79, 341 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In a medical report filed with the commission shortly after the filing of the application, Dr. Grasinger opined that Hobson had a permanent impairment as a consequence of the April 1987 injury. Dr. Grasinger\u2019s report was credible evidence of the existence of a permanent disability. It is of no consequence to the outcome of this case that Dr. Grasinger was unable to rate the degree of permanent disability until August 2, 1989. What is determinative is that the application for benefits was timely filed, that the credible evidence before the commission proved Hobson suffered a permanent impairment, and that the commission\u2019s award satisfied the requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\u201cWhere, as here, an employee suffers the loss of use of a scheduled body member, the compensation provided by [Code] \u00a7 65.1-56 is not awardable \u2018until the injury has reached a state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>permanency, i.e., maximum improvement, when the degree of loss may be medically ascertained.\u2019\u201d Hart, 218 Va. at 568, 238 S.E.2d at 815 (quoting <em>Collins v. G.M. Clements Co., </em>48 O.I.C. 49 (1966)). Although Dr. Grasinger had not quantified the degree of permanent impairment at the time the application was filed, he later did so and filed his report with the commission. The commission found, upon credible evidence, that Hobson suffered a permanent partial disability of the left wrist and the upper left extremity as a consequence of the injury by accident. The commission\u2019s procedure in this case was consistent with its established practice and fulfills the purposes of the Act. <em>See Griffin v. Breeden Co., </em>63 O.I.C. 151 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
