Arthur Treachers, 2 </em>Va. App. 323, 326, 343 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1986). We conclude that the commission did-not err in using the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d to determine the employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages.\u201d Since the application of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d did not, in fact, affect the amount of compensation the employee received, we do not decide whether its use under these facts was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The employee, a firefighter, was injured while working for the City of Fairfax and received an award for temporary total disability. The award was based on an average weekly wage which was determined from his wages from the City of Fairfax and, because of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule,\u201d did not include any consideration for the wages he earned for part-time work with a private company. This part-time work began approximately six months prior to the accident and consisted of performing repairs to light equipment. He earned $7.50 per hour and worked as many as 32 hours per week, depending upon his schedule, as a firefighter with the City of Fairfax. Since the amount of compensation to which the employee was entitled based upon his wages from the City of Fairfax exceeded the maximum compensation rate, he received the maximum rate of $326.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">After his accident, he was unable to work for the City of Fairfax and was also unable to continue his part-time work. However, approximately one year after his accident, he was able to return to work with the same private employer but not as a mechanic. Instead, he was offered and accepted a position as a service manager at $9.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The commission found that since he was no longer working for the City of Fairfax, he was able to increase his employment hours at his part-time job with the private employer. Consequently, the commission concluded that the employer was entitled to a credit for the employee\u2019s increase in earnings as a result of the extra hours he was able to work at his part-time employment but was not entitled to a credit for the remainder of his earnings from the dissimilar employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Thus, the commission modified the \u201cdissimilar employment rule,\u201d recognized that the employer was entitled to a credit under Code \u00a7 65.1-100.3 \u201cfor the overage,\u201d and awarded the employee compensation for partial disability under Code \u00a7 65.1-55. Since the amount to which the employee was entitled for partial inca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>pacity exceeded the maximum compensation rate, the employee\u2019s award again was $326. The employer contends that the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d should not have been used at all, while the employee contends that the commission was correct in using the rule but should not have modified it to include the increased earnings from his dissimilar employment in his average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">EMPLOYER\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Since the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d is an interpretive rule used by the commission to further define the meaning of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d as initially defined by Code \u00a7 65.1-6, it should be uniformly employed for this purpose in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It would be unfair to use it to define an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d where it benefited the employer but to decline to use it where it benefited the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">An employee\u2019s average weekly wages are twice used in calculating an award for partial incapacity. Compensation for partial incapacity is a sum equal to two-thirds \u201cof the difference between . . . [an employee\u2019s] average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-55. An employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages,\u201d both before the injury and after the injury must, therefore, be determined to calculate an award of compensation for partial incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u201cAverage weekly wages,\u201d whether they are those earned \u201cbefore the injury\u201d or those \u201cwhich he is able to earn thereafter\u201d have a common definition. Code \u00a7 65.1-6. They consist of \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee <em>in the employment in which he was working at the time of the </em>injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). It is this language which, according to the commission\u2019s interpretation, excludes earnings from \u201cdissimilar employment.\u201d <em>See </em>Hudson, 2 Va. App. at 326, 343 S.E.2d at 99. The \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d is, therefore, equally applicable in defining an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d which he is able to earn after an injury as it is in defining his \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d before the injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission, therefore, was correct in using the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d to determine the award for partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">EMPLOYEE\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We need not address the application of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d as raised in the employee\u2019s appeal of his award. The employee complains that the commission erred in considering the increase in his earnings from dissimilar employment in determining his compensation benefits. Consideration of the increase in the employee\u2019s earnings did not, however, reduce the amount of compensation for partial incapacity awarded to the employee. The commission\u2019s award to the employee for partial incapacity, even after considering the increase in earnings, was at the maximum compensation rate. As a result, the employee received exactly the same amount he received under his award for total incapacity. Thus, the application of the \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d did not result in a reduction in the amount of compensation the employee received for partial incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Furthermore, the language in the commission\u2019s opinion recognizing the employer\u2019s right to a credit does not require us to address the employee\u2019s appeal. Code \u00a7 65.1-100.3 allows the commission to award an employer a credit against future compensation for any payment \u201cprocured by the employee by . . . failure to report any return to employment or increase in earnings.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-100.3. An award under this statute, therefore, is limited to the amount the employee receives in excess of that which he or she should have received had he or she reported the return to employment or the increase in earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In this case, had the employee reported his return to employment he would have been entitled only to an award for partial incapacity rather than total incapacity. The employer would, therefore, have been entitled to a credit had there been a difference between the award the employee was receiving for total incapacity and that which he should have been receiving for partial incapacity. However, since the employee was entitled to receive the maximum compensation rate of $326 for both the award for total incapacity and the award for partial incapacity, no credit was due the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Although the commission\u2019s opinion recognized the employer\u2019s entitlement to a credit for an \u201coverage,\u201d it did not determine the amount of the overage nor did it make an award for one. Presumably the commission recognized that, since there was no difference between the award for partial incapacity and the award for total incapacity, there was no basis for an actual credit. For these reasons, the commission\u2019s award to the employee for partial incapacity is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Cole, J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> The \u201cdissimilar employment rule\u201d is not challenged by either party to this appeal. <em>See Hudson v.
