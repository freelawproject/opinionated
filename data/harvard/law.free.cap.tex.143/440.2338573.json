Since the Act which \u00e1uthorized the transfer of the funds is unconstitutional, the trial court properly enjoined the transfer of said funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Opinion delivered January 31, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Associate Justice Sharp dissenting.
