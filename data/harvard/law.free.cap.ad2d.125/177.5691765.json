For the first 14 months following the accident he received his full salary. He thereafter retired as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident on a three-quarters disability pension, which he will receive for the remainder of his life. At the trial of his action against the tort-feasors, defendants herein, he sought and was awarded lost earnings from the date of the accident to the date of the trial. His expert testified that a police officer\u2019s base salary was never less than $24,215 in the 3!\u00e1-year interval between the accident and the trial, and in the last year reached $30,126. Thus, said plaintiff\u2019s gross lost earnings at the time of trial were projected to be $125,000. The jury awarded him $140,000 for lost earnings and pain and suffering from the date of accident. He was also awarded $580,000 in future lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">After the trial, defendants moved to reduce the verdict by $36,000, the amount of basic economic loss for lost earnings, i.e., up to $1,000 per month for the first 36 months (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [a] [2]), which, they argued, may not be recovered in a plenary action to recover for a serious injury. Special Term denied the motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Since basic economic loss may not be recovered in a plenary action by a covered person against another covered person (Insurance Law \u00a7 5104 [a]), plaintiff Calisi\u2019s award of full lost earnings from the date of accident must be reduced by $36,000, the basic economic loss component of that award. That said plaintiff did not receive first-party benefits is, contrary to his argument, irrelevant, since the prohibition against the recovery of basic economic loss from a tort-feasor is absolute. <em>(See, Matter of Granger v Urda, </em>44 NY2d 91; <em>McDonnell v Best Bus Co., </em>97 AD2d 433; <em>Fiveson v Kondenar, </em>110 AD2d 749.) In any event, the terms \"basic economic loss\u201d and \"first-party benefits\u201d, as used in the No-Fault Law, are not synonymous. <em>(Fiveson v Kondenar, supra, </em>at p 750.) Since a police officer\u2019s pretrial monthly salary significantly exceeded $1,000, which figure was used as a measure of plaintiff Calisi\u2019s pretrial lost earnings, and he was disabled for at least three years after the accident, the lost earnings portion of his basic economic loss was $36,000. This amount, which we do not have any difficulty in extricating from the $140,000 pretrial damage award, mostly representing lost earnings, must be deducted from the verdict without consideration of any other benefits he received.
