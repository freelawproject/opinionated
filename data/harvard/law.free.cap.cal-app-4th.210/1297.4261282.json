(Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He admitted an allegation that he had three or more prior driving-under-the-influence-related convictions within 10 years. (\u00a7 23550.) Defendant was also convicted of driving while his license was suspended or revoked (\u00a7 14601.5) and driving a vehicle that was not equipped with an ignition interlock device (\u00a7 23247, subd. (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Defendant took prescription Ambien while at home and fell asleep. He asserted that he was not criminally liable because he was sleep driving and, therefore, unconscious during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s modified CALCRIM instructions to the jury on unconsciousness, voluntary intoxication, and involuntary intoxication were erroneous. Defendant also contends that the condition of probation imposed by the trial court that prohibits him from driving or having access to a vehicle or keys to a vehicle while he is taking Ambien violates his constitutional rights to travel, free association and privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that, except for the instruction on unconsciousness, the trial court\u2019s instructions were not erroneous. In our view, CALCRIM No. 3425 on unconsciousness is flawed, but the error is harmless in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that one aspect of defendant\u2019s challenged probation condition is unconstitutionally overbroad and remand the matter to the trial court to address the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">Finding no other error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">Defendant was charged with four counts stemming from his conduct just before midnight on October 16, 2008: count one, felony driving under the influence (sometimes referred to herein as DUI) (\u00a7 23152, subd. (a)), with three or more DUI-related convictions within the past 10 years (\u00a7 23550); count two, being a habitual traffic offender (\u00a7 14601.3); count three, driving with a suspended or revoked license (\u00a7 14601.5, subd. (a)); and count four, driving a vehicle that was not equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device while his driving privilege was restricted (\u00a7 23247, subd. (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>Based on the October 16, 2008 incident, the People filed a petition to revoke defendant\u2019s probation in a previous DUI case, and the Placer County Probation Department filed a separate petition to revoke defendant\u2019s probation in another DUI case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The Prosecution\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">On October 16, 2008, as Jeremy Miller was driving home from work, he saw a car driving erratically, \u201csplitting lanes,\u201d veering off the road onto the shoulder, and speeding up and slowing as it traveled east on Interstate 80. Miller called 911 and reported the erratic driving behavior. At the dispatcher\u2019s request, Miller followed the car to an ampm Mini Market, where he saw a man leave the car, enter the market, return to the car, and begin to pump gas. He provided the dispatcher with a description of the car and the man who was driving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Rocklin Police Officer Jeff Kolaskey responded, arriving at the market shortly after 11:45 p.m. Kolaskey saw a man matching the description Miller had provided standing between the gas pumps and a car that matched Miller\u2019s description. When Kolaskey asked defendant his name, instead of responding verbally, defendant pulled out his identification card and gave it to Kolaskey. Kolaskey testified that defendant responded coherently to a series of questions, including: where defendant was coming from, when and what he had last eaten, when he had last consumed alcohol or drugs, when and for how long he had last slept, whether his car had mechanical problems, whether he was diabetic or epileptic, whether he was under a doctor\u2019s care, and whether he was taking any medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">Defendant was cooperative during Kolaskey\u2019s interview and responded to all of Kolaskey\u2019s questions. Defendant did not stare blankly at the officer or fail to respond to questions. Defendant did not say anything that indicated he was unaware he had been driving or that he was unaware of what he was saying or doing, and Kolaskey testified he had no reason to believe defendant was unaware of those things. On cross-examination, however, Kolaskey admitted testifying at the preliminary hearing that defendant appeared to be incoherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">In response to the question about where defendant was going, defendant told Kolaskey that he drove from his house in Fair Oaks to get gas. Defendant actually lived in Citrus Heights. In response to the officer\u2019s questions about when and what defendant had last eaten, defendant said he had tortilla pizza at 1:00 p.m. that day. In response to the officer\u2019s questions about when defendant had last slept and for how long, defendant said he had slept for an hour earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>Defendant initially denied having consumed any alcohol or drugs but, upon further questioning, defendant told Kolaskey that he had taken two 5-milligram prescription Vicodin pills at his home earlier that day\u2014the first at 9:00 a.m. and the second at 4:00 p.m. Defendant told Kolaskey that the Vicodin had been prescribed for a back problem. During the interview with Kolaskey, defendant never mentioned having taken Ambien or zolpidem.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Kolaskey observed that defendant had droopy, watery and glassy eyes, slow, slurred speech and a dry mouth. Although defendant\u2019s verbal responses made sense to Kolaskey, defendant\u2019s words \u201cwould run together.\u201d Kolaskey also observed that defendant was swaying, and was uneasy standing on his own feet unassisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Kolaskey performed a series of field sobriety tests on defendant in the gas station parking lot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant appeared to understand Kolaskey\u2019s instruction for each test and also verbally stated that he understood each of the instructions after they were given. During the tests, defendant swayed, had difficulty maintaining his balance, exhibited a \u201cvery slow internal clock,\u201d was unable to accurately count, swayed when stationary and when he walked, walked in a \u201crobotic manner,\u201d and was unable to touch his nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Kolaskey detected no odor of alcohol on defendant, but based on his observations, he concluded that defendant was under the influence of drugs. Kolaskey administered a preliminary alcohol screening test in the field with defendant\u2019s consent. The test indicated that defendant did not have alcohol in his system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Kolaskey placed defendant under arrest for driving under the influence and transported him to the Placer County Jail. There, Kolaskey explained the blood-alcohol test options to defendant and defendant said he would take a blood test. Defendant\u2019s blood was drawn for testing at 1:40 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">The blood test showed that defendant had 0.13 milligrams per liter of zolpidem in his system. No alcohol or other drugs were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">The People\u2019s pharmacology expert, Dr. Julianna Landon Burton, testified that zolpidem, which is marketed under the brand name Ambien, among others, is prescribed as a sleep aid and can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, poor motor coordination, and erratic and impulsive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>According to Dr. Burton, when Ambien is first prescribed, pharmacists are legally required to counsel the patient about Ambien\u2019s side effects. A patient might also get a warning from his or her physician. Whenever Ambien is dispensed, it comes with label and package insert warnings that it can cause dizziness and drowsiness and cautions against operating heavy machinery and driving while using the drug. Patients are instructed to sit on their beds when they take Ambien and then to lie down. It is fast acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Dr. Burton opined that the symptoms Kolaskey observed in defendant and the driving behavior Miller reported are consistent with the effects Ambien can have on a user.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">According to Dr. Burton, studies show that 1.6 hours after taking the maximum recommended dose of 10 milligrams, people have an average peak level of 0.12 milligrams per liter of Ambien in their blood. Dr. Burton opined that since defendant had been in custody between 11:45 p.m. (the time when Officer Kolaskey encountered defendant) and 1:40 a.m. (when his blood was drawn), he had to have taken more than the maximum recommended dosage of 10 milligrams of Ambien on October 16. It is not possible to tell how much more defendant took without knowing how long before 11:45 p.m. he ingested the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Dr. Burton testified that sleep driving is a rare side effect of Ambien. In 2007 and 2008, the manufacturer of Ambien sent letters to health care professionals to warn them that Ambien can cause sleep driving. According to Dr. Burton, there had been a cumulative total of approximately 1,000 reported cases of sleep driving while under the influence of Ambien, and it is estimated that 26 million Ambien prescriptions are written per year. Dr. Burton stated that as of 2007, federal law requires that a warning relating to sleep driving as a possible side effect of Ambien be included in the written materials included in each prescription of Ambien. Dr. Burton testified that Ambien has also been associated with sleep walking, preparing food, eating, making phone calls and engaging in conversations and other behaviors a person does not typically engage in while asleep. Ambien has also been associated with amnesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The Defense Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">Defendant testified that in October 2008, he worked in construction. At that time, he suffered from insomnia, a condition he had had \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Without medication, he usually could not sleep for two to three days. By October 2008, he had been taking Ambien for insomnia for six or seven years, under the care of his physician, Dr. Thomas Dolkas. Defendant\u2019s Ambien dosage had remained the same since 2002. Dr. Dolkas testified he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>\u201cprescribed a usual amount, one at night, 10 milligrams I believe it was.\u201d He acknowledged that the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference indicates a patient should not take more than 10 milligrams of Ambien in a 24-hour period. While Dr. Dolkas said he never told defendant he should not take more than one 10-milligram dose in a 24-hour period, a patient should not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Defendant testified that he was prescribed \u201cOne 10 milligram dose. One pill at bedtime.\u201d He testified that he had never been told by a medical professional that he could not take more than one dose of Ambien within a 24-hour period, but he knew he should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Dr. Dolkas testified that he had never had a conversation with defendant about sleep driving or other complex behaviors associated with Ambien, such as making phone calls or preparing food while asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Defendant testified he was aware of warnings that Ambien causes sedation, drowsiness, or dizziness. Defendant was also aware that Ambien use is associated with other complex behaviors such as sleep eating and having conversations with others while the user is asleep. In fact, defendant had made phone calls while he was asleep. He testified that, prior to October 16, 2008, he had called his mother, his ex-wife, and others on a few occasions and engaged in conversation while he was asleep. Defendant also thought he may have left his house and returned while sleeping one night. He had been told that a friend who came over to check on him because he had been making phone calls found his door open, but found him at home. Defendant was aware, from what he saw on television, that an Ambien user who experiences \u201ccomplex behaviors\u201d while asleep should consult a doctor. Defendant admitted he did not talk to a doctor about making telephone calls while asleep because, even though it was embarrassing, he was not concerned about these incidents. During an interview with his defense expert, Dr. Gregory Sokolov, defendant told Dr. Sokolov that the sleep conversations did not scare him that much. Defendant also did not report to his doctor the incident in which friends had become concerned about phone calls he made one night, after which they went to check on him and found his door had been left open.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">As for sleep driving, defendant testified he had heard the warnings about sleep driving in relation to Ambien use on television \u201cprobably a couple years\u201d before October 16.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant was not concerned about sleep driving because he had been taking Ambien for many years and had never had a sleep-driving episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Defendant testified that on the evening of October 15, 2008, he took one Ambien pill at 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. The following morning, after defendant learned that he did not need to go to work that day, he took another Ambien pill around 7:00 a.m. He did not remember taking another Ambien pill afterward. However, he admitted that it is possible he took more Ambien pills on October 16 because he later discovered approximately four Ambien pills missing. Contrary to defendant\u2019s testimony, Dr. Sokolov testified that defendant told him seven or eight Ambien pills were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">Defendant testified that although he remembered a police officer standing in front of him, he did not remember driving to Rocklin, his conversation with the police officer, taking field sobriety tests, or being taken to the police station. According to defendant, the first thing he remembered after he took Ambien on the morning of October 16, 2008, was waking up in jail dressed in orange. In contrast, defendant told his psychiatric expert, Dr. Sokolov, that he remembered his blood draw, which took place before defendant \u201cwoke up\u201d in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Similar to the prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr. Sokolov testified that he recalled receiving a letter from the manufacturer of Ambien that had been sent to health care professionals warning about sleep driving. Dr. Sokolov opined that on October 16, 2008, defendant was in a state of sedative hypnotic intoxication as a result of taking Ambien. According to Dr. Sokolov, one is not fully aware and cannot process information in a conscious and rational manner when in a state of sedative hypnotic intoxication. Based on his understanding that defendant appeared confused and robotic to Officer Kolaskey, Miller\u2019s observation of defendant\u2019s erratic driving, defendant\u2019s inability to remember what happened on October 16 and defendant\u2019s prior episodes of having conversations while asleep, Dr. Sokolov opined that, \u201cwithin a medical certainty,\u201d defendant was in a state of sedative hypnotic intoxication, known as \u201csleep driving,\u201d on October 16. Dr. Sokolov testified that Ambien affects the judgment center of the brain, but not ingrained memories of behaviors in which the Ambien user has previously repeatedly engaged, such as driving. Dr. Sokolov agreed, however, that responding intelligibly to specific questions by a police officer evidences a conscious act. He also agreed that indicating understanding of field sobriety test instructions is evidence of awareness. It is evidence that \u201cat some level . . . there is processing of information, basic commands [to] do this [or do] that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Dr. Sokolov testified that defendant told him he had no memory of taking the Ambien pills he was missing. According to Dr. Sokolov, taking more pills might be complex behavior caused by the Ambien. However, he cited no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>studies, articles or reports indicating that such behavior had been reported among the other reported complex behaviors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Like Dr. Sokolov, defendant\u2019s pharmacology expert, Dr. Alan Donelson, testified that while under the influence of Ambien, a user is not fully conscious of what he or she is doing. It is \u201calmost as if part of their brain is asleep and part of their brain is not.\u201d Dr. Donelson testified that Ambien has been associated with complex ambulatory behaviors, such as sleep driving, food preparation and sleep eating. There have been reports of people who have taken Ambien making uncharacteristic phone calls and having emotional but intelligible conversations with others while asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">According to Dr. Donelson, sleep driving has been \u201cwidely recognized as a problem.\u201d Dr. Donelson testified that a study revealed gross deviation from normal driving behaviors, such as failing to maintain lanes, running off the road, running up on sidewalks, and driving into objects. Upon getting out of a vehicle, the sleep driver will have the appearance of a grossly intoxicated person, slurring his or her words, looking half asleep, and swaying while standing. To the uneducated eye, the person appears to be drunk, rather than asleep. Dr. Donelson was not asked about one\u2019s ability to understand and perform field sobriety tests or the behaviors exhibited during such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Dr. Donelson opined that the results of defendant\u2019s blood test and Kolaskey\u2019s and Miller\u2019s observations on October 16, 2008, are consistent with defendant being asleep while he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Dr. Donelson testified that Ambien metabolizes quickly. A person with severe insomnia who is worrying or anxious may not sleep through the night because the drug has its peak effect after only two hours. After four hours, the drug has worn off. \u201c[Ijt\u2019s not going to get you through the night if part of you wants to continue to worry and stay awake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">According to Dr. Donelson, the level of 0.13 milligrams per liter of zolpidem measured in defendant\u2019s blood draw at 1:40 a.m. would be within the therapeutic range provided the drug was ingested four hours before. But if a person were to have last taken Ambien 14 hours prior to the blood draw at 1:40 a.m. resulting in a level of 0.13 milligrams per liter, that person would have had to have taken a \u201chuge dose.\u201d The dose would \u201cprobably\u201d have been \u201cclose to a toxic level, four or five or six tablets.\u201d Unlike Dr. Sokolov, Dr. Donelson did not testify that taking more pills while asleep is a complex behavior caused by Ambien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">The Verdicts and Probation Violation Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">The jury found defendant guilty of driving under the influence as charged in count one of the complaint. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>the section 23550 allegation in count one and the misdemeanor offenses charged in count three, driving with a suspended license, and count four, driving a vehicle that was not equipped with an ignition interlock device. Defendant admitted the prior convictions alleged in count one. Pursuant to an apparent negotiated agreement, defendant stipulated to the facts needed to establish counts three and four, and count two, being a habitual traffic offender, was dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found defendant guilty on counts three and four and found defendant in violation of his probation in both probation cases based on defendant\u2019s conviction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Defendant was granted formal probation for a period of five years and ordered to serve 180 days in jail with seven days\u2019 credit for the convictions in the present case. However, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his judgment and sentence pending this appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">The trial court reinstated defendant\u2019s probation in his two prior driving-under-the-influence-related cases, ordered defendant to serve 60 days in one case and 19 days in the other, to run consecutively to each other and to the sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AXU\">I. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">A. In Limine Motions/Instruction Conference</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">Prior to trial, defendant filed an in limine motion in which he requested the standard jury instructions on unconsciousness and involuntary intoxication. Defendant argued that the trial court should give CALCRIM Nos. 3425, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>unconsciousness, and 3427, involuntary intoxication, so the jury could determine whether defendant knew or had reason to anticipate that taking prescription Ambien could cause sleep driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Thereafter, the prosecutor filed a motion to exclude evidence of unconsciousness on the grounds that voluntary intoxication is not a defense to driving under the influence, and involuntary intoxication is not at issue where defendant intentionally took Ambien after having engaged in ambulatory behavior while asleep on prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Defendant subsequently filed an \u201cadde[n]dum\u201d to his in limine motion, requesting modified versions of CALCRIM Nos. 3425, unconsciousness<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 3427, involuntary intoxication.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant argued that because sleep driving is such a bizarre consequence of taking Ambien, a person who previously had not experienced this side effect is not criminally responsible for sleep driving even if he had heard that Ambien could cause sleep driving. In defendant\u2019s view, a person taking Ambien should be held liable for driving under the influence only if he knew that taking Ambien would cause him to sleep drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">B. The Court\u2019s Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">The trial court reserved ruling on the instructions until the evidence was presented. Ultimately, the court rejected defendant\u2019s proposed instructions and gave its own modified CALCRIM instructions on unconsciousness and involuntary intoxication, as well as a modified CALCRIM instruction on voluntary intoxication. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">1. <em>Unconsciousness (modified CALCRIM No. </em>3425)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">\u201cThe defendant is not guilty of driving under the influence if he acted while legally unconscious. Someone is legally unconscious when he is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>conscious of his actions. <em>Unconsciousness need not rise to the level of coma or inability to walk or perform manual movements, </em>[f] <em>Legal unconsciousness may be caused by involuntary intoxication. Legal unconsciousness may not be caused by voluntary intoxication. </em>The People must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was legally conscious when he acted. If there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted as if he were conscious, you should conclude that he was legally conscious. If, however, based on all of the evidence you have a reasonable doubt that he was legally conscious, you must find him not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">2. <em>Voluntary intoxication (modified CALCRIM No. 3426)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">\u201cVoluntary intoxication is not<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> a defense to driving under the influence of drugs. <em>If you conclude that the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication was voluntary, then the defendant\u2019s state of consciousness or lack thereof shall not be considered as a defense to the crime. </em>[][] A person is voluntarily intoxicated if, <em>one, the defendant willingly and knowingly ingested a substance, two, the substance was capable of producing an intoxicating event [sic],</em><footnotemark><em>[13]</em></footnotemark><em> and three . . .

If you conclude that the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication was involuntary, then the defendant\u2019s state of consciousness or lack thereof shall be considered pursuant to a separate instruction regarding unconsciousness as previously read. </em>[f ] A person is involuntarily intoxicated if the defendant knowingly\u2014excuse me\u2014unknowingly!<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark> ingested an intoxicating substance, <em>two, </em>the defendant\u2019s intoxication was caused by force, duress, fraud, or trickery or [szc] someone else for whatever purpose without any fault on the part of the intoxicated person <em>or, three, he either unknowingly ingested some intoxicating liquor or drug or other substance or if he voluntarily ingested a legally prescribed drug that caused him to act unconsciously without knowing or that he reasonably should have known of the drug\u2019s intoxicating effects. </em>...[!]... [][] <em>In determining whether intoxication by prescription drug is involuntary, consider whether the defendant knew or had reason to anticipate that his use of the prescription drug could cause such intoxicating effects.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">C.

(Pen. Code, \u00a7 22, subd. (c).) While evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible on the issue of whether or not a defendant actually formed a required specific intent or mental state (Pen. Code, \u00a7 22, subd. (b); <em>People v. Velez </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 785, 791 [221 Cal.Rptr. 631] <em>(Velez)), </em>voluntary intoxication \u201cis not a defense to a general intent crime.\u201d <em>(Velez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 791.) In <em>Velez, </em>this court noted that the union or joint operation of act and intent that must exist in general intent crimes is deemed to exist irrespective of unconsciousness arising from voluntary intoxication. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[C]riminal responsibility is justified on the theory that having chosen to breach one\u2019s duty to others of acting with reason and conscience, one may not entirely avoid criminal harm caused by one\u2019s breach of duty. It is therefore apparent the imposition of criminal responsibility for acts committed while voluntarily intoxicated is predicated on a theory of criminal negligence.\u201d <em>(Velez, supra, </em>at pp. 794-795.) Driving under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>influence is a general intent crime (\u00a7 23152, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 5 [262 Cal.Rptr. 915] <em>(Garcia)), </em>and voluntary intoxication is not a defense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chaffey </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 852, 855 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 757] <em>(Chaffey)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">In contrast, involuntary intoxication that results in unconsciousness is a complete defense to a crime. <em>(Velez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) Involuntary intoxication can be caused by the voluntary ingestion of prescription medication if the person did not know or have reason to anticipate the drug\u2019s intoxicating effects. <em>(Chaffey, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 856-858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The question of whether intoxication is voluntary or involuntary focuses on whether the intoxication is induced through the defendant\u2019s fault or the fault of another or whether the defendant knows or has reason to anticipate the intoxicating effects of the substance he or she ingests. If intoxication is the result of the defendant\u2019s own fault or the defendant knows or has reason to anticipate the intoxicating effects, the intoxication is voluntary. <em>(Velez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 796; <em>Chaffey, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 856-858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">There is a dearth of published California decisions on whether the voluntary and knowing ingestion of prescription medication constitutes voluntary or involuntary intoxication. In <em>Chaffey, </em>the defendant had been prescribed Xanax for anxiety and sleeplessness. She took an overdose in an effort to commit suicide. <em>(Chaffey, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 854\u2014855.) The overdose rendered the defendant unconscious so that she had no awareness of what she was doing. The defendant drove her car and was arrested for driving under the influence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 853-854.) She had no recollection of what she did after taking the Xanax. <em>(Chaffey, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 854.) Her psychiatrist testified that the defendant was unconscious when she was driving. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Sitting as the trier of fact after the parties waived a jury trial, the trial court concluded that the intoxication must have been voluntary because it was predictable that the defendant would go through a period of sleepiness after taking an overdose of Xanax and that something would happen during that time. <em>(Chaffey, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 854.) Accordingly, the trial court found defendant guilty of driving under the influence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The appellate department of the trial court reversed the judgment based on the conclusion that the defendant was involuntarily intoxicated as a matter of law because, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>the appellate department\u2019s view, the undisputed facts established that the defendant did not know and a reasonable person in her condition would not have known that an overdose of Xanax would have caused intoxication. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 854, 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">The Court of Appeal canvassed out-of-state cases involving intoxication from the use of prescription drugs. (Chaffey, <em>supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 856-857.) These cases held that the intoxication is voluntary when the defendant knew or should have known of a drug\u2019s potential intoxicating effects. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Chajfey </em>court held that although a trier of fact could legitimately have found involuntary intoxication under the circumstances of that case, substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding of voluntary intoxication. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 857-858.) In particular, the court noted that the defendant voluntarily swallowed the Xanax tablets, the label warned her that Xanax would cause drowsiness, and one should not operate heavy equipment when taking Xanax. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 854, 857.) The court reasoned, \u201c[i]t may be true that [the defendant] did not intend or even expect to be able to stand up let alone drive a car. Although such a specific event was not predictable or necessarily foreseeable from her past experience with Xanax, it is possible as the trial judge stated that she \u2018. . . would go through a period of sleepiness and that something would happen in that period of time . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">E. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions on unconsciousness, voluntary intoxication, and involuntary intoxication were erroneous. We agree that the instruction on unconsciousness was flawed, but disagree that the other instructions were erroneous. We conclude that the flaws in the unconsciousness instruction are harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">1. <em>Instruction on legal unconsciousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction on unconsciousness is erroneous for two reasons. First, citing CALCRIM No. 3425, defendant contends that the trial court erred in declining to add \u201csleep driving\u201d as a cause of unconsciousness. Second, defendant contends that the court\u2019s instruction directed the jury to ignore the expert testimony and to find defendant was not legally unconscious. We reject the first contention, but find some merit to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">a. <em>Cause of unconsciousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">Defendant requested an instruction that states, in relevant part, \u201cUnconsciousness may be caused by a blackout, an epileptic seizure, involuntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>intoxication, sleepwalking, <em>sleep driving or other similar </em>condition.\u201d (Original italics.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s proposed instruction and in its modification of CALCRIM No. 3425, the court omitted all recognized causes of legal unconsciousness other than involuntary intoxication. Defendant argues that the trial court improperly removed an element of causation by refusing to instruct on \u201cthe causation of [defendant\u2019s] mental state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Defendant apparently equates his proposed insertion of \u201csleep driving\u201d with the parenthetical reference to \u201csleep walking\u201d or \u201cother similar condition\u201d in CALCRIM No. 3425. Defendant is mistaken, but the mistake is understandable given the CALCRIM reference to \u201csleep walking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[a]n unconscious act within the contemplation of the Penal Code is one committed by a person who because of <em>somnambulism, </em>a blow on the head, or similar cause is not conscious of acting and whose act therefore cannot be deemed volitional.\u201d <em>(People v. Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 717 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913], italics added, overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 165 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094], and disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]; <em>People v. Ferguson </em>(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1083 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 182].) It appears that \u201csleep walking\u201d was substituted in CALCRIM No. 3425 as a plain English substitute for what courts previously have referred to as \u201csomnambulism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">In the context of legal unconsciousness, somnambulism<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is a disorder or \u201ccondition\u201d on a par with epilepsy, another recognized cause of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>unconsciousness. <em>(See People v. Freeman </em>(1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 110, 115-116 [142 P.2d 435] [epilepsy is one of a number of causes of legal unconsciousness].) Neither the prosecution nor the defense experts here described sleep driving as a disorder or a \u201ccondition.\u201d Rather, it is a behavior that might result from the intoxicating effect of Ambien. In other words, defendant\u2019s purported unconsciousness was not caused by sleep driving. Instead, sleep driving is purportedly what defendant did while legally unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">The trial court\u2019s modified instruction, which stated that unconsciousness may be caused by involuntary intoxication, is a correct statement of the law <em>(Velez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 793), and the Judicial Council did not contemplate that each recognized cause of legal unconsciousness be listed for every jury. The recognized causes are set forth as options within parentheses. This, of course, indicates that the trial court is to select only the potential cause supported by the evidence. (See 1 CALCRIM (2012) Guide for Using Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instas. (CALCRIM) Alternatives vs. Options, p. xxvi [\u201c[w]hen the user must choose one of two or more options in order to complete the instruction, the choice of necessary alternatives is presented in parentheses . . .\u201d].) This is appropriate since listing causes not supported by the evidence could be potentially confusing for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Defendant\u2019s proposed modification sets forth a list of several alternative causes of legal unconsciousness-\u2014sleep driving being one alternative. But the insertion of the phrase \u201csleep driving,\u201d in addition to the inclusion of involuntary intoxication as a cause of legal unconsciousness, would have made the instruction read as if legal unconsciousness could result from involuntary intoxication <em>or </em>sleep driving (or one of the other listed conditions). Such an instruction would have effectively blurred the distinction between voluntary intoxication resulting in sleep driving, which is not excusable, and involuntary intoxication resulting in sleep driving, which is excusable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For this reason and the additional reason that sleep driving is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>a disorder or condition that causes legal intoxication, the trial court did not err by refusing to insert sleep driving as an alternative cause of legal unconsciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">b. <em>Presumption of consciousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Consistent with CALCRIM No. 3425 and the proposed modified instruction submitted by defendant, the court instructed the jury: \u201cThe People must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was legally conscious when he acted. <em>If there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted as if he were conscious, you should conclude that he was legally conscious. </em>If, however, based on all of the evidence you have a reasonable doubt that he was legally conscious, <em>you must </em>find him not guilty.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">While defendant offered the same language in his proposed modification to CALCRIM No. 3425,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> he now objects to that instruction on appeal. Defendant contends that the italicized language directed the jury to ignore the expert testimony that indicated a person can perform learned, complex behaviors after ingesting Ambien and appear to be awake, when in fact, the person is not awake. Defendant asserts that the instruction told the jury to conclude defendant was conscious without considering this expert testimony. Defendant further contends that the challenged instruction lightens the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof in violation of his constitutional rights to a jury trial and due process. While we disagree that the instruction violates defendant\u2019s due process rights, we agree that the instruction is potentially confusing and should be modified. However, as we discuss <em>post, </em>the error here is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">Before discussing the flaws we see in the challenged instruction, we first review the history of the instruction and the legal rule it is intended to address\u2014the presumption of consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">The genesis of the instruction is <em>People v. Hardy </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 52 [198 P.2d 865] <em>(Hardy). </em>(See commentary to CALCRIM No. 3425, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1023.) In <em>Hardy, </em>our high court discussed the judicially created presumption that a person who acts conscious is conscious. <em>(Hardy, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at p. 63.) The trial court in <em>Hardy </em>instructed the jury: \u201c \u2018When the evidence shows that a defendant acted as if he was conscious, the law presumes that he then was conscious. This presumption is disputable, but is controlling on the question of consciousness until overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, which means such evidence as when weighed against the presumption, and any evidence supporting the presumption has more convincing force, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>from which it results that the greater probability of truth lies therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Our high court observed, \u201cThere is no <em>statutory </em>presumption that a man is conscious merely because he acted as if he were conscious. [Citations.] Such a presumption, however, appears to have been recognized by judicial decision. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Nihell, </em>144 Cal. 200, 202 [77 P. 916].)\"But there can be no justification in the law for placing on the defendant the burden of overcoming the presumption \u2018by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hardy, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at p. 63.) The court reasoned that, \u201c[t]he necessary effect\u201d of the trial court\u2019s instruction \u201cwas to place on [the] defendant not merely the burden of producing evidence which would raise a reasonable doubt as to her consciousness, but the much greater burden of proving unconsciousness by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The <em>Hardy </em>court went on to note that the presumption serves only to require the defendant to produce sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. <em>(Hardy, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at p. 64.) One reason for this rebuttable presumption \u201cis that [the cause of unconsciousness] relates to defendant personally and lies peculiarly within his knowledge, and hence for reasons of convenience and necessity he should have the burden of producing evidence thereon.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This presumption does not change the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, however. <em>(Ibid.) </em>A defendant can overcome the presumption regarding consciousness by simply producing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt that he or she was conscious when he or she acted during the commission of the alleged crime. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">In <em>People v. Williams </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 34 [99 Cal.Rptr. 103] <em>(Williams), </em>the defendant contended at trial he was in the throes of a psychomotor epileptic attack that rendered him unconscious when he shot and killed a complete stranger. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d at p. 38.) The trial court instructed the jury on unconsciousness, using the pre-1972 version of CALJIC No. 4.31.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (22 Cal.App.3d at p. 55.) As defendant here points out, the <em>Williams </em>court concluded that the instruction was incompatible with the testimony of the expert witnesses. The experts had testified that, to an outward observer, a person in a psychomotor seizure acts purposefully and normally, as if he were conscious. The court observed that the jurors probably viewed the instruction as directing that they find the defendant conscious because of his conscious-like conduct regardless of the expert testimony. <em>(Williams, supra, 22 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 55-57.) Thus, the court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>pre-1972 version of CALJIC No. 4.31 required the jury, as a rule of law, to find the defendant conscious instead of simply giving consideration to a rebuttable presumption. (22 Cal.App.3d at p. 57.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">In <em>People v. Maxey </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 190, 200 [104 Cal.Rptr. 466] <em>(Maxey), </em>the court observed, \u201c[t]he first [sentence in the pre-1972 version of CALJIC No. 4.31], <em>standing alone, </em>would require the jury to find a defendant conscious, if they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted <em>as if he were conscious. </em>Thus, the jury would be precluded <em>from </em>finding a defendant unconscious in a case where his <em>overt acts </em>were those of a conscious person and regardless of any expert testimony or other evidence of unconsciousness. The second [sentence] of the instruction, however, properly concludes that \u2018. . . if the evidence raises a reasonable doubt that he was in fact conscious, you should find [that] he was unconscious.\u2019 Although the second [sentence] is somewhat saving, we nevertheless agree with the court in <em>Williams . . . </em>that the first [sentence] is misleading and that the total instruction is confusing, at the very least.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">In <em>People v. Cruz </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 308 [147 Cal.Rptr. 740] <em>(Cruz), </em>the Court of Appeal observed that CALJIC No. 4.31 was modified in 1972 to address the concern about expert witness testimony expressed in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Maxey. (Cruz, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at p. 331.) The 1972 revision added the following italicized language to the instruction: \u201c \u2018However, if, <em>notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s appearance of consciousness, </em>the evidence raises a reasonable doubt whether he was in fact conscious, you should find that he was then unconscious.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (83 Cal.App.3d at p. 331, italics added.) The court in <em>Cruz </em>suggested that the instruction as revised still created confusion and held that the italicized language did not cure the problem. The court reasoned, \u201cNo. 4.31 does not adequately instmct the jury of the operation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>rebuttable presumption as it relates to reasonable doubt on the issue of acts that demonstrate consciousness. The addition of the phrase \u2018notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s appearance of consciousness\u2019 does not cure this defect.\u201d <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at p. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Cruz, </em>were discussed in <em>People v. Kitt </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 834 [148 Cal.Rptr. 447] <em>(Kitt), </em>disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 836 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865], Disagreeing with <em>Cruz, </em>the court in <em>Kitt </em>held that the 1972 revision to CALJIC No. 4.31 cured the defect identified in <em>Williams. (Kitt, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at pp. 842-843.) Noting that <em>Williams </em>rejected the earlier version of CALJIC No. 4.31 as a conclusive presumption of consciousness following from the fact that a defendant acted in a conscious manner, the court, in <em>Kitt </em>observed, \u201c[t]he second paragraph of CALJIC No. 4.31, as revised in 1972, sets forth the method of operation of [the rebuttable] presumption. It does so properly without using the term 'presumption.\u2019 We find nothing confusing or contradictory in the instruction.\u201d <em>(Kitt, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at p. 842; see <em>People v. Caldwell </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 461, 478-479 [162 Cal.Rptr. 397] <em>(Caldwell) </em>[agreeing with <em>Kitt </em>that the 1972 revision cured the problem identified in <em>Williams].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">While the defect noted in <em>Williams </em>was corrected, the court in <em>Kitt </em>found fault with the second sentence of the 1972 revision of CALJIC No. 4.31; \u201c \u2018However, if, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s appearance of consciousness, the evidence raises a reasonable doubt whether he was in fact conscious, you <em>should </em>find that he was then unconscious.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kitt, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at p. 841, italics added.) The court took exception with the use of the word \u201cshould\u201d and suggested it be substituted with the word \u201cmust.\u201d \u201cThe use of the word \u2018should\u2019 might well be understood by the jury as <em>not </em>requiring it to make a finding of unconsciousness under the circumstances of reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>(Kitt, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at p. 843.)

The 1979 revision is the immediate predecessor to the CALCRIM instruction challenged in the instant case. In <em>Babbitt, </em>the defendant was charged with, inter alia, murder and attempted rape. One of the theories advanced by the defense was unconsciousness stemming from a psychomotor epileptic seizure. (45 Cal.3d at pp. 676, 678-679.) The defendant argued that because unconsciousness negates the element of intent, proof of consciousness is a fact necessary to prove intent. Thus, the presumption of consciousness created in CALJIC No. 4.31 impermissibly lightened the prosecutor\u2019s burden of proving intent, or stated conversely, impermissibly shifted the burden of negating intent to the defendant. (45 Cal.3d at p. 691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Rejecting that argument, our high court held that unconsciousness is a defense, not an element of murder or any other crime. <em>(Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 693.) The court explained, \u201cAlthough the state, once the defendant raises the issue, has assumed the burden of disproving unconsciousness, this fact of itself does not transform absence of the defense\u2014 consciousness\u2014into an element of murder for purposes of due process analysis. This is true even though unconsciousness negates the elements of voluntariness and intent, and when not voluntarily induced is a complete defense to a criminal charge. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[B]ecause consciousness is not an element of the offense of murder (nor of any offense), CALJIC No. 4.31 does not impermissibly shift to the defendant the burden of negating an element, nor does the instruction violate due process by impermissibly lightening the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, there is no constitutional impediment to the state\u2019s use of a rebuttable presumption in meeting its assumed burden\u2014once the issue has been raised\u2014to prove consciousness beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Babbitt, supra, </em>at pp. -693-694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">The Supreme Court reasoned that CALJIC No. 4.31 did not require the defendant to persuade the jury that he was unconscious. <em>(Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 695, fn. 15.) The instruction merely required the defendant to \u201craise a reasonable doubt that he was conscious, and then only if the prosecution\u2019s proof did not of itself raise such a doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 694, 695, fn. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">Our high court further reasoned that CALJIC No. 4.31 must be read together with the other instructions the trial court gave to the jury <em>(Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 695), noting that the jury was instructed on the presumption of innocence, the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving every element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove specific intent or mental state, that unconsciousness was a complete defense, and that if there was reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>that the defendant was conscious, the defendant must be acquitted <em>(id. </em>at pp. 695-696). \u201cPlaced in context, therefore, CALJIC No. 4.31 did little more than guide the jury as to how to evaluate evidence bearing on the defendant\u2019s consciousness and apply it to the issue, an issue that is capable of proof only by circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 696.) Thus, the court concluded, \u201cgiven the entirety of the charge a reasonable juror could not have, believed that defendant was required to persuade it that he was unconscious. Rather, the instructions taken as a whole clearly indicate the prosecution had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only that defendant appeared to be conscious, but also that he in fact was conscious.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Thus, the <em>Babbitt </em>court approved of the manner in which the presumption of consciousness was handled in the 1979 revision of CALJIC No. 4.31.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>(Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 693-694.) Here, the jury was instructed in the language of the third paragraph in CALCRIM No. 3425. That paragraph reads in part: \u201cIf there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted as if he were conscious, you should conclude that he was legally conscious. <em>If however, </em>based on <em>all </em>of the evidence you have a reasonable doubt that he was legally conscious, <em>you must find him not </em>guilty.\u201d (Italics added.) That part of the instruction is similar to the 1979 revision of CALJIC No. 4.31 in two respects, but its language is also different in two ways that could be potentially confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">We note first that the instruction improves on the prior CALJIC iterations. The two sentences of the third paragraph in CALCRIM No. 3425 referenced above are preceded by: \u201cThe People must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was legally conscious when he acted.\u201d This emphasis was not in any of the CALJIC instructions, and it positively reinforces both the burden of proof and the fact that the prosecution bears that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Looking now to the two similarities, we note that the instruction is different from the instruction criticized in <em>Williams </em>and somewhat consistent with the 1972 and 1979 revisions of CALJIC No. 4.31 discussed in <em>Babbitt. </em>CALCRIM No. 3425 tells the jury to consider <em>all </em>of the evidence when deciding whether there is a reasonable doubt that the defendant was conscious. Also, the word \u201cmust\u201d is used as suggested by the court in <em>Kitt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>Nevertheless, the wording of the second sentence in the third paragraph of CALCRIM No. 3425 is problematic in two ways. First, in our view, it bears greater similarity to the pre-1972 version of CALJIC No. 4.31 criticized in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Maxey </em>than the 1979 revision approved in <em>Babbitt. </em>In the 1979 revision, the direction that the jury should find the defendant conscious if he \u201cacted as if he were conscious\u201d is expressly qualified by language that immediately follows in the same sentence: <em>\u201cunless </em>from all the evidence you have a reasonable doubt that he was in fact conscious.\u201d In CALCRIM No. 3425, the critical language is located in a separate sentence, disconnected from the direction (\u201cshould conclude\u201d) that precedes it. So the jury is first told it should conclude defendant was conscious if he \u201cacted as if he were conscious.\u201d That command is not expressly qualified by an \u201cunless\u201d clause but is instead followed by a separate sentence that begins, \u201cIf, however.\u201d \u201cIf, however\u201d is <em>not </em>the same as \u201cunless.\u201d In context, it could mean that the jury is only to consider whether there is reasonable doubt based on the other evidence if it finds that a defendant acted as if he was not conscious. The instruction is unnecessarily ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Second, instead of telling the jurors they must find the defendant unconscious if they have a reasonable doubt that the defendant was conscious, the final sentence directs the jurors to find the defendant <em>not guilty. </em>As we have discussed, in an intoxication case, a defendant who was unconscious must be found not guilty only if the intoxication was involuntary. A defendant who was unconscious may still be found guilty if the intoxication was voluntary. Because the last sentence compels the jury to reach a not guilty verdict instead of compelling a finding regarding unconsciousness, that sentence is potentially confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">We have one other observation about the trial court\u2019s modified version of CALCRIM No. 3425. In our view, the trial court\u2019s modification to the second paragraph in CALCRIM No. 3425 makes the instruction superior to the current version in the context of an intoxication defense case. In explaining the law of unconsciousness, the trial court explained that while involuntary intoxication can cause legal unconsciousness, voluntary intoxication cannot. This additional language served to enhance the jury\u2019s understanding of the law and focused the jury\u2019s attention on the predicate to the application of the instruction on unconsciousness\u2014Was defendant\u2019s intoxication voluntary or involuntary?<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>2. <em>Instruction on voluntary intoxication</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">The trial court instructed the jury that voluntary intoxication is not a defense to driving under the influence, and if the jury concluded that defendant\u2019s state of intoxication was voluntary, defendant\u2019s state of consciousness or lack thereof should not be considered a defense to driving under the influence. Defendant contends that these instructions impermissibly relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving \u201cthe element of \u2018mental state,\u2019 specifically knowledge.\u201d Defendant asserts that even if the jury found voluntary intoxication, it could still have found that defendant\u2019s \u201ccondition\u201d negated his knowledge that Ambien could cause \u201cintoxicating effects, or ambulatory effects such as sleep driving.\u201d Defendant further argues that the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct on the union of act and mental state pursuant to CALCRIM No. 251, union of act and intent: specific intent or mental state.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He contends that knowledge is a necessary mental state in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">To prove that defendant was guilty of driving under the influence, the prosecution did not have to prove a knowledge element. The prosecution had to prove that (1) defendant drove a vehicle and (2) defendant was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or drug or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and drug when he drove the vehicle. (\u00a723152, subd. (a).) As we have previously noted, driving under the influence is a general intent crime (\u00a7 23152, subd. (a); <em>Garcia, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 5) and voluntary intoxication is not a defense to a charge of driving under the influence (Chaffey; <em>supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 854-855, 857-858).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>CALCRIM No. 251 derives from Penal Code section 20, which provides; \u201cIn every crime or public offense there must exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, or criminal negligence.\u201d This statute relates to the mens rea elements of offenses and links the mens rea element to the actus reus element. Penal Code section 20 does not apply to defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Defendant misplaces reliance on <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 220 [58 CaI.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365] to make his point. In discussing CALJIC No. 3.31, the former pattern instruction on the rule in Penal Code section 20, our high court stated, \u201c[b]y its very terms, this instruction applies only to \u2018crimes\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">As we have already explained, unconsciousness is a defense; consciousness is not an element of a crime. <em>(Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 693.) Consistent with <em>Babbitt </em>and Penal Code section 20, we hold that the question of whether defendant knew of Ambien\u2019s intoxicating effects\u2014a question that goes to the issue of whether his intoxication was voluntary or involuntary, and thus relevant to the defense of unconsciousness\u2014is not an element of the crime. Thus, it would have been inappropriate to instruct the jury on the joint operation of act and the mental state of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Because driving under the influence is a general intent crime, the trial court gave a modified version of CALCRIM No. 250, union of act and intent-general intent. The trial court told the jury that to find defendant guilty of driving under the influence, the jury must find that defendant committed the prohibited act, and that defendant intentionally did the wrongful act; however, there is no requirement that defendant intended to break the law. In the modified portion of the instruction, the court expressly referred the jury to the instructions relating to unconsciousness, voluntary intoxication, and involuntary intoxication for the specific rules as they relate to the general intent required in the case. This instruction was appropriate. Indeed, like the court\u2019s modification of the unconsciousness instruction, the modification to CALCRIM No. 250 enhanced the jury\u2019s comprehension of the law and focused the jury on the central issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The trial court also instructed the jury it could find defendant was voluntarily intoxicated if it found defendant willingly and knowingly ingested an intoxicating substance when he knew the substance could produce an intoxicating effect. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 22, subd. (c); <em>Chaffey, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>at pp. 856-858.) While this modified instruction was not completely congruent with the modified instruction on involuntary intoxication,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> this instruction, combined with the instruction on involuntary intoxication and the instruction that the prosecution had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, adequately stated the required factual findings for voluntary intoxication and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">3. <em>Instruction on involuntary intoxication</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury it had to find defendant was involuntarily intoxicated if it determined defendant did not know or have reason to know that Ambien would specifically cause him, as opposed to consumers in general, to sleep drive.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Defendant theorizes a person is involuntarily intoxicated when he or she previously experienced one intoxicating effect from prescription medication (such as engaging in sleep conversation), knew that use of that substance could cause sleep driving, but had not previously experienced a sleep-driving episode. Essentially, defendant asserts that until a person actually has a sleep-driving experience, intoxication resulting in sleep driving is involuntary. We equate this to a rule that would provide Ambien users one free sleep-driving episode before they could be held criminally culpable, even though they knew the drug has caused sleep driving by others. Defendant does not cite any authority in support of this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">As we have noted, this court explained in <em>Velez </em>that criminal responsibility in a general intent crime is justified where a defendant is voluntarily intoxicated to the point of unconsciousness even though there was no actual intent to commit a crime because a defendant may not avoid the criminal harm caused by his or her failure to act \u201cwith reason and conscience.\u201d <em>(Velez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 794.) Criminal responsibility in this context is predicated on a theory of criminal negligence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, this court applied an objective test in <em>Velez, </em>to determine whether a defendant was voluntarily intoxicated: whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>circumstances could have anticipated the intoxicating effects of the substance he had consumed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 794-796.) And, as we have noted, <em>Chajfey </em>held that a finding of voluntary intoxication was proper even though the specific event of sleep driving was not foreseeable from the defendant\u2019s past experience with prescription Xanax. <em>(Chaffey, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 857.) Defendant\u2019s one free sleep-driving episode theory is inconsistent with <em>Velez </em>and <em>Chaffey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">The jury here was instructed that a person is involuntarily intoxicated if he voluntarily ingested a legally prescribed drug that caused him to act unconsciously, \u201cwithout knowing or that he reasonably should have known of the drug\u2019s intoxicating effects.\u201d The trial court further instructed, \u201cIn determining whether intoxication by prescription drug is involuntary, consider whether the defendant knew or had reason to anticipate that his use of the prescription drug could cause such intoxicating effects.\u201d These instructions adequately stated the law on unconsciousness and involuntary intoxication. <em>(Velez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 796; <em>Chaffey, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 856-858.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The instruction essentially told the jury that if it found defendant knew or had reason to know that his use of Ambien could cause sleep driving, then defendant\u2019s condition was not caused by involuntary intoxication.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>other hand, if the jury found defendant did not know and could not have reasonably known that his use of Ambien could cause sleep driving, the jury was informed that defendant\u2019s intoxication would have been involuntary and the resulting unconsciousness would have been a complete defense to driving under the influence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">4. <em>Harmless Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">As we have indicated, the flaws we have identified in CALCRIM No. 3425 were harmless in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">In our harmless error analysis, we first focus on the evidence that establishes defendant was voluntarily intoxicated, because if he was, as defendant appropriately conceded at oral argument, the flaw in the unconsciousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>instruction is of no consequence. Thus, having concluded the voluntary and involuntary intoxication instructions were adequate, we look to the evidence that establishes defendant knew or should have known the Ambien he voluntarily took causes sleep driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Dr. Burton testified that each prescription of Ambien must include a written warning that Ambien can cause sleep driving. Dr. Donelson called sleep driving a \u201cwidely recognized\u201d problem. Defendant did not claim actual ignorance of Ambien\u2019s intoxicating effects. To the contrary, defendant admitted that, prior to his arrest, he was aware of warnings that Ambien can cause sleep driving and other complex behaviors while the user is asleep. Defendant knew that prior to his arrest he had engaged in \u201ccomplex behaviors\u201d while asleep on multiple occasions. Although defendant knew from what he saw on television that he should consult a doctor if he experienced \u201ccomplex behaviors\u201d while asleep and using Ambien, he chose not to consult his doctor. Defendant knew or should have known that Ambien causes sleep driving, even though he had not previously personally experienced a sleep-driving episode after using Ambien. <em>(Chaffey, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">There was evidence that defendant actually took more than the maximum prescribed dosage. By his own testimony, he took at least one more pill than was prescribed in a 24-hour period. Furthermore, tablets were purportedly \u201cmissing.\u201d Defendant testified four pills were missing, but he told Dr. Sokolov that seven or eight were missing. Based on the amount of zolpidem in defendant\u2019s system at the time of his arrest, Dr. Burton opined that defendant had taken more than the maximum prescribed dosage. And if defendant last took Ambien at the earlier time he claimed, Dr. Donelson opined that defendant would have taken a \u201chuge dose,\u201d probably close to a toxic level\u2014as many as four to six tablets. And defendant knew he should not take more than one tablet in a 24-hour period, even though his doctor did not tell him this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Not only was there evidence defendant took more than the recommended maximum dosage, but there was also evidence that he attempted to conceal having taken Ambien by telling the officer he had taken prescription Vicodin at two specific times on that day\u2014once in the morning and again in the afternoon\u2014while never mentioning he had taken any Ambien at all. A consciousness of guilt can be inferred from this concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">The evidence overwhelmingly establishes defendant knew or should have known that the Ambien he took could have caused sleep driving, even though he had not previously personally experienced a sleep-driving episode after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>using Ambien. Thus, defendant was voluntarily intoxicated, and the unconsciousness instruction does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Even if the unconsciousness instruction did apply, the flaw in the instruction is nonetheless harmless in this case. \u201cIf a jury instruction is ambiguous, we inquire whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood and misapplied the instruction.\u201d <em>(People v. Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 963 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171] <em>(Smithey)) </em>On review, the instructions must be examined as a whole, in light of the trial record. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Paysinger </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 26, 30 [93 Cal.Rptr.3d 901] <em>(Paysinger) </em>[court determined it was not \u201creasonably likely the jury understood the challenged instruction in a way that undermined the presumption of innocence or tended to relieve the prosecution of the burden to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d]; see <em>Dieguez, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Our examination of the trial record includes consideration of the arguments of counsel. (See <em>People v. Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 189 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664].) Similar to our harmless error analysis, the thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was that defendant\u2019s intoxication was voluntary and, as a consequence, the jury need not reach the issue of defendant\u2019s consciousness. The prosecutor told the jury, \u201cThe first question you have to ask yourself is after you establish he was under the influence, was the intoxication voluntary or was it involuntary, because that makes all the difference in this case.\u201d He later told the jury, \u201cVoluntary intoxication is not a defense to driving under the influence of a drug. If you conclude that the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication was voluntary, then the defendant\u2019s state of consciousness shall not be considered. ... If you find voluntary, do not consider consciousness, and the outcome is guilty. That\u2019s where the law is.\u201d The prosecutor later made the point again. \u201cThe intoxication is voluntary. The result is you cannot consider his state of consciousness in this case, and he\u2019s responsible for his own actions regardless of his state of consciousness. . . . That\u2019s what the law is, and, if you apply it, the defendant is guilty of this crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">The prosecutor mentioned the unconsciousness instruction, but only to say, \u201cThis is the instruction that you cannot use unless you find that the . . . intoxication was involuntary. . . . You can\u2019t even get here unless you find involuntary intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">In discussing unconsciousness, the prosecutor never suggested the jury was compelled to conclude defendant was conscious because he acted as if he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>conscious. The closest the prosecutor came to such an argument was when he argued that having amnesia does not equate to unconsciousness. In that context, the prosecutor said, \u201cIf they were [vz'c] unconscious, they [sz'c] would not be able to have an interaction with the officer.\u201d At no time did the prosecutor refer to the suspect language in the unconsciousness instruction. The prosecutor closed with, \u201cSo that\u2019s basically it. We\u2019re back to here. This is how you have to look at it. The defendant was voluntarily intoxicated, and he\u2019s responsible for his actions. That\u2019s what this case is about.\u201d There is simply no reason to suspect the jury relied on the instruction, let alone used it to disregard the expert opinion, given the prosecutor\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s state of consciousness was not a critical factor in determining guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Lastly, we examine the instructions as a whole. \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[T]he correctness of jury instructions is to be determined from the entire charge of the court, not from a consideration of parts of an instruction or from a particular instruction.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Smithey, </em>supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 963.) In addition to instructing the jury on unconsciousness, voluntary intoxication, and involuntary intoxication, the trial court instructed the jury that it may not convict defendant unless the prosecution proved defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was conscious when he acted, that the jury must consider all of the evidence, and that if two or more reasonable conclusions could be drawn from circumstantial evidence\u2014one pointing to guilt and the other pointing to innocence\u2014the jury must accept the one pointing to innocence. The jury was also instructed on the manner in which it must evaluate expert and other witness testimony. The instruction used here, although flawed, did reference the requirement that the jury consider <em>all </em>of the evidence when determining whether there was a reasonable doubt defendant was conscious when he drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">Given the entirety of the instructions, the trial evidence and the arguments of counsel, it was not <em>reasonably likely </em>the jury could have believed it was required to find defendant was conscious without considering all of the evidence presented, including the expert testimony, or that defendant bore the burden of persuading the jury that he was unconscious while driving. <em>(Paysinger, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.4th at p. 30; <em>Dieguez, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 276.) Accordingly, the error occasioned by the flaw in CALCRIM No. 3425 was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">II.

The failure to give an instruction on an essential issue, or the giving of erroneous instructions, may be cured if the essential material is covered by other correct instructions properly given.\u201d <em>(Dieguez, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at p. 277.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1106-9\"> We note that CALCRIM No. 3426, voluntary intoxication, states two ways a person can be voluntarily intoxicated\u2014\u201cknowing that [the drug] could produce an intoxicating effect, <em>or willingly assuming the risk of that effect.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) We take no position here about the assumption of the risk language as an alternative to actual knowledge of the intoxicating effects in cases not involving prescription drug intoxication.
