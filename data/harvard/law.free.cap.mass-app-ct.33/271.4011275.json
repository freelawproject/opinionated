The land had been transferred with the approval of the mayor and city council. Subsequent to the delivery of the deed, the Legislature, by enactment of St. 1983, c. 326, purportedly authorized the conveyance of the parcel by private sale. In their \u201cten taxpayers\u201d complaint in the Superior Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the conveyance violated the city\u2019s obligations under a public charitable trust which they claimed arose in 1893 when the parcel was acquired by deeds which state the land is to be used \u201cforever for park purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They sought to force the city to forever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201chold, manage, use and allow use\u201d of the parcel for public parkland. They also requested an order rescinding the conveyance to Gilberg and requiring him to restore the parcel to its condition prior to his acquisition of it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the plaintiffs were granted leave to pursue their action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3(10), the city and Gilberg filed a complaint in the Probate Court for application of cy pres. An order of the Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court assigned a judge to sit simultaneously as a justice of the Probate and Superior Courts to hear and decide these cases, consolidated in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 9. The Attorney General later was permitted to intervene as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The case was submitted to the judge, sitting without jury, on the basis of certain stipulated facts, exhibits, and pretrial discovery. After taking a view, the judge issued a memorandum of decision and order in which he concluded that the parcel was still impressed with the public charitable trust originally established, and it had not been demonstrated that it had become impossible or impracticable to carry out the trust purposes. He expressly found that the parcel possessed \u201ca beautiful scenic ocean view\u201d and was \u201csuitable for park purposes.\u201d He also found that at the time of the purported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>conveyance to Gilberg the parcel \u201cwas a popular area for walkers, riders, and joggers\u201d and \u201cprovided a scenic vista of open space suitable for park purposes and reinforced the \u2018greenness\u2019 of the area.\u201d He further concluded that the trust obligations could not be impaired by the enactment of special legislation purporting to authorize the city to convey the parcel at a private sale and declared the conveyance to Gilberg null and void. He ordered restoration of the parcel to its pre-1982 condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The city and Gilberg appeal from the consolidated judgment entered in accordance with the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. They claim that the judge misinterpreted the terms of the 1893 conveyance and improperly construed the concept of park purposes and, therefore, erroneously concluded that a trust was established, and that its terms can still be carried out. They argue that even if a trust was established, only a general charitable intent was evident; that compliance with the original terms is today impracticable; and that the doctrine of cy pres should be applied to determine that the conveyance to Gilberg, and the development and use he proposed, bring the conveyance within the original purposes of the trust. We afiirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">1. <em>Was a Public Charitable Trust </em>Established?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Each of the two deeds by which the city of Lynn acquired title states in the habendum clause, \u201cto the . . . [c] ity of Lynn to its own use and behoof forever for park purposes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Since the deed of one grantor cites the proposed conveyance by the other grantor of the adjacent land to the city, we treat the conveyances as constituting a single declaration of trust. See <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 213, 218 (1979). \u201cProperty conveyed to a governmental body ... for particular public purposes may be subject to an enforceable general public obligation or trust to use the property for those purposes.\u201d <em>Nickols </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Middlesex County, </em>341 Mass. 13, 18 (1960), and authorities cited. Whether a trust or obligation is imposed is \u201ca matter of interpretation of the particular instrument and determination of the particular donors\u2019 intent [,]\u201d and \u201cis to be ascertained from a study of the instrument [s] as a whole in the light of the circumstances attending . . . [their] execution. Search should be made for a general plan . . . designed to express a consistent and harmonious purpose.\u201d <em>Nickols </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Middlesex County, supra </em>at 19, quoting from <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>319 Mass. 243, 248 (1946). See <em>Newburyport Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 206, 229 (1980); <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Fall River, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 241, 243 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The conveyances in the present case contain direct and unambiguous language, clearly declaring that the grantors divested themselves of all their interests in the land \u201cforever for park purposes.\u201d Similar conveyances of land for parks, where the grantors specified the land be used \u201cforever\u201d or \u201cin perpetuity,\u201d without other limitation, have been found to establish a public charitable trust. See <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>344 Mass. 626, 629-631 (1962); <em>Dunphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 376, 383 (1975); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>369 Mass. 979, 985-986 (1975); <em>Newburyport Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 229-230; <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Fall River, supra </em>at 244-245. There is here no precatory language; no mere statement of a use only; no condition or limitation on the use; nor any right of reversion. Compare <em>Loomis </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>331 Mass. 129, 132 (1954); <em>Dunphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 378; <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 983-985; <em>Newburyport Redev. Authy. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 230. See generally <em>Selectmen of Provincetown </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 639, 642-643, 644-645 &amp; nn. 6-8 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The city and Gilberg suggest that since the grantors received substantial payment for the land in 1893, the conveyance was not a gift and, therefore, no trust was established. The record indicates that the city council appropriated $12,000 toward the $20,000 purchase price on the condition that the remaining $8,000 be raised by public subscription. The latter amount was obtained from \u201cproperty owners near the beach, and by a few public spirited citizens\u201d and included $1,500 donated by the grantors. We have found no authority, nor is any cited to us,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the effect that the receipt of substantial consideration prevents a grantor from conveying property to a municipality in such manner as to establish a public charitable trust. Generally, the creation of a trust may be supported by consideration \u201cin the sense that the beneficiary confers a benefit on the settlor in order to obtain from him the creation of the trust.\u201d Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 202, at 8-9 n.8 (2d ed. rev. 1992). Moreover, the grantors\u2019 monetary contribution in effect establishes that the conveyance, in part, was a gift. In any event, the record does not indicate that the payment to the grantors represented fair market value. This case must be distinguished from decisions denying trust status to conveyances made for substantial consideration \u201cin fee simple forever\u201d and which recited \u201cno specific purpose ... in the deeds . . . .\u201d <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Parks &amp; Recreation Commn. of Boston, </em>345 Mass. 641, 643 (1963). See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>334 Mass. 285, 286 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The circumstances attending the conveyances to the city evidence a general plan to dedicate the land permanently to public park purposes. During much of the time it was pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>vately owned, the land had been vacant and open to the public. In 1891, the city\u2019s park commissioners wrote in their annual report that the owners \u201care willing to sell this land to the city at [a] reasonable price, if dedicated to public use.\u201d They described a less desirable alternative for the city: \u201cIt is evident that the time is not far distant when the owners will seek to recover the sum annually paid in taxes for many years, and will sell the land in small lots or make such improvements as may exclude the public.\u201d In their 1892 annual report, the commissioners stated the land was to be \u201csecured for public enjoyment forever.\u201d The \u201cgeneral plan\u201d and expression of a \u201cconsistent and harmonious purpose\u201d are evident. See <em>Nickols </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Middlesex County, </em>341 Mass. at 19. The judge correctly concluded that a public charitable trust arose from these conveyances and that the acceptance of deeds by the city, \u201cconstituted a contract between the donor and the donee which must be observed and enforced.\u201d <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>344 Mass, at 631. Accord <em>Dunphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. at 383; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>369 Mass, at 982-983, 988; <em>Newburyport Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">2. <em>Has It Become Impracticable to Carry Out the Trust </em>Purposes?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The city and Gilberg argue that it has become impossible or impracticable to carry out the trust purposes, claiming the city\u2019s objective in acquiring the three and one-half acre tract was to provide public access to the shore, and that the construction of Lynn Shore Drive achieved that objective. They maintain also that the cutting off of the parcel at issue leaves it too small to be usable for park purposes and that it now has only \u201cornamental\u201d value. They therefore ask that the doctrine of cy pres be applied to allow the conveyance to Gilberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Mere physical access to the shore was not the only objective of the city\u2019s acquisition of the three and one-half acre tract. The park commissioners in 1891 also -wanted to acquire \u201cmore open air space\u201d and to avoid the potential exclusion of the public if the tract remained in private ownership. In their 1892 annual report, the commissioners, anticipating the construction of Lynn Shore Drive, describe a highway which would promote public enjoyment of the \u201cviews\u201d and \u201csea breezes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">While we find no precise and widely accepted definition of \u201cpark\u201d or \u201cpark purposes,\u201d we believe the expansive view expressed by the park commissioners to be in accord with the general definition of the authorities. \u201c[T]he term \u2018park\u2019 usually signifies an open or inclosed tract of land set apart for the recreation and enjoyment of the public; or, \u2018in the general acceptance of the term, a public park is said to be a tract of land, <em>great or </em>small, dedicated and maintained for the purposes of pleasure, exercise, amusement, <em>or </em>ornament; a place to which the public at large may resort to for recreation, <em>air, and light </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>344 Mass. at 630, quoting from <em>King </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>157 S.W.2d 682, 685 (Tex.Civ.App. 1941). Similar themes were expressed in decisions rendered at approximately the time of the conveyances in question. See <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>147 U.S. 282, 297 (1893) (virtually every city and town is planning parks \u201cas a pleasure ground for rest and exercise in the open air\u201d); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>174 Mass. 476, 479-480 (1899) (\u201c[parks] are expected to minister, not only to the grosser senses, but also to the love of the beautiful in nature . . . . If wisely planned and properly cared, for they promote the mental as well as the physical health of the people\u201d). Gilberg and the city in effect ask that the active aspects of recreation be stressed, and specifically argue that park purposes should not be defined so broadly as to include \u201cornamental\u201d uses. Given the scope which authorities have given to the meaning of \u201cpark,\u201d we decline the invitation to apply a narrow definition. Compare <em>Catanzarite </em>v. <em>Springfield, 32 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 967 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The argument that the parcel is too small to serve park purposes is belied by the judge\u2019s findings that it was being used, at the time of the purported conveyance to Gilberg, for exercise and recreation and provided pleasant vistas including \u201ca beautiful scenic ocean view.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s finding that the parcel \u201cprovides a buffer zone between private use and the ocean\u201d supports the conclusion that the parcel continues to satisfy an important objective of the original acquisition. Even in the absence of these findings, the judge\u2019s observation that the parcel constitutes a \u201cgreen edge to the parkway\u201d which \u201creinforced the greenness of the area\u201d alone might well support his conclusion. By ornamenting the parkway and making the general area pleasing to the eye, the parcel serves park purposes. See <em>Howe </em>v. Lowell, 171 Mass. 575, 580-581 (1898); <em>Hamlen </em>v. <em>Sorkin, </em>251 Mass. 143, 150-151 (1925). In sum, the judge\u2019s findings, none of which is clearly erroneous, amply support his conclusion that the city and Gilberg have not demonstrated that it had become impossible or impracticable to carry out the original park purposes of the 1893 conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">3. <em>Could the Conveyance Effectively be Authorized by the Legislature or City </em>Officials'?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">It has long been held that the contract obligations arising from a charitable trust such as exists in the present case cannot be impaired legislatively. <em>Cary Library </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>151 Mass. 364, 378-380 (1890). <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>274 Mass. 453, 462-464 (1931) (A conveyance conditional upon perpetual use of the property as a hospital imported a contract obligation. \u201c[T]he sanctity of [such a contract] [i]s under the protection of art. 1, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution of the United States ...\u201d). The special legislation authorizing the city to sell and convey could therefore neither impair the trust obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>gation, nor ratify the purported conveyance. See <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>344 Mass. at 631; <em>Dunphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. at 383; <em>Newburyport Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 230. \u201cThe policy of the Commonwealth has been to add to the common law inviolability of parks express prohibition against encroachment.... The firmly settled and frequently declared policy of the Legislature heretofore has been to preserve public parks free from intrusion of every kind which would interfere in any degree with their complete use for this public end. It cannot be assumed that this policy is to be lightly thrown aside.\u201d <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>357 Mass. 435, 439 (1970), quoting from <em>Higginson </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Sch.

The tract was thereafter leased to the Metropolitan Park Commission, the predecessor of the Metropolitan District- Commission (MDC), for ninety-nine years, beginning in 1907. The former Commission then constructed Lynn Shore Drive as a part of a park system now extending from Nahant to Swampscott, thereby separating the parcel at issue from the waterfront portion of the original tract. In 1981, the city council of Lynn voted to authorize sale of the parcel to Gilberg upon relinquishment by the MDC of any of its interest. The city council and mayor authorized the sale to Gilberg in December, 1981, and a deed was executed on January 5, 1982, for \u201cnominal consideration.\u201d The MDC, under authority of St. 1981, c. 753, and by an instrument dated May 24, 1982, relinquished all its right, title, and interest in the parcel. Subsequently, St. 1983, c. 326, authorized the city to sell and convey the parcel at a private sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Gilberg commenced construction of a parking lot after the parcel was conveyed to him.

Since all parties have fully briefed the matter and no suggestion of prejudice has been raised, see <em>Royal Indemn. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 88 (1977), we have reviewed the issue. All the evidence submitted to the judge consisted of documents which we have before us.

The factual findings of the judge relating to the cy pres aspect of this proceeding, aided by his physical view of the parcel, implicate a different standard of review \u2014 whether the findings are clearly erroneous.
