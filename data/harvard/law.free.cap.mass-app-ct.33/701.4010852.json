After hearing evidence of the so-called \u201cdepreciated reproduction cost\u201d of improvements on the BPOE\u2019s property, a jury determined the damages to be $2,500,000. Essentially, the appeal from an ensuing judgment in that amount (plus interest and costs) by the defendant LRA focuses on two grounds: (1) the propriety of the use of the disfavored depreciated reproduction cost approach to value (DRC)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (2) the effect of a restriction on use as an element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">On February 5, 1988, the LRA, pursuant to an urban renewal plan under G. L. c. 121B, took by eminent domain a portion of the BPOE\u2019s property. The BPOE\u2019s property had been improved by the construction of a lodge building in 1969. Additional improvements \u2014 a pavilion, horseshoe pits, a softball field, a volleyball area, a parking area, and other outing grounds \u2014 were added later. The lodge and these ancillary facilities were used primarily for the BPOE\u2019s charitable functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">1. <em>Depreciated reproduction cost.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The LRA first attacks the admission of evidence of the disfavored DRC, as well as the propriety of its application by the BPOE\u2019s valuation experts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its argument appears to be based upon this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Correia </em>v. <em>New Bedford Redev. Authy., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 291-292 (1977) <em>(Correia \u00cd), </em>which required the trial judge to make a preliminary finding that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tiff established that a determination of fair market value using preferred methods of valuation (i.e., comparable sales, capitalization of income) would be impossible. On further appellate review, however, the Supreme Judicial Court, maintaining that it was not departing from long established principles, stated, \u201cThe rule of disfavor . . . should be viewed as one of need, not \u2018impossibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>New Bedford Redev. Authy., </em>375 Mass. 360, 366-367 (1978) <em>(Correia II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Placing great stress on the need for the preliminary finding referred to in <em>Correia I, </em>the LRA asserts that the trial judge failed to make the requisite companion preliminary findings to support the need to use DRC method evidence, i.e., that (a) the BPOE\u2019s property was special purpose property and (b) the other two valuation approaches were inadequate or unreliable due to the special, unique characteristics of the buildings and other structures. As to the types of properties presenting unusual problems of proof of damages warranting the admission of DRC evidence, see <em>Newton Girl Scout Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy., </em>335 Mass. 189, 196 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">In eminent domain cases, the trial judge is \u201callowed to exercise sound discretion in determining when special conditions exist so as to justify the use of [DRC] data.\u201d <em>Correia II, </em>375 Mass. at 367. Such discretion is quite broad. See <em>Library Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Malden Redev. Authy., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 877, 878 (1980), and cases cited. The BPOE correctly argues that it is the use of the property <em>taken as a whole </em>that determines whether the property is special purpose property, i.e., particularly well suited for the purpose for which it is used. The typical concerns over the use of DRC evidence, such as \u201cwhere special purpose structures are very greatly out of date, are no longer well fitted to their particular use, and would not be reproduced [if destroyed or taken] by any prudent owner,\u201d do not appear to be present in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy., </em>352 Mass. 143, 149 (1967). After considering conflicting testimony as to the availability of market data to compare to the BPOE\u2019s property, the judge, acting well within his discretion, determined that the BPOE had demonstrated the need to use DRC evidence. There was testimony and other evidence adduced at trial from which the judge properly could conclude that the BPOE\u2019s property, as improved by the pavilion, the ball fields, the parking area, and the lodge building itself, is specially adapted for its charitable functions, and, therefore, meets the definition of special purpose property expounded by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Correia II. </em>The admission of DRC evidence was not error, and the LRA\u2019s particular complaints about the witnesses\u2019 application of that evidence are not such as would cause us to reverse the judgment, as they merely bear on the weight the jury could have afforded such evidence. See and compare <em>Trustees of the Stigmatine Fathers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562, 569-570 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">2. <em>Effect of land use restriction. </em>At the time of the taking, the LRA recorded an urban renewal plan that authorized the taking in fee of 9.6 acres of the BPOE\u2019s fourteen-acre parcel and simultaneously imposed on the remaining 4.4 acres of land a restriction which limited its use to nonprofit benevolent purposes for a period of twenty-five years. At issue here is whether the imposition of a land use restriction on the remainder of the BPOE\u2019s land (requiring it to continue to be used for benevolent purposes only) diminished its value. The trial judge ruled that the restriction was essentially part of the taking, i.e., the taking and the restrictions \u201cwere one, an interrelated, simultaneous transaction,\u201d occasioned by the urban renewal plan, and he allowed testimony as to the effect of the restriction on value.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The LRA argues that the use restriction is analogous to \u201cdown zoning\u201d and does not rise to the level of a taking. Citing our opinion in <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Newton Redev. Authy., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 626 (1979) <em>(Roach I), </em>the LRA takes the position that, \u201c[h]ad the restriction been an actual change in zoning which resulted from the urban renewal project, the zoning change would have to be disregarded in valuing property in a land damage proceeding.\u201d The LRA goes on to argue that the BPOE is \u201cnot entitled to compensation because the restriction was imposed, not as zoning, but as part of an urban renewal plan,\u201d and, citing <em>Lipinski </em>v. <em>Lynn Redev. Authy., </em>355 Mass. 550, 554 (1969), concludes that \u201c[w]hether the redevelopment plan increases or decreases value is to be disregarded in assessing damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">On further appellate review in <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Newton Redev. Authy., </em>381 Mass. 135 (1980) <em>(Roach II), </em>the court held that, although a potential use prohibited by a zoning restriction at the time of a taking may be considered as an element of value if there is a reasonable probability that the zoning law will be changed, \u201ca probability of rezoning or an actual change in zoning cannot be taken into account if it \u2018results from the fact that the project which is the basis for the taking was impending.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, quoting from 4 Nichols, Eminent Domain \u00a7 12.322[1] n.7.1 (rev. 3d ed. 1979). Based on its reading of <em>Roach II, </em>the LRA asserts that the effect of the taking upon the value of the remainder would be irrelevant because the use restriction was part of the urban renewal plan that occasioned the taking of the bulk of the BPOE\u2019s property, thereby barring compensation. This argument misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In <em>Lipinski </em>and <em>Roach II, </em>the court addressed how the reasonable probability of certain changes might bear on the value of the subject properties at the time of the taking. In those cases, the issue raised respecting the land use restriction was the value of land that was taken; here, however, the alleged injury (diminution in value) the restriction caused is to the <em>remaining </em>4.4 acres of the BPOE\u2019s land. \u201cThe measure of damages for the taking of land by eminent domain is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the market value, at the time of the taking, of the land actually taken and the decline, attributable to the taking, in the market value of the owner\u2019s remaining land.\u201d <em>Aselbekian </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy., </em>341 Mass. 398, 400 (1960). See <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 556, 559-560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We agree with the BPOE that \u201cthe imposition of the restriction substantially affected the marketability of the remaining acres.\u201d Since compensation for all injury to the portion not taken is required (see G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 12), and the restriction here is such an injury, the effect of the restriction upon the value of the remainder is perforce relevant because the BPOE now is prohibited from realizing the value of the highest and best use of the remainder \u2014 here, industrial use. The jury thus were properly permitted to consider the diminution in value of the remainder resulting from the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-15\"> It had been contemplated that this parcel was to be the site on which Emerson College would be relocated.
