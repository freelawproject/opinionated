After a hearing on his petition, the judge ordered that the child bear the paternal surname.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mother\u2019s appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>followed and raises questions about whether the judge considered the proper legal standard and whether there was sufficient evidence to support the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">If, as here occurred, the child\u2019s last name is altered, the mother argues that such a revision must be supported by evidence that it was in the child\u2019s best interests, and lacking this, the order allowing the petition may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We sketch the background. The mother welcomed the birth of her daughter, Meredith, on March 4, 1990. Meredith\u2019s father has never been married to her mother. From birth, Meredith has lived with her mother and a half-sister \u2014 the sole offspring of the mother\u2019s prior marriage. The mother was divorced in July, 1986, and retained the surname of her former husband as her own. She selected the name so that it would match that of Meredith\u2019s sister.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 15, 1990, about two months after Meredith\u2019s birth, Richard brought an action seeking a declaration that he was the child\u2019s father. A judgment to that effect was entered. The judgment also provided that Richard pay support for his daughter and that Richard have joint legal custody of Meredith with the mother, the latter having physical custody. About five months later, Richard filed the change-of-name petition which resulted in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Throughout the hearing, the judge indulged a presumption of patronymic naming of children. The judge\u2019s other comments offered during the trial demonstrated her agreement with the father\u2019s assumption that, in general, a child born <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>out of wedlock should bear the last name of its father so long as the father has acknowledged paternity, contributed support, and visited with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The judge noted in her limited findings that Richard complied with the support and visitation arrangements and applied himself with diligence to his work and continuing education. Those findings did no more than focus on his compliance with his parental obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The judge further found that the mother named Meredith without consulting with Richard and that \u201cthe surname . . . is the same name of the mother\u2019s former husband, whom she divorced some years prior to the minor child\u2019s birth.\u201d During the course of the hearing \u2014 in at least eight instances \u2014 the judge observed that the name the mother had chosen at the time of her divorce \u2014 and had given to Meredith \u2014 was not really her own, but rather the name of her former husband. She also used the occasion to point out that the mother was a \u201cvery attractive lady\u201d and was likely to marry again.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">1. <em>The Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In spite of the term \u201cpublic interests\u201d contained in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 12 (1990 ed.), a statute which generally governs petitions by adults or entire families to change their names, see, e.g., <em>Petition of Merolevitz, </em>320 Mass. 448 (1946); <em>Petition of Buyarsky, </em>322 Mass. 335 (1948), that language is not a substitute for the standard applicable to contested petitions for the change of childrens\u2019 names, <em>Petition of Two Minors for Change of Name, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 941 (1988) (\u201cbest interests of child\u201d standard has not been displaced by the 1977 amendment to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 12). Further it is settled that findings in litigation between former spouses which involve the change of their childrens\u2019 surnames must focus on the best interests of the child. <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. 521 (1956). <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Rothman, </em>370 Mass. 79, 81 (1976). <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss </em>(No. 1), 372 Mass. 64, 69 (1977). The same criterion should apply to a ruling which, as here, alters the name of a child born out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">We have found no case in Massachusetts which addresses this precise point but other courts have made no distinction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dunning, </em>87 Wash. 2d 50 (1976); <em>Bobo </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>38 Ohio St. 3d 330 (1988); <em>In re Petition of D.K.W. </em>v. <em>J.L.B., </em>807 P.2d 1222 (Colo. Ct. App. 1990). In other contexts we have been inclined to relieve children of the stigma traditionally attached to birth out of wedlock. See <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663 (1980) (where paternity is conceded, there is no justification for denying the right of a child born out of wedlock to inherit from his father); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 590 (1987) (child born out of wedlock has equal protection right to receive support from the person adjudicated to be his father as a child of divorced parents would be entitled to receive under like circumstances). We perceive no reason not to follow that course here. In resolving a dispute as to the surname of a child whose parents have not married, a court should not attribute greater weight to the father\u2019s interest in having the child bear the paternal surname than to the mother\u2019s interest in having the child bear her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the past the decisional law tended to protect the paternal surname. <em>Lassiter-Geers </em>v. <em>Reichenbach, </em>303 Md. 88 (1985), cert, denied, 474 U.S. 1019 (1985), and cases cited. The current trend of the cases is that the right of the father to have the child bear his name is no greater than that of the mother to have the child bear her name. <em>In re Rossell, </em>196 N.J. Super. 109 (Law Div. 1984). See also <em>State ex rel. Spence-Chapin Servs. to Families &amp; Children </em>v. <em>Tedeno, </em>101 Misc. 2d 485 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1979) (child permitted to maintain mother\u2019s surname where mother had custody of child, would be primary caretaking figure for child, and would make major decisions for her). Cf. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>City Clerk of Lowell, </em>373 Mass. at 185 (1977) (\u201cimportant changes in popular and legal thinking suggest that ancient canards about the proper role of women have no place in the law\u201d), quoting from <em>Surabian </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>362 Mass. 342, 348 n.7 (1972). Therefore, this principle of equality should be a component of the decisional process when considering the pivotal factors in the application of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Those further considerations include the effect of the change of the child\u2019s surname on the preservation and development of the child\u2019s relationship with each parent and other siblings; the length of time the child has utilized a given name; the age of the child as it may relate to his or her identification with the surname; and the difficulties and embarrassment that the child may experience from bearing the present or proposed surname. <em>Bobo </em>v. <em>Jewell, supra </em>at 335. <em>In re Marriage of Schiffman, </em>28 Cal. 3d 640 (1980) (discussing several factors to apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">2. <em>Application of the Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The judge should have outlined the best interests test as the analytical framework for her findings of fact and rulings of law. There was considerable argument about that topic by counsel during the trial. However, it is evident from our review of the record that the judge may not have focused on the proper aspects of the test, and was, in all events, plainly wrong in her ultimate conclusion. As we mentioned earlier in this opinion, the judge\u2019s assumption that the mother\u2019s future marriage prospects would diminish her attachment to her chosen surname was completely unwarranted. The judge should not have disregarded the mother\u2019s cogent reason offered in support of the best interests of her child for the use of the mother\u2019s surname \u2014 namely the consideration that both children be spared, during their formative years, the embarrassment and difficulty associated with having different surnames.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In the circumstances presented here, we hold that there is no presumption favoring the father\u2019s right to have his child bear his name solely because he provides financial support and recognizes the child as his own. More precisely, nowhere in the father\u2019s account of his own position did he express any interest of his child which would be furthered by the change of name. He testified that his daughter \u201cshould have her father\u2019s name\u201d and that she \u201cdeserves her father\u2019s name.\u201d On this record we hold that Richard failed to shoulder his burden of coming forward with evidence that the name change requested would be in Meredith\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>We are of opinion that the interests of the child were not given appropriate deference by the judge. There has been no showing that the emotional bond between the father and daughter will be weakened if the child maintains her mother\u2019s surname. Unlike the situations in <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. at 522, and <em>Petition of Two Minors for Change of Name, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 941, Meredith was originally given the maternal surname, and there has been no showing that the mother is attempting to \u201cweaken the bonds between father and child.\u201d Here the parents have joint legal custody which should promote the tie between father and daughter. Also, Richard testified that his infant daughter recognizes him and seems to enjoy his presence. As Meredith is too young to have achieved any significant identification with her last name, it seems unlikely that the mother\u2019s choice adversely impacts on her present relationship with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Finally, the other members of Meredith\u2019s household \u2014 her half-sister and her mother \u2014 bear the mother\u2019s surname. The change sought could well subject her to embarrassment or confusion at school and require at least some awkward explanation to her peers.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Review of all the relevant circumstances presented at the hearing convinces us that Richard has failed to establish that the change he sought is in the best interests of Meredith. In the absence of such proof the judge\u2019s decision may not stand. Accordingly, the order granting a change of name must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-17\"> The petition was brought pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 12, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 869, \u00a7 3, which provides: \u201cA petition for the change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>name of a person may be heard by the probate court in the county where the petitioner resides. The change of name of a person shall be granted unless such change is inconsistent with public interests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\"> In the absence of objection from the putative father \u2014 and there was none \u2014 the mother has the right to control the initial surname of her child born out of wedlock. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>City Clerk of Lowell, </em>373 Mass. 178, 191 (1977) (also recognizing the mother\u2019s right to custody and duty to support her illegitimate child as a natural guardian). Nothing in the record reflects that the father objected to the child\u2019s name at birth. Thus, the finding of lack of consultation with the father should have had no influence on the judge\u2019s ultimate decision to allow a change of the child\u2019s surname. The mother was clearly entitled to that name. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>City Clerk of Lowell, </em>373 Mass. at 188.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
