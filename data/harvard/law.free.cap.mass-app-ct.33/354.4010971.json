The lot was narrow but deep. The southerly portion, bordering the street, was zoned for business. The northerly portion was zoned for manufacturing, which included open storage of equipment and materials as a use either permitted or specially permitted, depending on factors not here relevant. The Maidas\u2019 lot, which abuts the Stampfls\u2019 lot on the north and northwest (in the shape of an \u201cL\u201d rotated one quarter turn clockwise) was also bisected by a zone line. The easterly portion of their lot, which abutted the Stampfls directly to the north, and where the Maidas\u2019 residence was located, was zoned for manufacturing; The westerly portion of their lot, abutting the northern portion of the Stampfls\u2019 westerly boundary line, was zoned residential. The Norwood zoning by-law requires the maintenance of a seventy-five-foot buffer strip devoted to plantings and certain limited accessory uses where a manufacturing district abuts a residential district. Hence the Stampfls, when they purchased their lot in 1986, were entitled to use the northerly portion of their lot for open storage of equipment and materials, subject to maintaining a seventy-five-foot buffer strip along their northwesterly boundary, i.e., along the residentially zoned portion of the Maidas\u2019 lot. In our view, that continues to be the case, notwithstanding the events that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Shortly after purchasing their lot, the Stampfls filed a plan of their property with the planning board. It was apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>a perimeter plan and was endorsed \u201capproval not required.\u201d Shortly thereafter the zoning district lines were amended in a manner that left the Maidas\u2019 lot zoned residential in its entirety and the Stampfls\u2019 lot zoned mostly for business, the zone line for which was moved north roughly 140 feet, and with the residential zone being north of that line. (Although the residentially zoned portion of the Stampfls\u2019 lot represents only perhaps one-quarter of the lot .area, that portion includes the entire boundary line between their property and the Maidas\u2019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It is not contested by the Maidas that the Stampfls are entitled to the protection of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par. (1990 ed.), which provides that when a plan is submitted to the planning board for an endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, \u201cuse of the land shown on such plan shall be governed by applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance or by-law in effect at the time of the submission of such plan . . . .\u201d The by-law in effect when the Stampfls submitted their plan permitted them to use the portion of their lot zoned for manufacturing for open storage, subject only to the buffer along the portion of the Maidas\u2019 property zoned residential. To require a buffer strip now along the portion of the Maidas\u2019 property previously zoned for manufacturing would be, in effect, to treat the Stampfls\u2019 use of their land as governed by the by-law amendments that followed the submission of their plan, shrinking the protection given them by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Stampfls contend that, because buffer strips are required only in manufacturing and certain related zones, and their property, where it abuts the Maidas\u2019, is zoned residential, they are not required to maintain any buffer strip at all. We reject the contention; it would be ironic if an amendment rezoning property from manufacturing to residential were to permit an extension of the manufacturing use into the previously protected buffer strip. The Stampfls cite <em>Bellows Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Acton, 364 </em>Mass. 253 (1973), which interpreted the predecessor statute to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, to protect the use of the land shown on a plan (at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>260) but not to apply to amendments to dimensional or intensity restrictions that do not unreasonably interfere with the protected use (at 260-261). The buffer zone provision, however, is not, in our view, a dimensional provision. Contrast \u00a7 13 of the Norwood zoning by-law that requires a seventy-five foot sideyard and rearyard setback for buildings in a manufacturing zone. Rather, it is a use regulation: in effect, a condition limiting the use of property in a manufacturing zone, so as to protect residentially zoned property by a green belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The Stampfls\u2019 argument that the application of a buffer zone will, in effect, render their property next to useless for open storage seems to be predicated on an assumption that the judgment requires them to maintain a buffer zone along the entire boundary between their lot and the Maidas\u2019. We do not understand the judgment to do that: it calls for a buffer strip measured \u201cfrom the district boundary line,\u201d which we take to refer to the boundary line between the residential zone and the manufacturing zone at the time of the submission of the plan. (After the zoning amendment of 1986, there was no \u201cdistrict boundary line\u201d between the Maidas\u2019 property and the Stampfls\u2019.) So understood, the judgment preserves precisely the uses to which the Stampfls could have devoted their property lawfully at the time of the submission of their plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> The case is in an awkward procedural posture. Norwood\u2019s zoning enforcement officer denied the Maidas\u2019 request for enforcement of a buffer strip. The Maidas appealed to the board, which failed to render a decision within the time required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, fifth par. The Stampfls appealed from the constructive decision in favor of the Maidas. Thereafter the board rendered an actual decision supporting the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s determination that the buffer strip by-law was inapplicable. In this court the board supports their actual decision in favor of the Stampfls and opposes their constructive decision for the Maidas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
