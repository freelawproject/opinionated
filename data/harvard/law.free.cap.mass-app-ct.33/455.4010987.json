MacDonald, Jr., is seeking reinstatement to his former position as a Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) police officer. The defendant, the MDC commissioner, claims that he successfully followed the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>have MacDonald involuntarily retired. MacDonald claims that the State Board of Retirement (board) erred in allowing his voluntary retirement on the basis of ordinary disability alone where the commissioner had applied to the board, pursuant to statute, for his involuntary retirement for accidental disability. Ordinary disability retirement is less advantageous to MacDonald than accidental disability retirement would have been. A further complication arises from the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the board misinformed MacDonald as to the proper avenue of review of its decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the commissioner on both points. With considerable misgivings about the board\u2019s confusing and misleading communications to MacDonald,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The undisputed material facts presented to the judge were as follows. MacDonald became an MDC police officer on December 29, 1969. On January 31, 1986, the commissioner filed an application with the board stating, among other things, that MacDonald was permanently disabled from further service in that he was suffering from \u201ca major mental disorder . . . bordering on a psychotic condition\u201d and requesting his retirement for \u201caccidental disability.\u201d In accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(l)(&lt;z), MacDonald was provided with a copy of the application, which included a summary of the facts relied upon, as well as copies of statutes setting forth his procedural rights before the board and his right to judicial review in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>At MacDonald\u2019s request, the board held a hearing on April 24, 1986. MacDonald presented no evidence to counter the commissioner\u2019s claims and, on June 5, 1986, the board issued a \u201ccertificate\u201d to the effect that MacDonald met the requirements for retirement for accidental disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201ccertificate\u201d was premature, however, because there had been no review by a regional medical panel as required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a review took place subsequently. The panel found unanimously that MacDonald was permanently disabled and unable, therefore, to perform the duties of a police officer. The panel also found, however, that the disability was not causally related to his police work.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">On June 1, 1987, the board notified MacDonald in writing that it was required as a result of the decision of the panel to deny the request for accidental disability retirement. Noting, however, that MacDonald was found by both the panel and the board to be permanently disabled and that he was a veteran with at least ten years of creditable service, the letter informed him that he was entitled to ordinary disability retirement benefits. Forms to effectuate such a retirement were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>enclosed. Finally, the letter informed MacDonald that if he were aggrieved by the board\u2019s decision he could appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) within fifteen days. That information was erroneous. Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(3), any appeal would be to the District Court. See <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>397 Mass. 255, 258 (1986); <em>Campana </em>v. <em>Directors of Mass. Hous. Fin. Agency, </em>399 Mass. 492, 496 n.12 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">MacDonald did not fill out the ordinary disability retirement forms. Instead, he filed an appeal of the denial of the request for accidental disability retirement with CRAB. He neglected, however, to notify the commissioner of the appeal, and on November 1, 1990, without opposition from MacDonald, CRAB dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution. No appeal was ever taken to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">MacDonald contended, in support of his motion for summary judgment, that, because the board denied the request for accidental disability retirement, he had the right to be reinstated in his former position. He based that claim on a statement made by a representative of the board in the course of the hearing before the board and on the language of the statute. The judge reviewed the statutes and the procedural history of the case and concluded that, although errors were made by the board, MacDonald was not entitled to reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">1. <em>MacDonald\u2019s claim that he is entitled by statute to reinstatement. </em>We briefly summarize the statutory background of the dispute. Apart from \u201csuperannuation\u201d retirements, there are two types of retirements for which a State employee may apply: \u201cordinary disability\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6; and \u201caccidental disability\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. The requirement for favorable regional medical panel review as a prerequisite for either type of retirement is set forth in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a), and the section specially requires a determination for a \u00a7 7 retirement that the disability \u201cmight be the natural and proximate result of the accident or hazard undergone\u201d in the performance of his duties. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>In G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, the Legislature provided a mechanism by which a head of a department may seek the <em>involuntary </em>retirement of a State employee. To do so, according to \u00a7 16 (l)(a), he \u201cmay file with the board on a prescribed form a written application for such retirement.\u201d Certain employees, of whom MacDonald was one, have the right in the event of such an application to a hearing before the board. The board may grant the department head\u2019s request for the employee\u2019s involuntary retirement. However, according to the language principally relied upon by MacDonald in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(l)(c), \u201c[i]f the board finds that [the employee] should not be retired, he shall continue in his office or position without loss of compensation ... as though no such application had been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The commissioner filed an application specifically for MacDonald\u2019s accidental disability retirement. MacDonald contends that, under the statutes, that application could result in one of two alternatives: his accidental disability retirement or his reinstatement. To require MacDonald\u2019s retirement for an ordinary disability, MacDonald contends, a new involuntary retirement application would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We think that is an incorrect interpretation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(l)(c). It is true that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(1)(a), requires the commissioner to choose between the two types of retirement when filing his application. However, the commissioner, through his application, was necessarily seeking a determination from the board <em>both </em>that MacDonald was permanently disabled and that the disability was causally related to his work. By choosing an application for accidental disability retirement, which would have afforded MacDonald a more generous pension than ordinary disability retirement, the commissioner sought to benefit MacDonald. The underlying assumption, however, was that the commissioner had determined that MacDonald could no longer function as a police officer because of his permanent disability. It would have been unreasonable for MacDonald to have assumed, as he stated he did, that if he should be found to be permanently disabled, but not as a result of his MDC police work, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>could resume his employment. The board having decided, after the opportunity for a hearing on the issue, that an employee is permanently disabled, it would be wasteful and irrational to require a department head to reapply to the board for the employee\u2019s involuntary retirement on the basis of ordinary disability. Thus, it is not surprising that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(l)(c), provides for automatic reinstatement after a board decision <em>only </em>if the board finds the employee should not be retired. There was no finding by the board that MacDonald should not be retired. Neither the logic of the statutory scheme, nor the specific language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (l)(c), supports MacDonald\u2019s claim of entitlement to reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Nor were any of the statements made at the hearing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> inconsistent with our analysis of the statutes or sufficient to create a reasonable belief on MacDonald\u2019s part that denial of accidental disability retirement would have resulted in his reinstatement. To the extent that the meaning of the statement relied upon is comprehensible, it suggests that if MacDonald should be found to be <em>not </em>disabled, \u201che is still Officer MacDonald.\u201d That statement would be consistent with the interpretation of the statute which we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">2. <em>The consequence of the board\u2019s misinformation about the proper avenue for review. </em>The board, through its executive secretary, notified MacDonald by letter of its decision that he was permanently disabled but not entitled to acciden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tal disability retirement. In the same letter he was offered an ordinary disability retirement. That decision was reviewable in the District Court within thirty days of the \u201ccertification.\u201d We assume the letter was made on the basis of a \u201ccertification\u201d issued by the board in the regular course of its proceedings although the letter does not expressly so state. No such appeal was filed in the District Court. Instead, based on information contained in the decision letter from the board, MacDonald took an appeal to CRAB. The board\u2019s mistake was inexplicable and serious, and we assume MacDonald relied upon it. Nevertheless, we conclude that the error does not affect the rights of the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A timely appeal to the District Court would not have provided MacDonald with any relief. Absent a favorable decision from the regional medical review panel, he could establish no right to accidental disability retirement. On the issue of his disability, he had the opportunity at his hearing before the board and also before the regional medical review panel to challenge the commissioner\u2019s claim that he was permanently disabled by offering evidence that he was not disabled. He offered none, however, while substantial evidence that he <em>was </em>disabled was offered by the commissioner. Although he presented affidavits to the Superior Court judge in support of his motion for summary judgment to the effect that he was not disabled, that evidence, never presented to the board or the medical review panel, would not have been admissible in any district court review to determine whether the board\u2019s decision as to his disability was justified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Because MacDonald is not entitled to reinstatement as an MDC police officer, the commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly allowed. Although the board is not a party in this case, it is clear that MacDonald is entitled to ordinary disability retirement benefits, effective retroactively. He was paid his full salary for some portion of the period between the date of the commissioner\u2019s application and the date judgment was entered in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Exactly what amount he is presently due by way of retroactive retirement benefits, and what rights the commissioner may have against the board with respect to salary payments made to MacDonald, will have to be worked out among MacDonald, the commissioner, and the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Accordingly, we order that the judgment be affirmed and that, if no agreement is reached within thirty days of the re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>script in this case, the matter shall stand for further proceedings in the Superior Court to which the board shall be made a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-16\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 21, in material part, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201c(1) <em>Involuntary Retirement and Right to a hearing-.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>Any head of a department who is of the opinion that any member employed therein should be retired for superannuation, ordinary disability or accidental disability, in accordance with the provisions of section five, six, or seven, as the case may be, may file with the board on a prescribed form a written application for such retirement.

Since the certificate could not have reflected a final decision in the absence of review by a regional medical panel, as previously indicated, that information was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a), as appearing in St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 32, in material part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cNo member shall be retired for a disability under the provisions of this section [ordinary disability] or section seven [accidental disability] unless he has been examined first by a regional medical panel and unless the physicians on such panel, after such examination, shall review the pertinent facts in the case, and such other written and oral evidence as the applicant and the employer may present to be reviewed in making a determination of the member\u2019s medical condition. No physician having previously examined the member, except as part of a prior disability medical panel, shall serve on the regional medical panel examining the member. At the conclusion of such examination, but in not more than sixty days, the panel shall certify to the board in writing whether such physicians on said panel find that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated for further duty and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent, and in any case involving a retirement under section seven, the panel physicians shall state further whether or not the disability is such as might be the natural and proximate result of the accident or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed under said section seven.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">MacDonald relies on the following discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cMr. Callahan: If this were cut and dried, and not to assume that we had reached any conclusions, because the Board hasn\u2019t, but if there were no questions in this, then Mr. MacDonald would have voluntarily put in for disability and there would be no hearing at all, so it is our determination, the Board\u2019s, that is, to ascertain whether the Metropolitan District Commission, through the Commissioner, is doing the proper thing by putting in an involuntary retirement for accidental disability for Officer MacDonald. If we, the Board that is, finds that the individual should go ahead with that, we still need his cooperation. If the medical panel found that he is not totally and permanently disabled, he is still Officer MacDonald, still have to take another step. Nothing final about our decision, unless everything falls into place. The doctors say yes, he is incompetent or incapable of performing the duties of a police officer, if it gets to that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cMr. Kaplan: And it was causally related.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"> Whatever mistake the board may have made is not attributable to the commissioner, and, regardless, an estoppel argument against the commissioner has never been advanced. Indeed, at the time the involuntary retirement application was filed, the commissioner correctly informed MacDonald of his appeal rights. Moreover, had MacDonald notified the commissioner of his appeal to CRAB, or named the commissioner as a party, the error could have been timely rectified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\"> The language is not clear as to what the scope of review is in the District Court under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(3). The issue was not briefed by the parties. At oral argument, upon inquiry from the court, both parties stated that the review would be one on the administrative record to determine whether the decision was based on substantial evidence and not a \u201cde <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>novo\u201d review. The language of the statute with respect to the scope of review is less than clear. Subsection (3) states that the court is to \u201creview such action and decision, hear any and all evidence and determine whether such action was justified.\u201d See, however, the discussion in <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 1, 9, 12 (1975). As in the present case, the language defining the scope of review in that case suggested that \u201cde novo\u201d review might have been intended. Concluding that \u201cde novo\u201d review was not intended, the court indicated that, in determining the nature of review in such circumstances, it is important to consider \u201cfunctional considerations,\u201d in particular the right to an evidentiary hearing before the administrative agency. See also <em>School Comm, of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 262-263 (1984) (the omission of the term \u201cde novo\u201d suggests that the Legislature did <em>not </em>intend the reviewing process to involve fact-finding). Here MacDonald had the right to an adjudicatory hearing before the board, and he participated in such a hearing. The reference to \u201cevidence\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(3), may refer only to evidence of what occurred in the proceedings before the board. In any event, appraising the total process in context, we conclude that new evidence would not have been allowed in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b487-14\"> On November 6, 1986, the commissioner notified MacDonald that, having failed to return the executed retirement documents to the board, he would be removed from the payroll on November 8, 1986. Shortly thereafter, he was removed. We do not think it is necessary for us to decide the propriety of that action or the consequence of MacDonald\u2019s failure to seek timely review of it pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16. On January 6, 1988, a preliminary injunction was entered reinstating him, with full pay, pending resolution of the instant Superior Court action. The preliminary injunction remained in effect until judgment was entered in the Superior Court on June 3, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
