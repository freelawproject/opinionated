L. c. 266, \u00a7 127A. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That statute, as amended by St. 1989, c. 121, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">\u201cWhoever willfully, intentionally and without right, or wantonly and without cause, destroys, defaces, mars, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>or injures a church, synagogue or other building [of certain specified types] . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">This appeal requires us to interpret this portion of the statute. Penal statutes must be strictly construed, but \u201cthis maxim is a guide for resolving ambiguity rather than a rigid requirement that we interpret each statute in the manner most favorable to defendants.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 569 (1982), quoting from <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 102-103 (1982). We assign language its ordinary meaning, where, as here, the statute is clear and unambiguous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The linchpin in the defendant\u2019s argument is that because the eggs which struck the temple \u201ccompletely washed off,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they did not cause the \u201csubstantial harm\u201d which he contends is required by the words \u201cdestroys, defaces, mars or injures\u201d of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold as matter of law that the unambiguous statutory language does not require either substantial or permanent harm. \u201cEgging\u201d comfortably fits with both the dictionary definition and the statutory meaning of either \u201cdeface\u201d or \u201cmar.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1379 (1971) (\u201cmar\u201d defined as \u201cto detract from the good condition or perfection or wholeness or beauty of\u2019); American Heritage Dictionary 488, 1097 (3d ed. 1992) (\u201cdeface\u201d defined as \u201cto mar or spoil the appearance or surface of; disfigure\u201d). Further, the ordinary meaning of the statutory language is consistent with the readily ascertainable purpose of the statute: to deter any physical attack of vandalism specifically against religious institutions, schools, and other facilities by increasing the penalties for such attacks. Compare G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 98, as appearing in St. 1960, \u00a7 169, a prior enactment which prescribes a lesser penalty for defacement or injury to a schoolhouse or church or affiliated building.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The motion for a required finding of not guilty was rightly denied. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spina, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 805 (1973) (insufficient evidence to show defendant \u201cwilfully, intentionally and without right, injure[d], deface [d] and mar [red] a certain building,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 104, where defendant had merely yelled and stood beside a codefendant who threw a rock at a police station).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-15\"> To those who engage in such malicious, immature, or bigoted acts, this offensive practice is called \u201cegging.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"amb-dedup-0\"> following the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial, the judge dismissed two other, related indictments. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on a fourth indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> This argument has been styled the \u201csoap and water\u201d test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. 347 (1990), a case discussing G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, is inapposite: the language and purpose of \u00a7 127 are quite different from those of \u00a7 127A. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 229, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> The defendant\u2019s other argument regarding limitation of cross-examination is of no avail, for the reasons given in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
