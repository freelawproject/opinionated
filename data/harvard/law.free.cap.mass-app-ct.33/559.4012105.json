We begin by outlining the events that led to this appeal. The plaintiff Highland Tap of Boston, Inc. (Highland Tap), a tavern located on Washington Street in the Roxbury section of Boston, has held an entertainment license since the early 1970\u2019s. It began to present nude dancing in September, 1979. In March of 1980, the licensing board of the city of Boston (board) held a hearing at which it asserted that the nude dancing violated G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A (as appearing in St. 1936, c. 71, \u00a7 1), the statute governing entertainment licensing, and that it also violated one of the board\u2019s licensing regulations, then called condition 8A. At that time, condition 8A prohibited nudity on licensed premises unless the premises were located in the area known as the \u201cAdult Entertainment Zone,\u201d which had been so designated in 1974 by an amendment to the Boston Zoning Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board informed Highland Tap that it would defer action on the pending violation if Highland Tap stopped presenting nude dancing. The plaintiff had done so the month before, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>after being informed by the Boston police that the entertainment was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">\n<em>The Gargiulo Litigation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">In May of 1980, Highland Tap brought an action in the Superior Court, seeking to restrain the board from enforcing the licensing statute or condition 8A on grounds that they were unconstitutional facially and as applied. Highland Tap of Boston, Inc. <em>vs. </em>Gargiulo, Civil No. 42026 (Superior Court, Suffolk County, 1980) (hereafter <em>Gargiulo). </em>The court granted preliminary injunctive relief in June, 1980, and Highland Tap again began presenting nude entertainment. Since that time, Highland Tap has been permitted to present nude entertainment under court order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">While <em>Gargiulo </em>was pending, a judge of the Federal District Court for Massachusetts held that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, as it gave complete discretion to licensing authorities and contained no governing standards. See <em>Venuti </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>521 F. Supp. 1027, 1030-1031 (D. Mass. 1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 183A was revised that year to incorporate standards limiting the authorities\u2019 discretion to grant, modify, suspend, or revoke licenses. St. 1981, c. 694, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Condition 8A was revised in 1983. Now called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>rule 2a, it prohibits nudity on licensed premises unless the licensee has petitioned to present nude entertainment and the licensing authority has given its approval.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In 1985, a Superior Court judge in <em>Gargiulo, </em>citing the Federal District Court\u2019s decision in <em>Venuti, </em>ruled in a partial summary judgment that the former G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, and the former licensing condition 8A were unconstitutional prior restraints on freedom of expression. The judge concluded that the revised statute and the revised condition 8A were constitutional on their face. Nonetheless, the judge ruled that the board could not apply the revised condition 8A to Highland Tap to regulate its presentation of nude dancing. The judge apparently concluded that because the prior unconstitutional licensing statute could not properly restrict the plaintiffs presentation of nude entertainment, and because the board had issued licenses to Highland Tap for the years 1982 through 1985, the board could not currently apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>amended condition 8A to Highland Tap. <em>Gargiulo </em>was dismissed by agreement of all parties on July 22, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">\n<em>The 1987 License Revocation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">After <em>Gargiulo </em>was dismissed, the licensing authority, now the mayor\u2019s office of consumer affairs and licensing (the division),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> resumed its attempts to regulate Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment. It notified Highland Tap that a license revocation hearing would be held on November 18, 1987. On December 28, 1987, after two days of hearings, the division found Highland Tap to be in violation of five licensing regulations and revoked its 1987 entertainment license. Three of these violations are important to this appeal. First, Highland Tap was found to have violated the revised condition 8A, now called rule 2a, because it had not petitioned the division for approval to present nude entertainment. Second, the plaintiff was found to be in violation of two licensing regulations which require conformance to provisions of the Boston Zoning Code. One, condition 4, states that licensees must conform to the code\u2019s provisions. The other, rule 9, provides that a licensee who restricts admission for entertainment to adults as a general practice may operate only in the Boston Adult Entertainment Zone, unless it had been presenting adult entertainment prior to 1974.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\n<em>The 1988 Rule 2a Hearings and the Plaintiffs Second Action Against the Licensing Authorities.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On December 28, 1987, the same day the division revoked Highland Tap\u2019s 1987 license, it notified Highland Tap that it was treating the plaintiff\u2019s license renewal application for 1988 as a \u201cpetition\u201d under rule 2a seeking approval of nude entertainment and that a hearing would be scheduled. The next day, Highland Tap again brought an action against the division in the Superior Court. The complaint alleged that the division had violated prior judicial and administrative decisions and abridged rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, arts. 12 and 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and State and Federal civil rights laws. Highland Tap sought to enjoin the division from interfering with its presentation of nude dancing, enforcing the revocation of its 1987 entertainment license, and enforcing the rule 2a requirement that it petition for approval to present nude entertainment. The plaintiff successfully obtained preliminary injunctive relief in each respect. On appeal, this court permitted the rule 2a hearing to go forward but did not permit the division to implement whatever decision it reached. See <em>Highland Tap of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 239 (1988).9</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The division conducted a rule 2a hearing on August 25, 1988. After the hearing, it denied Highland Tap approval to present nude entertainment during the license year 1988. On November 23, 1988, the plaintiff filed a supplemental complaint in the Superior Court seeking to enjoin the division from enforcing that decision. On December 21, 1988, the division again denied Highland Tap the authority to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>nude entertainment and issued it a 1989 entertainment license without authorization to present a floor show of any type. On January 20, 1989, Highland Tap filed a second supplemental complaint seeking delivery of a 1989 license permitting a floor show. The parties submitted briefs and documentary evidence and presented oral arguments to the Superior Court. No testimonial evidence was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">\n<em>The Superior Court Decision Now Being Appealed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In relevant part, in his findings of fact, rulings of law, and order for judgment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> issued on November 8, 1989, the judge concluded that the division had not given Highland Tap adequate notice of the 1987 license revocation hearings. He also ruled that the division could not conduct a rule 2a hearing to determine whether to approve Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment. This ruling rested on a finding that the division had previously applied the rule 2a requirement only to new applications for licenses which requested permission to present nude entertainment or to establishments seeking to expand their existing licenses to include nude entertainment. The division contended that Highland Tap\u2019s 1988 and 1989 applications constituted requests for license expansions to present nude entertainment. The judge decided that these applications did not seek license expansions because Highland Tap\u2019s license applications had been listing nude entertainment as part of its proposed floor show since 1982. He further concluded that the division lacks authority to suspend, revoke, or deny a license based on its interpretation of the Boston Zoning Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The judge declared that issues concerning Highland Tap\u2019s 1987 and 1988 licenses were moot, and, noting that the 1989 license would soon expire, specified that any order made would apply to a 1990 license. On December 22, 1989, he ordered the division to issue Highland Tap a 1990 entertainment license. He further ordered that pending the outcome of this appeal, the division was enjoined from interfering with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment based on the division\u2019s interpretation of the Boston Zoning Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Highland Tap moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts and Federal civil rights acts, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1988). The motion was denied, as was the division\u2019s motion for a new trial. Highland Tap appealed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The division appealed the Superior Court\u2019s November 8, 1989, and December 22, 1989, orders, and the denial of its motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">1. <em>Mootness. </em>The passage of time has rendered moot the issuance of entertainment licenses for 1987 through 1990.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Piona </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>332 Mass. 53, 57 (1954); <em>New Palm Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 963, 963-964 (1983). We will nevertheless decide important issues in this case. These concern whether 1) the division is precluded from requiring Highland Tap to petition for approval to present nude entertainment, and 2) the division is authorized to determine initially whether a licensee has violated provisions of the Boston Zoning Code which the division has incorporated into its own entertainment licensing regulations. Both sides have briefed these issues. They will almost certainly arise again under similar factual circumstances and will continue to evade appellate review because entertainment licenses have a one-year duration. See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782-784 (1984), and cases cited; <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Employment and Training, </em>412 Mass. 845, 846 n. 1 (1992). In order to clarify procedural requirements, we will also comment on certain questions relating to the 1987 revocation hearings and the 1988 rule 2a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Because of mootness we do not decide issues concerning the division\u2019s findings, following the 1987 license revocation hearings, that Highland Tap violated licensing rules 2(c) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(e). Those regulations prohibit patrons from touching entertainers\u2019 genital areas and prohibit entertainers from simulating sexual acts. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>We do not assume that these issues will necessarily arise again, since Highland Tap has stated that it prohibits these activities on its premises. See <em>Utility Contractors Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729-730 (1991). Nor are they likely to evade appellate review should they recur, since they may be addressed expeditiously through the division\u2019s administrative process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">2. <em>The division\u2019s application of rule 2a to Highland Tap. </em>Highland Tap argues that the division cannot require it to petition for approval to present nude entertainment because the Superior Court had so ruled in <em>Gargiulo </em>and the issue may not, therefore, be relitigated. <em>Gargiulo, </em>however, resulted in voluntary dismissal without prejudice, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1), 365 Mass. 803 (1974), before the entry of final judgment or the issuance of certification pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), and before full resolution of all the factual issues. See <em>Highland Tap of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 241. The rulings in that case consequently are not binding on the division or in this action. See <em>Tausevich </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, </em>402 Mass. 146, 149 (1988); <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. </em>v. <em>International Assn, of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, </em>915 F.2d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Highland Tap further contends that the doctrine of estop-pel prohibits the division from requiring it to comply with the rule 2a requirements because the division had previously issued Highland Tap entertainment licenses knowing that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>presented nude entertainment, but without requiring adherence to its regulations. Highland Tap has, however, been on notice of the board\u2019s, and then the division\u2019s, attempts to enforce its regulations restricting the presentation of adult entertainment since at least 1980, when Highland Tap instituted the <em>Gargiulo </em>litigation. Considering the licensing authorities\u2019 continued attempts to gain compliance, the plaintiff can hardly claim unfair surprise.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, the doctrine of estoppel is generally not applied to the government\u2019s exercise of its public duties and is not applied \u201cwhere to do so would frustrate a policy intended to protect the public interest.\u201d <em>Risk Mgmt. Foundation of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>407 Mass. 498, 509-510 (1990), quoting from <em>LaBarge </em>v. <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Ct., </em>402 Mass. 462, 468 (1988). Application of the doctrine of estoppel to this case would frustrate the division\u2019s statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tory obligation to promulgate and enforce regulations to \u201cprotect the public health, safety, and order.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A (note 6, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The division is not precluded from applying rule 2a to Highland Tap.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">3. <em>The division\u2019s authority to interpret the Boston Zoning Code under the circumstances. </em>The division\u2019s authority initially to interpret provisions of the Boston Zoning Code affects its ability to enforce its licensing regulations which relate to zoning. Condition 4 and rule 9 (see note 9, <em>supra.), </em>which the division found Highland Tap to have violated in 1987, require conformance with zoning code provisions. The division could not determine whether these regulations had been violated without first det\u00e9rmining whether Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment outside the Adult Entertainment Zone violated the Boston Zoning Code. Additionally, the division\u2019s decision whether to approve Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment under rule 2a would logically include consideration of whether it was violating provisions of the Boston Zoning Code limiting such presentations to a specified area of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Highland Tap concedes that it has been presenting nude adult entertainment since late 1979 and that it is located outside the Adult Entertainment Zone.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Both the division and the Boston zoning authorities have expressed agreement that Highland Tap\u2019s activity at its present location violates provisions of the code. Under these undisputed facts, the division may initially determine that the plaintiff has violated the Boston Zoning Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The division was not attempting to grant or deny variances, issue enforcement orders, or otherwise improperly assume the powers and responsibilities of a zoning board. Contrast <em>Colabufalo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Newton, </em>336 Mass. 213, 214-216 (1957). The division\u2019s action in this respect was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>analogous to those of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC) considered in <em>Aristocratic Restaurant of Massachusetts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn. (No. 1), </em>374 Mass. 547, 551 (1978). There, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the ABCC may interpret a regulation of a local licensing board in order to determine whether the licensee had violated the ABCC\u2019s own regulation prohibiting illegality on licensed premises. Although the division is a local, not a State agency, it, like the ABCC, is authorized to revoke a license for violation of law or of one of its regulations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Vaspourakan, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 347, 352 (1987); <em>Oznemoc, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>412 Mass. 100, 104-106 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">4. <em>Procedural questions with respect to the 1987 license revocation hearings and the 1988 rule 2a hearing, </em>(a) <em>The 1987 license revocation hearings. </em>The division did not adequately notify Highland Tap of the charges it was bringing at its 1987 license revocation hearings. The notification stated that police reports contained allegations concerning the adequacy of Highland Tap\u2019s management. It included copies of police reports describing nude dancing, simulated sexual activity and patrons\u2019 placing money under dancers\u2019 g-strings. Other allegations concerned a drug arrest, failure to post various licenses and a board of health certificate, and failure to provide a receipt for a cover charge. The notice did not specify which license regulations had allegedly been violated. After the hearings, the division found that Highland Tap had violated the division\u2019s condition 4 and rule 9 (see note 9, <em>supra) </em>by illegally presenting adult entertainment outside the Adult Entertainment Zone. It further found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Highland Tap had violated rule 2a by presenting nude entertainment without having petitioned for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 183A, provides that \u201c[t]he licensing authorities may . . . revoke a[n entertainment] license . . . after providing an opportunity for a hearing preceded by a written notice to the licensee ten days prior to the hearing date.\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court has construed the hearing provisions of the pre-1981 version of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, to require \u201cadequate notice setting forth the charge which forms the basis for the revocation.\u201d <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 135 (1981). \u201cDue process requires notice of the grounds on which the board might act rather than the evidentiary support for those grounds.\u201d <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass 454, 458 (1983). The notice was required to give Highland Tap \u201creasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence and argument.\u201d <em>Aristocratic Restaurant of Massachusetts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn. (No. 1), </em>374 Mass. at 551. See <em>Foster from Gloucester, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 284, 289-290 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Here, the notice was misleading. From the notice, Highland Tap could properly assume that the hearing would be concerned with alleged violations related to mismanagement of the premises. At the hearing, Highland Tap\u2019s attorney expressed his understanding that the proceedings were to be limited to such questions. Whether Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment violated regulations requiring conformance with the Boston Zoning Code, and whether Highland Tap had violated rule 2a, were both unrelated to the issue of whether the premises were properly managed. The revocation hearings were not, in fact, focused on the zoning issue or on Highland Tap\u2019s responsibilities under rule 2a.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The notice, \u201ctaken in conjunction with the hearing, [was not] sufficient to accomplish substantial justice\u201d [because] it \u201cmisled a licensee as to the possible grounds for revocation which he should be prepared to meet at the public hearing.\u201d <em>Foster from Gloucester, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>supra </em>at 289-290, citing <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>License Commrs. of Quincy, </em>308 Mass. 142, 145-146 (1941), and <em>Becker Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>314 Mass. 522, 526-527 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">(b) <em>The 1988 rule 2a hearing. </em>Highland Tap maintains that the division improperly considered its 1988 license renewal application (which specified that nude entertainment would be presented) as a \u201cpetition\u201d under rule 2a for approval to present nude entertainment. There was nothing improper in that action. Rule 2a specifies that a licensee\u2019s \u201cpetition\u201d initiates the approval process. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>It does not require a petition to be filed separately from the license application. Imposing a technical requirement that a rule 2a hearing can be initiated only if the licensee files a separate petition for approval would, without any sound purpose, condition the division\u2019s ability to enforce its rule on the licensee\u2019s decision whether or not to file a separate petition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">5. <em>Highland Tap\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts and Federal Civil Rights </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Acts. </em>There was no error in the denial of Highland Tap\u2019s application. It is enough to say that our preceding discussion demonstrates that the denial was proper for the reasons, if no other, that (a) Highland Tap failed to allege or show that there was any violation of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (b) pre-scinding from consideration of the nature of the claims, Highland Tap was not the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, that is, it cannot \u201cpoint to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant[s].\u201d <em>Texas Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Garland In-dep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989). This is the \u201cminimum\u201d which is necessary to be considered a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>University of N. Carolina, </em>632 F.2d 316, 346-347 (4th Cir. 1980); <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Illinois High Sch. Assn., </em>921 F.2d 96, 97, 98-99 (7th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The appeal of the division is dismissed, not on the merits but because it is moot. The denial of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Highland Tap is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\"> Licensing condition 8A read as follows before it was revised in 1983: \u201cIt is forbidden to employ or permit any person in or on the licensed premises while such person is unclothed or in such attire as to expose to view any portion of the areola of the female breast or any portion of the pubic hair, cleft of the buttocks, or genitals except this Section A does not apply to licensed premises located in the \u2018Adult Entertainment Zone\u2019 as designated by Amendment No. 38 of Section 3-1 of the Boston Zoning Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\"> See <em>Gargiulo, supra; Highland Tap of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>26 Mass.

See <em>Samuels Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>390 Mass. 583, 590 (1983); <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. at 784; <em>Reliance Ins.

App. Ct. 581, 589-590 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We disagree with the Superior Court judge\u2019s conclusion that the division could not consider Highland Tap\u2019s 1988 and 1989 applications as requests for a license expansion to present nude entertainment because Highland Tap had filed previous applications specifying that it would present nude dancing. The licensing authorities had considered Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude dancing to be an expansion of its licensed activities from the time it began such presentations, and had been attempting to regulate the presentations since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The licensing authorities complied with court orders requiring them to issue Highland Tap entertainment licenses but nevertheless continually indicated their position that Highland Tap was not entitled to present nude dancing. While the board issued Highland Tap licenses for 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985 pursuant to court order, it refused to deliver them. The division included in its renewal of Highland Tap\u2019s 1987 license a letter referring to the pending <em>Gargiulo </em>litigation and stating that the renewal would not prejudice the division\u2019s legal rights. An apparent exception occurred in 1986, when the division notified Highland Tap that its current license would be honored and considered valid. This notification, however, did not refer specifically to the circumstances of Highland Tap\u2019s license. It was a standardized letter, apparently sent to all licensees, to inform them that the licensing authority had been transferred from the board to the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The judge also said that rule 2a was \u201cvery flexible and the hearings, when held, were at the complete discretion of the division.\u201d That statement was based entirely on the deposition testimony of the secretary to the board. The board\u2019s licensing responsibilities were transferred to the division in 1986 and the events which are involved in this action occurred after that time. Thus, we attach no critical significance to the judge\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> The division contends that Highland Tap\u2019s presentation of nude entertainment is not a prior nonconforming use. The presentations began several years after the promulgation of the 1974 zoning code amendment creating an Adult Entertainment Zone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> General Laws c. 138, \u00a7 64 (1986 ed.), provides that the ABCC \u201cmay modify, suspend, revoke or cancel his license upon satisfactory proof that he has violated or permitted a violation of any condition thereof, or any law of the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlPv\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 183a, provides that \u201cthe licensing authorities may modify, suspend, or revoke a license ... for any violation of their rules and regulations or for any violation of law. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> Highland Tap claims that the rule 2a hearing was invalid because the division failed to notify Highland Tap of the hearing within 45 days of receiving its license renewal application as required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A. This issue was not raised before the division, however, and has thus been waived. <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493 (1983). <em>Shoolman </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>404 Mass. 33, 42-43 (1989).
