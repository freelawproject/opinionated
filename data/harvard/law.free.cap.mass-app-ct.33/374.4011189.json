One of the two lots was to have frontage of exactly that length; the other would have a 98.44-foot frontage. Armed with the variance from the zoning board of appeals, the Seguins submitted a plan to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>planning board for an endorsement that approval under the Subdivision Control Law was not required. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8 IP. This was refused on the ground that one of the lots shown on the plan lacked the frontage required by the zoning by-law. Rather than resubmitting the plan for approval under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, the Seguins sought judicial review under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB. A judge of the Superior Court denied the Seguins\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and a single justice of this court, acting under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, 1st par., allowed the Seguins to file this interlocutory appeal. See <em>Foreign Auto Import, Inc. </em>v. <em>Renault Northeast, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 464, 469-470 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The board acted correctly in denying the endorsement. In considering an application for an endorsement that its approval is not required, \u201ca planning board\u2019s judgment is confined to determining whether a plan shows a subdivision.\u201d <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 604 (1980). A subdivision is \u201cthe division of a tract of land into two or more lots . . . [except where] every lot within the tract so divided has frontage ... of at least such distance as is then required by zoning or other ordinance or by-law if any . . . and if no distance is so required, such frontage shall be of at least twenty feet.\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, \u201cSubdivision,\u201d as amended by St. 1956, c. 282. As one of the lots shown on the plan lacked the zoning by-law\u2019s required frontage of 100 feet, the plan showed a subdivision and thus required approval. <em>Hrenchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Walpole, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 949 (1979). The planning board\u2019s approval under the Subdivision Control Law would be independent of the approval of the variance by the board of appeals under the zoning by-law. <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 808 (1981). Cf. <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 527, 531 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The Seguins argue that the words, \u201cfrontage ... of at least such distance as is <em>then </em>required by zoning or other ordinance or by-law\u201d (\u00a7 81L, \u201cSubdivision,\u201d emphasis added), should be read as referring to the 98.44-foot frontage allowed by the zoning board\u2019s variance, with the result that each lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>shown on the plan has the required frontage. They rely, incorrectly, on <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Concord, </em>356 Mass. 709, 711-712 (1970), which held, as to a garden-apartment project specially permitted by the zoning board of appeals, on a parcel which lacked the frontage that would be required of single-family residences, that \u201cthe required frontage under both \u00a7 81L and [the provision of the zoning by-law authorizing garden apartments] is only the frontage required by the board of appeals. See <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>353 Mass. 731, 733-734 [1968].\u201d In the <em>Adams </em>case, however, as in <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>the zoning by-law contained no fixed frontage requirement for the type of project contemplated, leaving the frontage to be fixed by special permit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only in those special cases where the frontage requirement is fixed by special permit do the words of \u00a7 81L (\u201cfrontage . . . of at least such distance as is then required by zoning or other ordinance or by-law\u201d) refer to the frontage fixed by the board. \u201cThe lots ... are on a public way. The frontage requirement is met by the granting.of the [special permit]. This was not a variance from the by-law, but a special application of its terms.\u201d <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>353 Mass. at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Here, in contrast, the Seguins have been given an unappealed variance to create a lot lacking the frontage required by the zoning by-law. Their plan shows a subdivision and accordingly must be reviewed under the approval procedure with a view to vindicating the concerns of the Subdivision Control Law, which pertain primarily to considerations of access for vehicles and utilities. <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 810-811. That the proposed lots appear on the present record to present no problem in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>this respect may be relevant if the planning board should unreasonably withhold their approval of a plan under \u00a7 81U, but the board correctly ruled that the approval procedure could not be circumvented.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The order denying summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\"> In the <em>Adams </em>case, the Concord zoning by-law stated that \u201c[ljimited dwelling structures or garden apartments need have only such frontage on public or private ways as may be approved by the [b]oard of [ajppeals.\u201d 356 Mass, at 711. In <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>the Needham zoning by-law allowed the board of appeals \u201cto grant permits ... for the erection ... of buildings . . . upon . . . lots, although containing less area or less frontage than is hereby prescribed,\u201d where it found that surrounding development conformed generally to the smaller dimensional requirements of earlier bylaws. 353 Mass, at 732-733.
