The \u201cjust cause\u201d discharge standard, upon which the defendants rely, appeared in the collective bargaining agreement (the agreement) between the city and the defendant International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 338 (the union). However, the civil service statute setting the terms of the probationary period, upon which the city relies, provides that the appointing authority may terminate the services of a probationary employee \u201c[i]f the conduct or capacity of a person serving a probationary period, or the character or quality of the work performed by him is not satisfactory to the appointing authority.\u201d See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, fifth par. (1986 ed.). In addition to provisions for the final and binding arbitration of grievances \u201cto the extent permissible by law,\u201d see G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the agreement provided that the \u201carbitrator shall be without power to make any decisions in conflict with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The controversy arose out of the following undisputed facts. Diane Yakusik (the defendant) was appointed a full-time, civil service police officer on January 19, 1987. One month prior to the expiration of her twelve-month probationary period the city terminated the defendant\u2019s services for allegedly unsatisfactory performance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The union filed a grievance with regard to the defendant\u2019s discharge, the claim being that the termination was without just cause. The grievance was processed in the required manner, and in due course an arbitrator, in response to the issues put to him,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> announced his award. He concluded that the grievance was arbitrable, and that the city had violated the agreement by discharging the defendant without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The city then commenced these proceedings to vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a)(3). The union moved to confirm the award, and the judge, finding no conflict between the agreement and any law of the Commonwealth, allowed the union\u2019s motion. The city appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">An additional statutory provision similar to that referred to in note 3, <em>supra, </em>is important to an understanding of this controversy. General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>l{d) </em>(1986 ed.), provides, in brief, that if a collective bargaining agreement covering public employees \u201ccontains a conflict\u201d between the provisions of the agreement and any law of the Commonwealth which is enumerated in subsection (d), then \u201cthe terms of the collective bargaining agreement shall prevail.\u201d Chapter 31 is not one of the laws identified in subsection <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">1. <em>Judicial review. </em>The Superior Court is required, upon the application of any party, to vacate an award if \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a)(3), inserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>by St. 1959, c. 546, \u00a7 1. Whether, given the facial conflict between the agreement and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, the arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding that the defendant\u2019s discharge was an arbitrable issue is subject to our review. See <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union, Local 526, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 649, 651 (1989). The agreement itself yields the same result, for it provides, as we noted above, that the arbitrator \u201cshall be without power\u201d to make any decision which conflicts with the laws of the Commonwealth. An arbitrator exceeds his powers if the parties to the agreement never gave the arbitrator the power to make the award he made. <em>Mor-ceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc., </em>344 Mass. 120, 124 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">2. <em>Validity of the award. </em>The straightforward argument of the defendants (the union and Yakusik) is that there is no statutory bar to a provision in the collective bargaining agreement for a \u201cjust cause\u201d discharge standard for probationary employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants concede that if there were a conflict between the civil service law and the agreement, the civil service law would prevail, but they contend that there is no such conflict in this case. The civil service law, the defendants argue, does not prohibit an employer from conferring greater rights on its employees than are available through the civil service law. We conclude that the argument cannot prevail; there is a direct and substantial conflict between the agreement and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, and the agreement must yield to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Despite earlier intimations that the absence of a statute from the list of laws enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(d), </em>revealed the intention of the Legislature that a collective bargaining agreement must yield to that statute, see <em>School Comm, of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 109 (1977), more recent decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court and this court have focused on the question whether there exists a material conflict between the agreement and the unenumer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ated statute. In the absence of a material conflict with a statute not enumerated in \u00a7 7(if), the agreement may be enforced. See <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>410 Mass. 485, 493 n.4 (1991) (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 108L, an incentive pay program for police officers not enumerated in \u00a7 7[if], did not \u201cconflict\u201d with the collective bargaining agreement). <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union, Local 526, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 651 (with respect to a choice between qualified applicants for a provisional appointment, the civil service law does not \u201ccrowd out\u201d a seniority clause in a collective bargaining agreement; award confirmed). Compare <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Engrs. and Scientists </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admn., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 917 (1990) (entrance requirement of four years\u2019 experience set by personnel administrator, pursuant to his authority under the civil service law, could not be modified by the collective bargaining agreement; judgment vacating the award affirmed).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In this case, we must decide whether a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard for the discharge of a person serving during the probationary period materially conflicts with the provisions and underlying purpose of the civil service statute creating a probationary status. As noted above, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, fifth par., provides that if the conduct or the character of the person serving a \u201cprobationary period,\u201d or the quality of his or her work, is \u201cnot satisfactory to the appointing authority,\u201d notice of termination may be given. The term \u201cprobationary\u201d must be taken in its usual and ordinary sense. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 745, 747 (1985). \u201cIn ordinary connotation, the word indicates a status of experimental testing of the employee. It certainly implies no commitment for continuance of employment, if for any reason the experimental relationship leads to the conclusion that a more extended relationship may be unsatisfactory.\u201d <em>Rhine </em>v. <em>International Young Men\u2019s Christian Assn. College, </em>339 Mass. 610, 613 (1959). So, too, \u201cprobation\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca trial period in which a person\u2019s fitness for membership in a working . . . group is tested.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 987 (2d College ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>This \u201cexperimental testing\u201d of the fitness of an employee during a \u201ctrial period\u201d is to be contrasted with the attributes of a tenured employee. \u201cA tenured employee has a right of property in his job.\u201d <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Billerica, </em>377 Mass. 853, 859 (1979). He or she has a constitutional claim to fair procedure if charged with conduct that could result in the loss of position. <em>Id. </em>at 860. Fair procedure includes the requirement, by virtue of c. 31, \u00a7 41, that a tenured employee cannot be discharged except for \u201cjust cause.\u201d This means \u201csubstantial misconduct which adversely affects the public interest by impairing the efficiency of the public service.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Ct. of E. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 514 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Billerica, supra, </em>the court, in rejecting the argument that the notice of termination to a probationary employee must be sufficient to support a charge of \u201cjust cause\u201d for the discharge, pointed out that it was error to \u201cminimize [] the differences in the nature of the stated criteria \u2014 \u2018just cause\u2019 for discharge under \u00a7 43 [and \u00a7 41],-contrasted with a judgment of \u2018not satisfactory\u2019 for termination under \u00a7 20D [predecessor to \u00a734] related to \u2018conduct,\u2019 \u2018capacity,\u2019 \u2018character,\u2019 \u2018quality.\u2019 Likewise, it scants the functional differences between tenured and probationary employments. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The argument of the defendants would obliterate the statutory distinctions between tenured employees and probationary employees, and transform all probationary employees into tenured employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A probationary period of employment would no longer be an experimental testing of fitness during a trial period; proof of serious misconduct would be required for a discharge whenever the collective bargaining agreement so provides. Section 34 would become an optional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>provision which the city and the bargaining representative may then elect or discard.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Section 34 is a mandatory provision designed to benefit the public, which the city may not waive. With respect to police officers and fire fighters, in particular, the Legislature recognized the special need of a prolonged probationary period by extending the period from six months to one year. See St. 1977, c. 438, and now G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61. Courage, good judgment, and the ability to work under stress in the public interest and as part of an organization, are qualities that are not quickly perceived. The policy of the statute is to ensure sufficient time for a careful determination whether they are present in sufficient degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">This need for a subjective judgment by an experienced person of what is satisfactory performance is inconsistent with the need to establish serious misconduct. Prognosticating satisfactory character and work performance is the essence of judging a probationary employee, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with the discharge of a tenured civil service employee for serious misconduct. \u201cWe must remember, finally, to take care not to hobble the employer unduly in the process of selection for tenure because dislodgment thereafter is notoriously difficult. . . .\u201d <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Billerica, </em>377 Mass. at 860-861.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We conclude that the collective bargaining agreement, by imposing a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard for the discharge of probationary employees, directly and substantially conflicts with the provisions of \u00a7 34, which calls for an experimental testing of fitness during a trial period. The agreement must yield to the statute with which it conflicts, and the arbitrator, by entering an award that enforced the agreement, exceeded his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>powers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was no arbitrable issue,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the award must be vacated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered vacating the award of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-17\"> The probationary period for police and fire fighters is twelve months, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61; the probationary period for all other civil service employees is six months, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 8, provides that collective bargaining agreements covering public employees may provide for binding arbitration notwithstanding any contrary provision in various enumerated statutory provisions. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 34, is not among the enumerated statutes, from which we conclude, contrary to the argument of the defendants, that G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8, is not dispositive of this controversy. See <em>School Comm, of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>388 Mass. 557, 566 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> The termination was effected by written notice to the defendant. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34. The notice stated in detail the deficiencies in the conduct and the work of the defendant. See note 5, <em>infra. </em>The defendant makes no claim (so far as appears in the record) that the notice was in any respect \u201ca mere pretext masking unconstitutional motives for the termination.\u201d <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Billerica, </em>377 Mass. 853, 862 (1979). Nor is there any claim that the notice failed to comply with the statutory technicalities. Notice of termination to a probationary employee must state the \u201cparticulars\u201d supporting the discharge. It may not be given before the person has served thirty days, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, nor, in the case of a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>officer or fire fighter, after the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of full-time service. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\"> The written notice to the defendant, after reciting the dates and circumstances of specific events, concluded, in part, that the defendant had \u201cconsistently demonstrated conduct unbecoming an officer, and [she] has been discourteous to her superior officers, fellow officers and to members of the public. She has abused department property and has not been able to competently perform the duties as a police officer after almost one year of experience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\"> The brief filed by the city states that the city reserved \u201call defenses\u201d in stipulating the issues to be arbitrated. The brief filed by the defendants does not controvert this assertion, and therefore we accept the representation of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> Article I of the collective bargaining agreement defines the bargaining unit as consisting of \u201call employees of the Leominster Police Department\u201d with certain exceptions not material to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> That is not the scheme of things in the civil service law, which preserves the difference between employees on probation and those who are tenured. See, e.g., G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 6C, which grants to a tenured employee, but not to a probationary employee, certain rights in the event of disagreement with his or her evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> As noted earlier in this opinion, under the terms of the collective bargaining contract, art. 8, \u00a7 5, the arbitrator had no power to make any decision \u201cin conflict with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> Absent any claim that the notice of termination was defective, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>the \u201cnotice must be taken as final on the facts. . . .\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Manager State Airport, Hanscom Field, </em>336 Mass. 372, 376 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> We have reviewed the group of cases involving teachers which were cited by the defendants. See, e.g., <em>School Comm, of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106 (1977). None of the cases cited involves a material conflict between the collective bargaining agreement and, as here, a mandatory and explicit statutory provision such as G.
