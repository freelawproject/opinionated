After a hearing, a judge of the Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>rior Court had issued written findings and concluded that the officer, Michael F. Devane, had developed a sufficiently ar-ticulable basis to justify a stop of the defendant once he began to run. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The facts found by the motion judge, which we have embellished with undisputed details from the record, are as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At approximately 9:00 p.m. on July 4, 1990, Officer Devane and his partner Officer Perkins were on patrol in the area of Columbia Road and Dudley Street in Boston. The officers\u2019 interest was piqued by a man sitting atop an electrical box, who, upon their approach, began banging on the box by swinging a set of keys attached to a rope. Seeing nothing else unusual, the patrolmen moved on. A little over an hour later that evening the two officers responded to a breaking and entering committed at the same intersection. At the scene, Officer Devane learned that suspects had broken down the door of an abandoned building and then gained entry into an adjacent clothing shop through the dividing wall. Two individuals were apprehended and, in the process, a police officer was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Ten days later, while on patrol in a marked cruiser around 8:45 p.m., the same two officers decided, with the earlier crime in mind, to question a group of young men who were standing near the site of the earlier break. As he approached the group, Officer Devane noticed the defendant appear from around a corner near the doorway of the abandoned building, which was now boarded up. The defendant, walking on the sidewalk about a foot from the building, came straight toward the officer. Although Officer Devane admitted that he was unable to discern if the door to the building was ajar, he attempted to ask the defendant a few questions. Then the character of his inquiry began to change. Without breaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>stride, the defendant bluntly shouted \u201cFuck you,\u201d brushed by the group, and broke into a run. Officer Devane gave chase.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the course of a short footrace, the defendant threw a gun aside, and was subsequently caught and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We start with the proposition that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require suppression of the evidence. In <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>111 S.Ct. 1547 (1991), the United States Supreme Court held, over a vigorous dissent, that a \u201cseizure\u201d of a person within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment does not occur until a subject yields to the application of physical force by a police officer. A police officer\u2019s pursuit of a suspect, which the court treated as a \u201cshow of authority\u201d (see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, 392 </em>U.S. 1, 19 n.16 [1968]) for purposes of its opinion, does not trigger Fourth Amendment protections. Consequently, any evidence obtained prior to the actual collaring of the suspect is admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 1552. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567 (1988) (police in marked cruiser following a man, who fled at the appearance of the police vehicle, did not amount to a seizure because it would not have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore police presence). Recognizing this fundamental change in Fourth Amendment analysis (see 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.2[h], at 86-92 [Supp. 1992]), the defendant asserts that art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides greater substantive protection than does the Fourth Amendment. He argues that suppression of the evidence is mandated by a line of cases originating with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 764 (1981), in which the Supreme Judicial Court stated that \u201c[p]ursuit that appears designed to effect a stop is no less intrusive than a stop itself. <em>... [A] stop starts when pursuit </em>begins\u201d (emphasis supplied). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 998, 999-1000 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 201, 205-207 (1991). The abandoned weapon is the fruit of an illegal search, the argument goes, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Officer Devane had not acquired facts which would justify a stop at the time the defendant commenced his flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Whether art. 14 affords more expansive safeguards than those provided under the <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D. </em>formulation has not been addressed directly by a Massachusetts appellate court. Because we affirm the judge\u2019s order on other grounds, we need not decide the question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In our view, the defendant\u2019s cause is not advanced by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, supra. </em>There are significant factual distinctions between the circumstances of the pursuit in the instant case and those described in <em>Thibeau. </em>In that case the show of authority sufficient to constitute a seizure (the chase by the police \u201cwith siren blaring\u201d) began <em>before </em>the defendant engaged in any action that could be described as flight. The court stated that Thibeau \u201cfled when pursued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. In contrast, here the defendant\u2019s decision to run away was not prompted by any inappropriate police action. Because we conclude that Officer Devane permissibly could have detained the defendant for the purpose of conducting a legitimate field inquiry, once the defendant began his flight, we do not have to reach the question whether, after <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., supra, </em>art. 14 may provide more protection than the Federal Constitution with respect to \u201cseizures\u201d of individuals. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 543 n.3 (1991) (although art. 14 argument was waived, the court stated that it \u201chas never held that the State Constitution affords . . . more (or less) protection with respect to Te/ry-type stops . . . than does the Federal Constitution\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laureano, </em>411 Mass. 708, 709 n.l (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 206-207 n.4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Nor do we express an opinion as to whether the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, supra, </em>holding would survive as an independent principle of State constitutional law. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 373-377 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court has recently revisited its decision in <em>Thibeau. </em>Writing for the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laureano, </em>411 Mass. at 709-710, Justice Lynch, who wrote <em>Thibeau, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cThere we held that the police pursuit, with siren blaring, of a bicyclist required some articulable facts leading to reasonable suspicion prior to the start of pursuit because in those circumstances, the stop (and seizure) began when the pursuit commenced. <em>The claim of police \u2018pursuit\u2019 by the defendant, however, is not a talis-manic formula for converting all police investigation into a stop and seizure </em>(emphasis supplied). ... In this case there was no evidence of pursuit in the sense that the term was used in <em>Thibeau. </em>The [plainclothes] detectives merely followed the defendant into a public rest room where they both had a right to be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The defendant does not dispute that his flight may be considered as a factor in evaluating the officer\u2019s articulable suspicion, because \u201cthe defendant broke away from the police before they pursued him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>403 Mass. 640, 646 (1988). See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 764. In <em>Sanchez, </em>moreover, the defendant\u2019s flight, after he had consented to a police search, provided the officers with enough suspicion to pursue and stop him. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Although this is a close case, we think that Officer Devane\u2019s pursuit of the defendant (and consequently his \u201cstop\u201d for our present purpose) was justified in the circumstances. The judge found that Devane asked the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201cto stop for a minute\u201d so that \u201che could check the doorway to see if there was any attempt at breaking and entering\u201d because \u201cthe officer could not see the doorway from where he was standing.\u201d Given the background of the earlier breaking and entering, it was not unreasonable \u2014 in fact it was good police work<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 for Officer Devane to approach the group of men, who, from his perspective, may have been serving as lookouts for accomplices involved in further criminal activity. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>355 Mass. 378, 381 (1969). The defendant\u2019s quick appearance from around the corner, although it \u201ccould reasonably have been viewed by . . . another police officer ... as innocent [behavior],\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patti, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 443 (1991), might reasonably here have added to Officer Devane\u2019s suspicion, incorrect as it turned out, that another breaking and entering was in the making. The defendant\u2019s immediate and abrupt departure, particularly as it was apparently in direct response to Officer Devane\u2019s interest in him, in our view confirmed the officer\u2019s suspicion and transformed it into a \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d which was sufficient to detain the defendant while the crime locus was investigated. Unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 646 (1980), the defendant\u2019s evasive actions here immediately \u201craise [d] the observing officer\u2019s suspicions to the point of causing him then to believe the [defendant] should be stopped.\u201d When coupled with the other facts and circumstances, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 708 n.2 (1984), the pursuit, even though clearly designed to effect a stop, was permissible. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-14\"> The indictments were brought under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a) (carrying a firearm); G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A) (possession of ammunition); and G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60 (receiving stolen property).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> The defendant does not quibble with the facts found by the motion judge, which are supported by the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>403 Mass. 640, 643 n.2 (1988). Rather, he challenges the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion regarding the constitutional implication of those facts, which, of course, may form the basis of an appeal. See <em>ibid. </em>The ultimate findings are, however, entitled to substantial deference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. <em>777, </em>780 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> The motion judge found that the defendant\u2019s flight preceded the officer\u2019s pursuit, and the defendant has conceded as much.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> Although Massachusetts has apparently adopted, under art. 14, the <em>pre-Hodari D. </em>test for determining when a seizure of an individual has occurred \u2014 that is, whether \u201ca reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave[,]\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 791 (1985), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) \u2014 no appellate court of the Commonwealth has yet been presented squarely with the opportunity to consider the \u201cbright-line\u201d rule of <em>Hodari D. </em>and whether that rule would alter the <em>Thibeau </em>decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. at 543-544 (where the court, in construing the Fourth Amendment, invokes the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard, yet cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Hodari D., supra). </em>For a decision which demonstrates the difficult exercise of determining when a seizure occurs in a similar factual situation, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Mamon, </em>435 Mich. 1 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em> Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>365 Mass. 472, 475 (1974), in which the court discussed police officers\u2019 duty to follow those who flee upon their approach, appears to support our conclusion. However, that decision was apparently reached solely under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
