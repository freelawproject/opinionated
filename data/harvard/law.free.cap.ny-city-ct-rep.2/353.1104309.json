When these rights unite in one and the same person, he is put in the place of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The grantee in such a case could recover all in a single action, and why not in a summary proceeding? The right of action and of possession are in the present landlords, and it would defeat the purpose of the law to deny them any of the remedies furnished for their enforcement and protection. The petition states all the facts, and sufficiently confers jurisdiction (see 2 <em>R. S. </em>6 ed. 1128, \u00a7 20). Motion to dismiss denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">See Code, \u00a7 2235; <em>McAdam Landl. &amp; T. </em>2 ed. 388 <em>et seq.; </em>and People <em>v. </em>Stuyvesant, 1 <em>Hun, </em>102.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
