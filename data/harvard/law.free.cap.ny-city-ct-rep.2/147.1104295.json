It should allege either \u201c that the defendant is a resident,\u201d or \u201c that he has a place of business with the county,\u201d for either will suffice. If it be true that the defendant is a resident and also has a place of business within the county, the fact ought to be alleged in the conjunctive, in order to satisfy the rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Motion to vacate order granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
