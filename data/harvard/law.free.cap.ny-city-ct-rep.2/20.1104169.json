The ground of liability is the negligence of the parent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-11\">On June 15, 1879, the plaintiff went to the residence of the defendant to give the latter\u2019s twelve-year-old son lessons in Hebrew. The defendant kept a loaded pistol in an unlocked drawer of his bureau in the room where his children were allowed to play. The pupil playfully took the pistol out of the drawer, and, not knowing the consequences, pointed it at his mentor\u2014the plaintiff. It went off like a flash, the bullet striking the plaintiff, making a deep indentation in the flesh and doing him bodily harm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-12\">The action was against the parent for $2,000 damages, alleged to have been suffered in consequence of the injuries.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-13\"><em>T. D. Robinson </em>and <em>Isaac L. Sink, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-14\"><em>L. WaUack </em>and <em>Albert Oardoza, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Upon the conclusion of the evidence Judge McAdam declined to dismiss the complaint, and, after reviewing the evidence, charged the jury that if, under the circumstances stated above, they found that the defendant was negligent in placing a loaded revolver in an unlocked bureau drawer within the reach of children too young to understand its danger, and that such negligence resulted in injury to the plaintiff, the defendant was liable for the consequences; that while a parent is not liable for the tortious or negligent acts of his minor children, he was liable for his own want of care where it resulted in damage to another ; and that if he failed to observe the caution which an ordinarily prudent man would have exercised under similar circumstances, his negligence was established; that the ground of liability was the carelessness of the parent; and that the existence or absence of negligence was a question of fact for their determination. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff for $500 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The judgment was subsequently paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Liability for Torts by Infants.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The general rule is that an infant is responsible for his torts as any other person would be <em>(Cooley on Torts, </em>183; <em>Sherman </em>&amp; <em>R. on Neg. </em>\u00a7 57; Tifft <em>v. </em>Tifft, 4 <em>Denio, </em>175; see cases collated in <em>Washington L. Rep. </em>November 20, 1886; <em>MacPherson on Infants, </em>marg. p. 481; <em>Tyler on Infancy, </em>\u00a7 123; Schlossberg <em>v. </em>Lahr, 60 <em>How.

A child too young to understand the effects of exploding powder, and who injures himself therewith, may have his action against the person who sold it to him (Carter <em>v. </em>Towne, 98 <em>Mass. </em>567). In Poland <em>v. </em>Earhart (23 <em>Reporter, </em>111), the supreme court of Iowa <em>held </em>that an action would not lie against the seller of a fire-arm to a minor who is injured in handling it. The action was by the parent for loss of services.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
