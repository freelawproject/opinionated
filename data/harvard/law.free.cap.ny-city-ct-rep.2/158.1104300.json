J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATg\">The cases reported in 62 <em>How. Pr. </em>180, and 66 <em>How. Pr. </em>342, sustain the claim of the plaintiffs that they are entitled to the allowance not only on the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, but on the counter-claim which was extinguished. Those ca^es certainly place a very liberal construction on the rule in regard to allowances to counsel, but as I must accept them as a correct interpretation of the law, it follows that- the plaintiffs are entitled to have their allowance taxed in conformity to these decisions. The clerk will be ordered to retax accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
