It was, therefore, in legal effect, an appearance by the same attorney. There was no necessity for a separate defense (Perry <em>v. </em>Livingston, 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>404). The rule is the same where defendants appear by separate attorneys who are partners (6 <em>How. Pr. </em>9; 5 <em>Id. </em>104; 15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>75; 16 <em>Barb. </em>593). The cases relied on by the defendant do not conflict with these \"views.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Taxation affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
