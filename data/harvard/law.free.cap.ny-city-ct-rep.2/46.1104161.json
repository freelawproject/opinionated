Y. </em>241; Thaule <em>v. </em>Krekeler, 81 <em>Id. </em>428; Davis <em>v. </em>American Society, &amp;c., 75 <em>Id. </em>362). In the present ease malice is neither alleged nor proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Upon this ground, and without deciding whether, in law, the prosecution instituted by the agent in his own name, and apparently on his own behalf, binds the corporation in whose service he was engaged, the complaint will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">No appeal was taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
