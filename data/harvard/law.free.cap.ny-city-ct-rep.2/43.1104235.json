J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY0\">While it is true that the court will not compel a defendant in an action for libel or slander to furnish evidence in answer to a bill for discovery, to maintain the action and subject him to punitive damages in the nature of a penalty (5 <em>Barb. </em>297; 9 <em>Paige, </em>580; <em>2 Abb. N. C. </em>158; 14 <em>Hun, 122), </em>the rule does not prevent the defendant compelling a discovery from a plaintiff of the truth of the alleged libel, where such discovery will not subject him to a criminal prosecution, or to a penalty or forfeiture, or render him infamous (9 <em>Paige, </em>580; 26 <em>Hun, </em>166). The application to vacate the order for examination will therefore be denied, and the plaintiff will be required to submit to the required examination; but no question will be permitted, the answer to which may in any way tend to subject her to a criminal prosecution or penalty, or to render her infamous, nor will the witness be required to plead her privilege as an excuse for not answering \u201e such questions, such a requirement being contrary to the spirit and intent of the rule regulating such examinations (see <em>26 Hun, </em>169). So limited, the examination may be had on January 9, 1884, at 10 a. m., and the defendant to have three days within which to answer after the completion of such examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">No appeal was taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
