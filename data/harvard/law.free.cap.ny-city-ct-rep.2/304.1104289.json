J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">The defendant\u2019s claim for contribution- is valid to the extent, of. $150 and interest, making together $168; but it is not the proper subject of counterclaim, because it grows out of an unsettled partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>relation existing between Mm and the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. The defendant has a suit now pending for an accounting, m wMch he may appropriately charge the above $168 against Ms partner in the adjustment of the accounts. The following authorities sustain these conclusions: <em>Waterman on Set-off, </em>178, 179; <em>Barbour on Set-off, </em>90; <em>Story on Part. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 221-223; 3 <em>Hill, </em>188; 27 <em>Barb. </em>554; <em>Story Eg. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 664, 665; 14 <em>Johns. </em>318; 1 <em>Hall, </em>180; 6 <em>Barb. </em>537; 23 <em>Id. </em>184; 4 <em>N. Y. </em>186; 43 <em>Id. </em>598; 54 <em>Barb. </em>223; 1 <em>Duer, </em>667. A counter-claim, even if used merely as a set-off, is in the nature of a cross action, which cannot be maintained at law, by one partner against another, until there has been a settlement had and balance struck. The theory of the equity smt is that because the partners have not agreed upon a balance the court should, after the accounting, declare one.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The plaintiff, is, therefore, entitled to judgment for $384.04 with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
