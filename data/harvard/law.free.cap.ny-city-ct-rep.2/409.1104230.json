J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">As a rule, an infant is not liable as a partner (1 <em>Parsons on Cont. </em>7th ed., bottom p. 354). The rule has its exceptions (120 <em>Mass. </em>324). In an action against the firm, the infant, should be joined as a party defendant, because the defense is personal to him <em>(Barbour on Parties, </em>2 ed. 116; 1 <em>Daly, </em>416). Where, in an action on contract, the defendant pleads non-joinder of his copartner as a defendant, a reply that such copartner is an infant is bad on demurrer, as the contracts of an infant are voidable, not void (Slocum <em>v. </em>Hooker, 13 <em>Barb. </em>536). The correct practice is to join all the parties as defendants. If one pleads infancy the plaintiff may enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>against such defendant, and proceed to judgment against the other defendants (See cases collated in 13 <em>Barb. </em>540, and 1 <em>Daly, </em>416).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The adult defendant is in default, and, as the infant defendant has pleaded infancy in defense, the action may be discontinued as to him without costs (1 <em>City Ct. </em>262).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
