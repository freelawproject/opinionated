Half fees should suffice where adjournment was taken. The charge for preparing report and consideration is reasonable. There should thus be allowed $102 for sessions when testimony was taken; $60 for adjournments ; and $25 for consideration and report. Deducting $50 already paid, there is a balance due of $137. The defendant must pay this, and permit the taking up of report within ten days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
