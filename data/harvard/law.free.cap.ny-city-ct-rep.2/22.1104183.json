Pr. </em>511), and it makes no difference whether the liability be joint or several (Warner <em>v. </em>Ford, 17 <em>How. Pr. </em>54).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Mason, J., in the last cited, said: \u201cI do not see that it could make any difference if the contract on which the suit is brought were <em>joint and several, </em>when the plaintiff sues them jointly, for he is entitled to joint judgment. As the defendants have assumed a joint liability, the plaintiff is entitled to insist upon a joint judgment, and it does not lie with one of the parties to say that joint liability shall be severed by his putting in a separate defense, <em>and if the other parties, who do not wish, to defend, desire to he relieved from costs, they should pay the demand. </em>As sections 454, 455, 456, 1,205, i,932 of the Code of Civil Procedure were not invoked by either party before judgment, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>not necessary to pass on their effect, even if they would have been otherwise applicable. They do not in this case prevent the application of the former practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Motion to set aside judgment or to retax costs denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
