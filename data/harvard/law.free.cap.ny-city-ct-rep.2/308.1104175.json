If the judgment so obtained by him is affirmed on appeal, he is. entitled to double costs on the appeal (Burkle <em>v. </em>Luce, 1 <em>N. Y. </em>293; S. C., 3 <em>How. Pr. </em>236). But if the public, officer does not obtain a final judgment in his favor, he cannot obtain double costs upon a mere reversal of the judgment, which is not a final adjudication. He must, according to the statute as interpreted by the courts, succeed on the trial or obtain a final judgment in his favor before the right to double costs attaches (3 <em>law Bull. </em>29; 18 <em>How, Pr. </em>468; 4 <em>Hill, </em>546; 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>253; 9 <em>Id. </em>80); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>but when, it once attaches by force - of the statute, it applies to any appeal at which he succeeds in sustaining the judgment originally rendered in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Taxation affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
