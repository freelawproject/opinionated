The order of the general term affirming the judgment \u201c with costs \u201d having been reversed, \u201c its entire effect was wiped out\u201d (Murtha <em>v. </em>Curley, 3 <em>Civ.

These items, amounting to $126.50, will be deducted from $319.75, the bill as taxed, leaving $192.50 as the proper amount. At this sum the taxation will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
