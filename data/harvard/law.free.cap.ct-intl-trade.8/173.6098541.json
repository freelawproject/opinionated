Defendant also maintains the court erred by failing to consider the headnote definition for \u201cclock cases\u201d and by applying an incorrect test in overruling the statutory presumption of correctness. In Slip Op. 84-57, the court, after trial, ruled that the imported merchandise, consisting of wood and rattan frames, was classifiable under item A222.60 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) and entitled to duty-free entry under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The classification of the United States Customs Service (Customs) under item 720.34, providing for \u201cclock cases and parts thereof,\u201d was overruled because the merchandise, in its im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ported condition, was found not to be suitable for use as a clock case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">The judgment in Slip Op. 84-57 must be modified to the extent that GSP treatment was afforded to five of the disputed entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">This action, as consolidated, covers six entries. At the trial, Plaintiffs Exhibits 5, 8, and 11 were offered and consisted of three Customs Certificates of Origin (Form A), and, to the court\u2019s understanding, covered five of the disputed entries. It is now clear that two of the disputed entries, Nos. 81-507696-0 and 81-508568-9, were not covered by the Form A\u2019s introduced at trial. Since the filing of the Form A is a condition precedent to GSP treatment, <em>see </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.112 (1983),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> those two entries should not have been accorded GSP treatment. Accordingly, duty must be assessed on entries 81-507696-0 and 81-508568-9 at the rate of 11 percent ad va-lorem.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">With respect to entries 81-507871-9, 81-507987-3 and 81-507266-3, plaintiff filed Form A\u2019s at the trial. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs Exhibits 5, 8, 11. Counsel for defendant noted an objection, maintaining that plaintiff had laid no foundation for the late introduction of the Form A\u2019s. Under section 10.112 of the Customs Regulations, defendant contended, it was incumbent on plaintiff to demonstrate its freedom from willful negligence or fraudulent intent in explaining why the Form A\u2019s were not submitted at the time the entries were made. The court acknowledged the objection and reserved decision thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In Slip Op. 84-57, the court gave effect to Plaintiffs Exhibits 5, 8, and 11. The court interpreted section 10.112 as placing on defendant the burden of showing plaintiffs willful negligence or fraudulent intent in not filing the Form A\u2019s at entry. This burden properly rests on plaintiff. <em>See, e.g., Mattel, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>67 CCPA 74, 76, 624 F.2d 1076, 1078 (1980); <em>Green Giant Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>79 Cust. Ct. 61, 70 (1977). This burden, minimal as it was, was not satisfied at the trial since plaintiff adduced no evidence on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The language following <em>\u201cId.\u201d </em>and continuing until <em>\u201cCONCLUSION, </em>\u201d appearing at page 9 of Slip Op. 84-57 to the effect that section 10.112 places a burden on defendant is hereby vacated and withdrawn. The language appearing at page 10 of Slip Op. 84-57, namely, \u201cand entitled to duty-free entry under the GSP,\u201d is similarly vacated and withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Defendant also claims the court overlooked the statutory definition of \u201cclock cases\u201d contained in Headnote 2(d), Part 2E, Schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>7, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court did not \u201cdisregard\u201d this definition as defendant suggests, but, rather, found it nonapplicable. The court found, as a matter of fact, that the merchandise, in its imported condition, simply did not qualify as a clock case and thus could not come within the headnote definition. The imported frames could have been used for virtually anything, ranging from mirrors to paintings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Similarly, and contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion that the court applied a \u201cdedication to use\u201d test, the court found as a matter of fact that the merchandise, as imported, was amenable to several uses, including frames for pictures or mirrors. If the court was applying any test at all, it was the time-honored one that, for classification purposes, merchandise must be considered and examined in the condition in which it is imported. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Citroen, </em>233 U.S. 407, 414-15 (1912). Under this \u201ctest,\u201d classification of the imported frames under the \u201cclock cases\u201d provision was precluded. \u201cThe fact that the article in question was used in the manufacture of [clocks] has no relation to the condition of the article as imported, but to what afterwards the importer did with it.\u201d <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>139 U.S. 337, 341 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In accordance with the points outlined above, defendant\u2019s motion for rehearing and amendment of judgment is granted. All entries in this consolidated action, with the exception of 81-507512-3, which is properly classifiable under item A222.60, TSUS, free of duty, are properly classifiable under item 222.60, TSUS, with duty at the rate of 11 percent ad valorem!</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-17\"> Rule 59(a) of the Rules of the United States Court of International Trade provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-18\">(a) Grounds.
