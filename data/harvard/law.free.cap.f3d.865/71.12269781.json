LYNCH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Plaintiffs-appellants brought this action under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 <em>et seq., </em>against defendant-appellee American Medical Response, Inc. (\u201cAMR\u201d), alleging (1) in a <em>qui tam </em>claim, that AMR made false statements and submitted false claims to the government for reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and (2) in an individual claim, that AMR retaliated against plaintiff-appellant Paul Fabula for his refusal to falsify a document. The <em>qui tam </em>claim is asserted by bankruptcy trustee Ronald I. Chorches for and on behalf of the United States of America and for the benefit of Fabula\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The retaliation claim is asserted by Fabula individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Michael P. Shea, <em>Judge) </em>dismissed both claims: the first on the ground that Chorches failed to allege with the specificity required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) that AMR submitted false claims to the government, and the second on the ground that Fabu-la\u2019s refusal to falsify a document to effectuate AMR\u2019s alleged scheme to submit false claims did not constitute protected activity under the FCA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision. After deciding, as preliminary matters, that the district court had jurisdiction over Chorches\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>claim and that Fabula did not abandon his retaliation claim, we conclude (1) that Chorches has pled the submission of false claims with sufficient particularity under Rule 9(b), as applied in the <em>qui tam </em>context; and (2) that Fabula\u2019s refusal to falsify a patient report, under the circumstances of this case, qualifies as protected activity. Accordingly, we VACATE the judgment of the district court, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">The following facts are taken largely from the second and third amended complaints filed in this action (the \u201cSAC\u201d and the \u201cTAC,\u201d respectively). As required when reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim, we accept these facts as true for purposes of this opinion. <em>See O\u2019Brien v. Nat'l Prop. Analysts Partners, </em>936 F.2d 674, 676-77 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">From August 2010 to December 2011, Fabula worked as an Emergency Medical Technician (\u201cEMT\u201d) in the New Haven, Connecticut branch office of AMR, the largest ambulance company in the United States. In February 2011, while he was employed at AMR, Fabula filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; he received a discharge of his debts in May 2011; and his bankruptcy case was closed in June 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">As an EMT, Fabula provided emergency and non-emergency medical transport services, some of which were reimbursable under Medicare and/or Medicaid. According to the complaints, AMR engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain reimbursement from Medicare by falsely certifying ambulance transports as medically necessary and submitting claims that it knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>were not properly reimbursable under the rules and regulations governing payments by Medicare.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The execution of the alleged scheme was relatively straightforward. Medicare pays AMR only for ambulance transports that were \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d as explained in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual. Medical necessity is established when the patient\u2019s condition is such that use of any other method of transportation is contraindicated (ie., inadvisable for the patient\u2019s health). Thus, in any case in which some means of transportation other than an ambulance can be used without endangering the individual\u2019s health, whether or not such other transportation is actually available, Medicare does not pay for ambulance services. Even when the services are deemed medically necessary, moreover, Medicare payments are based on the level of services furnished, not simply on the vehicle used. As a result, in order to receive reimbursement from Medicare, AMR was required to review and submit information about the condition of patients and the emergency or non-emergency medical services that it had provided to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">When AMR dispatched, an ambulance to transport someone (in industry parlance, a \u201crun\u201d), the participating paramedics and/or EMTs were required to complete an electronic Patient Care Report (\u201cPCR\u201d). The PCRs documented information such as the date, time, and address of the pickup; the name of the person being transported; the name of the medical facility to which the person was transported; and a description of the condition of the person being transported. They were created electronically on a laptop computer during, or immediately following, a run. The description of the transported person\u2019s condition determines whether a run is treated as \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">The TAC alleges that during the period of Fabula\u2019s employment, AMR routinely made its EMTs and paramedics revise or recreate their field-generated PCRs to include false statements purportedly demonstrating medical necessity to ensure that runs would be reimbursable by Medicare, whether or not ambulance service was in fact medically necessary in the particular case. AMR supervisors provided the EMTs and paramedics with printouts of their original PCRs prepared at the time of the run, marked up with handwritten revisions that altered the substance of the original PCRs so as to falsely characterize runs as medically necessary. Supervisors at AMR specifically instructed EMTs and paramedics how to modify the PCRs by including false or misleading information, and admitted to Fabula that the purpose of such revisions was to qualify the run for Medicare- reimbursement. The participation of the EMTs and paramedics in the revision of the PCRs was required because those employees had unique log-in passwords that allowed them to alter the PCRs and prevented AMR supervisors from revising the PCRs themselves. After the EMTs and paramedics had revised or recreated the original PCRs, AMR supervisors collected and shredded the printouts with the handwritten changes. The falsified electronic PCRs remained in AMR\u2019s database, to be used for billing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">. In addition to identifying several general categories of patients who were susceptible to having their runs falsely certified as medically necessary (for example, calm and cooperative dementia patients were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>routinely written up as having a history of violence), the TAC identifies more than ten specific runs for which Fabula was ordered to alter PCRs to include false or misleading information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A few examples follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">On July 7, 2011, Fabula and paramedic William Shick transported several patients to the hospital in response to 911 calls. About two weeks later, Fabula was asked to revise four of the PCRs by adding information about the patients\u2019 previous surgeries and injuries, implying that such history made ambulance service medically necessary, even though one patient with a chronic allergy issue had no medical need for an ambulance but wanted a ride to the hospital because she thought she could avoid a wait at the hospital if she was brought in by an ambulance, and another patient called for an ambulance only because he felt that he should not have to buy his own cough syrup. On October 17, 2011, Fabula was in the midst of transports ing a patient to the hospital, when the run was canceled when it was learned that it was not the correct date for the patient\u2019s medical appointment. Nevertheless, AMR made Fabula complete a \u201creturn trip PCR,\u201d as if the patient had been transported both to and from the hospital. TAC \u00b6 101. On December 4, 2011, Fabula and Douglass Gladstone (also an EMT) assisted in transporting an obese patient who \u201chad no medical reason to be sent to the hospital, he simply wanted to go there.\u201d TAC \u00b6 100. The patient was able to walk himself to the stretcher and climb on unassisted. An AMR supervisor instructed Fa-bula to insert information about the patient\u2019s previous surgeries to justify his transport to the hospital. That same patient called 911 six dozen times during 2011 for an ambulance to bring him to a medical facility to obtain insulin. AMR directed Fabula, under threat of being placed on unpaid leave, to state falsely in the PCRs for those runs that the patient had difficulty remaining in an upright position. |</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Another run in December 2011, in which Fabula assisted paramedic Kevin Bodiford, ultimately led to Fabula\u2019s effective termination by AMR.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For several weeks following the run, an AMR supervisor repeatedly instructed Bodiford, who had completed the original PCR (the \u201cDecember 2011 PCR\u201d), to revise his PCR so that it could be submitted to Medicare for payment. Bodiford refused to resubmit the PCR and told a supervisor that Fabula was responsible for the run. In February 2012, while Fabula was on medical leave, the supervisor contacted Fabula and \u201ctold [him] to return to AMR under the guise of recreating a PCR from a run made in early December of 2011 that [the supervisor] said had been lost.\u201d SAC It 70. Fabula responded by email that he was uncomfortable with the request. Later that same month, when Fabula went to AMR\u2019s offices at the supervisor\u2019s direction, the supervisor told Fabula that \u201c[y]ou should be able to complete the PCR with the information I\u2019ve provided,\u201d SAC \u00b6 72, and Fabula was handed the PCR that Bodiford had created as well as a cover sheet that included handwritten additions for Fabula to include in a new PCR. The addition of the handwritten information would have qualified the run for Medicare reimbursement. The words Fabula was instructed to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>were not his, however; Fabula in fact did not even know what some of the words meant. No longer willing to participate in AMR\u2019s scheme, Fabula refused to falsify the PCR despite being told that \u201cif he didn\u2019t include [the handwritten information] on the PCR, he couldn\u2019t come back to work.\u201d SAC \u00b6 75. In a March 1, 2012 letter, AMR instructed Fabula \u201cimmediately to arrange a time for reconciliation and transmission of this [electronic PCR]. Failure to do so will result in corrective action up to and including termination.\u201d SAC \u00b6 79. Because Fabula never returned to revise the PCR, his employment was effectively terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">On June 22, 2012, Fabula filed this action as a relator on behalf of the United States, which declined to intervene in 2013. The SAC asserted two claims: Count One alleged that AMR violated 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A) and (B) by making false statements and submitting false claims to the government, and Count Two alleged that AMR fired Fabula in retaliation for his efforts to stop the submission of a false claim in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h). On March 4, 2015, the district court dismissed the retaliation claim with prejudice for failure to state a claim, holding that Fabula\u2019s refusal to falsify a PCR did not constitute protected activity. It also dismissed the <em>qui tam </em>claim on standing grounds, because the <em>qui tam </em>claim, which pre-dated Fabula\u2019s bankruptcy petition, had become the property of his bankruptcy estate. The district court stayed the dismissal of the <em>qui tam </em>claim, however, to give Chorches, the trustee of Fabula\u2019s bankruptcy estate, the opportunity to intervene and pursue that claim. Subsequently, Chorches joined the action and filed the TAC, which pled only the <em>qui tam </em>claim. On November 6, 2015, the district court dismissed the TAC with prejudice for failure to state a claim, holding that Chorches did not satisfy Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirement. It entered its final judgment dismissing the case on November 10, 2015. Appellants timely appealed the district court\u2019s March-4 and November 6,2015 rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">\u201cWe review de novo the grant of a [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Trs. of Upstate N.Y. Eng\u2019rs. Pension Fund v. Ivy Asset Mgmt., </em>843 F.3d 561, 566 (2d Cir. 2016). The complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and must \u201callow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. </em>Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Appellants contend that the district court erred in dismissing the FCA <em>qui tam </em>and retaliation claims, as pled in the TAC and the SAC, respectively. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">I. The <em>Qui Tam </em>Claim Was Adequately Pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Chorches argues that the district court erred in dismissing the TAC for failure to comply with Rule 9(b). AMR not only challenges that position but also claims that we lack jurisdiction to consider Chorches\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>claim because the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over that claim, AMR argues that because Chorches\u2019s allegations derive from claims made in Fabula\u2019s original complaint, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>violate the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar, which AMR contends is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">A. The District Court Had Jurisdiction over the Trustee\u2019s Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Because \u201cevery federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also [of] that of the lower courts in a cause under review,\u201d <em>Arnold v. Lucks, </em>392 F.3d 512, 517 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), we begin by addressing AMR\u2019s threshold contention that the FCA\u2019s so-called \u201cpublic disclosure bar\u201d deprived the district court of jurisdiction over Chorches\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The public disclosure bar provides that courts \u201cshall dismiss an action or claim under [\u00a7 3730] ... if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed\u201d in a federal action (amongst other avenues) \u201cunless ... the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). For the first time on appeal, AMR argues that because Chorches\u2014the trustee of Fa-bula\u2019s bankruptcy estate, to which the <em>qui tam </em>claim belongs\u2014raises the same <em>qui tam </em>claim that was previously raised by Fabula, Chorches\u2019s claim should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Whether the public disclosure bar is jurisdictional matters in this case because of AMR\u2019s failure to raise this argument below. Ordinarily, we will not consider in the first instance arguments not raised in the district court. <em>In re Nortel Networks Corp. Secs. Litig., </em>539 F.3d 129, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). However, because parties may not, by stipulation or neglect, confer jurisdiction on the federal courts that was denied to us by Congress, we must address any question about our jurisdiction, whether or not it has been properly preserved by the party contesting jurisdiction\u2014or indeed, whether or not any party raises the issue before us. <em>See Wynn v. AC Rochester, </em>273 F.3d 153, 157 (2d Cir. 2001). Accordingly, we turn first to the jurisdictional question. Upon due consideration, we conclude that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar is nonjurisdictional, and that AMR has forfeited the public disclosure defense by failing to raise the argument in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Not every rule that disallows claims under certain conditions affects the jurisdiction of the district courts. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has warned against \u201cprofligate use of the term jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d <em>Sebelius v. Auburn Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>568 U.S. 145, 153, 133 S.Ct. 817, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013). Courts must \u201cinquire whether Congress has clearly stated that the rule is jurisdictional; absent such a clear statement, [the Supreme Court has] cautioned, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnder this test, a provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts will not be considered jurisdictional.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Hayes v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>853 F.3d 80, 86 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, such rules are construed as denying a cause of action under the specified circumstances, and are subject to the normal rules for preserving nonjurisdictional arguments for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Our recent decision in <em>Hayes </em>is instructive. There, we held that the FCA\u2019s \u201cfirst-to-file rule\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is not jurisdictional; instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>it \u201cbears on the merits of whether a plaintiff has stated a claim.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>853 F.3d at 85. In so holding, we reasoned that the first-to-file bar did not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts, and stood \u201cin sharp contrast to other provisions of the FCA that <em>do </em>explicitly invoke the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The same rationale applies to the public disclosure bar at issue here. As elaborated in <em>Hayes, </em>\u201c[bjecause the FCA clearly states that <em>other </em>limitations on <em>qui tam </em>actions are jurisdictional, but does <em>not </em>clearly state\u201d that the public disclosure bar is jurisdictional, we must treat the public disclosure bar \u201cas nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Indeed, the evidence that the public disclosure bar is not jurisdictional is especially strong. Not only does the public disclosure bar, like the first-to-file rule at issue in <em>Hayes, </em>not speak in jurisdictional terms (when other provisions of the FCA do)\u2014the public disclosure rule <em>itself </em>was formerly written as a jurisdictional bar, but was amended in 2010 specifically to <em>delete </em>the jurisdictional language. Prior to 2010, the provision expressly denied jurisdiction, specifying that <em>\u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction </em>over an action under [\u00a7 3730] based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing ... unless ... the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (2006) (emphasis added). But Congress eliminated the reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d when it amended the statute in 2010. Thus, when this action was filed in 2012, the public disclosure rule was no longer jurisdictional in nature. That remains true today,</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Therefore, we join the majority of our sister circuits that have addressed the issue in holding that the public disclosure bar is no longer jurisdictional. <em>See, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, Inc. v. U.S. Bank, N.A., </em>816 F.3d 428, 433 (6th Cir. 2016) (since the 2010 amendment, \u201c[t]he public disclosure bar is no longer jurisdictional, as every other circuit to address the question has concluded.\u201d); <em>U.S. ex rel. Moore &amp; Co., P.A. v. Majestic Blue Fisheries, LLC, </em>812 F.3d 294, 299-300 (3d Cir. 2016); <em>U.S. ex rel. May v. Purdue Pharma L.P., </em>737 F.3d <em>908, </em>916-17 (4th Cir. 2013). <em>But see United States ex rel. Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local Union 20 v. Horning Investments, LLC, </em>828 F.3d 587, 591 (7th Cir. 2016) (\u201cIt is true that claims that previously have been disclosed may be brought only in limited circumstances, see 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4), and that this rule is jurisdictional.\u201d). Accordingly, because AMR failed to raise the public disclosure bar as an affirmative defense or in connection with its motion to dismiss below, its argument that Chorches\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>elaim is barred by Fabula\u2019s earlier complaints in this action has not been preserved for appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>B. The <em>Qui Tt\u00a1m </em>Claim was Adequately PlecJ under Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We turn next to the merits of Chorches\u2019s appeal. \u201cIn reviewing a decision to dismiss a complaint on Rule 9(b) grounds, we assume the truth of [a plaintiffs] allegations.\u201d <em>O'Brien, </em>936 F.2d at 676-77. The TAC alleges on information and belief that specific claims were submitted to Medicare for payment. The district court held, however, that the TAC fails to satisfy Rule 9(b) because it provides neither details, such as invoice numbers, invoice dates, and amounts billed or reimbursed, regarding actual requests for payment made to the government, nor a factual basis for its allegations that AMR submitted false claims. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The FCA is an anti-fraud statute that \u201cmay be enforced not just through litigation brought by the Government itself, but also through civil <em>qui tam </em>actions that are filed by private parties, called relators, \u2018in the name of the Government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Servs., Inc. v. U.S. ex rel. Carter, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1970, 1973, 191 L.Ed.2d 899 (2015), quoting 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1). As relevant to Chorches\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>claim, the FCA imposes liability on any person who \u201cknowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval\u201d or who \u201cknowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A), (B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The FCA defines a \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201cany request or demand ... for money or property\u201d that is presented, directly or indirectly, to the United States. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\"><em>Qui tam </em>complaints filed under the FCA, because they are claims of fraud, are subject to Rule 9(b). <em>U.S. ex rel. Ladas v. Exelis, Inc., </em>824 F.3d 16, 26 (2d Cir. 2016); <em>Gold v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., </em>68 F.3d 1475, 1476-77 (2d Cir. 1995). Rule 9(b) states that \u201c[i]n alleging fraud ..., a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). That ordinarily requires a complaint alleging fraud to \u201c(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the. speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u201d <em>Ladas, </em>824 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). But \u201cthe adequacy of particularized allegations under Rule 9(b) is ... case- and context-specific.\u201d <em>Espinoza ex rel. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. v. Dimon, </em>797 F.3d 229, 236 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">\u201cDespite the generally rigid requirement [of Rule 9(b)], allegations may be based on information and belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>when facts are peculiarly within the opposing party\u2019s knowledge.\u201d <em>Wexner v. First Manhattan Co., </em>902 F.2d 169, 172 (2d Cir. 1990). \u201cPleading on information and belief is a desirable and essential expedient when' matters that are necessary to complete the statement of a claim are not within the knowledge of the plaintiff but he has sufficient data to justify interposing an allegation on the subject.\u201d 5C C. Wright et al., Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 1224 (3d ed. April 2017 Update). \u201cWhere pleading is permitted on information and belief\u2019 in a complaint that alleges fraud (and is therefore subject to Rule 9(b)), we require that the complaint \u201cadduce specific facts supporting a strong inference of fraud.\u201d <em>Wexner, </em>902 F.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">AMR argues that Chorches has not satisfied Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirements because he has not identified actual invoices that were submitted to the federal government. The TAC, however, adequately pleads\u2014with specificity, albeit on information and belief\u2014that fraudulent claims were submitted to Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">\n<em>1. The TAC Adequately Alleges that Billing Information was Peculiarly Within the Knowledge of AMR.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Chorches concedes that he cannot identify exact billing numbers, dates, or amounts for claims submitted to the government. However, the TAC sets forth facts establishing specific reasons why such information regarding the particular bills that were submitted for reimbursement is \u201cpeculiarly within [AMR\u2019s] knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the TAC, all ambulance personnel, including Fabula, \u201cwere prohibited from making unauthorized entrances into the administrative building of AMR in New Haven where all the billing was taking place,\u201d and other than \u201ccertifying] whether ambulance runs were medically necessary,\u201d they were not able to \u201cparticipate[ ] in [AMR\u2019s] billing procedures.\u201d TAC \u00b6 115. In fact, EMTs and paramedics were restricted to the \u201c \u2018garage\u2019 and the \u2018window\u2019 where they punched in and punched out each day,\u201d so that any \u201cinformation about AMR\u2019s submissions to Medicare ... [was] not accessible by any paramedics or EMTs such as Fabula.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The billing procedures established by AMR thus (advertently or inadvertently) made it virtually impossible for most employees to have access to all of the information necessary to certify on personal knowledge both that a particular invoice was submitted for payment and that the facts stated to justify the invoice were false. The EMTs and paramedics who participated in the runs and wrote up the PCRs had knowledge of the facts recited regarding the runs (including any falsifications), which would be the basis for establishing whether the runs were eligible for Medicare reimbursement, but they had no access to the billing records establishing whether the runs with allegedly falsified records were in fact billed to Medicare. .Conversely, the accounting personnel who presumably dealt with the billing and reimbursement processes knew which invoices were submitted to Medicare, but had access to PCRs (that the TAC alleges were deliberately falsified) only <em>after </em>the falsification was complete; therefore, they presumably were in a position to believe in good faith that, according to the information certified by the EMTs and paramedics, the submitted runs qualified for reimbursement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In light of those particular circumstances, which are based on specific factual allegations that <em>are </em>within Fabula\u2019s knowledge and that we must assume to be true for present purposes, Fabula (and hence Chorches) was unable, without the benefit of discovery, to provide billing details for claims that AMR submitted to the government for reimbursement. As a result, through no fault or lack of diligence on their part, plaintiffs lacked the ability to identify specific documents containing false claims that AMR submitted to the government. The TAC does, however, make plausible allegations that the bills or invoices actually submitted to the government were uniquely within AMR\u2019s knowledge and control. It therefore establishes a basis for concluding that allegations regarding the actual submission of bills may be made on information and belief. But, as noted above, even where a plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to permit fraud to be pled on information and belief, the complaint must still \u201cadduce specific facts supporting a strong inference of fraud.\u201d <em>Wexner, </em>902 F.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">\n<em>2. The TAC Alleges a Basis for a Strong Inference that Specific False Claims Were Indeed Submitted to the Government.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">\u201c[F]raud under the FCA has two components: the defendant must submit or cause the submission of a claim for payment to the government, and the claim for payment must itself be false or fraudulent.\u201d <em>Hagerty ex rel. U.S. v. Cyberonics, Inc., </em>844 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 2016). To begin with, there is little dispute that insofar as AMR\u2019s scheme of falsifying PCRs is concerned\u2014as distinct from its subsequent submission of any claim for payment\u2014the TAC \u201cstate[s] with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Indeed, even in dismissing the TAC for failure to identify \u201cwith particularity any specific false claims that were actually submitted to the federal government for payment,\u201d the district court noted that \u201cthe TAC alleges, in some detail, a scheme of fraud, <em>ie. </em>[AMR\u2019s] falsely completing PCRs.\u201d J.A. 309-10, n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The TAC, over forty pages long, details the specifics of a scheme whereby AMR falsified PCRs so as to certify runs as \u201cmedically necessary\u201d and thus render them reimbursable by the government. It names supervisory personnel at AMR\u2019s offices in New Haven who instructed paramedics and EMTs to revise PCRs to insert false information. It identifies not only the time period of Fabula\u2019s employment, August 2010 to December 2011, as that during which the fraudulent scheme took place, but also provides dates, both precise and approximate, with respect to many particular runs for which Fabula was later asked to falsify a PCR. It explains both the scheme itself and the method by which AMR executed the scheme: how Medicare reimbursed AMR only for ambulance transports that qualified as medically necessary; how the EMTs and paramedics were required to complete PCRs to document their runs; and how AMR supervisors provided hard-copy markups (that were later destroyed) to the EMTs and paramedics and ordered them, under threat of suspension or termination, to revise field-generated PCRs with false or misleading information such that runs could be certified as medically necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">In addition to alleging that AMR falsified PCRs on a daily basis, and identifying the types of patients whose PCRs were routinely falsified, the TAC details many specific runs\u2014providing information such as the date, patient name, and original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>reason for the transport\u2014for which Fabu-la was told to alter a PCR with false or misleading information. These allegations are not merely general or conclusory. Here, as an example, is one such allegation vis-\u00e1-vis a particular set of runs that Chorches claims, upon information and belief, was submitted to Medicare for reimbursement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">[Patient name redacted] (now deceased) of [address redacted] in New Haven, was a grossly overweight man and a diabetic, and he called 911 for an ambulance on a daily basis\u2014six dozen times during 2011\u2014to bring him to his medical facility\u2014for his insulin. Paul Fabula was directed, under threat of being put on unpaid leave, to change and falsely certify the electronic entry of the PCRs in order to say that [patient] had difficulty remaining in an upright position in order to qualify [patient\u2019s] runs in the ambulance for Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement. Fabula did as he was ordered, and upon information and belief they were submitted to Medicare for payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">TAC II108.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Those allegations detail specific and plausible facts from which we may easily infer, for present purposes, that AMR systematically falsified its records to support false claims that ambulance runs were medically necessary and thus reimbursable. Such an inference of falsity is central to alleging the submission of false claims. As the Fifth Circuit has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">[standing alone, raw bills\u2014even with numbers, dates, and amounts\u2014are not fraud without an underlying scheme to submit the bills for unperformed or unnecessary work. It is the scheme in which particular circumstances constituting fraud may be found that make it highly likely the fraud was consummated through the presentment of false bills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-10\"><em>U.S. ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, </em>565 F.3d 180, 190 (5th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, Chorches has sufficiently pled the allegation, critical to stating an FCA <em>qui tarn </em>claim, that records were in fact falsified.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">He must <em>also </em>plead, however, that the false records were actually presented to the government for reimbursement. As noted above, although Chorches puts forth particularized allegations of a scheme to falsify records, and describes specific instances of the implementation of that scheme, he does not\u2014and, for reasons set forth above, he cannot\u2014allege on personal knowledge (of himself or of Fabula) that false claims were submitted to the government. We conclude, however, that the TAC sets forth facts supporting a strong inference that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">First, Chorches alleges that Fabula was explicitly \u201cinformed by [AMR supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>who directed the scheme] that the revisions were required to qualify the run for Medicare reimbursement.\u201d TAC \u00b6 33. Moreover, the TAC identifies specific instances in which AMR supervisors expressly asked for a PCR to be falsified in order to qualify a run for Medicare reimbursement. These allegations are hardly implausible, or even surprising, in light of the scheme of falsification that Chorches asserts (based on Fabula\u2019s personal knowledge) was effectuated by AMR. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a reason why AMR would go through the trouble of qualifying runs as medically necessary if not to claim reimbursement for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">Thus, in alleging that supervisors specifically referenced Medicare as the provider to whose requirements the allegedly falsified revisions were intended to conform, the TAC supports a strong inference that false claims were submitted <em>to the government. </em>Moreover, in light of the significant share of runs that are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid (as distinct from private insurance), it is highly likely that any systematic scheme for documenting fabricated medical necessity for ambulance services will indeed reach the governmental insurers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While it can be hypothesized, as AMR indirectly suggests, that AMR falsified PCRs for runs that were \u201cbilled to payors other than Medicare, billed for a denial, or not billed at all,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 50, any such conclusory defense of the underlying scheme is not persuasive at the pleading stage. If the allegations as to the falsification scheme are true, as we must assume at the pleading stage, it is highly implausible to suggest that the resulting records were never submitted to the federal government for reimbursement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, AMR fails to diffuse the strong inference that it submitted false claims to the government that arises from the admissions allegedly made to Fabula by his supervisors at AMR that Medicare was the specific target of the fabricated medical necessity claims that the alleged scheme generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">We are therefore satisfied that the TAC makes plausible and particularized factual allegations leading to a strong inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>that AMR did in fact submit false claims to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">\n<em>3. Permitting Pleading on Information and Belief on These Facts is Consistent with the Purposes of Rule 9(b) and of the False Claims Act.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In applying Rule 9(b) to the submission of false claims under subsections 3729(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the FCA, we decline to require that every <em>qui tam </em>complaint allege on personal knowledge specific identified false invoices submitted to the government. As set forth above, a complaint can satisfy Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement by making plausible allegations creating a strong inference that specific false claims were submitted to the government and that the information that would permit further identification of those claims is peculiarly within the opposing party\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">That standard \u201cmust not be mistaken for license to base claims of fraud on speculation and conclusory allegations.\u201d <em>Wexner, </em>902 F.2d at 172. A relator must make allegations that lead to a strong inference that specific claims were indeed submitted and also plead that the particulars of those claims were peculiarly within the opposing party\u2019s knowledge. Those requirements ensure that those who <em>can </em>identify examples of actual claims <em>must </em>do so at the pleading stage. <em>Cf. U.S. ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1314 n.25 (11th Cir. 2002) (rejecting argument for a \u201cmore lenient pleading standard\u201d where relator was \u201cnot without avenues for obtaining information\u201d and his \u201cconclusory statements [were] insufficient to justify relaxation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The pleading standard we apply accords with the text of Rule 9(b), which requires \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud\u201d to be pleaded with particularity. Our standard is also mindful of the purposes of both Rule 9(b) and the False Claims Act. An interpretation of Rule 9(b) that requires <em>qui tam </em>plaintiffs to plead billing details regarding the submission of specific false claims, even when knowledge of such details is peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s purview, would discourage the filing of meritorious <em>qui tam </em>suits that can expose fraud against the government. Under that approach, by simply insulating its accounting department from personnel with operational knowledge, a corporate fraudster could ensure that few employee relators could successfully plead both the falsity of recorded information and the presentment of a claim containing those falsehoods. As in this case, the line workers who falsify paperwork or witness the fraud could not show that claims were in fact submitted, while the accountants who submit the claims would be unaware of the particulars of any falsification, and perhaps to the entire scheme itself. It is not the purpose of Rule 9(b), as applied to FCA <em>qui tam </em>actions, to render the FCA toothless as to particularly clever fraudulent schemes. <em>See U.S. ex rel. Lusby v. Rolls-Royce Corp., </em>570 F.3d 849, 854 (7th Cir. 2009) (any requirement that the relator plead details regarding billing packages \u201ctakes a big bite out of <em>qui tam </em>litigation\u201d). Instead, Rule 9(b) is \u201cdesigned to provide a defendant with fair notice of a plaintiffs claim, to safeguard a defendant\u2019s reputation from improvident charges of wrongdoing, and to protect a defendant against the institution of a strike suit.\u201d <em>Ladas, </em>824 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Allowing the complaint in this case to go forward does no violence to those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">First, \u201cit is the pleading of the circumstances of the alleged fraud with a certain amount of precision that serves [Rule 9(b)\u2019s] purpose by apprising the defendant ... of the nature of the claim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the acts or statements or failures to disclose relied upon by the plaintiff as constituting the fraud being charged.\u201d 5A C. Wright et al., Fed. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Proc. \u00a7 1297 (3d ed. April 2017 Update). \u201c[T]he point of Rule 9(b) is to ensure that there is sufficient substance to the allegations to both afford the defendant the opportunity to prepare a response and to warrant further judicial process.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Heath v. AT &amp; T, Inc., </em>791 F.3d 112, 125 (D.C. Cir. 2015). As detailed above, the TAC provides ample details as to the nature of the alleged scheme, as well as to particular instances in which the scheme was, to the personal knowledge of the original relator, allegedly carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">While invoice numbers and the dates of their submission would undoubtedly have put AMR on notice of specific claims allegedly submitted to the government, so do details provided in the TAC (such as dates of runs, patient names, actual reasons for the transport, and the information entered into PCRs) with respect to specific runs for which false claims were allegedly submitted. That level of notice is especially fair and adequate given that AMR\u2014and not its ambulance personnel\u2014is \u201cin possession of the most relevant records, such as ... internal billing records, with which to defend on the grounds that alleged falsely-recorded services were not recorded [or] were not billed for.\u201d <em>Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 191.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Second, while we acknowledge that AMR\u2019s \u201creputation in the health field is valuable and should not be easily tarnished,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 38, that concern does not inoculate AMR against <em>qui tam </em>liability under the FCA such that no relator\u2014even one who, as discussed in the preceding subsections, has overcome our demanding Rule 9(b) pleading requirements\u2014can survive Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. The allegations of fraud made by the TAC are sufficiently strong to justify further inquiry to determine whether AMR does or does not deserve an unblemished reputation for integrity, even without further particularization of the invoices or bills submitted to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Third, the allegations in the TAC are also sufficiently robust to allay any fear of undermining Rule 9(b)\u2019s. purpose, cited by AMR, of preventing strike suits and the concomitant pressure to settle such suits due to the pressure of litigation costs. The TAC is not, as AMR claims, \u201can unjustified ticket to discovery\u201d that is founded on \u201cconclusory and insufficient allegations.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 43; <em>see also Madonna v. United States, </em>878 F.2d 62, 66 (2d Cir. 1989) (\u201cOne of the purposes of Rule 9(b) is to discourage the filing of complaints as a pretext for discovery of unknown wrongs.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). To the contrary, by alleging with particularity AMR\u2019s scheme to falsify PCRs in order to qualify runs as medically necessary, and identifying particular cases in which that scheme was carried out, Fabula has \u201covercome the bar erected by Rule 9(b) to spurious charges or frivolous lawsuits.\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1317 (Barkett, J., dissenting). Fabula\u2019s plausible and particularized allegations are amenable to a targeted discovery process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that could lead to a swift resolution of the lawsuit, especially if AMR has not committed the fraud alleged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Finally, it bears remembering what Rule 9(b) actually requires. The Rule provides that \u201c[i]n alleging fraud ..., a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). The rule demands specificity, but unlike such substantive reforms as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), it does not elevate the standard of certainty that a pleading must attain beyond the ordinary level of plausibility.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor does it forbid pleading upon information and belief where, as here, the circumstances justify pleading on that basis. <em>See Wexner, </em>902 F.2d at 172. Thus, as noted above, Rule 9.(b) demands that the pleading specify (1) the fraudulent statements, (2) the speaker, (3) where and when the statements were made, and (4) why the statements were fraudulent. <em>See Ladas, </em>824 F.3d at 25. The TAC amply satisfies that standard: '(1) it contends that AMR falsely stated facts to make specific ambulance runs appear medically necessary when they were not, and explains the nature and significance of those falsified facts; (2) it identifies that the speaker was, broadly, AMR, and more specifically, F\u00e1-bula or other identified EMTs or paramedics who were required by their supervisors to include such falsified facts; (3) it states that the statements were made in PCRs that were, on information and belief, submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for reimbursement on dates close in time to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>dates of the specified runs within the limited time period during which Fabula knew of and participated in the scheme; and (4) it explains that the statements were fraudulent in that they asserted false facts warranting a false inference that the runs were medically necessary and thus eligible for Medicare reimbursement. Rule 9(b) requires nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">In sum, the TAC satisfies Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement as applied to FCA <em>qui tarn </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">A <em>Our Holding in this Case Accords with the Emerging Consensus in our Sister Circuits, and is Fully Consistent with our own Precedents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">We recently acknowledged\u2014without taking any position of our own\u2014a seeming \u201ccircuit split regarding whether, to satisfy Rule 9(b), an FCA relator alleging a fraudulent scheme must provide the details of specific examples of actual false claims presented to the government.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Polansky v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>822 F.3d 613, 619 (2d Cir. 2016). On further consideration, we conclude that our holding today is consistent with the law as generally stated by a majority of our sister circuits, and that the reports of a circuit split are, like those prematurely reporting Mark Twain\u2019s death, \u201cgreatly exaggerated.\u201d As the various Circuits have confronted different factual variations, differences in broad pronouncements in early cases have been refined in ways that suggest a case-by-case approach that is more consistent than might at first appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Our holding today is clearly consistent with the approach taken by the Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, which have overtly adopted a \u201cmore lenient\u201d pleading standard. Those courts have allowed a complaint that does not allege the details of an actually submitted false claim to pass Rule 9(b) muster by \u201calleging particular details of a scheme to submit false claims paired with rehable indicia that lead to a strong inference that claims were actually submitted.\u201d <em>Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 190 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>U.S. ex rel. Lemmon v. Envirocare of Utah, Inc., </em>614 F.3d 1163, 1172 (10th Cir. 2010) (adopting <em>Grubbs </em>standard); <em>Ebeid ex rel. U.S. v. Lungwitz, </em>616 F.3d 993, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2010) (same); <em>Foglia v. Renal Ventures Mgmt., LLC, </em>754 F.3d 153, 156-57 (3d Cir. 2014) (same); <em>Heath, </em>791 F.3d at 126 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (same); <em>cf. Lusby, </em>570 F.3d at 854 (7th Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe don\u2019t think it essential for a relator to produce the invoices (and accompanying representations) at the outset of the suit.\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">In arguable conflict, at least at first glance, are decisions from circuits that have professed to apply a \u201cstricter\u201d standard for pleading the submission of false claims. In <em>Clausen, </em>the Eleventh Circuit held that Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard requires \u201csome indicia of reliability ... to support the allegation of <em>an actual false claim </em>for payment being made to the [g]overnment.\u201d 290 F.3d at 1311 (emphasis in original). The First, Fourth, and Sixth Circuits have relied on <em>Clausen </em>to require, broadly speaking, that a relator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>allege details identifying actual false claims submitted to the government.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has held that a relator\u2019s complaint does not satisfy Rule 9(b) where it \u201cfails to identify even one example of an actual false claim submitted.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Dunn v. N. Am. Mem\u2019l Health Care, </em>739 F.3d 417, 420 (8th Cir. 2014). However, the decisions from those Circuits are in fact more nuanced (as are those from the Circuits adopting a more \u201clenient\u201d standard) and leave open unresolved possibilities such that any \u201csplit\u201d between them and decisions from the more lenient circuits is not, we think, a sharp one.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">In any event, whether such a split can be identified in the broad language of the cases is not particularly meaningful here. It is far from clear that Circuits that have adopted the stricter pleading standard\u2014 but at the same time declined to impose an ineluctable bright-line rule that <em>every </em>relator allege details of actual claims submitted\u2014-would disagree with our decision in this case. Indeed, the TAC includes some details regarding submitted claims that those Circuits have identified as absent from insufficiently particularized complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">The Sixth Circuit, for example, in adopting the \u201cstricter\u201d pleading standard, expressly noted that it did not \u201cintend to foreclose the possibility of a court relaxing this rule in circumstances where a relator demonstrates that he cannot allege the specifics of actual false claims that in all likelihood exist, and the reason that the relator cannot produce such allegations is not attributable to the conduct of the relator.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., Inc., </em>501 F.3d 493, 504 n.12 (6th Cir. 2007); <em>see also Chesbrough v. VPA, P.C., </em>655 F.3d 461, 471 (6th Cir. 2011) (leaving open a similar possibility).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Sixth Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>cuit has recently suggested that \u201ca relator may ... survive a motion to dismiss by pleading specific facts based on her personal billing-related knowledge that support a strong inference that specific false claims were submitted for payment.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Prather v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., </em>838 F.3d 750, 773 (6th Cir. 2016). In doing so, it noted more generally that \u201c[e]very circuit that has applied a heightened standard ... has retreated from such a requirement in cases in which other detailed factual allegations support a strong inference that claims were submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772. Furthermore, it appeared to recognize that in a situation in which \u201cspecific allegations of the defendant\u2019s fraudulent conduct necessarily led to the plausible inference that false claims were presented to the government,\u201d a plaintiff might survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Such allegations; as detailed above, are. present in the instant case. Therefore, we fail to see how our holding can be construed as in conflict with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The standard in the Eleventh Circuit, the originator of the \u201cstrict\u201d pleading standard deriving from <em>Clausen, </em>has itself evolved in the years following that decision into a \u201cnuanced, case-by-case approach, [whereby] other means are available to present the required indicia of reliability that a false claim was actually submitted.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Mastej v. Health Mgmt. Assocs., Inc., </em>591 Fed.Appx. 693, 704 (11th Cir. 2014). Indeed, Chorches\u2019s allegations are analogous to those that the Eleventh Circuit, in yet another case, deeiqed \u201csufficient to explain why [a relator] believed [the defendant] submitted false or fraudulent claims for services rendered by nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Walker v. R&amp;F Properties of Lake Cty., Inc., </em>433 F.3d 1349, 1360 (11th Cir. 2005) (where the relator\u2014unlike <em>Clau-sen\u2019s </em>\u201ccorporate outsider\u201d who made speculative assertions but quite like Fabula\u2014 was a nurse practitioner in the defendant\u2019s employ whose conversation about billing practices with the office manager formed the basis for her belief that claims were actually submitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Finally, \u201calthough [Karvelas] cites <em>Clau-sen </em>and formulates its own strict standard, the facts before it did not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>[First Circuit] to reach the question of whether all complaints alleging [an FCA] presentment claim must include details of specific bills.\u201d <em>Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 187. Moreover, unlike the complaint dismissed in <em>Karvelas, </em>the TAC here contains many of the \u201cdetails\u201d that the First Circuit deemed relevant for purposes of \u201cidentify[ing] particular false claims for payment:\u201d the supervisors involved in the fraudulent scheme, dates for several runs, and both the contents of PCRs for those runs and particular services for which the government was allegedly billed. <em>Karvelas, </em>360 F.3d at 232; <em>see id. </em>at 232-35.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> More recently, in a \u201cqui tam action in which the defendant induced <em>third parties </em>to file false claims,\u201d the First Circuit adopted a \u201cmore flexible standard\u201d such that \u201ca relator could satisfy Rule 9(b) by providing factual or statistical evidence to strengthen the inference of fraud beyond possibility without necessarily providing details as to each false claim.\u201d <em>U.S. ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L.P., </em>579 F.3d 13, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Although Chorches alleges that AMR, and not a third party, submitted the false claims, the third-party rationale is persuasive where, as here, the complaint is \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d in alleging the submission of false claims, and the billing department was effectively a separate entity to ambulance personnel who were barred from accessing it. <em>Hagerty, </em>844 F.3d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">In short, we do not view our interpretation of Rule 9(b) to be in conflict with that of our sister Circuits. Nor do we see our holding as adopting a \u201clenient\u201d pleading standard.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We simply apply the basic rules of Rule 9(b) to a particular set of allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">For that reason, we reject AMR\u2019s citation of our opinion in <em>Ladas </em>as a decision \u201cfrom this Court [that] is not supportive\u201d of Chorches\u2019s position. Appellee\u2019s Br. 51. AMR\u2019s reliance on Ladas\u2014which issued a week after <em>Polansky </em>and did not grapple with the issue of presentment that <em>Polansky </em>identified but ultimately left unresolved<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>\u2014is misplaced. <em>Ladas </em>was an implied false certification case where the relator brought a <em>qui tam </em>claim alleging that certain devices were falsely certified as conforming to the terms of a procure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ment contract with the government. More specifically, he \u201calleged that required forms relating to quality assurance and payment were filed with the U.S. upon shipping, [falsely] certifying that listed items conform to contract.\u201d <em>Ladas, </em>824 F.3d at 26 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis, however, [was] the [complaint\u2019s] only express reference to an allegedly false statement made to the government by defendants in connection with a claim for payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the Court held that the relator\u2019s complaint</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-4\">did not contain plausible allegations of fact that showed, as required for FCA purposes, that any claim for payment submitted by [defendants] was false or that any of the devices delivered to the government failed to meet [contract specifications. [Also, the] district court found that the [complaint] does not include the specifics of any claims submitted....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 27 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the <em>Ladas </em>complaint, unlike the TAC, failed to sufficiently plead <em>the falsity </em>of any submitted claims. Moreover, that decision, like <em>Polansky, </em>did not address whether \u201can FCA relator alleging a fraudulent scheme must provide the details of specific examples of actual false claims presented to the government.\u201d <em>Polansky, </em>822 F.3d at 619. Accordingly, our holding in this case is fully consistent with <em>Ladas.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a3t-dedup-0\">\u2756 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">In conclusion, Rule 9(b) does not require that every <em>qui tam </em>complaint provide details of actual bills or invoices submitted to the government, so long as the relator makes plausible allegations, as Chorches does in the TAC, that lead to a strong inference that specific claims were indeed submitted and that information about the details of the claims submitted are peculiarly within the opposing party\u2019s knowledge. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the <em>qui tam </em>claim asserted in the TAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">II. Fabula Has Adequately Stated a Retaliation Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Fabula argues that the district court erred in holding that the SAC fails to state a claim for retaliation under \u00a7 3730(h) of the FCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">A. The Retaliation Claim Was Not Abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Before addressing the substance of the claim, we must first consider AMR\u2019s threshold argument that Fabula has \u201cwaived or abandoned his retaliation claim by failing to replead it in the TAC.\u201d Appel-lee\u2019s Br. 28. Understanding AMR\u2019s position requires a more detailed account of the procedural history in the district court. The SAC, filed by Fabula, pled both the <em>qui tam </em>and the retaliation claims against AMR.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">In an opinion dated March 4, 2015, the district court held that Fabula lacked standing to bring the <em>qui tam </em>claim, which had become the property of his bankruptcy estate, but stayed dismissal to allow the trustee of the bankruptcy estate to be substituted as plaintiff to bring that claim. As to the retaliation claim, which it concluded Fabula did have standing to pursue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the court held that Fabula \u201chas failed to state a claim for retaliation under the FCA\u201d and it dismissed the claim \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d J.A. 209.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Subsequently, the district court granted trustee Chorches\u2019s motion to join the case as a plaintiff for purposes of asserting the <em>qui tam </em>claim on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, and, on April 3, 2015, issued a text order \u201callow[ing] Plaintiffs the opportunity to amend <em>both </em>counts of the second amended complaint.\u201d J.A. 10 (emphasis added). However, the TAC, which was filed by Chorches\u2014and whose caption lists Chorches as the sole \u201c[pjlaintiff,\u201d \u201c[biring-ing this action on behalf of\u2019 the U.S., Fabula\u2019s estate, and Fabula (who retains a residual interest in his estate)\u2014pled only the <em>qui tam </em>claim. J.A. 330. Fabula did not file an amended version of his retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">AMR does not dispute that the retaliation claim, which arose several months after Fabula\u2019s bankruptcy case had been closed, belongs to Fabula individually and not, like the <em>qui tam </em>claim, -to his bankruptcy estate. Rather, AMR contends, as it did below in support of its motion to dismiss the TAC, that the district court\u2019s April 2015 text order giving plaintiffs the opportunity to replead both counts modified its March 2015 with-prejudice dismissal of the retaliation claim, and that Fabu-la\u2019s failure to replead his retaliation claim in the TAC thus renders that claim abandoned. Although the district court did not address the issue of abandonment in its November 6, 2015 decision dismissing the TAC, it held that \u201c[bjecause Chorches makes no attempt [in the TAC] to replead the retaliation claim, that claim is dismissed with prejudice.\u201d J.A. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">This Court has previously noted that \u201c[a] dismissal with leave to amend is ordinarily a non-appealable order, but an appeal may be pursued where the plaintiff disclaims any intention to amend or where ... the district court sets a deadline for amending and the plaintiff does not amend within the deadline.\u201d <em>Salmon v. Blesser, </em>802 F.3d 249, 252 n.2 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). Therefore, even assuming that the district court\u2019s April 2015 text order retroactively made its earlier dismissal of the retaliation claim .a non-final order that is not ordinarily appealable, by neither joining Chorches in the TAC nor repleading the retaliation claim in a separate amended complaint of his own, Fabula rendered that \u201cnon-final order \u2018final\u2019 and appealable,\u201d <em>Slayton v. Am. Exp. Co., </em>460 F.3d 215, 224 (2d Cir. 2006), subject to appeal after a final judgment was entered in the case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, the filing by Chorches of the TAC, which pleads the <em>qui </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>tarn </em>claim and undoubtedly superseded the SAC with respect to <em>that </em>claim, did not constitute an abandonment by Fabula of his entirely separate claim of retaliation against AMR. If Fabula believed that his retaliation claim was adequately pled in the SAC, he was fully entitled to stand on the allegations of the SAC, and to appeal the dismissal of that claim (when a final judgment was entered in the case), rather than to attempt to replead his retaliation claim to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">B. Fabula Adequately Pled That He Engaged in Protected Activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The FCA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF1\">[a]ny employee ... shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee ... whole, if that employee ... is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee ... in furtherance of an action under this section or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of [the FCA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h)(1). The particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) does not apply to retaliation claims under the FCA. <em>See Weslowski v. Zugibe, </em>626 Fed.Appx. 20, 20 (2d Cir. 2015) (in reviewing the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of a \u00a7 3730(h) claim, stating, without mentioning Rule 9(b), that the complaint is to be construed \u201cliberally\u201d in accordance with <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal); accord, Smith v. Clark/Smoot/Russell, </em>796 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir. 2015) (stating that FCA retaliation claims \u201cneed pass only [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 8(a)\u2019s relatively low notice-pleadings muster\u2014in contrast to Rule 9(b)\u2019s specificity requirements\u201d); <em>Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>521 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2008); <em>U.S. ex rel. Williams v. Martin-Baker Aircraft Co., </em>389 F.3d 1251, 1259 (D.C. Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Although \u201c[t]his Court has yet to articulate a test for deciding when a plaintiff has set forth a claim for retaliation under section 3730(h),\u201d <em>Weslowski, </em>626 Fed.Appx. at 22, district courts in this Circuit, as well as our sister circuits, have generally required a plaintiff to show that (1) he engaged in activity protected under the statute, (2) the employer was aware of such activity, and (3) the employer took adverse action against him because he engaged in the protected activity.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In its March 2015 decision dismissing Fabula\u2019s retaliation claim, the district court considered only the first of the three elements outlined above and held that Fabula\u2019s \u201cmere refusal to complete the PCR, without other affirmative acts to stop the alleged fraud, is not protected activity.\u201d J.A. 207. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">As relevant to Fabula\u2019s claim, \u00a7 3730(h) protects \u201clawful acts done by the employee ... in furtherance of ... efforts to stop 1 or more violations of [the FCA].\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h)(1); <em>see also Townsend v. Bayer Corp., </em>774 F.3d 446, 459 (8th Cir. 2014). AMR does not contest that Fabula\u2019s refusal to falsify the PCR was a lawful act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It argues, rather, that Fabula\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>fusal does not, -without more, qualify as an effort to stop a fraudulent scheme. Based on the plain language of the FCA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, we hold that Fabula\u2019s refusal to engage in the fraudulent scheme, which under the facts as pled was intended and reasonably could be expected to prevent the submission of a false claim to the government, can constitute protected activity under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">As alleged, Fabula\u2019s \u201crefusfel] to falsify the PCR as demanded by\u201d his AMR supervisor, SAC \u00b6 135, was plainly in furtherance of an effort to stop an FCA violation. To the extent AMR contends that Fabula\u2019s refusal does not rise to the level of an affirmative act, and so cannot constitute an \u201ceffort,\u201d that argument is refuted by the plain language of the statute. Consistent with the word\u2019s everyday use, Webster\u2019s relevantly defines \u201ceffort\u201d as a \u201cconscious exertion of physical or mental power.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (2002) (\u201cWebster\u2019s\u201d). Fabula did not simply omit, fail, or neglect to fill out the December 2011 PCR after being instructed to do so\u2014he verbally refused to alter the document as requested by AMR and, despite AMR^s threat of termination, failed to subsequently \u201carrange a time for reconciliation and transmission of\u2019 that PCR. SAC \u00b6 79.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Nor is this a case of an employee simply declining to play a role in a corrupt scheme engaged in by his fellows. It may well be a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 3730(h)(1) to hold that a doctor whose colleagues in a hospital or medical practice submit inflated Medicare claims for their own services does not engage in protected activity when she merely declines to submit inflated bills herself, while making no effort either to prevent others from doing so or to report their corruption. But that hypothetical\u2014on which we express no final view\u2014is not this case. While refusing to falsify a single PCR could not have put the brakes on AMR\u2019s fraudulent scheme as a whole, on the facts as pled, Fabula had reason to believe that his refusal to alter the December 2011 PCR\u2014which paramedic Bodiford had refused to alter, leaving only Fabula (who was called in during sick leave for the precise purpose of altering the document) with the credentials to falsify it<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>\u2014would make it difficult, or even impossible, for AMR to file a false claim for that particular run, thus preventing or hindering at least <em>one </em>violation of the FCA. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s (in relevant part, defining \u201cstop\u201d as \u201cto hinder or prevent the passage of,\u201d \u201cto get in the way of,\u201d \u201cto interrupt or prevent the continuance or occurrence of,\u201d and \u201cto arrest the progress or motion of\u2019).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, Fabula\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>falsify the December 2011 PCR so as to hinder the filing of a fraudulent claim in violation of the FCA constitutes protected activity under \u00a7 3730(h).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Our conclusion, which is rooted in the plain text of the statute, is bolstered by the anti-retaliation provision\u2019s drafting history as well as relevant policy considerations. Prior to 2009, \u00a7 3730(h) provided a non-exclusive list of specific \u201clawful acts\u201d done in furtherance of an FCA action that protected an employee, and it did not include the \u201cother efforts to stop ... violations\u201d language that is now part of the statute. That version read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">Any employee who is discharged, [etc.] ... by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h) (2006). Thus, the 2009 amendment had the effect of broadening the universe of protected conduct under \u00a7 3730(h), at least with respect to \u201cefforts to stop\u201d FCA violations.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At least one of the authors of the amendment, Congressman Howard L. Berman, contended that \u00a7 3730(h) was amended \u201cso that it is clear that it covers ... retaliation against not only those who actually file a qui tam action, but also against those who plan to file a qui tam that never gets filed, who blow the whistle internally or externally without the filing of a qui tam action, or <em>who refuse to participate in the wrongdoing.\u201d </em>155 Cong. Rec. E1295-03, 2009 WL 1544226, at *E1300 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Furthermore, interpreting the anti-retaliation provision to draw an arbitrary boundary between efforts that take the form of \u201cinternal reporting to a supervisor or company compliance department\u201d and those that amount to \u201crefusals to participate in the misconduct that leads to the false claims,\u201d <em>id., </em>would make little policy sense. There is, at best, a hair\u2019s-breadth distinction between complaining internally that a practice is illegal under the FCA and advising a supervisor of one\u2019s refusal to engage in that illegal practice. The facts alleged in this case exemplify that point. Fabula, who admits to having falsified numerous PCRs during his employment with AMR, had been told by his supervisors that PCRs were altered in order to render otherwise non-reimbursable runs reimbursable by the government. Under such circumstances, Fabula\u2019s email and oral re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>fusals to falsify the December 2011 PCR, and his statement to a supervisor who, according to the complaints, was involved in AMR\u2019s fraudulent scheme that he did not \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d making the alterations, SAC \u00b6 135, are functionally equivalent to raising the issue internally. Any line-drawing between the two, so as to qualify one but not the other as protected activity under \u00a7 3730(h), would raise concerns about arbitrariness and encourage the adoption of opaque or burdensome reporting mechanisms that would help FCA violators avoid liability. We therefore decline to interpret the FCA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision to exclude Fabula\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">The district court, whose analysis AMR repeats on appeal, concluded that because Fabula\u2019s action did not take the form of \u201ccomplaints to his employer\u2019s management or in-house counsel, reports to the media, or a reasoned explanation to his supervisors that what they were asking him to do violated the law and should cease,\u201d it did not constitute \u201can \u2018effort\u2019 to \u2018stop\u2019 .., \u2018[one] or more violations\u2019 of the FCA.\u201d J.A. 206 (alterations in original).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> But that con-elusion both ignores the plain language of the FCA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision\u2014 which does not require any of those particular steps but broadly protects efforts to stop even a single violation of the FCA\u2014 and undermines, as a practical matter, its capacity to protect persons who assist in the discovery and prosecution of FCA violations.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">While further factual development may well fail to validate Fabula\u2019s claim of retaliation, we must construe the allegations of the complaint in his favor at the pleading stage. We conclude that, on the facts alleged, Fabula has adequately pled that his refusal to alter the December 2011 PCR satisfies the \u201cprotected activity\u201d element of \u00a7 3730(h). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the retaliation claim asserted in the SAC.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\">. Although the TAC alleges that AMR made false statements and submitted false claims for reimbursement under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the complaint details the scheipe primarily vis-\u00e1-vis Medicare. For convenience, we refer only to Medicare in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-5\">. In addition to PCRs, the TAC alleges that AMR also falsified Physician Certification Statements (\u201cPCSs\u2019\u2019), forms completed by physicians or registered nurses pursuant to Medicare regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b965-8\">. On an earlier occasion, Fabula had been suspended for a day for not completing three PCRs in the manner specified by supervisors, and was ultimately required to complete the forms with information provided to him by AMR in order to be allowed to return to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b967-12\">. \"When a person brings an action under [\u00a7 3730], no person other than the Govemment may intervene or bring a related action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>based on the facts underlying the pending action.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b968-6\">. We retain discretion, of course, to consider arguments that are raised for the first time on appeal, where such consideration is in the interest of justice. <em>See Gibeau v. Nellis, </em>18 F.3d 107, 109 (2d Cir. 1994). No such injustice is apparent here, however. The public disclosure bar is intended to confine the right to bring <em>qui tam </em>actions to those who bring frauds against the public treasury to the attention of the government and the courts; no public purpose is served by allowing opportunistic outsiders to file suit based on allegations of fraud that have already been publicized in lawsuits by others. In this case, however, Chorches brings the <em>qui tam </em>claim not for his personal benefit but in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>capacity as the trustee of Fabula's bankruptcy estate, which in turn is the successor in interest to Fabula\u2019s pre-petition claims. His claim is thus simply the continuation of claims originally brought by Fabula, who made allegations of fraud not previously disclosed by anyone else. If the suit is successful, moreover, Fabqla will personally benefit, not only by having the moral satisfaction of seeing his debts repaid but also, if Chorches recovers an amount that exceeds the creditor's claims against the bankruptcy estate, by receiving any residual amount in the estate. We express no view as to whether, under these circumstances, the public disclosure bar should be held applicable if objection had been properly raised in the district court. We are confident, however, that no injustice results from permitting the trustee to proceed in these circumstances when the defendant failed to preserve the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b969-14\">. The district court dismissed the claim because of Chorches\u2019s failure to sufficiently plead the submission of a false claim. On appeal, AMR does not argue that any other element necessary for <em>qui tam </em>liability is lacking. Thus, we need not parse the other elements of either subsection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">. The \"garage\u201d was AMR\u2019s office in New Haven, Connecticut where trucks and ambulances were kept when not in use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b970-10\">, The TAC appears to identify only one managerial employee who both directed the falsification of PCRs and was later promoted to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>position overseeing the billing quality control unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b972-7\">. We note that it is easy to imagine innocent explanations for at least some of the alterations identified in the TAC. It is not a crime for a medical service provider to endeavor to make sure that its personnel omit no fact about a case that would legitimately render a particular service reimbursable by the patient\u2019s (governmental or private) insurer. Some such facts (such as those about a patient's history) might not be known by the ambulance personnel responsible for a particular run; other facts might be inadvertently omitted in field-generated reports because their significance to the billing process was not appreciated by an EMT or a paramedic whose principal concern was the immediate health and safety of the patient. Thus, whether discovery will support or refute the TAC\u2019s allegations cannot be known at this time. Nevertheless, the TAC directly and specifically alleges that at least some of the facts that Fabula was asked to insert were flatly false, and that other facts about the patient's history, while perhaps literally true, did not provide an accurate reason for the run and were thus misleading. We must assume for present purposes that those allegations are true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b973-5\">. The TAC alleges that between 40% and 70% of AMR\u2019s business in New Haven during the period in question involved Medicare or Medicaid patients. This suggests that any systematic scheme for documenting fabricated medical necessity for ambulance services would indeed reach the governmental insurers. More fundamentally, regardless of the likelihood that any particular run would be billed to Medicare, the key issue is the likelihood that a run <em>associated with a falsified PCR </em>was billed to the government. The supervisors who asked Fabula to falsify PCRs specifically referenced Medicare, suggesting that the falsification of records may have been particularly necessary to secure reimbursement from federal insurance programs.

Unlike Fabula's detailed allegations regarding AMR's scheme to defraud the government, the plaintiff in <em>Thomas </em>failed to establish\u2014post discovery, for purposes of summary judgment\u2014that she had engaged in protected activity because, among other reasons, she \"had no knowledge which of her students were receiving federal funds to attend ITT, ... what effect a failing grade would have on a student\u2019s federal loans, or how many failing grades a student had to receive to lose federal loans,\u201d \"was only aware of four grades that were changed, and those grades were changed after ITT terminated her,\u201d and \"did not submit evidence that ITT forced her to change grades.\u201d 517 Fed.Appx. at 263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b986-12\">.
