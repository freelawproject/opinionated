They appeal from judgments convicting them of receiving, possessing and selling food fish out of season. ORS 509.011(2)(a); 506.991(3). They assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for judgments of acquittal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Defendants\u2019 primary argument is that the state may not enforce its fishing laws against treaty Indians without alleging and proving a conservation necessity for doing so. We have recently held that the state may not convict a treaty Indian of taking fish out of season or of selling a game animal on ceded land without proving a conservation necessity for imposing the state\u2019s laws in an area which is subject to tribal control. It does not matter whether the Indians\u2019 actions were legal under tribal law; the treaty rights foreclosed the state from acting. <em>State v. Jim (Bruce), </em>81 Or App 189, 725 P2d 372 (1986); <em>State v. Jim (Warner), </em>81 Or App 177, 725 P2d 365 (1986). The state did not prove a conservation necessity in this case. The court should have granted the motions for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b550-7\">YOUNG, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aot\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">I dissent, because I am generally in agreement with the concurrence of Rossman, J., in <em>State v.
