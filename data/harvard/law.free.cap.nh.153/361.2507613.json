On July 14, 2004, the defendant attended a hearing at Rockingham County Superior Court. The hearing involved a motion filed by the defendant seeking the return of her personal property from a former boyfriend. This was the defendant\u2019s third hearing on that motion. The defendant\u2019s attorney, Kathleen Sternenberg, and the opposing attorney, Laura Gandia, were also present. After the hearing, Gandia, Sternenberg and the defendant exited the courtroom together. Gandia informed Sternenberg that her client was unlikely to comply with the trial court\u2019s order to return the defendant\u2019s property because he was on vacation in Florida. Gandia testified that the defendant then looked at her, said, \u201c[H]e\u2019s not in Florida,\u201d and pushed Gandia on her left shoulder with enough force to move her body backwards. The defendant testified that she poked Gandia with her finger on her shoulder \u201c[t]o get her attention\u201d and \u201clet her know that she was lying ... about where her client was.\u201d Gandia then said to Sternenberg, \u201c[D]id you see what happened? She just pushed me.\u201d At that point, a bailiff approached to investigate the commotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The defendant was charged with one count of simple assault. <em>See </em>RSA 631:2-a, 1(a). The complaint alleged that the defendant \u201cknowingly eause[d] unprivileged physical contact to Laura Gandia by knowingly pushing her.\u201d Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court denied the motion and, after trial, convicted the defendant of one count of simple assault. This appeal followed. <em>See </em>RSA 599:l-c, II (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that: (1) RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) is unconstitutionally vague; and (2) insufficient evidence supports her conviction. Although the State does not challenge the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s brief on appeal, the special concurrence concludes that we should not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims because it believes that she insufficiently briefed both of her arguments. We recognize that we may address the inadequacy of a party\u2019s argument on appeal even when the issue is not raised by the opposing party. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16(3), (6); <em>cf. Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004). We should not normally do so, however, where the argument is discernable and briefing inadequacies do not hinder or otherwise interfere with our review of the appeal. <em>Cf. </em>5 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Appellate Review </em>\u00a7 578 (1995) (\u201cCourts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>least likely to dismiss an appeal or impose other sanctions when briefing errors do not hamper the ability to dispose of the appeal or otherwise interfere with their review. Courts prefer to dispose of a case on the merits rather than to dismiss for deficiencies in a <em>brief____In a criminal case, the appellate courts will address discemable issues on the </em>merits.\u201d (emphasis added)); 5 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Appellate Review </em>\u00a7 867 (\u201cSubstantial compliance with the rules of appellate procedure ... may be found sufficient to avoid dismissal of an appeal and allow the court to address the merits, at least where the moving party has suffered no prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">As to the vagueness issue, because the defendant failed to \u201cunambiguously and specifically\u201d invoke any provision of the New Hampshire Constitution in her brief, we address her vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution only. <em>See Appeal of Morgan, </em>144 N.H. 44, 46-47 (1999). The special concurrence would not even address this claim under the Federal Constitution because it argues that the defendant\u2019s brief \u201cis devoid of any reference to the Federal Constitution, and she cites no federal cases in support of her argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">We have never held that a party\u2019s failure to include a citation to a specific provision of the Federal Constitution precludes appellate review. In fact, in <em>State v. Goding, </em>128 N.H. 267, 270 (1986), we reviewed a due process claim on appeal even though the defendant characterized it as a double jeopardy issue at trial. Here, the defendant\u2019s six-page argument clearly contends that the term \u201cunprivileged\u201d is \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d A citation to the Federal Due Process Clause adds nothing to our understanding of her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Moreover, although the defendant cites no specific constitutional provision, she does cite statutory and case law. The defendant relies on cases decided under our State Constitution and such reliance is appropriate \u201cbecause the Federal Constitution affords no greater protection than the State Constitution with regard to whether a statute is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>State v. Porelle, </em>149 N.H. 420, 423 (2003). She goes on in her brief to rely on the Model Penal Code and comparable statutes in other States. Thus, this is hardly a case where \u201coff-hand invocations of [constitutional rights] are supported by neither argument nor by authority.\u201d <em>Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 499 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">As to the defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim, the special concurrence would hold that the defendant did not adequately argue the issue because \u201c[t]he single paragraph in her brief devoted to this argument is merely an extension of her first argument that the statute is vague because it leads to absurd results.\u201d In her brief, the defendant\u2019s one and a quarter-page argument begins by claiming that \u201c[w]hatever the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>definition of unprivileged physical contact, the conduct at issue in this case should not be included.\u201d The defendant notes that the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State and argues that the conduct here as a matter of law should not fall within \u201cthe definition of unprivileged physical conduct.\u201d While we agree that the defendant incorporates her first argument into her second, she clearly raises a separate sufficiency of the evidence claim that we will address on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law. <em>State v. Bortner, </em>150 N.H. 504, 510 (2004). We therefore review the trial court\u2019s determination <em>de novo. </em>A statute \u201cmay be impermissibly vague because it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests.\u201d <em>Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 52 (1999). \u201cVagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. \u201cFirst, if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits.\u201d <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000). \u201cSecond, if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of simple assault if he ... [pjurposely or knowingly causes bodily injury or unprivileged physical contact to another.\u201d The defendant first contends that this language is unclear because neither the statute nor our ease law defines \u201cunprivileged physical contact.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u201cUnprivileged\u201d means a \u201clack of privilege.\u201d <em>See In re Nathan L., </em>146 N.H. 614, 621 (2001). Privilege is defined as \u201ca right or immunity granted as a peculiar benefit, advantage, or favor.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1805 (unabridged ed. 2002). Privilege can serve as \u201c[a]n affirmative defense by which a defendant acknowledges at least part of the conduct complained of but asserts that the defendant\u2019s conduct was authorized or sanctioned by law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1235 (8th ed. 2004). Accordingly, the plain meaning of \u201cunprivileged physical contact\u201d includes all physical contact not justified by law or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The defendant argues that a broad interpretation of RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) encourages arbitrary enforcement. The defendant hypothesizes that if we interpret the statute to forbid all physical contact not authorized by law or consent, even \u201cslapping on the back as a form of greeting\u201d could be criminalized. The State asserts that the statute\u2019s scienter requirement guards against the threat of arbitrary enforcement. Although we agree that the scienter requirement narrows the scope of conduct that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>statute proscribes, <em>see Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 732, that requirement by itself does not necessarily prevent arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">A statute encourages arbitrary enforcement where it promotes application on an <em>\u201cad hoc </em>and subjective basis.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 109 (1972). For example, in <em>Morales, </em>a plurality of the Court found that an ordinance which defined loiter as \u201cto remain in any one place with no apparent purpose\u201d encouraged arbitrary enforcement because it did \u201cnot provide sufficiently specific limits on the enforcement discretion of the police.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>527 U.S. at 56, 64 (plurality opinion). Unlike the ordinance in <em>Morales, </em>however, RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) does not relieve law enforcement of the burden to clearly articulate some form of \u201cunprivileged physical contact\u201d in order to allege a violation of the statute. Instead, the police must show that the contact at issue was not justified by law or consent. Like other criminal statutes, the enforcement of RSA 631-2:a, 1(a) \u201crequires the exercise of some degree of police judgment.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 733. We conclude that our construction of RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) adequately limits police discretion so as to make it unlikely that the law will be applied in an <em>\u201cad hoc </em>and subjective\u201d manner. <em>Cf. Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 733; <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant further asserts that a \u201cstrict plain meaning analysis\u201d of \u201cunprivileged physical contact\u201d yields a \u201cpatently absurd result.\u201d Specifically, the defendant hypothesizes that the plain meaning of the statute criminalizes tapping another on the shoulder \u201cunless one asks for permission to touch the other\u2019s shoulder first.\u201d We find this argument unpersuasive. First, the defendant overlooks the general principle that consent may be express or implied. <em>See Fischer v. Hooper, </em>143 N.H. 585, 597-98 (1999). Second, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that a statute\u2019s proscription of a broad category of conduct, alone, renders it unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that insufficient evidence supports her conviction under RSA 631:2-a, 1(a). \u201cIn an appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant carries the burden of proving that no rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Emery, </em>152 N.H. 783, 788 (2005) (quotation omitted). The defendant, however, concedes that she engaged in physical contact with Gand\u00eda. Moreover, the record contains testimony that the defendant acted knowingly and that her conduct was not justified by law or consent. Therefore, we find that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant committed simple assault under RSA 631:2-a, 1(a) by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201cknowingly causing] unprivileged physical contact to [Gandia] by knowingly pushing her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred; Broderick, C.J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b414-7\">Broderick, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMd\">concurring specially. I agree with the affirmance in this case. I write separately, however, simply because I would not reach either of the issues addressed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Prior to trial, the defendant, Cathy Burke, unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the complaint against her \u201cbased on the Constitutional doctrine of vagueness and overbreadth.\u201d Specifically, she argued: \u201cI believe that [RSA 631:2-a, 1(a)] is unconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad, and should be found that way and thus is a violation of due process, since that right is guaranteed by both the State and Federal Constitutions.\u201d The defendant\u2019s notice of appeal claims that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss, \u201cbased on the argument that the [statute] is unconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad.\u201d The majority refuses, and I agree with that refusal, to address the defendant\u2019s claim within the context of our State Constitution because she failed to unambiguously and specifically invoke any provision of the New Hampshire Constitution in her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The majority does, however, proceed to address the defendant\u2019s argument under the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution. Given the state of the defendant\u2019s brief, I would additionally choose not to address her claim of error within the context of our Federal Constitution. <em>Compare, e.g., Appeal of Morgan, </em>144 N.H. 44, 46-47 (1999) (where petitioner cited State and Federal Constitutions below, but failed to unambiguously and specifically raise vagueness issue grounded in due process provision of State Constitution, we addressed only federal claim), <em>with State v. Burr, </em>142 N.H. 89, 91-92 (1997) (where defendant\u2019s brief advanced argument under both State and Federal Constitutions, but failed to further devote anything more than passing reference to Federal Constitution, federal claims waived and discussion of argument limited to State Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The defendant\u2019s brief is devoid of any reference to the Federal Constitution, and she cites no federal cases in support of her argument. Of the seven New Hampshire cases cited in her brief, only two concern statutory vagueness, and, in those two cases, we addressed the vagueness issue only under our State Constitution, <em>see State v. Saucier, </em>128 N.H. 291, 296-97 (1986); <em>State v. Glidden, </em>122 N.H. 41, 45-47 (1982). I would choose not to employ a more lenient standard in deciding whether to reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>defendant\u2019s argument under the Federal Constitution in this case. <em>See, e.g., State v. Chick, </em>141 N.H. 503, 504 (1996) (although defendant\u2019s brief claimed violation of right to due process under Part I, Article 15 of State Constitution, and Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to Federal Constitution, claim waived where brief failed to further elaborate on argument; passing reference to due process, without more, not substitute for valid constitutional argument); <em>see also State v. McIntyre, </em>151 N.H. 465, 469 (2004) (declining to address arguments concerning due process rights under State and Federal Constitutions when not adequately briefed); <em>State v. Schultz, </em>141 N.H. 101, 104 (1996) (same); <em>Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 499 (1988) (off-hand invocations of constitutional rights supported by neither argument nor authority warrant no extended consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">In addition, I would not give the defendant credit for adequately arguing that the evidence to support her conviction was insufficient. The single paragraph in her brief devoted to this argument is merely an extension of her first argument that the statute is vague because it leads to absurd results. <em>See e.g., State v. Blackmer, </em>149 N.H. 47, 49 (2003) (complaint without developed legal argument insufficient to warrant judicial review).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
