The issue presented is whether a subcontractor\u2019s commercial general liability (CGL) policy provides coverage for indemnification to a general contractor for a claim brought by the subcontractor\u2019s employee against the general contractor. The superior court ruled that the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims were covered by the subcontractor\u2019s policy. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The record reflects the following facts. The general contractor hired as a subcontractor defendant Daniel Hardy d/b/a Flawless Finishes (subcontractor). On September 30,2003, an employee of the subcontractor was injured in the course of his employment at the general contractor\u2019s worksite. At the time the employee was injured, the subcontractor did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. The employee was thus not precluded from bringing a common law action against the subcontractor. RSA 281-A:7, IV (1999). The employee subsequently brought a negligence action against both the subcontractor and the general contractor, and the employee also sued the general contractor for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>See </em>RSA281-A:18 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The general contractor then brought cross-claims against the subcontractor. While it did not seek indemnification for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits owed to the employee, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:18, it sought indemnity for its liability in the event that the employee prevails in his negligence action against the general contractor. Neither liability nor damages have been determined in the employee\u2019s underlying negligence action against the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">At the time of the employee\u2019s injury, the subcontractor carried a CGL policy with Merchants Mutual. The subcontractor sought coverage of the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims from Merchants Mutual under this policy. Merchants Mutual denied coverage. Merchants Mutual then brought a petition for declaratory judgment against the subcontractor and the general contractor, seeking a determination that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify the subcontractor against the general contractor\u2019s claims. The subcontractor failed to appear and was defaulted. Merchants Mutual and the general contractor filed cross-motions for summary judgment, agreeing that there were no facts in dispute. The trial court granted summary judgment to the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>D'Amour v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>153 N.H. 170, 171 (2006). The facts before us are uncontested and we review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">The interpretation of the language of an insurance policy, like any contract language, is ultimately an issue for the court to decide. <em>Id. </em>We construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72. We enforce a policy provision that limits the insurance company\u2019s liability when the policy language is clear and unambiguous. <em>See Deyette v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>142 N.H. 560, 561 (1997). If more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer. <em>Catholic Med. Ctr. v. Executive Risk Indem., </em>151 N.H. 699, 701 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The Merchants Mutual CGL policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d ... to which this insurance applies____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">d----Any obligation of the insured under a workers\u2019 compensation, disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">e____\u201cBodily injury\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">(1) An \u201cemployee\u201d of the insured arising out of and in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">(a) Employment by the insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-14\">This exclusion applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">(1) Whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>(2) To any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">CGL policies typically include both a workers\u2019 compensation exclusion and an employer\u2019s liability exclusion. <em>See </em>9A L.R. RUSS &amp; T.F. SEGALLA, Couch on Insurance, \u00a7 129:10, at 129-23, \u00a7 129:11, at 129-25 (3d ed. 2005); <em>see also American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tickle, </em>99 S.W.3d 25, 29 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003). A workers\u2019 compensation exclusion \u201cexpressly excludes coverage for any obligation of the insured under a workers\u2019 compensation law or any similar law.\u201d 9A RUSS <em>&amp; </em>SEGALLA, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 129:10, at 129-23. The employer\u2019s liability exclusion \u201cexempts coverage for bodily injury to an employee arising out of and in the course of employment by the insured or during the performance of duties relating to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business.\u201d 9A RUSS SEGALLA, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 129:11, at 129-25. In the Merchants Mutual CGL policy, exclusion \u201cd\u201d is a workers\u2019 compensation exclusion and exclusion \u201ce\u201d is an employer\u2019s liability exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On appeal, Merchants Mutual argues that the trial court erred in two respects: (1) by misinterpreting <em>Royal Globe Insurance Co. v. Poirier, </em>120 N.H. 422, 428 (1980), in ruling that exclusion \u201ce\u201d did not apply to the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims against the subcontractor; and (2) by holding that exclusion \u201ce\u201d did not clearly and unambiguously apply to the general contractor\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We begin by reviewing <em>Poirier. </em>In <em>Poirier, </em>the Nashua School District hired a subcontractor to restore a building. <em>Poirier, </em>120 N.H. at 424. An employee of the subcontractor was fatally injured during the restoration. <em>Id. </em>The subcontractor carried workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability (WCEL) insurance, as well as CGL insurance. <em>Id. </em>The employee\u2019s estate received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but brought a separate action against the Nashua School District for damages arising out of the employee\u2019s death that were not compensable under workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <em>Id. </em>The Nashua School District instituted a third-party action against the subcontractor for indemnification for all damages that it may have owed the employee. <em>Id. </em>The insurer then brought a declaratory judgment action to determine its obligation to indemnify the subcontractor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Under the terms of the CGL policy in <em>Poirier, </em>the insurer agreed \u201cto pay on behalf of [the subcontractor] all sums which he should become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury to which the insurance applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. However, the CGL policy contained exclusion \u201cj,\u201d which excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>insured or to any obligation of the insured to indemnify another because of damages arising out of such injury.\u201d <em>Id. Poirier </em>does not indicate whether the CGL policy contained a separate workers\u2019 compensation exclusion for claims compensable under workers\u2019 compensation insurance similar to exclusion \u201cd\u201d in Merchants Mutual\u2019s CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\">In determining whether exclusion \u201cj\u201d applied to the Nashua School District\u2019s indemnity claims, <em>Poirier </em>recognized that \u201c[t]he objective of [exclusion \u2018j\u2019] is to avoid duplication of coverage with respect to the subject matters covered by a standard [WCEL] Policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). <em>Poirier, </em>however, went on to say, \u201c[W]e do not find that the language of exclusion \u2018j\u2019 effectively conveys to a reasonable person in the position of the insured that in an indemnity action all damages, whether or not covered by workmen\u2019s compensation, are excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. Thus, <em>Poirier </em>concluded that \u201cexclusion \u2018j\u2019 does no more than exclude from liability coverage those damages that are compensable under a workmen\u2019s compensation policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, <em>Poirier </em>required the insurer to indemnify under the CGL policy the \u201cmany damages claimed against the [Nashua School District] ... not covered under the workmen\u2019s compensation policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The trial court in this case reviewed <em>Poirier </em>and identified exclusion \u201cj\u201d in the <em>Poirier </em>policy as an employer\u2019s liability exclusion. In its order it stated that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Poirier </em>is that an employer\u2019s liability exclusion is ineffective against a third party indemnity claim.\u201d Relying upon its interpretation of <em>Poirier, </em>it concluded that because exclusion \u201ce\u201d in Merchants Mutual\u2019s policy is an employer\u2019s liability exclusion, it is ineffective against the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims. The trial court thus required Merchants Mutual to indemnify the general contractor under the terms of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">On appeal, Merchants Mutual argues that the trial court misinterpreted <em>Poiri,er. </em>While it does not ask us to overrule <em>Poirier, </em>it urges us to recognize that \u201cthe core holding in <em>Poirier </em>[is] that a CGL Policy and [WCEL] Policy serve distinct purposes with respect to coverage.\u201d Accordingly, Merchants Mutual contends that a claim which is compensable under a WCEL policy cannot also be covered under a CGL policy. Merchants Mutual argues that the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims in this case were the type of claims that were compensable under the employer\u2019s liability section of a standard WCEL policy. It argues that, under <em>Poirier, </em>we must conclude that these claims cannot be covered by CGL insurance since they were compensable under WCEL insurance. Merchants Mutual asserts that the subcontractor\u2019s failure to procure employer\u2019s liability insurance does not affect the applicability of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion, because the \u201cfact that [the subcontractor] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>did not procure [WCEL] coverage does not, and cannot, transfer the obligation from a [WCEL] policy to a CGL policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">By contrast, the general contractor argues that <em>Poirier </em>held that the language of exclusion \u201cj\u201d was ineffective to exclude the Nashua School District\u2019s third party indemnity claims. It contends that, because the facts in this case are indistinguishable from the facts in <em>Poirier </em>and the language of exclusion \u201ce\u201d in the Merchants Mutual CGL policy is substantively identical to the language of exclusion \u201cj\u201d in <em>Poirier, Poirier </em>\u201cdictates the outcome of this case.\u201d It argues that we must therefore conclude that exclusion \u201ce\u201d is ineffective against the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims and that Merchants Mutual must provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We disagree with the general contractor that it is clear from the <em>Poirier </em>opinion that <em>Poirier </em>squarely controls the outcome in this case. As the Fifth Circuit noted in a factually similar case, \u201c[i]n <em>Poirier, </em>it is uncertain whether the applicable policy also contained an express exclusion discharging the insurer from coverage of workers\u2019 compensation claims, similar to the [workers\u2019 compensation exclusion] of the [applicable CGL] policy.\u201d <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Kasler Corp., </em>906 F.2d 196, 199 n.2 (5th Cir. 1990). It thus found <em>Poirier </em>\u201c[not] controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200. Similarly, the Eighth Circuit relied upon <em>Easier </em>and found <em>Poirier </em>\u201c[not] controlling.\u201d <em>Pearson Services Inc. v. INA Ins. Co., </em>937 F.2d 401, 404 (8th Cir., 1991). The assumption underlying both <em>Easier </em>and <em>Pearson </em>is that, if the CGL policy in <em>Poirier </em>contained only exclusion \u201cj\u201d and no separate workers\u2019 compensation exclusion, this would explain why <em>Poirier </em>held that exclusion \u201cj\u201d was simply a workers\u2019 compensation exclusion and why <em>Poirier </em>concluded that the language of exclusion \u201cj\u201d was ambiguous. We agree with <em>Easier </em>and <em>Pearson </em>that <em>Poirier </em>is unclear, and thus disagree with the general contractor\u2019s assertion that <em>Poirier </em>squarely controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Given the uncertainty about the applicability of <em>Poirier </em>to the facts before it, <em>Easier </em>considered the plain language of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion in the CGL policy. <em>Kasler, </em>906 F.2d at 199-200. <em>Easier </em>determined that the employer\u2019s liability exclusion \u201cunambiguously discharges [the insurer] from its obligation to defend ... in third-party indemnification suits where ... the genesis of the action is an employee\u2019s work-related bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like <em>Easier, Pearson </em>considered the plain language of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion and held that it \u201cis unambiguous and ... excludes coverage for an indemnification claim that is based on damages arising out of an employee\u2019s work-related injury.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>937 F.2d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">More fundamentally, by finding that the employer\u2019s liability exclusion unambiguously excludes third-party indemnity claims, <em>Easier </em>and <em>Pearson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>strongly suggest that they would not follow <em>Poirier\u2019s </em>conclusion that the language of exclusion \u201cj\u201d did not clearly and unambiguously apply to third-party indemnity claims for bodily injury arising out of and in the course of employment. We need not, however, determine whether <em>Poirier </em>was wrongly decided. Suffice it to say that the CGL policy before us clearly contains two separate exclusions, neither of which is ambiguous. We thus agree with <em>Kasler </em>and <em>Pearson </em>and follow their analysis by examining the plain language of exclusion \u201ce\u201d in the Merchants Mutual CGL policy to determine whether it applies to the general contractor\u2019s claims. <em>Cf. Kasler, </em>906 F.2d at 199-200; <em>Pearson </em>937 F.2d at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\">The language of exclusion \u201ce\u201d in the Merchants Mutual policy excludes coverage of claims for \u201cbodily injury\u201d to an employee \u201carising out of and in the course of\u201d his or her \u201cemployment by the insured.\u201d This language clearly and unambiguously applies to claims for bodily injury damages that arise out of an employee\u2019s employment by the insured. The \u201cany obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury\u201d language of exclusion \u201ce\u201d clearly and unambiguously applies to third-party indemnity claims. We thus find that exclusion \u201ce\u201d applies to the general contractor\u2019s claims for indemnification of bodily injury damages that arose out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">This interpretation of the exclusionary language is consistent with virtually every other jurisdiction that has considered this issue. <em>See Com\u2019rs of State Ins. Fund v. INA, </em>607 N.E.2d 795, 797 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1992) (holding that \u201c[cjoverage for [third-party indemnity] claims is excluded [by the employer\u2019s liability exclusion] in clear and unmistakable language____ To divine ambiguity here would ... defeat the use of plain English language in this insurance policy and clause____\u201d) (quotation and citation omitted); <em>Bassuk Bros., Inc. v. Utica First Ins. Co., </em>768 N.Y.S.2d 479, 481 (N.Y. App. Div. 2003) (holding that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the [employer\u2019s liability] exclusion was to relieve [the insurer] of liability when an insured ... was sued ... for damages arising out of bodily injury to an employee sustained in the course of employment\u201d); <em>Fidelity and Guar. Ins. v. City of Kenner, </em>894 F.2d 782, 785 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that the employer\u2019s liability exclusion \u201cunambiguously\u201d excludes employee\u2019s injuries arising out of employment from coverage); <em>Hackensack Water Co. v. General Accident, Etc., Corp., </em>202 A.2d 706, 708 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1964) (holding that \u201cthe third-party [claim] ... was expressly excluded by [the employer\u2019s liability exclusion in] the policy\u201d). <em>But see Overthrust Constructors, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>676 F. Supp 1086, 1089 (D. Utah 1987) (citing <em>Poirier, </em>court held that an exclusion identical to exclusion \u201cj\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Poirier </em>did not cover third party indemnity actions because \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the language would lead an insured reasonably to believe that it excludes only direct actions by employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Our conclusion is also consistent with learned treatises. Holmes\u2019 Appleman on Insurance states, \u201cTo prevent possible duplication of coverage, the CGL policy excludes employers liability coverage.\u201d 21 E.M. Holmes, Holmes\u2019 Appleman on Insurance \u00a7 132.5, at 62 (2d ed. 2002). \u201cWhere an employee is injured in the course of his employment and is [entitled to] damages from a third party, the third party will often seek indemnification from the insured employer. Under these circumstances, the employer\u2019s liability exclusion typically precludes coverage of any amount the insured employer owed to the third party.\u201d 9A Russ &amp; SEGALLA, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 129:11, at 129-26 to 129-27. \u201cThe [employer\u2019s liability exclusion] ... is generally clear, unambiguous, and enforceable.\u201d 21 Holmes, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 132.5, at 67; <em>see also </em>21 Holmes, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 132.5, at 64 n.141; Annotation, <em>Construction and Application of Provision of Liability Policy, Other than Automobile Liability, Excluding from Coverage Injury or Death of Employee of Insured, </em>34 A.L.R.3D 1397, 1420-22 (1970 &amp; Supp. 2005); 9A Russ &amp; Segadla, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 129:11, at 129-27 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In light of the plain language of exclusion \u201ce,\u201d we hold that the trial court erred by not ruling that the exclusion clearly and unambiguously applied to the general contractor\u2019s indemnity claims. Accordingly, we conclude that the plain language of exclusion \u201ce\u201d discharges Merchants Mutual from coverage of the general contractor\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
