We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The record reflects the following facts. In 2002, Belanger and two friends entered into a one-year lease for an apartment in Brighton, Massachusetts. In September, when the lease began, Belanger moved out of her mother\u2019s home in Hampton, New Hampshire, and into the Brighton apartment. She was twenty-two years old at that time. Her reason for moving was that she thought she would have a better chance of finding work as a massage therapist in the Boston area than in New Hampshire. She took a job at a retail store in Boston. While living in Brighton, she continued to receive some mail at her mother\u2019s house and kept some clothing and personal items there. During the ensuing year, conflicts arose between Belanger and her roommates. She spent some nights at her mother\u2019s house in April and May of 2003. By the end of May, her roommates told her to move out. In early June, Belanger packed most of her clothes and took them to her mother\u2019s home, but left some furniture at her apartment. Though her lease for the Brighton apartment ran through August, she spent the majority of nights at her mother\u2019s home. She also spent a few nights a week in June at her boyfriend\u2019s home. Belanger continued to work at her retail job in Boston after leaving her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">While staying at her mother\u2019s house in June, Belanger began looking for a new apartment to rent with her sister. The sisters located a suitable apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. On June 25, 2003, they paid the first month\u2019s rent and security deposit for the apartment, and received keys to the apartment. Though the lease began on July 1, the landlord told Belanger that she could move in as soon as possible. On the next day, June 26, the sisters were driving to Somerville to clean the apartment when they were involved in an automobile accident and Belanger was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Belanger sought uninsured motorist insurance coverage from the defendant, MMG Insurance Company (MMG), with which Belanger\u2019s mother had a policy. The policy provided coverage to Belanger\u2019s mother along with any \u201cfamily member.\u201d The policy defined \u201cfamily member\u201d as: \u201ca person related to [the policy holder] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of [the policy holder\u2019s] household.\u201d MMG denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Belanger brought a declaratory judgment action against MMG, alleging that she was a \u201cfamily member\u201d under her mother\u2019s policy. MMG moved for summary judgment, arguing that Belanger was not a \u201cresident\u201d of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>mother\u2019s household at the time of the accident. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment. In its order, the trial court defined \u201cresident\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">any person who occupies a dwelling within the State, has a present intent to remain within the State for a period of time, and manifests the genuineness of that intent by establishing an ongoing physical presence within the State together with indicia that this presence within the State is something other than merely transitory in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Applying this definition, the trial court found that, because Belanger rented the Somerville apartment, it was not her intent to reside with her mother for the foreseeable future, and, thus, Belanger was not a resident of her mother\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On appeal, the parties agree that the sole issue is whether Belanger was a \u201cresident\u201d of her mother\u2019s household, under the policy, at the time of the accident. Belanger argues that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining whether or not she was a resident of her mother\u2019s household. MMG responds that, based upon the facts of this case, the trial court properly found that Belanger\u2019s residence was not with her mother. Despite agreeing with the trial court\u2019s result, MMG urges us to adopt a definition of residence that differs from the definition used by the trial court. MMG would have us apply the definition of \u201cresidence\u201d established by RSA 21:6-a (2000), which defines residence as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">a person\u2019s place of abode or domicile. The place of abode or domicile is that designated by a person as his principal place of physical presence for the indefinite future to the exclusion of all others. Such residence or residency shall not be interrupted or lost by a temporary absence from it, if there is an intent to return to such residence or residency as the principal place of physical presence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Our standard of review for a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If there is no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the grant of summary judgment is proper. We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Banfield v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>152 N.H. 491, 493 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We begin our analysis by clarifying the term \u201cresident,\u201d which MMG\u2019s policy did not define. \u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Krigsman v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 643, 645 (2005). We have considered the meaning of the term \u201cresident\u201d in the insurance context on multiple occasions. <em>E.g., Concord Group Ins. Co\u2019s v. Sleeper, </em>135 N.H. 67, 70 (1991). In such decisions, we have defined \u201cresidence\u201d as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018residence\u2019 in [the insurance] context, refers to the place where an individual physically dwells, while regarding it as his principal place of abode.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the trial court applied an incorrect definition of \u201cresident\u201d to the facts. The trial court\u2019s definition and decision improperly considered \u201cintent to remain\u201d at a location. Intent to remain is not a factor in our definition of \u201cresidence.\u201d Our definition of \u201cresidence\u201d considers two factors that must occur simultaneously: (1) the person must physically dwell at the claimed residence; and (2) the person must regard the claimed residence as his principal place of abode.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We also decline to adopt MMG\u2019s definition of \u201cresidence\u201d taken from RSA 21:6-a. Though the legislature has established MMG\u2019s definition, that definition does not apply in the context of interpreting language in insurance contracts. RSA 21:1 (2000), entitled \u201cApplication,\u201d states that the rules established in RSA chapter 21 apply to the construction of statutes. Because the instant case involves interpretation of contractual, rather than statutory, language, the definition of \u201cresidence\u201d that MMG promotes does not apply to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Having clarified the definition of \u201cresidence\u201d in this case, we must now apply that definition to determine whether Belanger was a resident of her mother\u2019s household. A determination of residency is largely based upon the facts of each case. <em>See Limonges v. Horace Mann Insurance Co., </em>134 N.H. 474, 475 (1991) (emphasizing that the facts determine whether individuals are members of the same household); <em>Sleeper, </em>135 N.H. at 70 (stating that a determination of residency involves weighing a number of factors). There is no dispute between the parties as to the first factor of our definition of residence: physically dwelling at the claimed residence. There can be little doubt that Belanger physically dwelled with her mother during the month of June. Though Belanger spent a few nights in June with her boyfriend, the trial court found that she spent the majority of nights that month at her mother\u2019s house. It is clear that, at the time of the accident, Belanger physically dwelled with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The remaining question for us to decide is whether, on June 28, the day of the accident, Belanger regarded her mother\u2019s home as her principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>place of abode. The facts indicate that Belanger made a conscious decision no longer to live in her Brighton apartment. During April and May, she intermittently stayed at her mother\u2019s home. In late May, her roommates in Brighton told her to move out, and, even though Belanger\u2019s lease ran through August, the record reflects that she complied with their directive. At the beginning of June, she took all of the clothes that she was likely to wear in the near future and brought them to her mother\u2019s house. She then spent the majority of nights in June sleeping at her mother\u2019s house. Further, Belanger spent much of June looking for a new apartment, and, by the date of the accident, had paid the first month\u2019s rent and security deposit for a new apartment in Somerville. These facts show that Belanger no longer intended to dwell at her Brighton apartment and thus, on the date of the accident, intended her mother\u2019s home to be her principal place of abode.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Based upon the above facts, we conclude that Belanger was a resident of her mother\u2019s household under MMG\u2019s policy at the time of the accident. Accordingly, in consideration of all inferences properly drawn from the undisputed facts in a light most favorable to Belanger, we additionally conclude that MMG was not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
