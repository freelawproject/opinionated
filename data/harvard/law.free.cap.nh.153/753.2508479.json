We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The following facts were found by the trial court or appear on the record. In or around December 1989, the defendant and Colley/McCoy Management Company, LLC (Colley/McCoy) entered into a series of agreements to establish a franchise for a McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Fisherville Road in Concord, including a franchise letter agreement, a license agreement, and an operator\u2019s lease. The defendant is the franchiser and owner of the building in which Colley/McCoy, as franchisee, operates the restaurant. The license agreement provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\"><em>Licensee not an Agent of Licensor. </em>Licensee shall have no authority, expressed or implied, to act as agent of Licensor, McDonald\u2019s____Licensee is, and shall remain, an independent contractor responsible for all obligations and liabilities of, and for all loss or damage to, the Restaurant and its business____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">The operator\u2019s lease also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-16\"><em>No Agency Created: </em>Lessee shall have no authority, express or implied, to act as agent of Lessor, or any of its affiliates for any purpose. Lessee is, and shall remain, an independent contractor responsible for all obligations and liabilities of, and for all loss or damage to, the Restaurant and its business____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">Colley/McCoy operates as a separate entity, independent of McDonald\u2019s Corporation. It is responsible for the cost of purchasing equipment for the restaurant, and paying for the fixtures, food products, advertising, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>maintenance, utilities, and insurance. It hires and trains its own employees. The license agreement provided that the defendant could hold Colley/McCoy in \u201cMaterial Breach\u201d and terminate the agreement if Colley/McCoy failed, among other things, to \u201cmaintain and operate the Restaurant in a good, clean, wholesome manner and in compliance with the standards prescribed by the McDonald\u2019s System.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In its role as franchiser of McDonald\u2019s restaurants, the defendant published an operations and training (0 <em>&amp; </em>T) manual, which addressed a number of issues related to the operations of McDonald\u2019s restaurants, including safety and security procedures. However, the 0 &amp; T manual provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">McOpCo employees should consider the rules and regulations contained in this chapter as company policy. Independent owner/operators are encouraged to adopt appropriate policies for their restaurant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">A \u201cMcOpCo\u201d is a restaurant that is owned and operated by the defendant itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The defendant employed field consultants to monitor McDonald\u2019s restaurants. In early 2001, Christine Perrault assumed the role as field consultant for the Colley/McCoy restaurant. In January 2002, the defendant published a \u201cQuality, Service, Cleanliness (QSC) Play Book\u201d for field consultants to use in evaluating its restaurants and recommending improvements. On June 25, 2002, Perrault conducted a \u201crestaurant systems review\u201d of the restaurant and found deficiencies concerning shift management, food safety, and production. She requested that Colley/McCoy develop an \u201caction plan\u201d to rectify such deficiencies. Perrault also found several deficiencies in the restaurant\u2019s execution of the \u201cSafety and Security\u201d system. She did not request the development of any action plan in response to these deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The plaintiff began working at the restaurant in the late 1990\u2019s as an overnight custodian. His shift was from midnight until 8:00 a.m. The restaurant was closed during that time and the plaintiff worked alone. On February 6, 2003, at approximately 3:00 a.m., two intruders attacked the plaintiff while he was taking a break outside of the restaurant. One of the intruders carried a baseball bat and ordered the plaintiff inside the building. Once inside, the intruders tied up the plaintiff and beat him with another pipe-like instrument. The intruders demanded that the plaintiff give them the combination to the safe. When he insisted that he did not know it, they beat him again until he lost consciousness. When the plaintiff awoke, he was face down on the restaurant floor. He remained motionless until the intruders left. At that point, he managed to untie himself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>make his way to the restaurant\u2019s panic button. After pressing the button, the plaintiff lost consciousness again. He alleges that the panic button was broken and did not alert the Concord police. At approximately 4:45 a.m., an employee reporting for work found the plaintiff unconscious and dialed 911. The plaintiff was transported to Concord Hospital where he was treated for multiple injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The plaintiff brought claims for negligence and vicarious liability against the defendant as a result of injuries he suffered as an employee of Colley/McCoy. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment concerning both claims, finding that: (1) no genuine issues of material fact exist; (2) the defendant did not assume a duty to ensure that Colley/McCoy would follow its security measures designed to protect employees; and (3) the defendant did not retain sufficient control over Colley/McCoy\u2019s security policy so as to subject it to vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his negligence and vicarious liability claims by: (1) ignoring evidence in the record that the defendant assumed and breached duties to provide adequate security at the restaurant; and (2) ignoring evidence in the record that Colley/McCoy was an agent of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Sintros v. Hamon, </em>148 N.H. 478, 480 (2002). If our review of the evidence does not reveal any genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>An issue of fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d for purposes of summary judgment if it affects the outcome of the litigation under the applicable substantive law. <em>Sandford v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>143 N.H. 481, 484 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">\n<em>III. Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We first review whether the trial court erred in granting the defendant summary judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim. The trial court concluded that the defendant \u201cdid not assume a duty to ensure that Colley/McCoy would follow several of its security measures designed to protect employees.\u201d To prevail on his negligence claim against the defendant, the plaintiff had to show that: (1) the defendant owed him a duty; (2) the defendant breached this duty; and (3) the breach proximately caused his injuries. <em>See Dupont v. Aavid Thermal Technologies, </em>147 N.H. 706, 709 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The plaintiff argues that the defendant \u201cvoluntarily assumed such a duty by adopting the \u2018QSC Play Book,\u2019 a year before [the plaintiff] suffered his attack.\u201d Whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>We have not addressed what constitutes a franchiser\u2019s voluntary assumption of a duty to ensure the safety of a franchisee\u2019s employees. We have, however, addressed a similar issue concerning a landlord\u2019s voluntary assumption of a duty to protect tenants from criminal attack. <em>See Walls v. Oxford Management Co., </em>137 N.H. 653, 658 (1993). As a general principle, landlords have no duty to protect others from criminal attack. <em>Id. </em>We recognized in <em>Walls, </em>however, that consistent with the RESTATEMENT (Second) Of Torts \u00a7 323 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-3\">[A] landlord who undertakes, either gratuitously or by contract, to provide security will thereafter have a duty to act with reasonable care. Where, however, a landlord has made no affirmative attempt to provide security, and is not responsible for a physical defect that enhances the risk of crime, we will not find such a duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><em>Walls, </em>137 N.H. at 659. Breach of such a voluntarily assumed duty can create liability to third parties as well. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) Of TORTS \u00a7 324 A (1965). Section 324 A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">(a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">(b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">(c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">We must, therefore, examine whether the trial court erred by concluding that the defendant made no affirmative attempt to provide security to the employees at the Colley/McCoy franchise, and, consequently, assumed no such duty to the plaintiff. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court relied upon the plain language of the 0 &amp; T manual, providing: \u201cMcOpCo employees should consider the rules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>regulations contained in this chapter as company policy. <em>Independent owner!operators [franchisees] are encouraged to adopt appropriate policies for their </em>restaurant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court, thus, found that Colley/McCoy, as a franchisee, was not required to implement the defendant\u2019s security recommendations.. The trial court also relied upon the deposition testimony of Johnny Webb, McDonald\u2019s divisional security manager, who testified that franchisees like Colley/McCoy were not required to follow the defendant\u2019s security policies, and Christine Perrault, McDonald\u2019s field consultant for the restaurant, who testified that her role was only to <em>recommend </em>and not mandate compliance with security procedures. The trial court also considered the affidavit of John Loftus, Vice President of Colley/McCoy, who stated that Colley/McCoy, and not the defendant, was responsible for security at the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The plaintiff did not counter with affidavits or other contradictory evidence under oath to establish that the defendant required Colley/McCoy to follow its security procedures. He argues, however, that the trial court unreasonably ignored the plain text of the QSC Play Book in finding that the security procedures set forth therein were mandatory only for McOpCo restaurants. The plaintiff references the front page of the QSC Play Book, which indicates that the information therein is directed to \u201cOperations Consultants and Owners/Operators, as well as all McOpCo personnel.\u201d The QSC Play Book instructs the field consultant that subsequent to conducting the \u201crestaurant systems review,\u201d he or she should \u201cdiscuss the impact of missing key success factors ... <em>[t]o gain Owner/Operator or McOpCo Supervisor commitment </em>to put missing key success factors in place.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Specifically, the plaintiff contends that, through such language, the defendant undertook, in relevant part, , to evaluate franchisee compliance with the McDonald\u2019s \u201cSafety and Security\u201d system, and to correct franchisee deviation by gaining a commitment to cure any violations and come into full compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">We do not find that language, in itself, to impose an explicit mandate upon the franchisee to implement the defendant\u2019s security policies, and the plaintiff has not highlighted any additional language in the QSC Play Book that classifies franchisee non-compliance as grounds for termination of the franchise relationship. Nor has the plaintiff provided any supporting evidence for his contention that the defendant\u2019s adoption of the QSC Play Book nullified any pre-existing policy, set forth in the 0 &amp; T manual, specifically delegating responsibility for security issues to franchisees. While the plaintiff asserts that the defendant had discretion to terminate the license agreement if a franchisee failed to comply with \u201cthe standards prescribed by the McDonald\u2019s System,\u201d he presented no supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>evidence that the defendant could terminate the license agreement if a franchisee failed to meet specific security and safety standards set forth in the QSC Play Book.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">In the absence of such evidence, the plaintiff urges the court to rely upon <em>Martin v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>572 N.E.2d 1073 (Ill. Ct. App. 1991), in support of his position. In <em>Martin, </em>an Illinois appellate court affirmed a damages award against McDonald\u2019s for injuries suffered by employees of a franchisee during a robbery of the restaurant. <em>Id. </em>at 1082-83. The court held that \u201cthere [wa]s ample support in case law and the facts ... to support a determination that McDonald\u2019s Corporation voluntarily assumed a duty to provide security to plaintiffs and protect them from harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078. In <em>Martin, </em>however, the McDonald\u2019s regional security manager \u201cacted directly as security supervisor for the newly acquired [restaurant] ____Since [the franchisee] had neither an operations manager nor a security supervisor, these positions were handled by ... two executives from defendant McDonald\u2019s Corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077. The <em>Martin </em>court also found that the McDonald\u2019s executives \u201cundertook not only the obligation to check for security problems, but also to communicate to the store management what the security policies were and to \u2018follow up\u2019 to be certain that the problems had been corrected and the \u2018recommended\u2019 security procedures \u2018followed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The trial court found that the \u201cactions of [the defendant] regarding security in the present case [fell] far short of those described in <em>Martin.\u201d </em>We agree. Colley/McCoy hires its own executives and employees. While in <em>Martin </em>the regional security manager and operations manager conducted security checks, which \u201cincluded changing locks, and ordering a new security window and alarm system for the back door,\u201d <em>id., </em>there is no evidence in this case that any executive or employee of the defendant participated in implementing a security system at the restaurant. Furthermore, Webb and Perrault testified that they recommended, but did not require, that franchisees like Colley/McCoy follow the defendant\u2019s security policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">In the absence of evidence in the record to the contrary, we conclude that the trial court did not err by finding that \u201cno genuine issues of material fact exist and that [the defendant] did not assume a duty to ensure that Colley/McCoy would follow several of its security measures designed to protect employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Next, the plaintiff, citing <em>Iannelli v. Burger King Corp., </em>145 N.H. 190 (2002), argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on his negligence claim because \u201clandowners (like McDonald\u2019s) bear liability for criminal attacks occurring on their premises where \u2018the opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>criminal misconduct is brought about by the actions or inactions of the owner or where overriding foreseeability of such criminal activity exists.\u2019 \u201d Specifically, he contends that the defendant created \u201cthe opportunity for criminal misconduct by [its] inaction in allowing [the plaintiff] to continue to work alone through the night in a profitable restaurant shrouded by darkness.\u201d The trial court did not explicitly address whether the defendant, as landowner, \u201ccreated the opportunity for criminal misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We have specifically rejected liability for criminal attacks \u201cbased solely on the landlord-tenant relationship or on a doctrine of overriding foreseeability.\u201d <em>Walls, </em>137 N.H. at 659. We recognized in <em>Walls, </em>however, that special circumstances can impose a duty where a landlord created, or was responsible for, \u201ca <em>known </em>defective condition on a premises that foreseeably enhanced the risk of criminal attack.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In <em>Iannelli, </em>the plaintiffs brought a negligence action against Burger King Corporation for injuries sustained as a result of an assault by teenagers at the restaurant. <em>Iannelli, </em>145 N.H. at 190. The evidence supported a finding that the restaurant was aware of the teenagers\u2019 threatening conduct towards the plaintiffs and other customers. <em>Id. </em>at 194-95. We, thus, concluded that the restaurant owed a duty to the plaintiffs to protect them from the assault as \u201cthe teenagers\u2019 behavior in the restaurant created a foreseeable risk of harm that the [restaurant] unreasonably failed to alleviate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Iannelli, </em>however, the plaintiff here has both: (1) failed to submit supporting evidence that the defendant knew, or should have known, that the restaurant was \u201cshrouded by darkness\u201d during the nighttime hours; or (2) failed to claim that the defendant knew, or should have known, of the impending actions of those who assaulted him. We, thus, conclude that the trial court did not err by rejecting a duty premised upon special circumstances and by granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\n<em>IV. Vicarious Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Next, we review whether the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s vicarious liability claim on the basis that no agency relationship existed between the defendant and Colley/McCoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Whether an agency relationship has been established is a question of fact. <em>Herman v. Monadnock PR-24 Training Council, </em>147 N.H. 754, 758 (2002). \u201cAn agency relationship, or lack thereof, does not turn solely upon the parties\u2019 belief that they have or have not created one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>necessary factual elements to establish agency involve: (1) authorization from the principal that the agent shall act for him or her; (2) the agent\u2019s consent to so act; and (3) the understanding that the principal is to exert some control over the agent\u2019s actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The trial court concluded that \u201cthe record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, does not support a finding that an agency relationship exists.\u201d The trial court relied upon the absence of evidence that the defendant retained any control over Colley/McCoy security procedures, as well as the license agreement and operator\u2019s lease which, as noted above, provided that there was no agency relationship between Colley/McCoy and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The plaintiff argues that the presence of the relevant document provisions does \u201cnothing to change the reality of agency.\u201d He contends that by executing the license agreement, \u201cColley McCoy obtained McDonald\u2019s authorization to act for McDonald\u2019s as a purveyor of the \u2018McDonald\u2019s System,\u2019 and Colley McCoy consented to act.\u201d He further contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">McDonald\u2019s has maintained a continuous prescription of what Colley McCoy shall and shall not do. McDonald\u2019s mandates compliance with the \u201cMcDonald\u2019s System.\u201d McDonald\u2019s mandates particular methods for preparing foods, as well as food preparation and service times. McDonald\u2019s mandates through the \u201cQSC Play Book\u201d that franchisee restaurants such as Colley McCoy implement \u201ckey success factors\u201d in their restaurants. Moreover, McDonald\u2019s sends out field consultants such as Ms. Perrault to Colley McCoy to ensure that McDonald\u2019s specifications are met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">We have yet to address the issue of the vicarious liability of a franchiser for the security breaches of its franchisee. The trial court correctly recognized, however, that although case law in other jurisdictions is not uniform, the weight of authority construes franchiser liability narrowly, finding that absent a showing of control over security measures employed by the franchisee, the franchiser cannot be vicariously liable for the security breach. <em>See, e.g., Folsom v. Burger King, </em>958 P.2d 301, 309 (Wash. 1998) (en banc) (concluding that while Burger King reserved the right to enforce its standards and required that franchisees comply with the guidelines in Burger King\u2019s manual, it had not \u201cretained control over the security of the franchise restaurant\u201d); <em>Helmchen v. White Hen Pantry, Inc., </em>685 N.E.2d 180, 182-83 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997) (concluding that although the franchiser published a security manual and engaged in efforts to \u201cheighten awareness\u201d and \u201coffer suggestions\u201d concerning security to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>franchisees, it was not vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of its franchisee as it did not \u201cspecifically mandate any security measures\u201d); <em>Hoffnagle v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>522 N.W.2d 808, 814-15 (Iowa 1994) (concluding that even though McDonald\u2019s required its franchisees to use its business manuals and attend training programs, its authority was \u201cno more than the authority to insure \u2018the uniformity and standardization of products and services offered by a [franchiser\u2019s] restaurant\u2019\u201d and, thus, McDonald\u2019s was not vicariously liable for the criminal assault by a third party at the franchisee restaurant).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In analyzing this issue, the trial court relied primarily upon <em>Wendy Hong Wu v. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Inc., </em>105 F. Supp. 2d 83 (E.D.N.Y. 2000), in which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York surveyed extensive state and federal case law concerning the vicarious liability of a franchiser for the security breaches of its franchisee. In <em>Wendy Hong Wu, </em>an employee of a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 franchisee brought a vicarious liability claim against Dunkin\u2019 Donuts after she was raped and assaulted while working the night shift. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87. The court specifically examined whether Dunkin\u2019 Donuts had control over the alleged \u201cinstrumentality\u201d that caused the harm. <em>See id. </em>at 87-88. The court held that since there was no evidence that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts actually mandated specific security equipment or otherwise controlled the steps taken by its franchisees in general to protect employees, it was not vicariously liable for the alleged lapse in security. <em>Id. </em>at 94. The court reasoned that the franchise agreement was \u201cprimarily designed to maintain uniform appearance among its franchisees and uniform quality among their products and services to protect and enhance the value of the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts trademark. [The franchisee] remain[ed] solely responsible for hiring, firing, and training its employees and for making all day-to-day decisions necessary to run the business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. In addition to finding a lack of control over security matters within the franchise agreement, the court stated that \u201cthe undisputed evidence in the record demonstrates that [Dunkin\u2019 Donuts] merely made security equipment available for purchase and suggested that alarm systems and other burglary prevention techniques were important.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The plaintiff urges the court to rely instead upon <em>Butler v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>110 F. Supp. 2d 62 (D.R.I. 2000), a case not addressed by the trial court. In <em>Butler, </em>the plaintiff brought suit against McDonald\u2019s for injuries he sustained when the door of a franchisee restaurant shattered on his entry. <em>Id. </em>at 64. The plaintiff claimed that the injury was caused by the franchisee\u2019s negligent failure to repair the premises but sought to hold McDonald\u2019s vicariously liable pursuant to an agency relationship between McDonald\u2019s and its franchisee. <em>Id. </em>McDonald\u2019s argued that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>agency relationship based upon the plain language of the franchise license agreement, which explicitly stated that \u201cno agency had been created,\u201d and an affidavit from a corporate officer of McDonald\u2019s, stating that it did \u201cnot own, operate, or have a right to control the franchise restaurant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. The plaintiff countered that McDonald\u2019s exercised a right to control through its requirement that the franchisee conform to \u201cthe McDonald\u2019s \u2018comprehensive\u2019 system, the frequent and detailed inspections of the premises and its operations, the taking of profits, and the right of defendant to terminate the agreement for material breach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island concluded that the plaintiff offered sufficient evidence to demonstrate McDonald\u2019s requisite right to control the franchise restaurant, and that a reasonable jury could have found the existence of an agency relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We find the reasoning employed by the <em>Wendy Hong Wu </em>court, which examined facts similar to those here, more persuasive than that in <em>Butler, </em>as we believe that this issue turns narrowly upon the defendant\u2019s level of control over the alleged \u201cinstrumentality\u201d which caused the harm. <em>Wendy Hong Wu, </em>105 F. Supp. 2d at 87-88. The <em>Butler </em>court, by contrast, found an agency relationship based upon indicia of general control, <em>see Butler, </em>110 F. Supp. 2d at 67; it did not determine whether McDonald\u2019s specifically maintained a right to control repairs to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We agree with the trial court that the evidence demonstrates that although the defendant maintained authority to insure the uniformity and standardization of products and services offered by the Colley/McCoy restaurant, such authority did not extend to the control of security operations. <em>See Hoffnagle, </em>522 N.W.2d at 814. Thus, there was no genuine issue \u00f3f material fact as to whether the defendant exercised control over the relevant security policies at the restaurant through adopting the QSC Play Book.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Because we conclude that the defendant did not retain sufficient control over Colley/McCoy\u2019s security policies so as to subject it to vicarious liability, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s vicarious liability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b811-9\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
