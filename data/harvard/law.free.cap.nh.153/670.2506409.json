He argues that the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.) erred by denying his motion to dismiss because there was insufficient evidence to establish that he believed the person he solicited to be under the age of sixteen. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">The jury could have found the following facts. On November 30, 2003, the defendant went to his cousin\u2019s house to watch a football game. While there, he used his cousin\u2019s computer to enter an America Online \u201cchat room\u201d devoted to the subject of New Hampshire romance. The chat room could be used by a participant to observe or take part in an ongoing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cpublic\u201d conversation among all the entrants in the room, and also to engage in a private conversation with one particular entrant through use of \u201cinstant messaging.\u201d Each participant uses a \u201cscreen name\u201d of choice which appears on the computer screen for all entrants to see. An entrant may also create a \u201cprofile\u201d which purports to provide some description of the person using the screen name. Entrants can choose to access another participant\u2019s profile but need not do so in order to remain in the chat room, engage in the public conversation, or have a private conversation through instant messaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">On the afternoon of November 30, the defendant used his cousin\u2019s screen name \u201cJay Paul 29.\u201d Meanwhile, Sergeant Richard Mello of the Hollis Police Department also entered the same chat room under the screen name \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d with the following profile:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">Name: Jenny</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">New Hampshire</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">Female 14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">Oh ya.. .im single!;)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">Hobbies &amp; Interests: Hangin\u2019 &amp; partying w/friends .......do u need a smile?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Mello assumed the identity of a fourteen-year-old girl for the purpose of conducting an undercover investigation into the solicitation on the internet of minors to engage in sexual conduct. While in the chat room, the defendant initiated a private conversation with \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d by sending an instant message as \u201cJay Paul 29.\u201d During the approximately one-hour conversation, the two discussed meeting to engage in sexual intercourse. At one point in the conversation, \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d gave \u201cJay Paul 29\u201d her telephone number and told him to call her after 2:00 p.m., once her parents had left the house. \u201cJay Paul 29\u201d called the number, an undercover phone line at the Hollis Police Department, and Officer Tracey Dunne answered, posing as \u201cJennyNHJenny.\u201d After some conversation, they agreed to meet at a designated time and location in Hollis.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">After the call concluded, Sergeant Mello determined that insufficient police coverage existed to safely monitor the arranged meeting. Officer Dunne attempted to contact the defendant on-line in the chat room to cancel the meeting, but the defendant\u2019s cousin responded, informing her that the defendant had already left. Officer Dunne then dressed undercover and proceeded to the meeting for the purpose of identifying the defendant. Once she located the defendant, she informed him that they would need to meet on a different occasion because her \u201cparents\u201d or \u201cfather\u201d had unexpectedly returned home early. The defendant then gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Officer Dunne his phone number so that they could arrange another meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">According to the defendant\u2019s cousin, once the defendant returned from the meeting, he acted \u201cnervous,\u201d worrying that \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d had been looking at his license plate. The following day, Officer Dunne called the defendant and left him a message as \u201cJennyNHJenny.\u201d Upon hearing her message, the defendant contacted his cousin, expressing reservations about returning the call. The defendant called \u201cJennyNHJenny,\u201d spoke with Officer Dunne and repeatedly asked her whether she had looked at his license plate. The defendant was later arrested and charged under RSA 649-B:4, I, with using a computer on-line service to solicit a person whom he believed was a child under the age of sixteen to engage in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">At trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the charge. He argued, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he believed \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d was a child under the age of sixteen. The court denied the motion, and the jury returned a guilty verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">To succeed on a motion to dismiss, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the evidence, viewed in its entirety and with all reasonable inferences drawn in the State\u2019s favor, was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the crime charged. <em>State v. Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. 331, 349 (2005). \u201cWhen reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss, we view the evidence and reasonable inferences arising therefrom in the manner most favorable to the State,\u201d even when the evidence presented is solely circumstantial. <em>Id. </em>at 349-50. Further, we review the evidence in context, and not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>at 350. When the evidence is purely circumstantial, it must exclude all rational conclusions except guilt. <em>Id. </em>We emphasize, however, that \u201c[t]he proper analysis is not whether every possible conclusion has been excluded but, rather, whether other <em>rational </em>conclusions based on the evidence have been excluded.\u201d <em>State v. Cobb, </em>143 N.H. 638, 658 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he believed \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d was a child under the age of sixteen. He contends that no evidence was presented showing he reviewed the profile of \u201cJennyNHJenny,\u201d which listed her age as fourteen, and the transcript of the on-line conversation makes no reference to her specific age. He argues that his statements during that conversation leave \u201cserious doubt\u201d that he knew she was under sixteen, and concludes that because the circumstantial evidence supports the rational inference that he believed \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d to have been at least sixteen years old, his conviction must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Viewing the initial portion of the on-line conversation in the State\u2019s favor, a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence excluded all rational conclusions except that the defendant believed \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d to be fourteen as purported by the screen name profile. The defendant initiated the private conversation with \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d at 1:06 p.m., asking whether she was looking \u201cto meet a sweet guy.\u201d Within the first few minutes, he inquired about the size of her breasts and characteristics of her pubic area. The following conversation immediately ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">JennyNHJenny [1:11 PM]: age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARs\">Jay Paul 29 [1:11 PM]: do you like older guys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK7\">JennyNHJenny [1:11 PM]: yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah4\">Jay Paul 29 [1:12 PM]: is 30 too old for [you]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgD\">JennyNHJenny [1:12 PM]: no lol</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At-\">Jay Paul 29 [1:13 PM]: no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH5\">JennyNHJenny [1:13 PM]: no, Y?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajbp\">Jay Paul 29 [1:14 PM]: most people your age would not talk to someone my age</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Significantly, when \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d inquired about the defendant\u2019s age, he immediately brought up the purported age discrepancy between them by asking, \u201cdo you like older guys?\u201d He continued by asking whether \u201c30 was too old for [her]\u201d and stated that \u201cmost people <em>your age </em>would not talk to someone my age.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Viewing all inferences in the State\u2019s favor, the jury could have discerned that the only rational conclusion to be drawn from this initial exchange was that the defendant believed that \u201cJennyNPIJenny\u201d would perceive a significant age discrepancy between them, with \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d being the younger of the two. For the defendant to discern an age discrepancy, he obviously had some information about the age of \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d in order to compare it with his own. The screen name \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d itself provides no intrinsic reference to her age. Nor did the statements or questions offered by \u201cJennyNHJenny,\u201d leading up to the defendant\u2019s apprehension, provide an intimation that she was any particular age. Indeed, at this initial juncture of their on-line conversation, the profile of \u201cJennyNHJenny,\u201d which listed her age as fourteen, comprised the sole source of her purported age by which the defendant could have measured and compared his own age. Therefore, a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence excluded all rational conclusions except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>guilt; namely, that the defendant believed that \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d was under sixteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We observe that later portions of the on-line conversation, the phone dialogue between the defendant and Officer Dunne posing as \u201cJennyNHJenny,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s nervous behavior after their meeting confirm that the defendant believed the person he conversed with on-line to be underage. For example, the defendant was concerned that \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d was a \u201ccop,\u201d and that he might incur legal ramifications for talking and meeting with her. Also, the proffered persona of \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d throughout their conversations suggested a youthful teenaged girl, such as that she ran track, lived at home with her parents and needed to wait for her parents to leave the house that afternoon in order to talk to the defendant on the telephone. None of this later evidence, standing apart from the initial portion of the on-line conversation, demonstrates that the defendant believed \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d to be under the age of sixteen. That evidence could support a rational conclusion that he believed \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d to be youthful but at least sixteen. <em>See </em>RSA 639:3 (1996) (endangerment of child under eighteen years old). We, however, view the evidence in totality, <em>Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. at 350, and because the defendant\u2019s initial interaction with \u201cJennyNHJenny\u201d would have permitted the jury to exclude all rational conclusions other than he had reviewed her profile, which listed her age as fourteen, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b722-6\">Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
