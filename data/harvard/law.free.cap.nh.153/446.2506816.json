(Pure) is exclusively responsible for the judgment in this case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The trial court found the following relevant facts. In 1998, Thompson, a former Olympic gold medal swimmer, and Matthew Freese, President and CEO of Pure, entered into an endorsement contract, whereby Pure agreed to pay Thompson scheduled sums in return for her endorsement of Pure\u2019s nutritional products and services. Under the terms of the contract, Thompson allowed Pure to use her image on its web site and promotional materials. Subsequently, Pure began to experience financial difficulties. In an effort to recover, Freese met with Ralph Cutillo, owner and operator of defendants C&amp;C Research and Development, LLC, Total Body Wellness Franchising, LLC, and Health-Style, USA, Inc. (the Cutillo defendants). Cutillo expressed interest in purchasing Pure\u2019s assets through C&amp;C Research and Development LLC (C&amp;C Research) with the understanding that any such purchase would not include the assumption of Pure\u2019s liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">During the ensuing negotiations, much of Pure\u2019s equipment, inventory and office supplies were delivered to C&amp;C Research\u2019s facilities in Laconia. By December 2000, Pure\u2019s office was closed and by January 2001, most, if not all, of Pure\u2019s tangible assets were located at C&amp;C Research\u2019s facilities. On January 9, 2001, Freese authorized Pure\u2019s product manufacturer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>produce nutritional bars and other products for C&amp;C Research. In March 2001, Pure officially transferred its account for facilitating web site purchases to C&amp;C Research. Despite these transfers during the early months of 2001, the parties had not yet reached a final agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Negotiations continued over several months. In an attempt to reach a final agreement, Freese met with Cutillo and Cutillo\u2019s attorney, John Giere, in March 2001. Attorney Giere, who subsequently drafted an asset purchase agreement for the parties\u2019 review, was unaware of Thompson\u2019s endorsement agreement with Pure. Neither party mentioned it during the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Although products continued to be sold, Freese made no payments to Thompson. Thompson wrote to Freese on March 30, 2001, seeking payments that she had not received since June 2000. Freese responded in an April 10, 2001 letter, assuring Thompson that Pure was solely responsible for the payments owed and that a newly formed distribution company, which Freese did not identify, was not responsible for any of Pure\u2019s liabilities, including Thompson\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Between March and June 2001, negotiations between Pure and the Cutillo defendants deteriorated. In a June 14, 2001 letter to Freese, Attorney Giere stated that Cutillo had rejected \u201cany final agreement\u201d proposal, but was leaving the door open for an asset purchase agreement. On June 27, 2001, Cutillo sent a letter informing Freese that he had rejected all proposals for either an asset purchase or a licensing agreement, and requested that Freese remove all of Pure\u2019s assets from the premises of Cutillo\u2019s company and prepare to reimburse Cutillo for sums already paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">On August 28, 2002, Thompson filed suit in superior court against Freese, Pure, and Total Body Wellness Franchising, Inc. (TBW). Her original writ claimed that: (1) Pure breached the endorsement contract; (2) TBW was hable for this breach because it had acquired \u201cthe assets and debts\u201d of Pure; and, alternatively, (3) if TBW did not acquire \u201cthe assets and debts\u201d of Pure, then TBW and Cutillo were liable for invasion of privacy for the misappropriation of her name and likeness by using them on TBW\u2019s web site. On November 1, 2002, just two days after Thompson filed a voluntary nonsuit against Freese individually, she obtained a confession of judgment from Pure.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">On March 31, 2004, Thompson amended her writ to name C&amp;C Research and Health-Style USA, Inc. (Health-Style) as defendants. Thompson alleged that Pure\u2019s assets and debts had been acquired by TBW as of January 2001, and that the two new defendants participated in, or were responsible for, \u201cthe acquisition of [Pure and] the breach of contract and misappropriation of [her] name and likeness without authorization.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Following a consolidated bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Thompson for $265,000 against Pure, but judgment in favor of the remaining defendants on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On appeal, Thompson argues that the trial court erred by: (1) finding that the Cutillo defendants were not liable for the misappropriation of her image; (2) failing to consider her alternative claims of quantum meruit, quasi-contract, and unjust enrichment; (3) ruling that Pure\u2019s acceptance of sole responsibility precluded her from seeking damages for the misappropriation of her image from the Cutillo defendants; and (4) ruling that no <em>defacto </em>merger occurred between Pure and the Cutillo defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We will not disturb the findings of the trial court unless they lack evidentiary support or are erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Miller v. Slania Enters., </em>150 N.H. 655, 659 (2004). Legal conclusions, as well as the application of law to fact, are reviewed independently for plain error. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, our inquiry is to determine whether the evidence presented to the trial court reasonably supports its findings, and then whether the court\u2019s decision is consonant with applicable law. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>I. Misappropriation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Thompson first contends that the trial court erred by finding that there was no evidence that the Cutillo defendants misappropriated her image. She asserts that the Cutillo defendants either assumed her endorsement contract or misappropriated her image. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">In its final order, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">At the time Freese began to transfer assets to C and C Research, Pure operated a web site which contained the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement and photograph. Cheryl Sivewright, web designer for Pure, testified that at no time did the web site contain a photograph of the plaintiff while it was controlled by C and C. While the plaintiff was justifiably concerned that her likeness appeared on the web site after she learned that C and C Research was attempting to acquire Pure, there is no evidence that C and C Research misappropriated her likeness at a time when it controlled the web site or related domains.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The trial court also granted requests for findings of fact that essentially confirm that neither Cutillo individually, nor any of the Cutillo defendants, ever maintained or used a website containing the likeness of Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">\u201c[A]s the trier of fact, the trial court is in the best position to assess and weigh the evidence before it because it has the benefit of observing the parties and their witnesses.\u201d <em>In re Adam M., </em>148 N.H. 83, 84 (2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Cheryl Sivewright testified that at no time did a company controlled by Cutillo ever control or operate a website with Thompson\u2019s photograph or likeness on it. On the contrary, she testified that Pure had exclusive control of such website. As such, we conclude that a reasonable fact finder could have found as the trial court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Thompson also argues that the Cutillo defendants misappropriated her image by distributing catalog pamphlets that contained her image and endorsement. The record suggests that the Cutillo defendants did in fact distribute these pamphlets, but such use did not constitute misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The trial court found that any use of the pamphlets containing the likeness of Thompson by the Cutillo defendants was pursuant to an initial licensing agreement between Pure and the Cutillo defendants that was consistent with Thompson\u2019s endorsement contract. Specifically, the trial court found that Pure and C&amp;C Research entered into an initial licensing agreement, the terms of which required payments by C&amp;C Research and a percentage of profits in exchange for permission to use \u201cinventory, equipment, customer lists, sales and marketing materials\u201d of Pure, and that C&amp;C Research paid $82,500 to Pure towards satisfaction of this initial licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Thompson argues that the findings of the trial court concerning an initial licensing agreement are inconsistent with its finding in the final order that \u201cthere was no meeting of the minds.\u201d Although the trial court\u2019s order does suggest that what occurred between Freese and Cutillo between November 2000 and June 2001 amounted to continued negotiations, we conclude that the parties\u2019 course of conduct supports the trial court\u2019s finding of an initial licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In <em>Remsburg v. Docusearch, </em>149 N.H. 148, 157 (2003), we adopted the tort of invasion of privacy by the appropriation of an individual\u2019s name or likeness. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C comment <em>a </em>at 381 (1977). Under our decision in <em>Remsburg, </em>liability under this theory occurs when one \u201cappropriates to [their] own use or benefit the name or likeness of another.\u201d <em>Remsburg, </em>149 N.H. at 157 (citation omitted). In <em>Remsburg, </em>we also recognized that such an appropriation \u201coccurs most often when the person\u2019s name or likeness is used to advertise the defendant\u2019s product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">An individual has an interest in controlling the use of his or her own name or likeness insofar as a benefit may be derived from its use, but when the individual authorizes another and its licensee to use his or her name or likeness under the terms of a contract, such authorization precludes a finding that either the contractual party or its licensee is liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>for misappropriation. <em>See Neal v. Electronic Arts, Inc., </em>374 F. Supp. 2d 574, 579 (W.D. Mich. 2005) (granting summary judgment in favor of licensee in a misappropriation action by a National Football League player because player\u2019s contract allowed for assignment of player\u2019s name and likeness to licensees of the contracting entity). The endorsement contract between Thompson and Pure expressly authorized Pure <em>or its licensees </em>to use Thompson\u2019s endorsement for the products designated in the agreement. The conduct of Cutillo and Freese created such a licensing agreement under which the parties operated while continuing to negotiate terms of a potential asset purchase or final licensing agreement. <em>See Harrison v. Watson, </em>116 N.H. 510, 511 (1976) (stating that contracts may be established by spoken or written words or by acts or conduct); <em>see also Tsiatsios v. Tsiatsios, </em>140 N.H. 173, 178 (1995) (noting that contractual offers may be accepted by performance).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Accordingly, the conduct of Freese and Cutillo supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Pure and the Cutillo defendants entered into an initial licensing agreement. We hold that the trial court did not err in its finding that any use by the Cutillo defendants of the pamphlets containing Thompson\u2019s likeness occurred pursuant to the initial licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\n<em>II. Quantum Meruit, Quasi-contract, and Unjust Enrichment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Thompson argues that the trial court erred by failing to address her restitutionary claims of unjust enrichment, quasi-contract, and quantum meruit. Thompson alleges that this error was brought to the trial court\u2019s attention in her motion for reconsideration of the verdict. Specifically, she states that her post-trial motion \u201cpointed out that the Court\u2019s final order failed to address the issue of unjust enrichment of the defendants by allowing them to benefit from the endorsement contract, while denying [her] compensation for the use of her image and endorsement.\u201d For the following reasons, we rule that the trial court did not err in failing to address these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The theories of quantum meruit and quasi-contract first appeared in the brief that Thompson filed in this appeal. It cannot be said that the trial court committed an error in failing to consider theories of relief that Thompson failed to raise until the appellate stage of the process. <em>McGrath v. Town of Canaan, </em>147 N.H. 623, 626 (2002) (refusing to consider claim made for the first time on appeal). As for unjust enrichment, the first articulation of this theory appears in the written closing arguments submitted after the trial. As such, the Cutillo defendants were not put on timely notice that relief was being sought on a theory of unjust enrichment. We conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>consider a theory of relief that was not timely pled. <em>See Perron v. Aranosian, </em>128 N.H. 92, 95 (1986) (court did not err in refusing to consider theory of unjust enrichment not properly raised before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>III. Pure\u2019s Acceptance Of Sole Responsibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Thompson next argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law to the extent that it ruled that Freese\u2019s representations as to Pure\u2019s sole responsibility under the endorsement contract precluded her from seeking damages against the Cutillo defendants for the wrongful use of her image. Upon review of the record, we find no support for the claim that the trial court so ruled. The trial court did not explicitly or implicitly rule that Freese\u2019s representations precluded Thompson from pursing claims for damages against the Cutillo defendants for the misappropriation, or wrongful use, of her image.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>IV. Defacto Merger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Finally, Thompson argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the Cutillo defendants were not liable for the assumption of her endorsement contract under a theory of <em>de facto </em>merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The standard for successor liability starts with the general rule that \u201ca corporation purchasing the assets of another corporation is not liable for the seller\u2019s debts.\u201d <em>Bielagus v. EMRE of N.H., </em>149 N.H. 635, 640 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">One exception to the general rule applies when an asset transfer amounts to a <em>defacto </em>merger of the two entities. <em>Id. </em>In addressing whether the Cutillo defendants were obligated to pay Thompson under the theory that they effectively merged with Pure and thus acquired the endorsement contract, the trial court properly considered the non-exclusive factors set forth in <em>Bielagus, </em>which ask whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">(1) There is a continuation of the enterprise of the seller corporation, so that there is continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">(2) There is a continuity of shareholders which results from the purchasing corporation paying for the acquired assets with shares of its own stock, this stock ultimately coming to be held by the shareholders of the seller corporation so that they become a constituent part of the purchasing corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>(3) The seller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-3\">(4) The purchasing corporation assumes those obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In applying the above factors, the trial court found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">First, the physical location of the two businesses remained separate. Second, C and C Research continued with the same management or personnel. Third, there was no evidence to suggest that C and C Research paid for any of Pure\u2019s assets with shares of its own stock. Finally, there was no evidence that Pure ceased to exist upon transfer of its assets to C and C Research.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Contrary to the arguments advanced by Thompson, the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to the first three factors under <em>Bielagus </em>are amply supported by the evidence. While the trial court made no explicit finding regarding the fourth factor, it had no need to do so. The evidence under the first three factors supports the trial court\u2019s ruling that no <em>de facto </em>merger occurred regardless of whether C&amp;C Research assumed the obligations of Pure ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-9\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
