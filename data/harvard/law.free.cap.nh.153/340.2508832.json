We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">The following facts are undisputed. Handley, the owner of a home building and remodeling company, requires that his subcontractors demonstrate proof of insurance prior to hire. In September 2003, Handley asked subcontractor James Miles to provide a certificate of insurance before he would hire him to install sheetrock. Miles told Handley that he had insurance through Robert Olivier of the Olivier Insurance Agency. Olivier is an independent insurance agent and an authorized representative of Providence. On September 29, 2003, Olivier faxed a certificate of insurance to Handley. The certificate listed Handley\u2019s company as the certificate holder and indicated that Miles had general liability coverage through Providence from September 5, 2003, through September 6,2004. Shortly thereafter, Miles began working for Handley.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">At the time that he issued the certificate, Olivier knew that Miles was not insured by Providence. In fact, the check that Miles had provided to pay for his coverage had been returned for lack of sufficient funds in July 2003. Although Miles had promised Olivier that he would provide a valid cheek, he failed to do so before Olivier issued the certificate to Handley.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>In mid-October 2003, a piece of sheetrock affixed by Miles fell and injured Handley. Handley contacted Olivier to request coverage under Miles\u2019 general liability policy. Olivier subsequently informed Handley\u2019s attorney that, because Miles\u2019 check never cleared, Miles had no general liability insurance through Providence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">Handley brought suit against Olivier and Providence for negligent misrepresentation and against Miles for negligence. Providence cross-claimed against Olivier for misrepresentation and moved for summary judgment on Handley\u2019s claim. The trial court granted Providence\u2019s summary judgment motion and concluded that, pursuant to <em>Bradley Real Estate Trust v. Plummer &amp; Rowe Insurance Agency, </em>136 N.H. 1 (1992), the certificate of insurance issued by Olivier \u201ccreated no contractual relationship or duty on the part of Providence to inform Mr. Handley of any inaccuracies contained in the certificate of insurance issued on behalf of Mr. Miles, including whether coverage actually existed.\u201d The trial court later granted Handley\u2019s motion for voluntary nonsuit without prejudice as to his claims against Olivier and Miles. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">On appeal, Handley argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Providence. Specifically, Handley asserts that <em>Bradley </em>is distinguishable on its facts and, thus, does not dictate the outcome of this case. Handley also contends that genuine issues of material fact exist concerning whether Olivier made oral representations regarding Miles\u2019 coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s initial grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Broom v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>152 N.H. 749, 752 (2005). \u201cIf there is no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the grant of summary judgment is proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The trial court concluded that <em>Bradley </em>controls this case. In <em>Bradley, </em>an insurance agent issued a certificate of insurance purporting to inform a third party that a contractor had purchased adequate workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <em>Bradley, </em>136 N.H. at 2. The certificate contained three disclaimers, including one that stated that it was \u201cissued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The policy was subsequently cancelled due to the contractor\u2019s failure to pay the premiums. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The third party argued that the certificate imposed a duty on the agency to notify it that coverage had been cancelled. <em>Id. </em>at 4. We held that the certificate contained \u201cclear\u201d disclaimers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>indicating that it did no more than \u201ccertify that insurance existed on the day the certificate was issued.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><em>Bradley </em>relied on <em>Broderick Investment v. Strand Nordstrom, </em>794 P.2d 264 (Colo. Ct. App. 1990). In <em>Broderick, </em>a certificate of insurance accurately represented the insured\u2019s coverage on the day of its issue, but became inaccurate after the insured changed the terms of its coverage. <em>Broderick, </em>794 P.2d at 266. The certificate in <em>Broderick </em>contained the same three disclaimers as in <em>Bradley. Id. </em>at 265-66; <em>Bradley, </em>136 N.H. at 4. The <em>Broderick </em>court held that the certificate\u2019s disclaimers constituted \u201cexpress limitations ... as to the future accuracy of the information contained in that instrument.\u201d <em>Broderick, </em>794 P.2d at 267. <em>Broderick </em>concluded that the certificate imposed no duty on the agent to inform the certificate holder of any material changes to the insurance coverage it described. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Handley points out that the certificate in this case, unlike the certificates in <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Broderick, </em>lacks language indicating that it is issued for \u201cinformation only\u201d and \u201cconfers no rights upon the certificate holder.\u201d The certificate here contains three pertinent provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">This Certificate does not amend, extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The second:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">Coverages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">This is to certify that the policies of insurance listed below have been issued to the insured named above for the policy period indicated, notwithstanding any requirement, term or condition of any contract or other document with respect to which this certificate may be issued or may pertain, the insurance afforded by the policies described herein is subject to all the terms, exclusions and conditions of such policies, limits show [sic] may have been reduced by paid claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The third:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">Cancellation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">Should any of the above described policies be cancelled before the expiration thereof, the issuing company will endeavor to mail 10 days written notice to the certificate holder named to the left, but failure to mail such notice shall impose no obligation or liability of any kind upon the company, its agents or representatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Providence contends that neither <em>Bradley </em>nor <em>Broderick </em>depended solely on the \u201cinformational\u201d language cited by Handley. Instead, Providence argues, the <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Broderick </em>courts considered the collective effect of the language of the certificates in those cases. Providence argues that the certificate in this case, when viewed in its entirety, also disclaims all obligations to the certificate holder. We agree with Providence that the certificate\u2019s provisions placed Handley on notice that the terms of coverage are controlled by the policy and that the agent and insurer have no duty to notify the certificate holder of cancellation or change to the policy. But, unlike the certificates in <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Broderick, </em>the certificate here does not clearly indicate that it is issued for \u201cinformation only\u201d or that it \u201cconfers no rights upon the certificate holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Moreover, the parties do not dispute that Olivier knew that Miles had no insurance through Providence when he faxed the certificate to Handley. Thus, unlike <em>Bradley, </em>the certificate in this case did not even accurately certify that coverage existed on the day it was issued. The <em>Broderick </em>court declined to impose a duty on the agent to notify a certificate holder of a policy\u2019s subsequent inaccuracies in part because it was \u201cunable to conclude that [the agent] supplied any false information to [the certificate holder].\u201d <em>Broderick, </em>794 P.2d at 267. In this case, Olivier, Providence\u2019s authorized representative, admits that the certificate supplied false information to Handley.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in concluding that <em>Bradley </em>compelled it to grant summary judgment to Providence. Because we reverse on this issue, we need not address Handley\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
