We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>This is the second appeal of this case. <em>See Carignan v. N.H. Int\u2019l Speedway, </em>151 N.H. 409 (2004). The facts, including the details of the August 23, 1998 accident from which this case arises, are sufficiently recited in <em>Carignan. Id. </em>at 411-12. In <em>Carignan, </em>the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, Mary Carignan, which was appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 412. Wheeler argued, among other things, that the trial court erred by: (1) refusing to admit Officer Locke\u2019s police accident report under the hearsay exception in New Hampshire Rule of Evidence Rule 803(8)(C); (2) allowing the plaintiff to establish a new liability theory by cross-examining Wheeler\u2019s expert witness based upon inadmissible deposition testimony; (3) failing to grant his motion to set aside the jury verdict; and (4) failing to grant a remittitur because the jury award was excessive and improperly calculated. <em>Id. </em>at 415-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We determined that the conclusion in Locke\u2019s police report that \u201cthe driver of the motorcycle made a wrong decision in his attempt to pass the RV\u201d was a factual finding within the meaning of Rule 803(8)(C). <em>Id. </em>at 416. Accordingly, we vacated the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding the report and remanded the case \u201cfor a determination of whether that portion of the report was trustworthy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. We also concluded that while Wheeler\u2019s expert witness could be asked on cross-examination about otherwise inadmissible facts that underlay or formed the basis of his opinion, the trial court did not err in excluding testimony concerning Locke\u2019s conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On remand, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and found the following facts: On August 23, 1998, Locke, a part-time officer in the Loudon Police Department, arrived at the scene of an accident involving co-defendant Dennis Carignan\u2019s motorcycle and Wheeler\u2019s recreational vehicle, which was entering co-defendant New Hampshire International Speedway, Inc.\u2019s parking facility. During his subsequent investigation, Locke used triangulation to mark the resting place of the vehicles and gouge marks on the pavement, took measurements, prepared a diagram, and made observations. In addition, he received statements from witnesses upon which he relied in reaching his conclusion of fault. Locke issued his accident report on that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The trial court ruled that the \u201cthe police report is not trustworthy and was properly excluded at trial.\u201d The court found that \u201cOfficer Locke lacked the skill, training, and experience in accident investigation to allow his conclusion of fault to be admitted\u201d and that his investigation was \u201crather unsophisticated\u201d as his conclusion of fault was based \u201con witness testimony rather than independently verifiable objective facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">On appeal, Wheeler argues that the trial court erred by excluding Locke\u2019s report and findings. He also argues that the trial court made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>following errors, which were raised, but not addressed, in <em>Carignan: </em>(1) allowing the plaintiff to establish a new liability theory by cross-examining Wheeler\u2019s expert witness based upon inadmissible deposition testimony; (2) failing to grant his \u201cmotion to set aside the jury verdict and for new trial\u201d; (3) allowing the future cost of medical treatment and lost wages without requiring the plaintiff to reduce them to present value; and (4) denying his motion to reconvene the jury when it used a <em>per diem </em>formula in calculating its pain and suffering award and impermissibly awarded the plaintiff a credit for attorney\u2019s fees in its damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>I. Police Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case. <em>Carignan, </em>151 N.H. at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Rule 803(8)(C) provides an exception to the hearsay rule for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201c[r]ecords, reports, statements or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... (C) in civil actions ... factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">N.H. R. EV. 803(8)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">In <em>Carignan, </em>we ruled that Locke\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe driver of the motorcycle made a wrong decision in his attempt to pass the RV\u201d was \u201cadmissible under that subsection of the rule, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Carignan, </em>151 N.H. at 416-17. We suggested that the trial court consider, on remand, the following factors from <em>Baker v. Elcona Homes Corp., </em>588 F.2d 551, 558 (6th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 933 (1979): (1) the timeliness of the investigation; (2) the special skill or experience of the official; (3) the level at which the investigation was conducted; and (4) whether the report was made with any improper motive. <em>Id. </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Wheeler first contends that, with respect to the second factor, the trial court \u201cinappropriately dwelled on Officer Locke\u2019s lack of accident reconstruction\u201d when it is \u201cnot necessary\u201d that he be an \u201caccident reconstructionist\u201d or have investigated \u201ca large number of accidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The trial court found that Locke was a part-time officer who had previously investigated only five to ten accidents. It also found that Locke\u2019s \u201conly training in accident investigation came from a part-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Academy program and he did not learn any accident reconstruction skills aside from using triangulation.\u201d In regard to triangulation, the court noted Locke\u2019s testimony that this technique does not \u201cdetermine what or who caused an accident.\u201d As such, the trial court determined that Locke\u2019s skill, training, and experience indicated that his conclusion of fault lacked trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Although we agree with Wheeler that there is no requirement that \u00bf police officer be an expert in accident reconstruction or have investigated a large number of accidents, the trial court could properly consider Locke\u2019s limited training and experience in evaluating the trustworthiness of his findings. We see no error in the court\u2019s consideration of these facts. <em>See Baker, </em>588 F.2d at 558 (finding that a twenty-eight-year veteran patrolman who \u201chad investigated hundreds or even thousands\u201d of accidents and testified in detail about the vector analysis he performed possessed the requisite skill and experience).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Wheeler also contends that, with respect to the third factor, the trial court erred by finding that Locke relied \u201csolely on witness statements and ignored other parts of his investigation.\u201d Specifically, Wheeler contends that Locke made his findings based upon his entire investigation, which, in addition to interviewing witnesses, included taking measurements, making observations, and performing triangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Although the trial court noted that Locke \u201cmarked the resting place of vehicles and gouge marks on the pavement using triangulation,\u201d it found that \u201che did not consider this evidence in drawing a conclusion as to fault.\u201d Locke testified that he did not perform any accident reconstruction or any skid mark calculations, and that neither his diagram nor his vehicle resting point measurements (triangulation) was used by him to arrive at his conclusion of fault. In addition to admitting that his conclusion was formed from the witness statements he received, Locke explained that without \u201cbeing an accident reconstructionist,\u201d he did not have anything besides the witness statements to use as the basis for his conclusion. The witnesses who provided these statements were two employees of the New Hampshire International Speedway as well as Wheeler and Carignan. When asked if \u201canybody could take [their] statements and draw a conclusion,\u201d Locke testified, \u201cSure, anybody could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Wheeler does not contest the trial court\u2019s findings on the other factors \u2014 that the investigation was timely and the report was made without any improper motive. Considering the trial court\u2019s findings on all of the factors,' we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding, that Locke\u2019s report was untrustworthy, is both tenable and reasonable. <em>See Faries v. Atlas Truck Body Mfg. Co., </em>797 F.2d 619, 623 (8th Cir. 1986) (ruling that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>trooper\u2019s accident report containing his conclusion of the accident\u2019s cause was inadmissible because there was no method for \u201cchecking or corroborating\u201d the report and there was insufficient physical evidence to support his conclusion that was \u201clargely based upon the statements of an interested [witness]\u201d); <em>cf. Breagy v. Stark, </em>138 N.H. 479, 484 (1994) (finding that an officer\u2019s opinion testimony concerning the fault or cause of an accident is properly excluded when it would not assist the jury); <em>Johnston v. Lynch, </em>133 N.H. 79, 88 (1990) (same); <em>Saltzman v. Town of Kingston, </em>124 N.H. 515, 524-25 (1984) (same). We thus find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe police report ... was properly excluded at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>II. New Liability Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Wheeler next argues that the trial court erred by allowing the plaintiff to establish a new liability theory (that Wheeler \u201cdid not make a normal left turn, but rather drifted left on a direct angle well before the turn, and entered the motorcycle\u2019s lane causing the collision\u201d) during cross-examination of Wheeler\u2019s expert witness using the inadmissible deposition testimony of Carignan.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In <em>Russell v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>83 N.H. 246, 252 (1928), we held that a plaintiff was not entitled to present to a jury a new liability theory, which was suggested \u201c[j]ust before the close of evidence, in cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s expert,\u201d when it \u201cconstituted a radical departure from the theory upon which the whole trial had proceeded up to that time\u201d and where \u201cthere was a total lack of evidence to sustain it.\u201d Citing <em>Russell, </em>Wheeler appears to argue that the trial court erred in allowing this new liability theory to go to the jury essentially because it \u201cwas not presented in the Plaintiff\u2019s pretrial statement, opening statement, or anywhere in the Plaintiff\u2019s case in chief,\u201d but rather was \u201cspontaneously developed\u201d during the cross-examination of Wheeler\u2019s expert witness. The record reflects otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Unlike in <em>Russell, </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel here referenced evidence concerning the \u201cclipped corner\u201d manner of Wheeler\u2019s turn during his opening statement. Subsequently, the plaintiff and Carignan described Wheeler\u2019s turn in their direct examination both as a normal and as a gradual turn. Therefore, there was no \u201cradical departure\u201d within the meaning of <em>Russell. Id. </em>at 252 (rejecting new theory of cause of fire interjected at conclusion of trial without foundation).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Furthermore, even though large portions of Carignan\u2019s deposition were not admitted into evidence, we reiterate our statement from <em>Carignan </em>that New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 705 \u201cpermits inquiry on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>cross-examination into facts underlying an expert\u2019s opinion even if those facts would be otherwise inadmissible.\u201d <em>Carignan, </em>151 N.H. at 417. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel was allowed to cross-examine Wheeler\u2019s expert witness about statements in Carignan\u2019s deposition because he testified that he relied upon this deposition in forming his opinions. In addition, the' trial court gave a limiting instruction to the jury that the deposition evidence was relevant only for what Wheeler\u2019s expert considered in forming his opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in allowing the plaintiff\u2019s case as presented to go to the jury for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>III. Reconvening the Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Wheeler also argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconvene the jury when its verdict was based upon \u201cimpermissible speculation as to the Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses\u201d and an \u201cimpermissible <em>per diem\u201d </em>based formula in order to make sure that the plaintiff received \u201c$20,000 per year above medical costs, lawyer\u2019s fees and any other expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Wheeler\u2019s motion was accompanied by an affidavit.of his attorney, Kenneth Bouchard. Attorney Bouchard\u2019s affidavit detailed how, upon receiving a response to a juror questionnaire, he called the juror and thereby received the information that formed the basis for the motion. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case. <em>State v. Low, </em>138 N.H. 86, 88 (1993); <em>see State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). Whether or not to reconvene the jury based upon an attorney\u2019s affidavit is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Drop Anchor Realty Trust v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>126 N.H. 674, 683 (1985). Based upon the record before us, the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion is neither untenable nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">\n<em>IV. Remaining Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Wheeler asserts in his remaining arguments that the trial court erred by failing to grant his \u201cmotion to set aside the jury verdict and for new trial,\u201d and by allowing the future cost of medical treatment and lost wages without requiring the plaintiff to reduce them to present value. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>conclude that these arguments lack merit and warrant no further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
