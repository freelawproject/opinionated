RSA 631:2,1(d) (1996). The defendant argues that the Trial Court <em>{McGuire, </em>J.) erred by overruling his objection to a statement made by the prosecutor during closing argument regarding the motivation of the police officer witnesses to testify truthfully. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The record reflects the following facts. In the early morning of January 12, 2004, the victim\u2019s mother took her three-year-old son to Concord Hospital. Emergency room physician Dr. Michael Lynch initially treated the victim for severe injuries to his genital region. His penis and scrotum were swollen and bruised. The skin of his penis was excoriated and the shape of his penis was distorted, curling off to the side as a result of loss of skin. Due to the severity of the injury, Dr. Lynch called a pediatrician and a urologist to assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">When asked how her son sustained the injury, she told the physicians that the victim, who was not circumcised, had inserted his thumb into his foreskin and stretched the skin to look more like his two older brothers, who were circumcised. The physicians did not believe that the injuries were self-inflicted and suspected child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">The division for children, youth and families (DCYF) and the Concord Police Department initiated an investigation. Concord Police Officer Julie Curtin and a DCYF caseworker arrived at Concord Hospital and learned that the victim\u2019s mother had gone home. Concord Police Detectives Sean Dougherty and John Thomas went to speak with her at her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">She told the detectives that she had \u201cexclusive sole supervision of the children\u201d and that \u201cno one else in the world\u201d had watched them. When asked about her son\u2019s injury, she attributed it to his stretching the foreskin of his penis. She also said that, within the past month, the victim\u2019s two older brothers had bitten and kicked the victim\u2019s penis. During this conversation, the detectives saw the victim\u2019s two older brothers come downstairs and asked the victim\u2019s mother if anyone was watching the children. She answered that she had called the defendant early that morning to come watch her children. At the detectives\u2019 request, she then took the detectives upstairs to meet the defendant. He introduced himself, stating that he assumed they were there because of the victim\u2019s condition. The detectives asked him to spell his name, which he spelled \u201cM-u-z-z-e-y.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The defendant told the detectives that he had seen the victim\u2019s injury the night before and that the victim\u2019s mother had told him about seeing the victim pulling his own penis the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Several hours after leaving the apartment, the detectives learned that the defendant had misspelled his name and that he had been picked up on outstanding warrants. They went to the Concord police station to interview the defendant. Detectives Dougherty and Thomas conducted the interview while Curtin observed from a separate room on closed circuit television. At the time of the interview, neither Dougherty nor Thomas had seen the victim\u2019s injury or spoken with the treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">According to Dougherty\u2019s testimony, the defendant told the detectives that he and the victim\u2019s mother had become closer following the death of the boys\u2019 father in September 2003 and that he lived at her apartment most of the time. The defendant said that the children had \u201cissues\u201d with toilet training. The detectives told the defendant that the victim\u2019s injury could not have been self-inflicted or caused by another child. They urged him to tell them any information he had and told him that there will be consequences for whoever caused the victim\u2019s injuries. The defendant began to cry and admitted that he had spanked the children for bedwetting \u201con five or six occasions.\u201d He then asked the detectives, \u201c[Wjhat kind of consequences[?]\u201d The detectives explained that the consequences would depend on the seriousness of the injury and the person\u2019s involvement. The defendant then stated, \u201c[Mjaybe I did do it.\u201d While crying, he stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt the little guy, I just lost my cool.\u201d The defendant then said, \u201cI wanted to tell you guys today when you were at the apartment, but [the victim\u2019s mother] was there and I wanted to tell her last night when she discovered it, but I didn\u2019t want her to hate me and I didn\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Dougherty testified that the defendant then gave a detailed confession: On Sunday, January 11, 2004, at around 10:00 a.m., one or more of the boys had wet or soiled their beds and he and the victim\u2019s mother had put them in showers. The defendant showered the victim\u2019s two older brothers and then took the victim, who had not been in the shower, into the bedroom to put a pull-up diaper on him. The victim began to urinate onto the floor and the defendant. At that point, he \u201creacted and reached up and he grabbed [the victim] by the penis, spun him around and spanked his bottom and ... he maintained a hold on [the victim\u2019s] penis and the scrotum in his hands and ... he pulled him towards the bathroom so that he could finish peeing in the toilet.\u201d He held the victim\u2019s genitals for ten to fifteen seconds, and his mood at the time was \u201cirate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Dougherty asked the defendant if he was holding the victim \u201chard enough to break an egg,\u201d and the defendant said \u201c[Ojh, yeah.\u201d When asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>if it was hard enough to break a walnut, the defendant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know about that.\u201d Thomas asked him to demonstrate how hard he had squeezed the victim by squeezing Thomas\u2019 fingers; he did so and Thomas said, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s pretty hard.\u201d The defendant stated that the victim had been crying throughout the assault, but stopped when the defendant was dressing him and hugged the defendant, apologizing for urinating. Dougherty testified that the defendant appeared remorseful and apologetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Officer Curtin took handwritten notes as she watched the interview from another room. At trial, Curtin reviewed her notes, testifying that she had written down the defendant\u2019s statements in chronological order and had \u201ctried to be verbatim.\u201d Curtin\u2019s notes were consistent with Dougherty\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Detective Thomas\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s confession corroborated Dougherty\u2019s testimony. Thomas also testified that, after the interview, he took the defendant downstairs to book him on assault charges. The defendant asked Thomas if he could call his mother and Thomas permitted the call, taking notes of the defendant\u2019s side of the conversation. Thomas testified that the defendant told his mother, \u201cI\u2019m in real trouble, I grabbed one of [the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s] sons, ... and I hurt him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">At trial, the victim\u2019s mother testified that on the morning of January 11, the victim and his older brothers had soiled their pants. The defendant offered to give the children a shower. The victim\u2019s mother then went downstairs. While downstairs, she heard the victim crying. She went upstairs five to ten minutes later and saw the victim wrapped in a towel. The defendant told her that the victim had fallen in the shower. She testified that she first saw the victim\u2019s injuries that same day around 8:00 p.m. She showed the injury to the defendant at around 1:00 a.m. and he told her to take the victim to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The defendant testified at trial that he had been away from the apartment for several hours on January 10. When the defendant awoke around 10:00 a.m. the next day, he first noticed the victim\u2019s injury. The defendant \u201cwas considerably shocked\u201d when he saw that the victim\u2019s genitals were swollen and red. He testified that when he had bent down on one knee to examine the injury, the victim began to urinate on him. He testified, \u201cI put my right hand up ... open handed ... to keep the stream of urine from going up my arm and on the side of my neck.\u201d The defendant then yelled at the victim, asking, \u201c[W]hat are you doing[?]\u201d The victim went into the bathroom on his own and finished urinating. The defendant advised the victim\u2019s mother to take her son to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The defendant also testified that, during the interview at the police station, Thomas told him that \u201cthis situation is front page news, and ... we can keep this out of the papers ... if you talk to us.\u201d He said it was clear that they wanted him to confess. He said that Thomas asked him how hard he would have to squeeze an egg to break it, and that he showed him by squeezing Thomas\u2019 fingers. He testified that he \u201cgot emotional\u201d and started to cry because he felt like a suspect and was scared. He testified that he told the detectives, \u201cmaybe I did hurt [the victim],\u201d because he did not know whether he had hurt him when he put his hand up to stop the victim\u2019s urine from hitting him. On cross-examination, the defendant denied saying that he had spun the victim around and spanked his bottom while holding onto his genitals or had walked him to the bathroom while continuing to hold onto them. The defendant said that Curtin, Dougherty and Thomas were \u201cliars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The three treating doctors testified that the injury could not have been self-inflicted or inflicted by other children. Each doctor testified that the injury could have been caused by a grown man angrily grabbing the victim\u2019s penis and scrotum and spinning the child around to spank him and leading the child to another room while holding onto his genitals. Dr. Lynch, the emergency room physician, testified that the victim would not have been able to urinate without significant discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">During closing argument, defense counsel said that the police officers involved in this case \u201cdon\u2019t like to follow the rules, ... they want to do things their own way and... they think it is okay to bend the rules to get a conviction.\u201d Defense counsel told the jury that the reason the detectives did not prepare a written confession for the defendant to sign was that the defendant \u201cwouldn\u2019t have signed [it] because it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d She also argued that detectives were trained in deception and stated, \u201cIf you\u2019re not a good liar, you\u2019re not a good detective____In their mind, deception helps get convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated to the jury, \u201cDo these people have a motive not to lie? If it is determined that these officers lied and conspired together to convict an innocent man, their careers will be \u2014\u201d Defense counsel objected at this point. The objection was overruled and the prosecutor continued, saying, \u201ctheir careers will be over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument concerning- collateral consequences to the police officers\u2019 careers constituted reversible error. The defendant argues that the statement was improper because it concerned facts not in evidence and caused sufficient prejudice to require a new trial. The State makes three arguments in response: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s statement was proper in light of cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>have allowed similar statements; (2) defense counsel\u2019s allegation that the three officers had lied to the jury justified the prosecutor\u2019s statement; and (3) any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Because the trial court is in the best position to gauge any prejudicial effect that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks may have had on the jury, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Wood, </em>150 N.H. 233, 235 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The State first argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was proper in light of existing case law. We have not previously addressed this question. The State forthrightly acknowledges that courts are divided on the issue of whether prosecutors may argue that police officers would risk losing their careers if they were found to be lying. In <em>State v. Smith, </em>No. 2003-CA-23, 2004 WL 259246, at *5 (Ohio Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2004), the court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s statement that two police officers would not jeopardize their careers by lying about the case. Similarly, in <em>Lemons v. State, </em>608 S.E.2d 15, 22 (Ga. Ct. App. 2004), the court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s statement that, \u201c[If] you even for a moment think that the detective would risk his career and \u2014.\u201d In both cases, the courts reasoned that the conclusions advocated by the prosecutors could be inferred from the evidence. The court in <em>Smith </em>stated that the jury \u201ccould reasonably infer that police officers would not jeopardize their careers by lying about a case in which they have no personal interest.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>2004 WL 259246, at *5. The court in <em>Lemons </em>upheld the prosecutor\u2019s comment because it was \u201cthe conclusion the prosecutor wished the jury to draw from the evidence, and not a statement of the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief as to the veracity of a witness.\u201d <em>Lemons, </em>608 S.E.2d at 22 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The defendant cites an opposing line of cases. In <em>United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir. 2005), the court found improper the prosecutor\u2019s statement that his witnesses \u201care officers that risk losin\u2019 their jobs, risk losin\u2019 their pension, risk losin\u2019 their livelihood ... [and risk] bein\u2019 prosecuted for perjury.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Spain v. State, </em>872 A.2d 25, 28 (Md. 2005), the court found improper the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he Officer in this case would have to engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception ... to come in here and tell you that what happened was not true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">These courts have identified a number of reasons for ruling that prosecutors engage in improper argument when they argue that police officers risk their careers by lying to the jury. <em>See Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d at 1146-51; <em>Spain, </em>872 A.2d at 30-32. The <em>Weatherspoon </em>court found that such arguments \u201cvouch for the credibility of witnesses and ... encourage the jury to act based on considerations other than the particularized facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of the case [and] pose a real danger to the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d at 1152. In addition, they \u201cclearly [urge] that the existence of legal and professional repercussions served to ensure the credibility of the officers\u2019 testimony,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1146, and \u201c[place] the prestige of the government behind a witness [by providing] personal assurances of the witness\u2019s veracity,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotation omitted). The court in <em>Spain </em>found that such arguments impermissibly elevate the credibility of police officers over the credibility of other witnesses, including the defendant. <em>Spain, </em>872 A.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We are more persuaded by the cases cited by the defendant than by those cited by the State because the former more accurately assess the impact of such statements on the jury. Furthermore, they are consistent with our previous cases holding prosecutors to a high standard by not allowing them to vouch for the credibility of witnesses by citing facts not in evidence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Boetti, </em>142 N.H. 255, 261 (1997); <em>State v. Bujnowski, </em>130 N.H. 1, 4-5 (1987); <em>State v. Bureau, </em>134 N.H. 220, 224 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s statement effectively told the jury that if it returned a verdict of not guilty, the police officers would suffer detrimental consequences to their careers. There was no testimony regarding the likelihood of such consequences. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s statement required the jury to speculate about these consequences and distracted it from its primary responsibility of weighing the evidence before it. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was a personal assurance of the credibility of the officers. The prosecutor appeared before the jury as an agent of the government and his statement about the officers\u2019 credibility effectively placed the government\u2019s prestige behind the officers. <em>See Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d at 1146. His statement directly contravened our prior warning that \u201c[t]he representative of the government approaches the jury with the inevitable asset of tremendous credibility \u2014 but that personal credibility is one weapon that must not be used.\u201d <em>Bujnowski, </em>130 N.H. at 4-5 (quotation omitted). Finally, upholding the prosecutor\u2019s argument as proper in this case would open the door to similar arguments in future cases. This would create uncertainty in the law by blurring the line differentiating proper argument from impermissible speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The State next argues that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was invited by defense counsel\u2019s allegations that the officers were lying. To support this position, the State relies on <em>Bureau, </em>134 N.H. at 224, where we upheld a prosecutor\u2019s argument that a witness had no reason to lie in response to statements by defense counsel that had \u201ccontinually attacked the [witness\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Similarly, in <em>State v. Brinkman, </em>136 N.H. 716, 719-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>21 (1993), we found no impropriety in an argument that a witness had nothing to gain by testifying falsely where defense counsel had attacked the witness\u2019s credibility. However, unlike the arguments in <em>Bureau </em>and <em>Brinkman, </em>the argument here went beyond merely stating that the witnesses had no motivation to lie and added that they would suffer negative consequences to their careers if they were found to be lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The State also relies upon two cases where courts found that defense counsel\u2019s allegations that police officers were lying invited prosecutors to argue that the officers risked their careers if they were found to be lying. First, in <em>State v. Carr, </em>374 A.2d 1107, 1114 (Conn. 1977), defense counsel \u201chad intimated that the officer\u2019s testimony was motivated by his desire for promotion.\u201d The prosecutor then argued that if the jury did not believe the police officer, it would be deciding that he was a liar and would ruin the police officer\u2019s reputation. <em>Id. </em>The court stated, \u201cWe are not convinced that the [prosecutor\u2019s] comments were not provoked or that they were flagrantly improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Unlike in <em>Carr, </em>defense counsel in this case did not argue that the officers\u2019 testimony was motivated by desire for a promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The State also relies on <em>State v. Walker, </em>No. 2004AP2747-CR, 2005 WL 2086208, at *2 (Wis. Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2005), <em>review denied, </em>708 N.W.2d 694 (Wis. 2005) (Table). There, the prosecutor stated that the detective risked losing her job if she testified falsely. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel had argued that the detective was lying, but had never argued that her career depended on testifying falsely. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the court held that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument was a measured response to [the defendant\u2019s] suggestion that [the officer] was lying.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We disagree that defense counsel\u2019s mere allegation that an officer is lying invites the prosecutor to suggest that the officer would risk his career if he were found to be lying. <em>See United States v. Swiatek, </em>819 F.2d 721, 731 (7th Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 903 (1987). Here, while the defendant\u2019s allegations that the police officers were lying may have justified the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the officers had no motive to lie, it did not invite the prosecutor to argue that police officers risked losing their careers if they were found to be lying. The prosecutor\u2019s statement went beyond merely countering allegations that the officers were lying by encouraging the jury to speculate on the effect the verdict might have on their careers.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">We next address whether the failure to sustain the defendant\u2019s objection constituted reversible error. \u201cAn improper comment made by the State during closing argument may, under certain circumstances, constitute prosecutorial overreaching requiring a new trial.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>Scognamiglio, </em>150 N.H. 534, 537 (2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn examining claims of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, we face the delicate task of balancing a prosecutor\u2019s broad license to fashion argument with the need to ensure that a defendant\u2019s rights are not compromised in the process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If the prosecutor\u2019s remark was impermissible, we must determine whether the error requires reversal of the verdict. <em>State v. Ellsworth, </em>151 N.H. 152, 155 (2004). In doing so, we balance the following factors: (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was deliberate; (2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction; and (3) whether any prejudice surviving the court\u2019s instruction likely could have affected the outcome of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The first factor is whether the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was deliberate. <em>Cf. Ellsworth, </em>151 N.H. at 157. In <em>Ellsworth, </em>we found that the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the jury, which indicated that the \u201cdefendant was the only person who could explain how he assaulted the victim,\u201d was deliberate because \u201cthe prosecutor did not admit to making a mistake or express any regret\u201d after making the comment. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s impermissible comment about the defendant\u2019s failure to testify was a conscious decision, as opposed to a mere slip of the tongue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">At the time the prosecutor in <em>Ellsworth </em>made his statement, the law clearly prohibited prosecutors from commenting on the defendant\u2019s choice not to testify at trial. <em>See Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965). However, unlike <em>Ellsworth, </em>at the time the prosecutor made his closing argument in this case, New Hampshire law did not clearly prohibit prosecutors from arguing that officers risked losing their careers if they were found to be lying. The prosecutor here was not on notice that his statement was prohibited. <em>Cf. United States v. Cox, </em>752 F.2d 741, 745 (1st Cir. 1985) (prosecutor\u2019s comment regarding the defendants\u2019 failure to testify at trial was deliberate in light of his \u201cprefatory statement pointing out to the jury that defendants need not present any defense suggests that he saw relevant danger lurking in the questions that followed\u201d). Thus, we do not find that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in this case was deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The second factor in our analysis is whether the jury instructions adequately cured the prosecutor\u2019s improper statement. <em>Cf. Ellsworth, </em>151 N.H. at 157. We have recognized that an immediate curative instruction can remedy improper prosecutorial commentary. <em>See id. </em>\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s immediate curative instruction bears the weight of judicial disapproval.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court did not give an immediate curative instruction, but issued only a general jury instruction prior to the closing argument. The instruction listed a number of credibility factors and instructed the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u201cconsider these factors in deciding the credibility of all of the witnesses whether or not they happen to be ordinary citizens or police officers.\u201d The court also instructed the jury, \u201c[Y]ou will hear the lawyers discuss the facts and the law in their [closing] arguments to you. These argument are not evidence.\u201d However, neither this language nor any other language within the trial court\u2019s instruction signaled to the jury that the court disapproved of the prosecutor\u2019s statement. <em>Cf. id. </em>We thus find that this instruction was not sufficiently strong or explicit to outweigh the danger of the prosecutor\u2019s improper statement. <em>Cf. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The third factor is whether any prejudice surviving the court\u2019s instruction likely affected the outcome of the case. <em>See id. </em>The evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction was overwhelming. The defendant confessed to injuring the victim in detailed and graphic terms. The confession was recorded in the officers\u2019 notes and each officer gave nearly identical testimony as to what the defendant said during his confession. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s confession was strongly corroborated by the medical evidence and testimony of the treating doctors, who testified that the victim\u2019s injuries could have been caused by the actions to which the defendant confessed. The officers, who had no medical training and had not spoken to the doctors about the injuries prior to obtaining the defendant\u2019s confession, could not have invented a story that fit the medical facts so well. The confession\u2019s legitimacy was bolstered by the defendant\u2019s admission that much of the officers\u2019 account of what he told them was true. Moreover, the defendant testified to a series of events that was entirely devoid of credibility. On these facts, we can comfortably say that any prejudice the prosecutor\u2019s statement may have caused was minimal.
