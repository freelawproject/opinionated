We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">The record reflects the following facts. On the morning of April 7, 2003, D\u2019Amour drove to her home at an apartment complex in Concord. She parked her vehicle in its designated parking space with the front of the vehicle facing away from the apartment. She got out of the car, opened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>back door on the driver\u2019s side and removed several coolers and a grocery-basket to carry into her apartment. She proceeded to walk along the driver\u2019s side of the car, toward the rear of the vehicle, then alongside the rear bumper, when she slipped on ice and fell. D\u2019Amour never reached the walkway leading from the parking lot to her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">D\u2019Amour\u2019s neighbor, J. Christopher Williams, who was sitting in his car in the parking lot, witnessed D\u2019Amour\u2019s fall. Williams stated in an affidavit: \u201cI observed [D\u2019Amour] beginning to walk from her vehicle towards mine. D\u2019Amour was carrying bags of groceries and other items in both her hands____As D\u2019Amour reach[ed] the driver[\u2019s] side rear of the vehicle parked between her car and my vehicle, she slipped on a patch of ice.\u201d In his affidavit, Williams said that, at the time of her fall, D\u2019Amour was \u201c[a]t the point behind the passenger rear of the vehicle parked between her car and my vehicle.\u201d He said that she struck Williams\u2019 vehicle \u201cwith her right shoulder ... as she hit the ground.\u201d D\u2019Amour alleged that, as a result of the fall, she sustained injuries to her shoulder, tailbone and leg, as well as a pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. Her medical bills totaled approximately $58,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">At the time of the accident, D\u2019Amour carried automobile liability insurance with Amica, which included medical payments coverage. When D\u2019Amour requested payments, Amica denied coverage because, at the time of her injury, D\u2019Amour was not \u201coccupying\u201d a vehicle as defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">D\u2019Amour filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the superior court to determine coverage. Amica filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that D\u2019Amour\u2019s injury was not related to her use of the vehicle because she was not \u201coccupying\u201d a motor vehicle at the time of her injury. The trial court granted Arnica\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s summary judgment ruling, we must consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Peerless Ins. v. Vt. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 71, 72 (2004). Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>The facts before us are uncontested and we review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Marikar v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 395, 397 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u201cOur analysis begins with an examination of the insurance policy language.\u201d <em>Peerless Ins., </em>151 N.H. at 72. \u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language, like any contract language, is ultimately an issue of law for the court to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 782, 788 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We start by considering whether the language at issue is ambiguous. <em>See Oliva v. Vt. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>150 N.H. 563, 566 (2004). \u2018Where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>151 N.H. at 788. \u201cIf the language of the policy reasonably may be interpreted more than one way and one interpretation favors coverage, an ambiguity exists in the policy that will be construed in; favor of the insured and against the insurer.\u201d <em>High Country </em>Assocs. <em>v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 41 (1994). \u201cThe fact that the parties may disagree on the interpretation of a term or clause in an insurance policy does not create an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Oliva, </em>150 N.H. at 566 (quotation omitted). \u201cIn addition, policy provisions are not ambiguous merely because it is difficult to apply the factual situation to the specific policy language.\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The policy provides that Amica \u201cwill pay reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical... services because of bodily injury ... [sustained by an insured.\u201d The policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201c[y]ou or any family member ... while occupying ... a motor vehicle____\u201d The policy defines \u201coccupying\" as \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">On appeal, D\u2019Amour argues that she was occupying her vehicle for purposes of coverage because she was in the process of \u201cgetting out\u201d of the vehicle when she was injured. D\u2019Amour argues that \u201coccupying,\u201d when defined as \u201cgetting out,\u201d is ambiguous because it is susceptible to several reasonable and different interpretations. She argues that the ambiguity must be construed in her favor and against the insurer and, thus, there is coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Arnica argues that there is no basis for reasonable disagreement about the meaning of \u201coccupying.\u201d It argues that mere disagreement about whether D\u2019Amour was getting out of the vehicle at the time of her injury does not make the term \u201coccupying\u201d ambiguous. Amica also argues that D\u2019Amour had completed the act of \u201cgetting out\u201d of her vehicle and was not occupying it at the time she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Both parties rely upon <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Cookinham, </em>135 N.H. 247 (1992). In <em>Cookinham, </em>the claimant was leaning her elbows on an insured vehicle in which she intended to accept a ride when she was struck by an uninsured vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 248. The trial court ruled that the claimant was not entitled to medical coverage because she was not \u201coccupying\u201d the insured vehicle at the time of her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 249. The policy in <em>Cookinham </em>defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin or upon or entering into or alighting from\u201d the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 248. The issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>whether the claimant was \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle and therefore \u201coccupying\u201d it at the time of her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The trial court in <em>Cookinham </em>ruled that the claimant was not entitled to coverage because she was \u201cpedestrian or sidewalk oriented,\u201d rather than \u201cvehicle oriented\u201d at the time of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 249. The trial court applied the \u201cvehicle orientation standard,\u201d under which a claimant must be \u201cengaged in a transaction essential to the use of the insured vehicle at the time of the accident\u201d in order to be \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The trial court held that the claimant was not \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle because she was not \u201cengaged in a transaction essential to the use of the insured vehicle at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the insurance company urged us to adopt the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u201coccupying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The claimant in <em>Cookinham, </em>however, argued that \u201coccupying\u201d should be interpreted literally and that, because she was leaning on the vehicle at the time she was injured, she was \u201cupon\u201d it and was within the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccupying.\u201d She relied upon <em>Mondelli v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>506 A.2d 728 (N.J. 1986), where the claimant was struck and injured by an uninsured motorist while resting his arm on the roof of a parked vehicle. The court in <em>Mondelli </em>held that the claimant was \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle and therefore \u201coccupying\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We concluded that the term \u201coccupying\u201d was ambiguous because both parties presented a reasonable interpretation of its meaning. <em>Cookinham, </em>135 N.H. at 250. Applying the claimant\u2019s interpretation, we held that she was entitled to coverage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Here, the parties agree that D\u2019Amour was no longer \u201cin or upon\u201d the vehicle at the time of her injury. The parties also agree that a claimant need not have physical contact with the vehicle in order to be \u201coccupying\u201d it. Amica argues that a person is \u201cgetting out\u201d of, and thus \u201coccupying,\u201d a vehicle only while she is engaged in a transaction related to the motor vehicle. This interpretation is consistent with the vehicle orientation test and is therefore reasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">D\u2019Amour argues that \u201cgetting out\u201d of, and thus \u201coccupying,\u201d a vehicle includes \u201cthe process of moving away from the vehicle to a place of safety.\u201d We agree with D\u2019Amour that, under the vehicle orientation test, \u201coccupying\u201d may include the process of moving away from the vehicle to a \u201cplace of safety.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Kantola v. State Farm Ins., </em>405 N.E.2d 744, 746 (Ohio Mun. 1979), (child found to be \u201calighting from\u201d school bus when hit by car while crossing road to his home because he had not yet reached a \u201cplace of safety\u201d); <em>Etter v. Travelers Ins. Cos., </em>657 N.E.2d 298, 302-03 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995) (claimant \u201cgetting out\u201d because he had not reached a \u201cplace of safety\u201d when standing on icy median approximately twenty feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>from his vehicle and pushing a vehicle that had slid off the road); <em>Olsen v. Farm Bureau Ins. Co. of Nebraska, </em>609 N.W.2d 664, 670-71 (Neb. 2000) (claimant \u201calighting from\u201d vehicle which had driven into a power pole because, although he was electrocuted by a live power line somewhere between four and forty feet from the vehicle, he remained within \u201czone of risk\u201d); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Holmes, </em>333 S.E.2d 917, 918 (Ga. Ct. App. 1985) (decedent was \u201calighting from\u201d vehicle because he had not reached a \u201cneutral zone\u201d when, a few feet from vehicle, he was swept away by floodwaters); <em>Nelson v. Iowa Mutual Ins. Co., </em>515 P.2d 362, 364 (Mont. 1973) (decedent was still \u201calighting <em>from\u201d </em>vehicle stuck in a ditch during blizzard where she froze to death 143 feet from vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We agree with D\u2019Amour that her interpretation of \u201coccupying\u201d as involving moving to a place of safety is reasonable. However, D\u2019Amour does not fit within that definition. Where courts have found that claimants have not yet reached a place of safety, the claimants were exposed to unsafe conditions and were attempting to remove themselves from those conditions. D\u2019Amour was not removing herself from an unsafe condition when she slipped and fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In making what appears to be an alternative argument, D\u2019Amour relies upon two cases holding that claimants were \u201cvehicle oriented\u201d even though they were injured a considerable distance from their vehicles. In <em>Radmann v. Truck Insurance Exchange, </em>660 So. 2d 975 (Miss. 1995), the claimant parked his truck and was hit and killed approximately 100 feet from the truck while crossing a highway toward a restaurant. The court held that \u201c[the claimant] was in close physical proximity with the truck at the time of his accident so as to deem him vehicle-oriented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978. In <em>Genthner v. Progressive Casualty Insurance Co., </em>681 A.2d 479 (Me. 1996), the court awarded coverage to a claimant who was standing in the road approximately 100 yards from the insured vehicle when he was hit by another vehicle while trying to obtain its license number. We believe that these cases are inconsistent with the vehicle orientation test, which requires claimants to be \u2018Vehicle oriented,\u201d rather than \u201chighway oriented\u201d or \u201csidewalk oriented.\u201d <em>See Etter, </em>657 N.E.2d at 301. In these cases, the claimants were \u201chighway oriented\u201d and not \u2018Vehicle oriented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">D\u2019Amour has not provided a reasonable interpretation of \u201coccupying\u201d that would apply to the facts of this case. We thus apply Arnica\u2019s interpretation of \u201coccupying\u201d and conclude that D\u2019Amour was \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle only if she was \u201cengaged in an activity essential to the use of the vehicle\u201d at the time of an accident. <em>See Cookinham, </em>135 N.H. at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>At the time of her injury, D\u2019Amour had severed her connection to her vehicle. She was no longer engaged in activities essential to its use and was thus not \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle. <em>See id. </em>at 250. This result is supported by cases from other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. Loman, </em>518 N.E.2d 486, 492 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987) (no recovery for claimant who had exited truck and walked approximately thirty feet to kick muffler to side of the road when hit by another vehicle because he \u201chad embarked on a course of conduct ... entirely distinct from acts reasonably necessary to make an exit from the car\u201d); <em>Carta v. Providence Washington Indemnity Co., </em>122 A.2d 734, 737 (Conn. 1956) (no recovery for claimant run over by rolling vehicle after she had exited it and walked around its front, even though she was within inches of the vehicle, because \u201c[a] person is not in the process of alighting if ... he has embarked on a course of conduct entirely distinct from acts reasonably necessary to make an exit from the car\u201d). Accordingly, the superior court did not err by granting summary judgment to Arnica.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-4\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
