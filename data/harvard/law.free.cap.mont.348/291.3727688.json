Rose was found guilty by a jury and judgment entered on June 6, 2003. He appealed and this Court remanded to the District Court to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the denial of Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b62 After remand, the District Court held a two day evidentiary hearing on Rose\u2019s speedy trial claim and subsequently entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order again denying his motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. We restate and consider the several issues Rose raises on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b63 1) Did the District Court err in denying Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b64 2) Did the District Court err when it failed to hold a hearing on Rose\u2019s complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\u00b65 3) Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Rose\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis that the prosecutor\u2019s statements during the State\u2019s closing argument denied Rose a fair and impartial trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\u00b66 4) Was Rose\u2019s trial counsel ineffective before she was removed, thus requiring a mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">\u00b67 Rose was arrested on January 11, 2002, in Ravalli County following an incident in which he kidnapped a friend and co-worker, Jonathan Kirk Davies at knife point, badly cutting Davies when he tried to escape. Both Rose and Davies required medical attention. Later, upon his release from the hospital, Rose obtained pepper spray inadvertently left in the back of a patrol car and sprayed a law enforcement officer with it when in the Ravalli County Detention Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">\u00b68 The odyssey which occurred between Rose\u2019s arrest on January 11, 2002, and his eventual trial which commenced 507 days later, on June 2, 2003, is summarized here as it relates to Rose\u2019s claim that he was denied a speedy trial and his claim that he was denied a hearing to address his complaints about his lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">\u00b69 The day after his arrest on January 11, a complaint was filed in the Ravalli County Justice Court charging Rose with aggravated kidnapping, assault with a weapon and assault on a peace officer. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>January 23, the State filed an information charging Rose with these same felony offenses in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b610 On February 6, Rose made his initial appearance in District Court with court-appointed counsel, Larry Mansch. When asked if the defense needed further time to enter a plea, Mansch said, \u201cWe do, your Honor. We received about 160-some pages of discovery just the other day, and I know that Robert would like more time to review that, so we\u2019d like to reappear next Wednesday, if I could, please.\u201d On Wednesday, February 13, Rose appeared with counsel and entered not guilty pleas. The District Court set an Omnibus Hearing for March 6. At the Omnibus hearing, defense counsel noted Rose\u2019s desire to move for a change of venue, and asked for additional time to pursue that option. The court gave the defense until March 27, 2002, to file the motion and stated: \u201cThen it will be on the standard schedule.\u201d The court set a status conference for April 10 and a settlement conference for April 18, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b611 At the April 10 status hearing, Rose appeared with counsel and requested a continuance of the April 18 settlement conference. The State, represented by Ravalli County Attorney George H. Corn, objected. Corn predicted that Rose would later raise speedy trial problems and requested to proceed to trial with all haste. The District Court granted Rose\u2019s motion to postpone the settlement conference until May 2, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b612 On April 17, the District Court received the first of several letters from Rose complaining about his legal representation by Mansch. On April 18, the District Court scheduled a special hearing for April 24 to inquire about Rose\u2019s complaints. The day before the hearing, the court received another letter from Rose, retracting his complaints against Mansch. Rose then appeared at the hearing on April 24 along with Mansch. He personally advised the court that he was satisfied with his counsel and there was no need for a further hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AQF\">\u00b613 On May 6, the court received another letter from Rose saying he regretted stating in court that he was satisfied with Mansch. On May 30, Mansch, who received Rose\u2019s letters only after the court forwarded copies of them to him, wrote the court saying Rose\u2019s letters to the court had not affected his representation and he was unwilling to step down from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b614 On June 6, Rose sent another letter to the court saying he was far from happy or satisfied with Mansch\u2019s assistance. Rose also asked to represent himself <em>pro se </em>until he could retain private counsel or until he was appointed different counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u00b615 At a status hearing on June 12, Mansch told the court that Rose\u2019s letters to the court had not compromised his representation of Rose. The State, again desiring the proper procedure be followed concerning Rose\u2019s off again on again complaints about his lawyer and wishing to avoid speedy trial issues, asked the District Court to inquire about the letters written by Rose complaining about his lawyer, and noted that the trial was set to take place in less than two months. The judge asked Rose to state the reasons why he was dissatisfied with Mansch\u2019s representation and explained that only then could the court determine if there was a substantial basis for Rose\u2019s dissatisfaction. The judge explained that only if there was a valid basis for Rose\u2019s complaints, would the court hold a full hearing to determine if Mansch should be replaced. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">Rose: Your Honor, I was wondering if we could maybe postpone this issue until a further time when we can meet with Mr. Corn and discuss some things, and if I still feel there\u2019s a problem, could I address the Court at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">State:... I\u2019ll rearrange my schedule and make sure we get it done. I think I want the record to reflect that this is done on Mr. Rose\u2019s request. There could be a speedy trial issue, and I don\u2019t want that to be on the State\u2019s hook, so that\u2019s my concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">Court: So we\u2019ll continue this hearing then -until June 19th at 9:00 on request of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b616 On June 19, 2002, a status hearing was held at which Corn said that the State would press ahead and assumed the trial would be held on July 31. By that time, Rose had sent yet another letter to the court regarding Mansch\u2019s representation. The State asked that Rose decide whether or not he wanted to proceed with Mr. Mansch, noting he signed no waiver of a speedy trial. The judge asked Rose if it was his wish to have a different attorney, Rose replied, \u2018Yes, I think I would, because things have not run smoothly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b617 The District Court specifically told Rose that if a new attorney was assigned to represent him, it would mean the trial would probably be postponed for weeks or even months. Mansch noted that Rose continuously complained about his representation and indicated his willingness to step aside. The District Court, noting it would save time, dismissed Mansch and appointed another attorney, Mr. Dustin Gahagan to represent Rose. The prosecutor, Mr. Corn, made no objection, noting the trial was still scheduled for July 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b618 On July 11, 2002, the defense filed a motion to continue the July 29 trial. Attached to the motion was a handwritten waiver of speedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>trial signed by Rose. Reasons cited for requesting the continuance were counsel Gahagan had not been on the case very long, was extremely busy, and needed additional time to prepare the defense. Rose sent a letter to the District Court on July 13,2002, requesting postponement of the July trial saying he had hoped not to have to waive his right to a speedy trial but due to the lack of preparation by present counsel, he was left with no other option.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b619 Six days later, Gahagan moved to substitute a different attorney as counsel for Rose due to the change in the public defender contract with Ravalli County. On July 22, 2002, the District Court appointed Kelli Sather as Rose\u2019s attorney. The District Court granted Rose\u2019s motion for further delay caused by his request for a different lawyer and reset the trial for November 18, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b620 On October 25, 2002, less than one month before the November trial date, the defense filed a motion for a psychological exam. Three days later, the State filed a motion requesting that the trial proceed as scheduled on November 18. That same day, Rose appeared in court with Sather. Rose told the court he was interested in proceeding <em>pro se </em>but did not have a chance to talk to counsel about it enough yet. Sather reiterated the request for a psychological evaluation. The State reiterated its request that trial proceed as scheduled and any delay be attributed to the defense. The court advised Rose an evaluation would further delay trial and asked if he understood. Rose advised the court he understood. The court granted the motion for a psychological evaluation and advised a new trial date would be set after the evaluation was received. Rose requested to proceed <em>pro se </em>with consultation from Sather and the court postponed any decision on that matter until completion of the psychological examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b621 On January 31, 2003, Rose wrote to the court requesting a hearing about his complaints about his attorney. On February 12, 2003, Rose appeared with Sather. The District Court inquired about both the status of the psychological examination and Rose\u2019s complaints about his attorney. Sather stated the examination was finished and the doctor reported Rose was competent to proceed to trial. Sather further advised that Rose had not yet decided whether he wanted to rely on the psychological evaluation at trial, which would require him to disclose it to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b622 The court then inquired about Rose\u2019s complaints with his representation by Sather as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Court: ... Well, Mr. Rose, do you have a problem with Miss Sather\u2019s representation? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Rose:... We met Monday, as she said, and I feel there\u2019s been some confidence restored there, but as I mentioned in my complaint, I felt there\u2019s been some due process violations and I would like to make mention of, if the Court would allow me time. If not we can-. Court: You can\u2019t have an attorney and represent yourself at the same time, Mr. Rose. If you want to represent yourself, we can discuss that. If you want to be represented by an attorney, you need to deal with her and she will evaluate your claims and proceed with what she thinks is valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">Rose: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">Court: Is that clear? So are you dissatisfied with her representation or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">Rose: I felt that I was. We met on Monday and we have started to address some issues and some concerns that I have had, and I feel if we are allowed to continue in those and spend time together and discuss my other defenses and gathering of evidence, I feel that that confidence-that the competence issue between her and I is fine. I do not have a complaint with her. I told her that. I felt it was a conflict rather with the State of Montana and Ravalli County and providing me with counsel that\u2019s real busy, and that\u2019s been the issue, and I feel that\u2019s where my conflict lies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">Court: You\u2019re never going to be appointed an attorney who has only you for a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Rose: I understand, Your Honor. I\u2019ve never expected that from an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">Court: These are busy people and that\u2019s just part of the situation. Rose: I know, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">Court: So right now you are not asking that your attorney be relieved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">Rose: No, I\u2019m not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u00b623 Rose requested that trial be set.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">Rose: But I do not want to make light of the complaints I had in the letter about representation. I feel I had adequate complaint. We have addressed issues on Monday, and if the Court would like to hear why I made those issues and put something on the record, I\u2019m fine with that. I-but I would like to also say that her representation of me at this point, as of Monday, I feel is fine. We have discussed some due process issue that she\u2019s agreed to look at with me, and those were my concerns that were being ignored. Court: Okay. Did you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>State: Your Honor, I did. Thank you. I just wanted to remind the Court that these were the same complaints the Court has heard from Mr. Mansch last May, June and July. Mr. Mansch was ultimately relieved. The Court attempted to address Mr. Rose\u2019s concerns, and it seems like we\u2019re back to the same spot as eight months before. The matter has been set for trial twice. Witnesses have been subpoenaed, interviewed. I think that I\u2019d respectfully request the Court impose some deadlines, not too quick, since we have witnesses out of town, but it sounds like Mr. Rose is heading down the same path. He\u2019s going to attempt to fire present counsel, would be my prediction, so I would ask that the Court put some deadlines. It would take us probably a month to five weeks, just because we have witnesses that are out of the county that we have gone through the process of contacting and lining up before, but I think the deadlines are necessary, given the history of the case. Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">Court: Are we ready to set this for trial, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">Sather: Your Honor, yes, I believe we are. And if I could have until tomorrow to make a final decision, as I stated, with Mr. Rose about the disclosure of Dr. Davis\u2019s report and whether we\u2019re going to use that at trial as a defense or not. We\u2019re still planning on going to trial, so yes, I think setting a trial date is fine at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">State: My only caveat to that is if they do use Dr. Davis\u2019s, we may have to request some more time, ironically enough, to see if we agree with that and have that scrutinized by the State\u2019s expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agb\">Court: The soonest we could set it would be probably in May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADU\">Rose: Your Honor, may I make a response to the State\u2019s accusations of frivolous matters pertaining to my complaint here today? The State responded to me-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayq\">Court: You know, I-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajf\">Rose: I would like some-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">Court: No disrespect to Mr. Corn, but he\u2019s saying what he has to say, and we just don\u2019t have the time to get into this back and forth here, and it\u2019s not going to do your case any good anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b624 Two days later, on February 14,2003, Sather filed notice of Rose\u2019s intent to introduce evidence of his mental disease or defect at trial. On February 18, 2003, the court scheduled a jury trial to begin May 12.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">\u00b625 On March 11, 2003, Rose wrote another letter directly to the judge, questioning the fairness of the presiding judge and requesting an inquiry into whether his speedy trial rights had been violated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Three days later the court was forced to reset the jury trial for June 2, 2003, due to conflicts with the court\u2019s calendar. Also on March 14, the State moved for a psychological examination of Rose by a doctor of the State\u2019s choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b626 On March 19, 2003, Rose appeared in court with counsel. The judge advised that the State\u2019s motion for a psychological examination was granted and Rose\u2019s motion for new judge was denied. For the State\u2019s expert to perform an evaluation, the State asked the defense to provide the supplemental materials relied upon by Dr. Davis in his evaluation of Rose. The defense failed to expeditiously provide that discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b627 On March 25, 2003, Rose again wrote directly to the court complaining of issues he felt his attorney was failing to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b628 On March 28, Rose again sent a letter to the court attempting to make motions on his own behalf to protect his constitutional rights. This letter contained (1) a complaint about court-appointed counsel; (2) an invocation of his speedy trial rights; and (3) a motion for the court to take judicial notice of various evidentiary rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b629 On April 8,2003, the State moved to bar evidence of Rose\u2019s mental disease or defect because the defense failed to produce the discovery related to the evaluation after the court had ordered its production. The State attached to its motion a letter written by Rose to the court and Sather. The letter contained questions regarding his constitutional rights and criticizing County Attorney Corn for failing to protect his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b630 On April 16, 2003, Rose filed a <em>pro se </em>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, raising issues regarding his representation and his speedy trial rights. Rose then appeared with counsel in court. The State made sure that Rose\u2019s complaints about court-appointed counsel were addressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">State: And thirdly your Honor, the third thing is Mr. Rose has been sending letters to the Court regarding dissatisfaction with counsel and the system in general. The State\u2019s concern is that that may need to be addressed at some point before the trial. What I don\u2019t want to happen is we have to reschedule three times. Mr. Rose has been through several attorneys, and if he intends to represent himself with Miss Sather as standby attorney or something, that needs to be sorted out before we get up to the eve of trial. I\u2019m afraid, because there are quite a few subpoenas we have to send out, I would hate to see trial derailed again. And given the tenor of the letter that I received last week that I had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>send to the Court and Miss Sather, it particularly concerns me. He wrote me directly. I sent a copy to the Court and I sent one to Miss Sather, and that\u2019s one reason that you may need to set something up so that that is all settled before you get closer to trial, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">Court:... Now, Mr. Rose, are you currently dissatisfied with Miss Sather\u2019s representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">Rose: I felt that the-that we have a very serious lack of time together. I\u2019ve prepared a handwritten writ of habeas corpus. I don\u2019t know if the Court has jurisdiction here. I would like to ask if it\u2019s frivolous to apply in this Court; if not, I would like to-I\u2019ve got two copies, one for the Court and one for Mr. Corn, if that\u2019s feasible to present today. If not, then I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Court: Well, I couldn\u2019t comment on it without seeing it. ... [Rose hands it to clerk who stamps it. Judge says he\u2019ll look at it later.] Maybe what we ought to do here is have another attorney appointed to independently evaluate Mr. Rose\u2019s complaints and make a report to the Court as to whether or not a hearing is necessary.... [Court determines that Ms. Brownlee has not been involved in the case.] I\u2019ll appoint Miss Brownlee, just for the sole purpose of inquiring into your complaints about Miss Sather and determining, in her opinion, if further hearing is warranted on your concerns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b631 The District Court ordered attorney Sasha Brownlee to inquire into Rose\u2019s complaints regarding his current counsel and to report to the court whether Rose\u2019s complaints seemed substantial, warranting a hearing. The State meanwhile requested a hearing on the State\u2019s motion for sanctions be continued without date until the State had a chance to evaluate a stack of materials that the defense provided 5 days prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b632 On April 30, 2003, Rose appeared with counsel. The State inquired into the investigation by Brownlee to see if Rose\u2019s complaints were valid. Rose responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">Rose: May I have a minute, Your Honor? Miss Brownlee met with me Friday. We went over some things. She\u2019s familiarizing herself with the rest of the matters that we discussed. She said she would get back with me, and so I\u2019m just waiting to hear back from her on that. As I said before, I was dissatisfied at the time that counsel and I have had to get together and discuss matters of the case, and one of those would be that my right to privilege on some of this information is being discussed here today. I wanted some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>arguments on that and counsel and I, I felt, need some more time to go over the matters of privilege as far as mental evaluation. There\u2019s some parts of that that I don\u2019t feel have been released in accord with-or have been released lawfully and it was a violation of my privilege. Whether that\u2019s true or not, I would like some argument on it, and maybe have some time to look into that. Sather: Your Honor, I have looked into that somewhat, and if-I mean, I don\u2019t mind setting a hearing on that if we want-at a later date if I find something or if Miss Brownlee finds something. I began to look into it in filing this response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b633 On May 23, 2003, ten days before they were to go to trial, Sather, on behalf of Rose, filed a motion to dismiss for a violation of speedy trial rights, arguing he suffered from a 498 day delay, triggering the speedy trial analysis. Rose alleged the entire delay was attributable to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b634 In chambers on June 2, 2003, the day of trial, defense requested a hearing on Rose\u2019s speedy trial motion. After some argument, the District Court denied the request for a hearing and the motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. On appeal, this Court remanded for a hearing on the speedy trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b635 Trial was held as scheduled. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts. Rose was sentenced to Montana State Prison. As noted above, Rose appealed and we remanded for a hearing on the speedy trial issue. The District Court held a hearing and thereafter entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order denying Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b636 We review the factual findings underlying a district court\u2019s speedy trial ruling to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 119, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 119. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination of whether a speedy trial violation occurred because it is a conclusion of constitutional law. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 13, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 13, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b637 <em>Ariegwe </em>was decided August 16,2007, which was after the District Court heard and entered its order denying Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>lack of a speedy trial. The District Court utilized the now superseded analysis set forth in <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866, to reach its decision. In other cases that were on appeal when a district court entered its decision before <em>Ariegwe, </em>we remanded for the district court to reconsider its orders applying the <em>Ariegwe </em>factors. See <em>State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58; <em>State v. Smith, </em>2008 MT 7, 341 Mont. 82, 176 P.3d 258; <em>State v.

However, as this case was previously remanded for a hearing on Rose\u2019s claim that he was denied a speedy trial, the factual record concerning Rose\u2019s speedy trial motion is comprehensive and complete, and the District Court has made the necessary findings of fact for application of the <em>Ariegwe </em>analysis. A second remand for the District Court to again examine the record and reconsider its decision under <em>Ariegwe </em>would further delay a resolution for the parties involved. We conclude that judicial economy and fairness require we analyze the record and District Court\u2019s findings of fact and reach the merits of the speedy trial argument. <em>See ABC Collectors, Inc. v. Birnel, </em>2008 MT 35, \u00b6 15, 341 Mont. 310, \u00b6 15, 176 P.3d 1067, \u00b6 15. Therefore, in this singular instance, we have carefully examined and utilized the record to consider the speedy trial issue in this case using the <em>Ariegwe </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"Avv\">\u00b638 Rose argues the judgment must be vacated because the District Court erred in not conducting a hearing to determine whether he was entitled to have his appointed counsel replaced. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision on a request for the appointment of new counsel absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 10, 288 Mont. 180, \u00b6 10, 955 P.2d 1371, \u00b6 10. The substitution of counsel is within a district court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>City of Billings v.

He makes this argument for the first time on appeal. We may discretionarily review claimed errors-even absent timely objection-which implicate a defendant's fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v.

Did the District Court err in denying Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b642 A court presented with a speedy trial claim analyzes and balances four factors: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the accused\u2019s responses to the delay; and, (4) prejudice to the accused. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 106-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b643 On remand, the District Cotut held a two day speedy trial hearing which resulted in a 250 page transcript. There are also over 150 docket entries leading up to the June 2,2003, trial date, as well as transcripts from most of the pre-trial hearings. Also, the parties not only filed their original briefs, but filed supplemental briefs pertaining to the speedy trial issue. We examined the record and consider the <em>Ariegwe </em>factors as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b644 <em>Factor One: Length of the Delay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\n<em>A. The Interval between Accusation and Trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u00b645  The speedy trial clock begins to run at the earliest of arrest, indictment, or the filing of a complaint or information. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 42. Rose was arrested on January 11, 2002, in relation to the charges subsequently filed in District Court on January 23,2002. The trial date was June 2, 2003. The interval between the accusation and trial was 507 days, as found by the District Court on remand. This delay triggers further speedy trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">\n<em>B. The Extent to which the Delay Stretches beyond the Trigger Date.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">\u00b646 As a speedy trial analysis is triggered, we next consider the extent to which the delay, irrespective of fault for the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date. The delay stretched 307 days beyond the trigger date. As a result, under Factor Two the State\u2019s burden is to explain that its delay was not caused by bad faith, negligence or lack of diligence is increased substantially. Likewise, the presumption that pretrial delay prejudiced Rose is increased and the quantum of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>expected of Rose under Factor Four is substantially decreased.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b647 <em>Factor Two: The reasons for the delay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b648 Under Factor Two, we determine whether the reasons for the delay weigh for or against the conclusion that Rose\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated. The more delay caused by the State for \u201cunacceptable\u201d reasons (e.g., lack of diligence or bad faith), the more likely the right was violated. The more delay caused by Rose for such reasons (e.g., to avoid being brought to trial), the less likely the right was violated. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-72, 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b649 On January 11, 2002, Rose made his first appearance in Justice Court and was later scheduled to be arraigned in District Court on February 6,2002. At his arraignment in District Court, Rose moved to continue for an additional week before he pled so his counsel could review discovery materials, which was granted. Thus, we attribute seven days of delay to Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b650 On February 13, Rose appeared with counsel and pleaded not guilty. An Omnibus hearing was set for March 6, 2002. At the Omnibus hearing Rose was unprepared and requested a further delay to investigate whether he should move for a change of venue. This delay was granted. The court gave Rose until March 27 to make his motion. Thus we attribute 21 days of delay to Rose. At this time the court also set a settlement conference for April 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b651 On April 10, at a scheduled status hearing, Rose appeared with counsel and moved for a continuance of the April 18 settlement conference. The State objected, arguing it was necessary to press ahead in order to avoid speedy trial issues. However, the District Court granted Rose\u2019s motion and set a new settlement conference for May 2. On April 25, the District Court set Rose\u2019s trial for July 29. Thus, we attribute only 7 days of delay to Rose for the time between April 18 and April 25 when the District Court set the first trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u00b652 As noted in \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16, the District Court held to the July 29 trial date, even though Rose began making complaints about his lawyer until July 11, when Rose moved to continue the trial and filed a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Based on this motion, the trial was continued from July 29 until November 18, 2002. Thus, an additional 102 days of delay is attributed to Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u00b653 We note here that in most cases, once the defendant waived his right to a speedy trial, it is unnecessary to continue with an analysis of whether that right has been violated. However, in this case, the trial was not held as re-scheduled. Thus, we continue with the speedy trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00b654 On October 25, 2002, Rose appeared in court with counsel and moved to continue the November 18 trial for the purpose of obtaining a psychological examination to determine if the defense of mental disease or defect should be raised.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At yet another hearing held on October 28, 2002, the State objected to any further delay. It was the State, not Rose, which was concerned with Rose\u2019s right to a speedy trial. Rose said he understood that the exam would cause a further delay, but nevertheless desired to proceed with the mental examination. The District Court granted Rose\u2019s motion. At this time the court held off on rescheduling the trial until the examination was completed. On February 18, 2003, after the defense received the results of the psychological examination, the court set trial for May 12, 2003. Thus, we attribute an additional 171 days to Rose for the time between November 18, 2002, and May 12, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b655 On March 11, 2003, the trial was moved from May 12 to June 2, due to conflicts in the court\u2019s calendar. On June 2, 2003, the trial commenced as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b656 Based on our analysis of the record, of the 507 days of delay we attribute 199 days to the State and 308 days to Rose, as detailed above in \u00b6\u00b6 48-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b657 Institutional delay is delay that is inherent in the justice system and largely beyond the control of the justice system. This delay is attributed to the state but weighs less heavily against the State than delay caused by lack of diligence or bad faith in the balancing process because it is not delay that the State actively pursued or encouraged. <em>State v. Atkins, </em>277 Mont. 103, 107, 920 P.2d 481, 483 (1996). In this case, all of the delay attributable to the State is institutional delay. The record clearly reflects the State objected to Rose\u2019s requests for postponements from the beginning of the process. In this case it was the State, not Rose, concerned with protecting his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b658  To the contrary, Rose made complaints about his counsel and then withdrew those complaints, only to make the same complaints and again withdraw them. When a defendant makes requests for new counsel and then withdraws those requests only to renew those requests later, requiring a hearing and ultimately resulting in the withdrawal of counsel, the delay caused is appropriately attributed to the defendant. <em>State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 301 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>289, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24; <em>State v. Collier, </em>277 Mont. 46, 55-56, 919 P.2d 376, 382-83 (1997). Also, when the District Court inquired into Rose\u2019s complaints and explained that, if they were substantial, a hearing would be conducted to decide if counsel should be replaced, Rose said he would proceed. When he again complained about his representation, the District Court carefully explained to Rose that if he wanted new counsel it would cause a delay. Rose accepted the delay and went so far to file a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Then, after new counsel had time to prepare, and shortly before the trial was set, Rose filed a new request for further delay to advance a new defense, and then again complained about his lawyer\u2019s representation. Based on this record, we conclude it was Rose who caused the greater portion of the delay in bringing this case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b659 <em>Factor Three: Response to the delay and assertion of speedy trial right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b660 A defendant must assert his speedy trial right before the case goes to trial in order to assert the right on appeal. The evaluation of Rose\u2019s response to the delay must be based on surrounding circumstances, such as timeliness, persistence and sincerity of any objection to the delay, the reasons for any acquiescence in delay, and his pretrial conduct (as that conduct bears on the speedy trial right). <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-81. Conduct evidencing a desire to be brought to trial promptly weighs in Rose\u2019s favor whereas conduct demonstrating a desire to avoid trial weighs against Rose in the overall balancing. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b661 Rose, in a half-hearted fashion, asserted his right to speedy trial in letters sent directly to the District Court on March 11 and 28,2003, and in his writ of habeas corpus filed on April 16, 2003. He was also advised on several occasions that his various motions would result in delay of trial, at which time he said he understood but still wanted to make his belated motions even though he knew they would cause delay. He finally filed a formal motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial on May 23, 2003, 497 days after he was arrested and 10 days before trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b662 The State\u2019s response to the motions for delay indicates its desire to proceed to trial. The State was diligent in its attempt to bring the matter to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b663 The record in this case shows it was Rose who caused the delay over the objections of the prosecution. In sum, Factor Three tips the balance substantially against dismissal for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00b664 <em>Factor Four: Prejudice to Rose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b665 A presumption the accused was prejudiced by a trial delay arises after 200 days. As the length of delay grows beyond 200 days, the prejudice intensifies. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 56. The court must weigh each party\u2019s evidence (or lack thereof) in light of this intensifying presumption. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49, 51. Specifically, as the delay gets longer, the accused\u2019s duty to show prejudice decreases while the necessary showing by the State of no prejudice simultaneously increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b666  The length of delay in this case is sufficient to raise the presumption of prejudice to the degree that the State must make a highly persuasive showing Rose was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b667 The determination of how much mental and physical discomfort a defendant is forced to endure because of delay between the time of his or her arrest and the trial is a fact intensive inquiry. The factual nature of this determination is a principal reason why the trial courts, who personally see and hear the defendant and other witnesses, should in the ordinary case consider whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated. However, as noted above, this is not the ordinary case and this Court has a fully developed record which contains the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact concerning the degree which Rose personally suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b668 First, Rose argues his pretrial incarceration was oppressive, noting his weight loss and his grievance forms about the food and temperature at the Ravalli County Detention Center. Next, he argues the delay of his trial caused him substantial anxiety and concern as demonstrated by his nail biting, his mental illness for which he sought treatment, his parents\u2019 health problems and divorce, and his loss of work and contact with his daughter. These claims can be considered in light of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\u00b669 i. <em>Oppressive Pretrial Incarceration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u00b670 In assessing whether the pretrial incarceration in a given case is \u201coppressive,\u201d we consider all of the circumstances surrounding the incarceration. In <em>Ariegwe, </em>we identified a number of pertinent circumstances, including the duration of the incarceration, the complexity of the charged offense(s), any misconduct on the part of the accused directly related to the pretrial incarceration (e.g., a demonstrated likelihood to flee the jurisdiction of the court), whether the accused was incarcerated on a separate charge while awaiting trial on the instant charge, and the conditions of the incarceration, such as overcrowding and lack of recreational opportunities, adequate food, climate control, proper medical care, cleanliness, or legal research <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>capabilities. <em>Ariegwe, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>90-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b671 We agree with the District Court\u2019s findings of fact that although Rose\u2019s pretrial incarceration was lengthy, neither its length nor the conditions of incarceration were unduly oppressive in light of the very serious offenses with which Rose was charged, Rose\u2019s criminal history, and the potential danger Rose\u2019s release would pose to others. In addition, there is substantial evidence in the record which supports the District Court\u2019s determination Rose received sufficient medical treatment for a hip problem and other medical conditions while he was in detention, including medical appointments with a nurse and a physician, as well as treatment with various pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b672 In regard to Rose\u2019s complaints that his medical needs were not met, we also agree with the District Court and the United States District Court that the detention staff acted appropriately in their responses to grievances and were reasonably responsive to his mental health needs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b673  There is evidence the temperature in the jail was unsatisfactory for a short time. However, the problem was corrected. Considering the particular difficulties Rose suffered while incarcerated we do not conclude the District Court erred in finding that Rose\u2019s time in jail was not so uncomfortable that it was \u201coppressive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b674 ii. <em>The Accused\u2019s Anxiety and Concern.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b675 \u201c[T]he speedy trial guarantee serves <em>\u2018to </em>shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges,\u2019 not to eliminate the disruption altogether.\u201d <em>Ariegwe </em>\u00b6 97 (quoting <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1502 (1982). The question is whether the delay in bringing Rose to trial unduly prolonged the disruption or aggravated the anxiety and concern inherent in being accused of a crime. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 97, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"AMP\">\u00b676 Although the length of delay is, in this instance, significant, the State demonstrated Rose was, to say the least, anxious and in mental turmoil before his arrest on these charges. While his incarceration pending trial may have increased his mental unrest, Rose suffered with anxiety and mental illness before his arrest and had refused treatment. In fact, it was while he was incarcerated on these charges he finally requested and received treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b677 Rose claims the delay exacerbated his anxiety and concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>because Rose\u2019s mother underwent surgery and he was unable to be with her while she was ill. He also claims that being unable to spend more time with his teenage daughter caused additional anxiety and concern. We agree with the District Court while Mrs. Rose\u2019s medical condition was undoubtedly a source of anxiety for Rose, there is no evidence this anxiety was any greater than would reasonably be expected for someone who has a family member with a serious medical condition. In regard to his daughter, Rose did not spend much time with her previously, but only claimed he was trying to form a relationship at the time of his arrest. The District Court concluded any anxiety and concern Rose suffered regarding these family relationships may have been caused by his incarceration, but were not unduly aggravated by the delay in his trial. We cannot conclude from the record that the District Court erred in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b678 <em>Hi. The Possibility that the Defense will be impaired.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b679 The third interest protected in a consideration of prejudice to the defense caused by a delay in trial relates to the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98. Impairment of one\u2019s defense can be difficult to prove because time\u2019s erosion of exculpatory evidence and testimony can rarely be shown. For this reason, affirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b680 Rose argues the delay in bringing him to trial damaged his ability to present an effective defense because cell phone records disappeared, the truck in which the kidnapping took place was no longer available, and various witnesses were no longer available or could not remember certain details of the events in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b681 However, in spite of the delay, the State was able to demonstrate Rose\u2019s ability to present an effective defense was not demonstrably impaired. While incarcerated, Rose had access to at least three lawyers and a private investigator. While he did not always agree with the tactics and techniques of his attorneys, he had the ability to consult with them, advise them where evidence could be collected, and assist them in preparation for trial. With the use of his special investigator, Rose was able to secure and preserve any information or evidence which could have been exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b682 Rose\u2019s defense, after he decided to forgo the defense of mental disease or defect, was based on justifiable use of force. There were only two persons present at the time of the altercation between himself and Mr. Davies. Considering the circumstances, there is no reason to believe that cell phone records he claims are missing or the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>his pickup would have provided evidence which would tend to exculpate him. Nor is there any showing that a witness forgot exculpatory evidence. Likewise, there is nothing in the record revealing what the witnesses Rose claims could not be located could have testified to, nor is there a showing of how their testimony could have been relevant to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b683 The District Court concluded Rose was intimately familiar with the legal system and willing and able to assert every possible legal claim available. This weighs against him when deciding if his defense was impaired, which has been considered by many courts to be the most important factor in this analysis. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98. <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 532, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2193 (1972); <em>State v. Price, </em>2001 MT 212, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 381, \u00b6 28, 34 P.3d 112, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b684 <em>iv. Factor Four Summary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b685 In summary, Rose was incarcerated 507 days. However, due to the severity of the crimes and his criminal history, the length of time he was incarcerated does not rise to the level of oppressive. While Rose suggests his medical treatment was not sufficient, we conclude that under these circumstances, he was not unduly prejudiced by lack of medical care. The anxiety Rose suffered existed before his arrest and was not overly aggravated by delay. The anxiety Rose suffered came from the nature of the offenses and the general jail experience, not the delay in bringing him to trial. While the delay may have caused some witnesses to forget some details, there is no evidence this hampered his defense. Nor is there any indication as to how any alleged missing evidence would have been used at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b686 <em>Balancing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b687 We next determine whether Rose was deprived of his right to speedy trial in light <em>of </em>the facts of the case and the weight assigned to each of the four factors laid out above. \u201cNone of the factors is dispositive by itself; rather, the factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u00b688  Factor One weighs in favor of Rose. The period between his arrest and his trial date is 507 days. This is indeed a substantial delay. However, considering the reasons for the delay under Factor Two, the length of the delay does not require that the charges be dismissed. The entire 199 days of delay attributable to the State is institutional delay. The remaining portion of the delay, 308 days, was not only caused by Rose, the State repeatedly objected to his motions for continuances. Thus, we must conclude that Rose\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>violated by the length of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b689 Considering Rose\u2019s desire to proceed to trial, after the greater portion of the delay was incurred, he asserted his right to speedy trial but then delayed the trial by subsequent motions. In sum, Rose\u2019s actions were inconsistent with someone who desires to be brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b690 Finally, taking into consideration the crimes for which Rose was being held, the length of time incarcerated cannot be considered oppressive. The mental and physical problems Rose has were not unduly compounded by the amount of time he spent incarcerated. \u00b691 Importantly, an examination of the record leads to the conclusion that Rose\u2019s ability to defend himself was not impaired by the delay between his arrest and the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b692  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b693 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court err when it failed to hold a hearing on Rose\u2019s complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b694 Rose alleges the District Court erred in failing to hold a hearing on his complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel. The right to counsel does not include the right to select an attorney of one\u2019s own choosing or to require the particular attorney be appointed. <em>State v. Pepperling, </em>177 Mont. 464, 472, 582 P.2d 341, 346 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b695 We will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision on a request for the appointment of new counsel absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 10.

The inquiry by the district court is sufficient if the district court considers the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints. <em>City of Billings, </em>281 Mont. at 136-37, 932 P.2d at 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"Aze\">\u00b697 Rose sent letters directly to the judge regarding his concerns with his first court appointed attorney, Mansch. In response to the first letter, the judge questioned Rose about his current representation. Rose responded that the problems had been addressed, and no further conversation on the topic was needed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">Court: Mr. Rose, we had been here to address your concerns about your attorney. I\u2019m now in possession of a letter received by the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>court yesterday where you appeared to indicate that you\u2019ve worked through whatever concerns you have with Mr. Mansch here. Are you currently satisfied with his representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">Rose: Yes. Your Honor, the complaints I made last week in the letter were some things that I felt that we needed to go over and hadn\u2019t gone over yet, and we\u2019ve started to go over those things and started to work on some of those things, so, you know, that\u2019s what I was making reference to in the letter yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">Court: So at this time then there\u2019s no need to address the adequacy of your representation; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Rose: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u00b698 Later, upon receiving another complaint letter from Rose, the judge once again inquired into the matter and Rose responded he still had the same concerns and felt a new attorney was the best option. The judge, following the procedure suggested in <em>Weaver, </em>suggested a full hearing to determine if the complaints were so substantial that a different attorney was required. No hearing was held, however, as the lawyer said it would be more efficient for him to step aside. Rose and the District Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\u00b699 Another lawyer, Gahagan, was appointed and represented Rose for about a month before he was replaced by Sather. In January of 2003 Rose began sending letters to the court directly complaining about Sather. On February 12, 2003, the court questioned Rose about his representation by Sather. Rose responded he had concerns with her, but they were beginning to work through those. Rose also explained to the comb he was upset with the system in general. Finally, Rose informed the District Court that he simply wanted his concerns to be heard and noted by the court. As the District Court inquired into Rose\u2019s complaints and determined that he was in fact happy with counsel, there was no need to conduct a hearing to inquire further. <em>See Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">\u00b6100 On April 16, 2003, after receiving more letters from Rose complaining about Sather, the District Court appointed another attorney, Sasha Brownlee, to inquire into Rose\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">\u00b6101 After multiple meetings with both Rose and Sather, Brownlee filed a report with the court on May 16, 2003. Brownlee advised the District Court Rose made it clear to her he did not want Sather replaced; rather he wanted her to do things his way. Brownlee also advised the District Court that Sather\u2019s communication with Rose was not deficient. Rose did not inform the District Court that Brownlee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>conclusions were wrong, nor has he argued on appeal that her advice to the District Court was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b6102  When the District Court asked Rose what his problems with his lawyers were, he voiced no seemingly substantial complaints. When the District Court appointed yet another lawyer to inquire into Rose\u2019s complaints about Sather, he told her he did not want her replaced. The District Court did not err in failing to hold a separate hearing to determine if Rose was being effectively represented by counsel. <em>See </em>Gallagher, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b6103 <em>Issue 3: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Rose\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis that the prosecutor\u2019s statements during the State\u2019s closing argument denied Rose a fair and impartial trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b6104 Rose alleges two particular segments of the State\u2019s closing argument violated his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b6105 Rose first objects to the following comment made by the prosecutor near the end of his argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">The real question is, and the one reason the defendant took the stand in this particular case and just told you so many untruthful things, is he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019ll hold him accountable. He doesn\u2019t think that you, as members of the community, have the nerve to hold him accountable for his actions. He thinks that if he gets up and tells the big lie, that you\u2019re too gullible, you\u2019re too naive, you\u2019re too nice to imagine that anyone would do that, and he hopes that by doing that, he will escape his responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\u00b6106  A prosecutor invades the jury's province and engages in highly improper behavior when an attorney characterizes the defendant or witnesses as liars or offers personal opinions on a witness's credibility. <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 36, 339 Mont. 218, \u00b6 36,168 P.3d 685, \u00b6 36; <em>State v. Hanson, </em>283 Mont. 316, 326, 940 P.2d 1166, 1172 (1997). However, to properly preserve an issue for appeal the defendant must make a timely objection or it is considered waived. Section 46-20-104 (2), MCA. Rose did not contemporaneously object to this statement and thus the objection was waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having failed to object, Rose requests we employ our discretionary plain error review and reverse on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u00b6107 Our review of the closing arguments fails to persuade us the prosecutor's comments resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice, undermined the trial\u2019s fundamental fairness, or compromised the judicial process\u2019s integrity. We conclude Rose failed to preserve this argument for appeal and we decline to exercise our discretionary plain error review and do not consider this matter further. <em>See Racz, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"AzE\">\u00b6108 The second statement Rose objects to is about one of the weapons Rose used. In his closing argument the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">There\u2019s no question these things are weapons. There\u2019s just no question. We have got a utility knife \u2014 we all know this is the same sort of thing that the people that hijack the airplanes that ran into the World Trade Center, this is what they used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b6109 Rose asserts on appeal that using this language 21 months after the September 11 terrorist attacks was an improper tactic which appealed to the patriotic emotions of the jury. In this instance the prosecutor referred to the type of knife supposedly used in the attacks of September 11 as an example of how a utility knife could be a weapon of which one could reasonably be afraid. Again, Rose did not object to this analogy and our review of the record does not persuade us that the prosecutor's comment resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice, undermined the trial's fundamental fairness, or compromised the judicial process's integrity and we decline to exercise our discretionary plain error review. <em>See Racz, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>State v.

The right to counsel means the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2063 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b6112 This Court has adopted the two-prong test first enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>for evaluating a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See e.g. State v. Meza, </em>2006 MT 210, \u00b6 27, 333 Mont. 305, \u00b6 27, 143 P.3d 422, \u00b6 27; <em>State v.

A defendant who brings an ineffective assistance of counsel claim bears the burden of showing: (1) his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) his counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>failure was prejudicial. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 668, 104 S. Ct. at 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b6113 In regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test-whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient-the inquiry must be \u201c \u2018whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 14, 343 Mont. 90, \u00b6 14, 183 P.3d 861, \u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). Every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b6114 The pertinent inquiry, therefore, is not whether counsel acted because of ignorance or neglect but, rather, whether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms under the surrounding circumstances. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b6115 Under the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the defendant must show the existence of a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional conduct, the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 53 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068). The prejudice inquiry focuses on whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance renders the trial result unreliable or the proceedings fundamentally unfair. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 53 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S. Ct. at 2069).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u00b6116 Rose made no claim on appeal his counsel was ineffective by causing the delay between the time he was arrested and the time he was brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u00b6117 Even though Rose discharged his counsel and represented himself, he claims on appeal Sather was ineffective before he discharged her because during voir dire she failed to either properly question, or attempt to remove for cause, a prospective juror who previously worked at the county attorney\u2019s office. Rose asserts he is entitled to a new trial, relying on <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2005 MT 118, 327 Mont. 115, 112 P.3d 1005, where defense counsel admitted he was negligent in reviewing a jury questionnaire, and allowed a mother of a paralegal who worked for the prosecutor\u2019s office to sit on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">\u00b6118 A defendant is guaranteed an impartial jury by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 7. Voir dire in a criminal proceeding requires adequate questioning to assure counsel's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ability to challenge a prospective juror for cause. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 23, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"A98U\">\u00b6119 In this case, defense counsel has not admitted a mistake, as was the case in <em>LaMere. </em>In conducting voir dire, the prosecutor listed the witnesses that may be called to testify and then asked if any veniremen knew them. One remarked she knew one of the potential witnesses, a retired detective, because a couple of years previously she had held a temporary position in the county attorney\u2019s office. She then stated she would not tend to favor one side or the other and could hear the evidence and decide the case. She stated she would be fair. In her voir dire for the defense, Sather confirmed this potential juror knew the named witness. The juror then stated she also knew the Roses, years previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b6 120 There is nothing in the record that indicates this juror held any bias or prejudice. She had, years before, worked as a temporary employee in the county attorney\u2019s office and was also acquainted with the defendant\u2019s family. These facts do not indicate a bias or a prejudice. When there is nothing in the record to indicate a potential juror is biased, this Court does not presume she harbors a bias or prejudice. <em>Cf. State v. Ibarra-Salas, </em>2007 MT 173, \u00b6 22, 338 Mont. 191, \u00b6 22, 164 P.3d 898, \u00b6 22 (stating there is no presumption of juror bias for or against members of any particular racial or ethnic group). The juror, without coaching, affirmatively stated she could be fair, and would hear the evidence and decide the issues presented to her. As there is no record this particular juror had any bias or prejudice, we conclude counsel\u2019s assistance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms under the surrounding circumstances. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b6121 Finally, Rose takes a shotgun approach and argues under the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>he probably would not have been convicted if his counsel inspected and tested blood evidence in Davies\u2019 pickup where the offense occurred, because counsel did not object to evidence concerning his use ofmethamphetamine, and because counsel made no objection to a jury instruction that an intoxicated condition is not an excuse to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b6122 Rose argues the failure to preserve the pickup led to his inability to present blood evidence. Davies testified, and Rose does not deny, both he and Davies suffered bloody injuries in the cab of the pickup. How blood evidence could have been exculpatory remains a mystery.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u00b6123 Relating to methamphetamine use, after the trial had started, Rose decided to change his defense theory from lack of ability to form the intent to commit an offense because of mental disease or defect, to justifiable use of force. He then discharged his counsel, and proceeded <em>pro se. </em>When the State called the victim to testify, he said without objection, Rose was agitated and nervous the day of the offenses, that Rose told him that his girlfriend had spiked his hot chocolate with meth or speed, and that Rose wanted to go to a treatment center. Rose himself testified he was afraid and nervous that day, and also he would have gone to a treatment center. He also testified about his methamphetamine use. On appeal, Rose has not made a cogent argument as to why evidence of his methamphetamine use was error. Even if there were an error in introduction of such evidence, its introduction is attributable to Rose himself, not appointed counsel. Also, considering the evidence introduced, we see no error in giving the instruction concerning voluntary intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b6124  We conclude appointed counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances and did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b6125 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART and RICE and DISTRICT COURT JUDGE WATTERS, sitting for JUSTICE MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> Rose previously gave the State notice he might rely on the defense of justifiable use of force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\"> Rose filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court, which made a factual determination he was not being ill-treated and denied the writ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\"> By the time of closing arguments Rose had persuaded the District Court to allow him to represent himself with Sather as stand by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b339-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AYp\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u00b6126 I concur in the ultimate results the Court reaches on all four issues, but I do not agree with all of the Court\u2019s reasoning. My primary concerns relate to the Court\u2019s decision on the speedy trial issue (Issue 1). Thus, I limit my discussion here to that specific issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u00b6127 For one thing, the Court\u2019s speedy trial analysis contains a number of factual errors and unsupported legal propositions. The Court also paints extremely one-sided pictures of the circumstances related to Factors Two and Four. For instance, the Court unduly minimizes the conditions of Rose\u2019s incarceration and overstates the extent to which Rose caused pretrial delay. Along these same lines, the Court totally ignores the District Court\u2019s role in unnecessarily delaying Rose\u2019s trial. Lastly, in several instances, the Court misapplies the revised speedy trial test articulated in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. Under Factor Two in particular, the Court does not follow the approach we established in <em>Ariegwe </em>and repeated in <em>State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 124-134; <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-30.1 address these and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>other points in the following application of the <em>Ariegwe </em>test to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">FACTOR ONE: THE LENGTH OF THE DELAY</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b6128 I agree with the Court\u2019s calculation of a 507-day delay between arrest and trial. Opinion, \u00b6 45.1 also agree that the State\u2019s burden to justify the delay under Factor Two is \u201cincreased substantially\u201d and that the State must make a \u201chighly persuasive showing\u201d under Factor Four that Rose was not prejudiced by the delay. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 66. It is important to point out, however, that in <em>Ariegwe </em>the delay stretched 208 days beyond the 200-day trigger date for speedy trial analysis, <em>see Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123, while here the delay stretches 307 days beyond the trigger date. In <em>Ariegwe, </em>we stated that the State must provide \u201cparticularly compelling justifications\u201d for the delay under Factor Two and must make a \u201chighly persuasive showing\u201d under Factor Four that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123. Accordingly, the burden on the State in the present case is even heavier under these two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">FACTOR TWO: THE REASONS FOR THE DELAY</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b6129 At the outset of discussing Factor Two, I note that my primary disagreement with the Court\u2019s analysis is its failure to acknowledge and properly attribute the substantial amount of avoidable delay in this case. As explained below, there are significant blocks of time during which no trial date was set, which in turn created delay for which there was no constitutionally acceptable justification. Such delay certainly cannot be blamed on Rose, as the Court has done. Rather, it must be attributed to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b6130 In this connection, it is necessary to recall the basic principles which dictate our approach under Factor Two. For one, \u201c \u2018the primary burden\u2019 to assure that cases are brought to trial is \u2018on the courts and the prosecutors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 72 (quoting <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 529, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2191 (1972)). \u201cA defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; the State has that duty.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 92 S. Ct. at 2190 (footnote omitted); <em>accord State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 23, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 23, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 23. Moreover, \u201csociety has a particular interest in bringing swift prosecutions, and <em>society\u2019s representatives </em>are the ones who should protect that interest.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 92 S. Ct. at 2190 (emphasis added). Thus, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the prosecutor <em>and the trial court </em>have an affirmative constitutional obligation to try the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>in a timely manner and that this duty requires a good faith, diligent effort to bring him to trial quickly. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 65. Consistent with these principles, the prosecution bears the burden of explaining pretrial delays. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">First Trial Setting: July 29, 2002 (199 Days of Delay)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b6131 Rose became an \u201caccused\u201d on January 11, 2002, when he was arrested in relation to the charges ultimately filed in the District Court. The first trial date set by the District Court was July 29, 2002. This constitutes a 199-day delay between arrest and the first trial setting. The District Court attributed this delay to the State as institutional delay. This Court appears to attribute 35 days of it to Rose. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51. An analysis under <em>Ariegwe </em>reveals both to be incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b6132 The following events occurred following Rose\u2019s arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u2022 January 11: Initial appearance in Justice Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u2022 January 23: Filing of the Information in District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u2022 February 6: Initial appearance in District Court. Upon inquiry by the court, defense counsel stated that he had recently received about 160 pages of discovery and needed time to review it before Rose would enter his plea. The court scheduled entry of plea for February 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u2022 February 13: Rose entered a plea of not guilty. The District Court scheduled the omnibus hearing for March 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u2022 March 6: Omnibus hearing. The District Court approved the Omnibus Hearing Memorandum. In addition, pursuant to its trial procedure, the court ordered Rose and the State to conduct a \u201cface to face settlement conference\u201d on April 18. The court stated that a trial date would \u201cbe set thereafter if necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u2022 April 10: Status hearing. Defense counsel requested a continuance of the settlement conference. The District Court reset the conference for May 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u2022 April 24: Hearing to address Rose\u2019s complaints about defense counsel. At the conclusion of this hearing, the prosecutor and defense counsel advised the court that the case had not been settled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">\u2022 April 25: The District Court entered an order setting trial for July 29, 2002 (95 days out).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">\u00b6133 The 95-day delay between April 25 and the July 29 trial date is attributable to the State as institutional delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 68. But the 104-day delay between January 11 (Rose\u2019s arrest) and April 25 is another matter. Again, the primary burden to assure that cases are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>brought to trial is on the courts and the prosecutors, and the trial court itself has an \u201c \u2018affirmative constitutional obligation\u2019 \u201d to make a good faith, diligent effort to bring the defendant to trial quickly. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65, 72. Given these constitutional mandates, there is simply no justification for a trial court\u2019s failing to select a trial date at the earliest practical opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b6134 Notably, in <em>Ariegwe, </em>the district court set trial at Ariegwe\u2019s arraignment. In <em>Billman, </em>the district court issued an order 20 days after Billman\u2019s arraignment scheduling the omnibus hearing and setting a trial date. In this case, however, the District Court did not set trial until well after the omnibus hearing. The State offers no justification for delaying until 50 days after the omnibus hearing and 71 days after Rose\u2019s arraignment to set a trial date which, as noted, was 95 days out.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b6135 Absent exceptional circumstances, a trial court should be able to select a trial date by the time of the omnibus hearing or promptly thereafter. The purpose of this hearing, which is to be held \u201c[w]ithin a reasonable time following the entry of a not guilty plea but not less than 30 days before trial,\u201d is \u201cto expedite the procedures leading up to the trial of the defendant.\u201d Section 46-13-110(1), (2), MCA. At this point in time, the parties should have a good idea of whether a trial is \u201cnecessary.\u201d Indeed, \u00a7 46-13-110(3), MCA, instructs the prosecutor and defense counsel to be prepared to discuss a number of pretrial matters, including the existence of a plea agreement; reliance on certain defenses; intent to seek persistent felony offender status; intent to rely on evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts; and change of venue. While a \u201cface to face settlement conference\u201d after the omnibus hearing might ultimately resolve the case, that is beside the point. There is always a risk that the case will <em>not </em>be settled, and the speedy trial right prohibits the court from placing that risk on the defendant by refusing to select a trial date until after the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b6136 Here, on March 6, the District Court required the parties to have a \u201cface to face settlement conference\u201d on April 18 and stated that a trial date would be set thereafter, \u201cif necessary.\u201d While this procedure may have enabled the court to set only \u201cnecessary\u201d trial dates, it conflicted with the court\u2019s affirmative constitutional obligation to ensure that criminal defendants are brought to trial expeditiously. Fifty days later, after being apprised by the prosecutor and defense counsel that the case remained unresolved, the court set trial. Presumably, July 29 was the earliest suitable date; however, this does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>not change the fact that a suitable date roughly 50 days earlier might have been possible had the court not delayed setting Rose\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ALL\">\u00b6137 The Court asserts that Rose\u2019s counsel was \u201cunprepared\u201d at the March 6 omnibus hearing and requested additional time to investigate whether he should move for a change of venue. Opinion, \u00b6 50. Conspicuously absent from the Court\u2019s discussion, however, is the fact that the prosecutor likewise was \u201cunprepared\u201d and, thus, requested additional time to file his notice under <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 274, 602 P.2d 957, 963-64 (1979), and <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142-43, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991). The District Court gave defense counsel until March 27 to file a change of venue motion and gave the prosecutor until March 29 to file his <em>Just/Matt </em>notice. Nevertheless, the Court assigns 21 days of delay to Rose. Opinion, \u00b6 50. This approach is erroneous for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b6138 First, the District Court\u2019s policy, as stated in the Omnibus Hearing Memorandum, was not to set a trial date until after the settlement conference, which was slated for April 18. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s request for additional time to investigate a change of venue had absolutely no impact on the setting of a trial date in this case. Both his investigation and his motion were to be completed several weeks before the settlement conference was to occur. Consequently, the Court here is doing exactly what we said in <em>Ariegwe </em>a court should not do: \u201cconsider any actions taken by the State or the accused which do not result in a postponement of the trial date.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 63. Defense counsel\u2019s request did not delay Rose\u2019s trial; thus, there is no basis for the Court to assign Rose the 21 days of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b6139 Second, and more to the point, neither Rose\u2019s request for additional time to investigate a change of venue nor the State\u2019s request for additional time to file its <em>Just/Matt </em>notice precluded the District Court from setting a trial date. The record reflects that that a three-to four-month delay between setting a trial date and holding the trial was typical for the District Court during this period. Had the court set trial on March 6 for June 10, instead of setting it on April 25 for July 29, 50 days of delay could have been averted. While this might appear to be speculative, the critical point here is that the State has the burden of justifying the pretrial delays, and that burden in this case is \u201cincreased substantially\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 46) due to the extent of the delay. Yet, the State has offered no justification for the District Court\u2019s waiting until April 25 to select a trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b6140 Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the 199-day delay between arrest and the first trial setting is properly attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>as follows. First, from the January 11 arrest to the March 6 omnibus hearing (54 days): Accepting, for the sake of argument, the Court\u2019s assertion that Rose delayed the selection of a trial date by 7 days when he requested time to review discovery before entering his plea (Opinion, \u00b6 49), 47 days are attributable to the State as institutional delay and 7 days are attributable to Rose as acceptable delay in preparing his case. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 68-72. Second, from March 7 to April 25 (50 days): Because this delay resulted from the District Court\u2019s decision to postpone setting Rose\u2019s trial date, for which the State has provided no justification, it is attributable to the State and weighted more heavily than unavoidable delay inherent in the criminal justice system. <em>See e.g. Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 126-128. Lastly, from April 26 to July 29 (95 days): These days are attributable to the State as institutional delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Second Trial Setting: November 18, 2002 (112 Days of Delay<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b6141 The Court notes that on July 11, 2002, defense counsel filed a motion to continue the trial and included a \u201cwaiver\u201d of Rose\u2019s right to a speedy trial. Opinion, \u00b6 52. Based on this single fact, the Court attributes all 112 days to Rose. Opinion, \u00b6 52. While I do not necessarily disagree with the Court that Rose is responsible for some, if not all, of this delay, the question is not as straightforward as the Court\u2019s reasoning suggests. For one thing, the Court simply assumes that Rose\u2019s supposed \u201cwaiver\u201d was valid. Moreover, the Court fails to consider a number of pertinent circumstances related to the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>Rose\u2019s Motion to Continue and \u201cWaiver\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b6142 Through a series of letters sent to the District Court in April, May, and June 2002, Rose expressed dissatisfaction with court-appointed counsel Larry Mansch. At a status hearing held June 19, Rose stated that he wanted a different attorney, and Mansch indicated that his ability to communicate with Rose had been compromised. Mansch advised the court that he had spoken with Dustin Gahagan about assuming the case, and the County Attorney concurred with this suggestion, stating that \u201cthe best thing we could do at this point is relieve Mr. Mansch, appoint Mr. Rose another attorney, with the understanding that trial is set for July 31st [sic], I think that gives the other attorney time to come up to speed on the case.\u201d Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>court appointed Gahagan to replace Mansch and instructed Gahagan to advise the court if a trial postponement was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b6143 On July 11, Gahagan filed the motion to continue, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">The undersigned has not been on this case very long and needs additional time to review the evidence and prepare a defense. Defendant has signed a handwritten waiver of his right to a speedy trial and the undersigned will execute and file a more formal waiver in the near future.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> Another reason for the request is that the undersigned is no longer a part of the \u201cconflict public defender\u201d contract with Ravalli County. Because the undersigned is currently extremely busy, the new \u201cconflict public defenders\u201d have been contacted about taking over this case and they have indicated that they would also need additional time to prepare for trial. County Attorney George Corn has been contacted and does not oppose a continuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Attached to the motion was a piece of paper on which a single handwritten statement appeared: \u201cI Robert L. Rose here by wave [sic] my Right to a Quick and Speedy Trial.\u201d This statement was dated July 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b6144 On July 12, Rose sent a letter to the District Court in which he explained, on one hand, that \u201cI was hoping not to have to wave [sic] my Right to a speedy trial,\u201d but on the other hand, that \u201cI do not feel it is possible for me to have a fair trial if it is not postponed.\u201d According to Rose, Gahagan had told him that he (Gahagan) would not have time to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b6145 On July 19, the District Court sent Rose a letter stating that the motion to continue would he granted. In addition, the court informed Rose that Gahagan \u201cis no longer a contract public defender which may require reassignment of your defense to the new conflict public defenders in the immediate future.\u201d Also on July 19, Gahagan filed a motion to substitute Kelli Sather as defense counsel \u201cfor the reason that Kelli S. Sather and Sasha Brownlee now have the conflict contract with Ravalli County and all cases need to be transferred to new counsel.\u201d The court granted this motion on July 22. On July 29, the District Court entered an order resetting trial for November 18.</p>\n<p id=\"A8H\">\u00b6146 Without citation to any authority, the Court asserts that \u201cin most cases, once the defendant waived his right to a speedy trial, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>unnecessary to continue with an analysis of whether that right has been violated.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 53. This statement is patently incorrect. Assuming for the moment that Rose\u2019s one-sentence \u201cwaiver\u201d is valid, it was attached to a <em>specific </em>motion to continue, and nothing in the waiver indicates that Rose intended to waive his right to a speedy trial for <em>all </em>pretrial delays. The waiver, rather, was intended (as Rose later confirmed in his July 12 letter) to secure a continuance of the July 29 trial date. The Supreme Court has said that courts \u201cshould indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d and \u201cnot presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 525-26, 92 S. Ct. at 2189 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court errs in suggesting that Rose\u2019s supposed waiver applied to all of the delays in this case. <em>See United States v. DeLongchamps, </em>679 F.2d 217, 219 (11th Cir. 1982) (\u201cThe defendants\u2019 waivers were manifestly intended to secure a continuance and were submitted for no other purpose. Indulging every reasonable presumption against waiver of the right to a speedy trial, we decline to hold that the waivers extended to other delays in this case.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b6147 At a more fundamental level, however, I question the validity of this waiver. It is well-established that \u201cany waiver of one\u2019s constitutional rights must be made specifically, voluntarily, and knowingly.\u201d <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 25, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6 25, 41 P.3d 305, \u00b6 25 (citing <em>Park v. District Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 36, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 36, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 36, in turn citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1023 (1938), and State <em>v. Lucero, </em>151 Mont. 531, 538, 445 P.2d 731, 735 (1968)). The Supreme Court has \u201cplaced the entire responsibility on the prosecution to show that the claimed waiver was knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191. The State, however, has made no effort in the present case to show that Rose\u2019s waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b6148 In this connection, Rose contends that he was \u201cforced\u201d to choose between his right to effective assistance of counsel and his right to a speedy trial. He cites <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S. Ct. 967 (1968), in which the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">[The defendant] was obliged either to give up what he believed, with advice of counsel, to be a valid Fourth Amendment claim or, in legal effect, to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In these circumstances, we find it intolerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 394, 88 S. Ct. at 976. Rose also relies on <em>State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, 324 Mont. 444, 103 P.3d 538, in which we agreed with the following argument by defense counsel in support of Blair\u2019s speedy trial motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201c[Rjegardless of the fact that I am in fact Mr. Blair\u2019s third attorney and that he had two before, he is in no way responsible for that. He\u2019s not accountable for that, and certainly is entitled, regardless of personnel changes in the Yellowstone County Public Defender\u2019s Office, to a timely and effective representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWu\"><em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b6149 In the present case, according to the report filed by Sasha Brownlee in May 2003, Gahagan asked Rose to sign the purported waiver \u201cas Gahagan was no longer going to work for the county and [Rose] would be assigned new counsel.\u201d A defendant, however, cannot be required to waive his right to a speedy trial simply because the public defender contract is changing hands and his new counsel will not be prepared for trial. It is doubtful that such a waiver is \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Moreover, the defendant certainly should not be blamed for delay caused by personnel changes within the public defender system.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b6150 I accept that Rose\u2019s objections to Mansch\u2019s representation, which ultimately led to Mansch\u2019s replacement on June 19, contributed to the need for a continuance of the July 29 trial date. On the other hand, Rose could not be required to choose between his right to effective assistance of counsel on one hand and his right to a speedy trial on the other. <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 394, 88 S.Ct. at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\n<em>The State\u2019s Motion to Add Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A98\">\u00b6151 Wholly aside from the substitutions of Rose\u2019s appointed counsel, another event occurring in early July 2002 bears on the instant discussion. Section 46-11-401(2), MCA, requires the prosecution to \u201cinclude endorsed on the information or indictment the names of the witnesses for the prosecution, if known.\u201d When the prosecutor filed the Information on January 23,2002, he endorsed ten witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u2022 RCSO Lt.

However, on July 8, a mere 21 days before trial, the State filed a motion to add 13 new witnesses to the Information. The following witnesses were listed in the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u2022 Sgt.

Defense counsel filed the motion to continue the trial two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">\u00b6153 The prosecutor offered no justification for not endorsing these witnesses sooner, and it is difficult to conceive of a meritorious explanation for why the prosecution apparently was unaware, prior to July 8, 2002, that Kirk Davies (one of the victims of the charged offenses), five members of the Ravalli County Sheriff s Office, and four healthcare professionals from Marcus Daly Hospital had relevant testimony to provide at Rose\u2019s trial. In any event, the point here is that even if Mansch had stayed on as Rose\u2019s counsel, the State\u2019s endorsement of 13 new witnesses 21 days before trial likely would have necessitated a continuance. For this reason, I cannot agree with the State\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere would have been no delay but for Rose\u2019s request for new counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b6154 The State must provide particularly compelling justifications for the delay in this case. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123. Moreover, \u201c[a]ny delay not demonstrated to have been caused by [Rose] or affirmatively waived by [Rose] ... is attributed to the State by default.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 65. If these standards are to have any meaning in our speedy trial framework, I cannot agree with the Court that the 112-day delay between the first and second trial settings should be attributed solely to Rose. Opinion, \u00b6 52. The State has the burden to show that that Rose\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d was made knowingly and voluntarily, but the State has not done so. The State also has the burden to show that postponement of the July 29 trial date was caused by Rose, but the record is ambiguous on this point. The postponement may have been necessitated by institutional changes in the public defender system, by the prosecution\u2019s motion to add 13 new witnesses 21 days before trial, by the replacement of Mansch at Rose\u2019s request about six weeks before trial, or by all of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b6155 The Court makes the valid point that \u201c[w]hen a defendant makes requests for new counsel and then withdraws those requests only to renew those requests later, requiring a hearing and ultimately resulting in the withdrawal of counsel, the delay caused is appropriately attributed to the defendant.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 58 (citing <em>State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, and <em>State v. Collier, </em>277 Mont. 46, 55-56, 919 P.2d 376, 382-83 (1996)). Yet, the record in this case does not establish that Rose\u2019s complaints about court-appointed counsel were meritless. <em>See Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 24 (observing that Ellenburg\u2019s \u201cmeritless\u201d complaints delayed his trial). And to the extent Rose\u2019s complaints were made in the legitimate exercise of his right to effective assistance of counsel, he cannot be charged with the resulting delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b6156 For these reasons, I conclude that responsibility for the 112 days should be shouldered in part (if not in whole) by the State, given the State\u2019s heavy burden to justify the delay and the State\u2019s failure to make the proper showings here. That being said, attributing the 112 days to Rose (as does the Court, <em>see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 52) does not change my ultimate conclusion under Factor Two. Thus, for the sake of argument, I will assume that this delay is attributable to Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Third Trial Setting: May 12, 2003 (175 Days of Delay<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b6157 On October 25, 2002, defense counsel (Sather) filed a Motion for Psychological Examination. At a hearing on October 28, the District Court advised Rose that the trial would have to be rescheduled if an evaluation was conducted. Rose indicated that he understood this. The court then granted the motion. The court stated, however, that a new trial date would not be set until the evaluation was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b6158 Of the 175 days between November 18, 2002 (second trial setting) and May 12, 2003 (third trial setting), the District Court attributed 86 days to Rose and 89 days to the State. The court reasoned that the time it took to complete the psychological evaluation was Rose\u2019s responsibility and the time between completing the evaluation and trial was the State\u2019s responsibility. The flaw in this reasoning, however, is that these two time periods could have elapsed <em>simultaneously </em>had the court promptly rescheduled trial upon granting Rose\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b6159 The first trial date in this case was set on April 25, 2002, for July 29, 2002 (about three months out); the second trial date was set on July 29,2002, for November 18,2002 (nearly four months out); and the third trial date was set on February 19, 2003, for May 12, 2003 (almost three months out). Thus, on October 28, 2002, when the court granted the Motion for Psychological Examination and vacated the existing trial date, had the court then set a new trial date, the new date likely would have been sometime in February 2003. (Actually, the prosecutor pointed out during the October 28 hearing that \u201ctrial dates are already being scheduled in March.\u201d) But that did not occur. Rather, the court stated that \u201cI won\u2019t set [the trial date] until we get the report in.\u201d As a result, there is a significant period of time (October 28, 2002, to February 19, 2003) during which there was no trial date set in this case at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b6 160 Such delay is unacceptable, and it clearly is not attributable to Rose. As explained above, the trial court shares the duty of assuring that a criminal case is brought to trial expeditiously. This includes maintaining a trial date. Having a pending trial date provides an impetus for the parties to prepare their cases diligently for trial, which in turn lessens the chance of a speedy trial violation. It also creates a favorable situation in which \u201cdocket delay\u201d (i.e., delay caused by the reality that trial dates have to be set a number of months in advance) transpires <em>simultaneously </em>with the time required by the parties to prepare their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b6161 By waiting until February 19, 2003, to set a trial date, the District Court created needless delay (during which, incidentally, Rose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>was incarcerated). Had the court, on October 28, 2002, set a trial date for, e.g., March 3, 2003 (about four months out), and had Rose\u2019s counsel requested additional time to review the psychological report (which counsel received during the first week of February 2003), then such delay would have been properly attributed to Rose. But Rose was never even given the opportunity to proceed to trial in early March 2003 because the District Court failed to set a new trial date promptly after it vacated the November 18, 2002 trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b6162 This Court attributes the entire 175-day period to Rose on the ground that his Motion for Psychological Examination caused the District Court to vacate the November 18 trial date. Opinion, \u00b6 54. Yet, for the reasons just discussed, although Rose\u2019s motion caused the court to vacate the existing trial date, the motion did not in any way preclude the court from promptly setting a new trial date. Rather, the court of its own accord decided to allow four months to pass by without a pending trial date in Rose\u2019s case. Notably, the parties were ready to proceed in mid-February 2003, but they had to wait an additional three months to go to trial due entirely to the District Court\u2019s failure to maintain a trial setting for Rose on the court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b6163 For these reasons, I conclude that of the 175 days between the second and third trial settings, the 93 days of avoidable delay during which no trial date was set (November 18,2002, to February 19,2003) is attributable to the State and weighs more heavily than institutional delay. The remaining 82 days are attributable to Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Fourth Trial Setting: June 2, 2003 (21 Days of Delay)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b6164 This postponement was necessitated by a conflict in the District Court\u2019s calendar. The 21-day delay is attributable to the State as institutional delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b6165 In sum, the interval between accusation and trial in this case was 507 days. Of that, 306 days (60 percent) are attributable to the State as follows: 163 days as institutional delay, and 143 days as avoidable delay in setting trial dates. The remaining 201 days (40 percent) are attributable to Rose due to his trial preparations. Significantly, there is no evidence of stonewalling on the part of the prosecution. Indeed, on a number of occasions, the prosecution expressed concern about the speedy trial issue and objected to postponing the trial date. On the other hand, given the State\u2019s substantially increased burden to justify the delay in this case (Opinion, \u00b6 46), and given the amount of delay attributable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>State that could have been avoided, I conclude that Factor Two weighs in Rose\u2019s favor, though only slightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">FACTOR THREE: ROSE\u2019S RESPONSES TO THE DELAY<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b6166 At the outset, I note the Court\u2019s assertion that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s response to the motions for delay indicates its desire to proceed to trial.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 62. As explained in <em>Ariegwe, </em>however, the critical question under Factor Three is \u201cwhether <em>the accused </em>actually wanted to be brought to trial promptly.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 76 (emphasis added). The State\u2019s desire to proceed to trial has little, if any, relevance to this question. Rather, we must evaluate <em>Rose\u2019s </em>responses to the pretrial delays. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-81. Conduct evidencing a desire to be brought to trial promptly weighs in Rose\u2019s favor, whereas conduct demonstrating a desire to avoid trial weighs against Rose in the overall balancing. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b6167 Some of Rose\u2019s pretrial letters suggest ongoing frustration about the pace at which defense counsel was investigating and preparing the defense. Yet, many of Rose\u2019s actions (such as the repeated about-faces concerning Mansch\u2019s representation and the request for a psychological examination in spite of the fact that it would require a trial postponement) suggest that Rose was not overly concerned about the pretrial delays. Likewise, although Rose asserted his right to a speedy trial in a number of court filings beginning in late-February 2003, the sincerity of these assertions is questionable. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 61 (referring to Rose\u2019s assertions as \u201chalf-hearted\u201d). Considering the totality of Rose\u2019s conduct, I agree with the Court that Factor Three weighs in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">FACTOR FOUR: PREJUDICE TO ROSE</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b6168 Under Factor Four, we assess whether Rose was prejudiced in the light of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect: preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, minimizing anxiety and concern, and limiting the possibility that the defense will be impaired. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 86-88. As noted, the State must make a \u201chighly persuasive showing\u201d that Rose was not prejudiced by the delay. Opinion, \u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u00b6169 I generally agree with the Court\u2019s analysis under Factor Four (Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 69-85), except with respect to the oppressiveness of the incarceration. Rose was incarcerated at the Ravalli County Detention Center (RCDC) for the entire 507 days between arrest on January 11, 2002, and trial on June 2, 2003. He spent the first seven months isolated in a maximum security cell. He testified in the District Court (during the speedy trial hearing) that he was not allowed contact with other inmates during this period. He was in his cell for at least 23 hours a day, and some days he was not let out of his cell at all. His only human contact was with the guards when they delivered his meals through a food slot. He ate alone in his cell, which was seven feet wide and approximately ten feet long and had a cement floor, a cement ceiling, cinderblock walls, and a stainless steal toilet and sink. The only window was a four inch by four inch piece of glass in the door.</p>\n<p id=\"Avb\">\u00b6170 Rose claims he was placed in isolation despite strong indications that he suffered from existing mental health issues including bipolar disorder. Rose cites <em>Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872, in which we recognized \u201cthe psychological harm caused by placing inmates in a severely restrictive setting for nearly 24 hours a day,\u201d which can manifest as massive anxiety, acute confusion, paranoia, concentration and memory problems, and aggressive or self-destructive behaviors. <em>Walker, </em>\u00b6 66. In this connection, Paul Graves, who met with Rose almost weekly as part of the jail ministry, testified that Rose lost around 15 or 20 pounds during his isolation and that the slight limp Rose had when they first met appeared to worsen over this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b6171 During the winter months, Rose\u2019s cell was \u201cunbearable\u201d in terms of temperature. Rose testified that there were \u201ctimes you could see your breath in the cell and there was just no relief.\u201d He was allowed only one blanket and would \u201cshiver all night long.\u201d He also stated that he was threatened with disciplinary action when he plugged a vent that blew cold air into his cell. Cathy Powell, RCDC Commander, acknowledged at the speedy trial hearing that there had been problems with the heating. She testified that these problems have since been remedied.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b6172 The State asserts that \u201c[njeither the length nor the conditions of Rose\u2019s pretrial incarceration were oppressive in light of the nature of the charged offenses, Rose\u2019s criminal history and Rose\u2019s drug history.\u201d The Court appears to agree. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 71. Yet, even if Rose\u2019s pretrial incarceration was necessitated to an extent by the factors set forth in the bail statute (\u00a7 46-9-301, MCA), nothing about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the nature of the charged offenses, Rose\u2019s criminal history, or Rose\u2019s drug history could justify subjecting him for an extended period of time to the conditions discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b6173 Rose was incarcerated for 507 days in a short-term holding facility. He spent the first seven months isolated in a maximum security cell. Considering the duration and conditions of that incarceration, I conclude that the incarceration was oppressive. However, as noted, I agree with the Court that the delay in bringing Rose to trial did not unduly prolong the disruption of his life or aggravate the anxiety and concern inherent in being accused of a crime. Opinion, \u00b6 77. Likewise, it does not appear that the delay significantly impaired Rose\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83. For these reasons, I conclude that Factor Four weighs slightly in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">BALANCING</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b6174 There was a substantial delay of 507 days between Rose\u2019s arrest and his last scheduled trial date. A significant portion of that delay (28 percent) was caused by the District Court\u2019s delay in setting trial dates. And Rose\u2019s incarceration was oppressive due to the conditions of the incarceration and the amount of time Rose was subjected to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b6175 On the other hand, there is no evidence of stonewalling by the prosecution. To the contrary, the prosecutor objected to several of the delays in this case. Moreover, Rose is responsible for 40 percent of the delay, and his actions during much of the pretrial period suggest that he was not overly concerned about the delays. Finally, it does not appear that Rose\u2019s ability to present an effective defense was significantly impaired by the delay or that the delay aggravated or unduly prolonged Rose\u2019s anxiety and concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b6176 For these reasons, I reach the same conclusion as the Court: The District Court did not err<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in denying Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. I base this conclusion, however, on the foregoing analysis under <em>Ariegwe.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b354-9\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Special Concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> The Court calculates \u201c102 days.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 52.
