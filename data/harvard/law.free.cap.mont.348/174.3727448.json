Smith contends that the court erred in not granting his motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b62 Smith has raised three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b63 1. Do Montana courts possess personal jurisdiction of Mr. Smith?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b64 2. Did Mr. Smith waive his objection to personal jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by acting in disregard for Mr. Smith\u2019s rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b66 For the reasons set forth below, we determine that issue two is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b67 The Smiths were married in Roundup, Montana in 1981. Their three children were born in Montana. In 1991 they moved to Georgia. They were divorced in Georgia in 2003 at which time Bristol returned to Montana with the two younger children. In the Settlement Agreement entered in the Georgia court, Smith agreed to \u201cpay, be solely responsible for, and hold [Bristol] harmless from: all debts incurred during the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\u00b68 In April 2006, Bristol filed a Petition for Contempt in the Montana Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County. She alleged Smith failed to pay marital debts as agreed. Smith\u2019s counsel appeared and indicated to the court that he might file a motion objecting to personal jurisdiction. The District Court, orally and by subsequent written order of January 18, 2007, ordered that Smith submit his motion and brief by February 9, 2007. The court also set a hearing for March 13, 2007. The court\u2019s order specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">[i]n the event the Petitioner [Smith] does not file a motion to challenge the jurisdiction of this Court, the hearing on the Verified Petition for Contempt is set for March 13, 2007 at 2:30 p.m.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">\u00b69 Smith did not submit a motion or brief in the time frame required by the court nor did he request an extension of time to file a motion and brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">\u00b610 At the March 13, 2007 hearing, Smith\u2019s counsel, despite not having filed a motion and brief, raised the question of personal jurisdiction over Smith. The court responded by requiring briefing on the question of whether Smith\u2019s failure to file a motion and brief as ordered by the court \u201ctrumped [Smith\u2019s] right to object to jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and on the underlying jurisdiction objection.\u201d The brief was to be filed by March 23, 2007. Smith filed a timely brief but only addressed the question of personal jurisdiction. Contrary to the court\u2019s specific direction, he did not address the question of whether his failure to file the motion and brief by the initial February 9th deadline amounted to a waiver of the issue of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b611 Noting that Smith had failed to timely challenge personal jurisdiction and then failed to brief the question of whether that failure constituted a waiver of the jurisdictional argument, the court overruled Smith\u2019s objection to its exercise of personal jurisdiction, simultaneously denying his Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b612 At the subsequent trial of the matter, Smith failed to appear by phone, video or in person. On appeal he challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b613 Whether a district court properly ruled on a motion to dismiss is a conclusion of law which we review to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Filip v. Jordan, </em>2008 MT 234, \u00b6 7, 344 Mont. 402, \u00b6 7, 188 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b614 Smith relies on our decision in <em>Heinle v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>260 Mont. 489, 861 P.2d 171 (1993) in support of his argument that the question of waiver is immaterial because the \u201ccontrolling consideration is whether the Montana court had a constitutional basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over [Smith]....\u201d <em>Heinle, </em>260 Mont. at 493, 861 P.2d at 173. Smith points out that, although the out-of-state father in <em>Heinle </em>did not make a timely objection to the exercise of personal jurisdiction, this Court nonetheless concluded the judgment with respect to child support was void for lack of jurisdiction. The <em>Heinle </em>case, however, is distinguishable from the present situation because <em>Heinle </em>involved a default judgment entered against the father when he failed to appear. We reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">the dispositive question is whether the court had a constitutional basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over Howard and enter a money judgment against him. It is well established that if a court does not properly acquire personal jurisdiction over a defendant, a default judgment entered against that defendant is void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI9\"><em>Heinle, </em>260 Mont. at 492, 861 P.2d at 173. Unlike <em>Heinle, </em>the judgment against Smith was not a default judgment. Rather, Smith, through counsel, filed an appearance on September 11, 2006. Smith\u2019s counsel then appeared at status conferences on November 21, 2006, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>January 16,2007, without filing any challenges to the District Court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction. As a result of counsel\u2019s comment at the January 16th conference that he was going to challenge personal jurisdiction, the District Court set a briefing schedule to address that issue. As set fourth above, Smith failed to comply with that briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b615 Rule 12(b) M. R. Civ. P. provides that at the option of the pleader, the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction can be raised by way of motion. Smith\u2019s counsel indicated to the court that he wished to raise the defense by way of a motion. Accordingly, the court set a time frame within which to brief and address the issue. Smith did not comply with that schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b616 Lack of personal jurisdiction is a waivable defense. Rule 12(h)(1)(B) M. R. Civ. P. provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">[a] defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person ... is waived ... if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b617 Further, Rule 2(b) of the Uniform District Court Rules provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE2\">[flailure to file briefs may subject the motion to summary ruling. Failure to file a brief within five days by the moving party shall be deemed an admission that the motion is without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcW\">\u00b618  We conclude that where a defendant who has been served with process files an appearance, indicates that he anticipates filing a motion challenging personal jurisdiction and then fails to file such a motion or supporting brief within the time frame established by the court\u2019s scheduling order, the defendant has waived that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u00b619 Since we have concluded that the District Court correctly denied Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss, we need not address Issues 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-10\">JUSTICES RICE, NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
