(collectively Fleetwood) appeal from a jury verdict in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. David and Donna Vader (Vaders) cross-appeal from some of the District Court\u2019s rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">\u00b62 On November 16, 2000, the Vaders purchased a 2000 model Pace Arrow Vision motor home for approximately $119,000 from a Fleetwood dealer in Grand Island, Nebraska. The motor home itself was sold and warranted by Fleetwood, while the chassis of the motor home was separately manufactured and warranted by the Ford Motor Company. At the time of purchase, the Vaders were residents of Arizona. The motor home was titled in Montana. As the Vaders were retired, they intended to use the motor home as their place of residence and travel throughout the United States and Mexico. The Vaders would frequently spend time in Montana to visit family.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">\u00b63 Soon after purchasing the motor home, the Vaders encountered a number of problems with it. These included problems with the leveling jacks, hot water heater, ice maker, and other components. Most importantly, they claimed that the motor home swayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>significantly and dangerously while they drove it. The Vaders claim that this swaying/handling problem was so severe that they had to drive through congested areas like bigger cities in the middle of the night, out of a concern that they would not be able to properly handle the motor home in heavy traffic. On several occasions they claimed that the swaying was so bad that they feared for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b64 The Vaders claim that they noticed these problems, particularly the swaying/handling problem, within the first two months after purchasing the motor home. David Vader testified that he specifically complained in writing about the swaying problem, as well as other problems, to the Fleetwood dealership in Grand Island, Nebraska, in January of2001. Neither Fleetwood nor the Vaders have a copy of this letter. The Vaders maintain that they sent the letter to the Fleetwood dealership outlining the many problems they were experiencing with their motor home, but that Fleetwood did not remedy the swaying problem.</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\">\u00b65 The Vaders claim they made numerous attempts over the next two years to have the swaying problem fixed. They visited a Fleetwood dealer in Mesa, Arizona, in 2001, Ford dealers in Yuma, Lake Havasu City, and Bullhead City, Arizona, in 2001 and 2002, and the Fleetwood factory in Riverside, California, in the spring of 2002. They also paid visits to Bitterroot Motors of Missoula, Montana, Travel Time RV of Great Falls, Montana, and J <em>&amp; </em>D Truck Repair, Inc. of Helena, Montana, in 2003. They also claim that they contacted Fleetwood repeatedly about the swaying problem. During this same time period, other problems unrelated to the swaying/handling problem were also brought to Fleetwood\u2019s attention and were for the most part remedied. The bottom line for the Vaders, however, is that while Fleetwood did repair some of the problems associated with the motor home, the swaying/handling problem was never addressed. Instead, the Vaders claim that Fleetwood generally referred their swaying/handling complaints to the Ford Motor Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b66 On July 2, 2004, the Vaders filed a six-count complaint against Fleetwood and the Ford Motor Company in the First Judicial District Court. Prior to trial, Ford settled with the Vaders and was dismissed from the suit. Counts I (negligence) and IV (strict liability) were dismissed prior to trial. Count II, breach of implied warranty, alleged that Fleetwood breached the implied warranties of merchantability, safe design, and fitness for the motor home\u2019s particular use as a motor home because of its defective condition, particularly with regard to compromised drivability and passenger safety due to the swaying problem. Count III, breach of express warranty, alleged that Fleetwood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>expressly warranted that its motor home was merchantable, safely designed, and fit for the use and purpose of a motor home, and that the Vaders relied on these express warranties when they purchased the motor home. The Vaders alleged that this express warranty was breached due to the swaying problem. The Vaders further alleged that they provided Fleetwood with written notice of these breaches on October 22, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">\u00b67 Count V alleged that Fleetwood had engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices which damaged the Vaders. These claims were brought pursuant to Montana\u2019s Consumer Protection Act (CPA), Title 30, chapter 14, part 1, MCA. The Vaders claimed that in the course of attempting to address the swaying problem, they had the motor home weighed and discovered that its actual weight was greater than the weight noted on the vehicle\u2019s title. Thus, the Vaders alleged that Fleetwood designed, manufactured, and distributed the motor home, the actual weight of which exceeded the weight listed on its title, and that these acts constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice which caused them damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b68 Count VI was a \u201cLemon Law\u201d claim, brought pursuant to the new motor vehicle warranties provisions found in Title 61, chapter 4, part 5, MCA. Here, the Vaders alleged that shortly after experiencing problems with their motor home, they reported the problems to Fleetwood in writing and by telephone, expressing to Fleetwood that the motor home did not conform to its express warranties and identifying the necessary repairs. They claimed that Fleetwood first acknowledged this correspondence by a letter dated August 21, 2001. The Vaders alleged that they also drove the motor home to Fleetwood\u2019s assembly plant in Riverside, California, as well as several authorized service centers in Montana and Arizona, to allow Fleetwood to complete the repairs necessary to conform the motor home to its express warranty. While some of the repairs were completed, they alleged that the motor home remained nonconforming and was still overweight, and that its condition substantially impaired the use, market value, and safety of the motor home. The Vaders also claimed that in October 2003, they offered to return the motor home in exchange for $100,000, or alternatively, a replacement with an equivalent model, but that Fleetwood rejected this offer. Accordingly, because Fleetwood failed to remedy the motor home\u2019s defects after a reasonable number of attempts, the Vaders claimed they were entitled to statutory remedies under Montana law. Those remedies include a replacement vehicle or a monetary refund of the purchase price and incidental damages. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-4-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u00b69 A jury trial was held on these claims on February 5-8, 2007. The Vaders presented evidence and testified concerning the problems they had with the motor home-particularly the swaying/handling problem which was the focus of their complaint-and the steps they took in attempting to have these problems remedied. The Vaders presented expert testimony to support their claims. Fleetwood presented its own representatives, as well as expert testimony, in support of its defense. Where necessary, this testimony and evidence will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b610 After both sides rested, Fleetwood and the Vaders both lodged challenges to some of the proposed jury instructions. The Vaders\u2019 objections are not relevant to the present appeal. Fleetwood objected to several instructions pertaining to the Lemon Law and CPA claims, arguing that the Vaders had failed to present sufficient evidence as a matter of law to submit those claims to the jury. The District Court overruled the objections. Fleetwood also moved to dismiss the Lemon Law and CPA claims as a matter of law for failure to present sufficient evidence pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 50. The District Court denied this motion as well, but allowed Fleetwood to file post-trial briefs on the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b611 The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Vaders. It concluded that Fleetwood violated the Lemon Law, breached an implied or express warranty, and was also liable to the Vaders for damages due to unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the CPA. The jury awarded the Vaders $84,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b612 Both parties filed post-trial motions. The motions filed by the Vaders concerned an award of attorney\u2019s fees, an award of prejudgment interest, and the type of replacement vehicle that the Vaders were entitled to by virtue of their successful Lemon Law claim. The Vaders also argued for an increase in the jury\u2019s award of damages pursuant to \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, of the CPA. Fleetwood filed post-trial motions under M. R. Civ. P. 50 and 59 seeking judgment as a matter of law on the Vaders\u2019 Lemon Law, CPA and breach of warranty claims. Fleetwood again argued there was insufficient evidence to submit these claims to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b613 Following a hearing on the motions, the District Court determined that there had been sufficient evidence presented to support the Vaders\u2019 Lemon Law, CPA, and breach of warranty claims, and, further, that the Vaders met the legal requirements for submitting these claims to the jury. The District Court also rejected a challenge by Fleetwood to jury instructions on the breach of warranty claims, noting that Fleetwood failed to object to these instructions at the time they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>given. Additionally, the District Court determined that the Vaders were entitled to a replacement motor home as a remedy under the Lemon Law. The District Court also granted the Vaders attorney\u2019s fees and doubled the damages pursuant to \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, of the CPA. In granting this increase, the District Court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\">Plaintiffs are seeking attorneys fees and triple damages pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act. Section 30-14-133(3), MCA, allows the Court to award reasonable attorney fees. Section 30-14-133(1), MCA, allows the Court, in its discretion, to award up to three times the actual damages sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">The purpose of the Consumer Protection Act is to \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d The above-noted sections seek to shift the burden from the consumer, who can ill afford a lawsuit, to the person or entity ultimately responsible for the problem. In this case, that would be Defendants. Further, these provisions encourage consumers to pursue their remedies. These remedies should deter inappropriate action by manufactures in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">Here, the Court notes that Plaintiffs made any number of attempts to have their problems solved, all to no avail. They even took their motor home to Defendants\u2019 manufacturing plant. Although it was serviced once, on a second attempt, Plaintiffs were turned away from the plant when they tried to get their motor home fixed. An unanimous jury has found that all of the problems complained of by Plaintiffs were the fault of Defendants. Therefore, Defendants are the authors of their own misfortune. The Court finds that Defendants should be required to pay Plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Section 30-14-133(3), MCA. The Court will not triple Plaintiffs\u2019 damages, as that could be an excessive award. Section 30-14-133(1), MCA. However, the Court will double the amount of damages awarded by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b614 Fleetwood now appeals from the jury award and related post-trial rulings. Fleetwood asserts that the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to the Lemon Law, CPA, and breach of warranty claims should be set aside because the evidence presented by the Vaders was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a finding of liability. Accordingly, Fleetwood asserts the damage award and the award of a replacement home for the Lemon Law violation should be vacated. Additionally, Fleetwood asserts that the District Court erred in doubling the award of damages by the jury under the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b615 The Vaders argue that there was sufficient evidence to submit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Lemon Law, CPA, and breach of warranty claims to the jury, and that the verdict and award should be affirmed. The Vaders also cross-appeal, arguing that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to award them treble damages, as opposed to its award of double damages. Finally, the Vaders request that this Court award attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal pursuant to the CPA, if the jury award and the post-trial orders by the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b616 Because Fleetwood concedes that it did not object to jury instructions regarding the Vaders\u2019 breach of warranty claims at the time they were given, we conclude that Fleetwood has waived this issue for purpose of appeal. <em>See Turk v. Turk, </em>2008 MT 45, \u00b6 16, 341 Mont. 386, \u00b6 16, 177 P.3d 1013, \u00b6 16 (\u201cThe failure to object to a verdict form and/or jury instructions at trial results in a waiver of the right to challenge them on appeal.\u201d). Thus, we state the remaining issues on appeal and cross-appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b617 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court err in denying Fleetwood\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the Lemon Law, CPA, and breach of warranty claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b618 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in doubling the jury\u2019s award under the CPA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b619 Issue Three: <em>Are the Vaders entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the CPA for fees incurred on appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>West v. Club At Spanish Peaks, L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 183, \u00b6 45, 343 Mont. 434, \u00b6 45, 186 P.3d 1228, \u00b6 45. Judgment as a matter of law is proper only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. <em>West, </em>\u00b6 45. Moreover, when considering such a motion, all evidence and any legitimate inference which might be drawn from that evidence are to considered in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>West, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\u00b621 A district court\u2019s decision to increase an award of damages pursuant to \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, of the CPA, is a discretionary ruling which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 314 Mont. 101, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 64 P.3d 984, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The test for an abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">\u00b622 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court err in denying Fleetwood\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the Lemon Law, CPA, and breach of warranty claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">A. Lemon Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b623 In its post-trial motion, Fleetwood argued it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Lemon Law claim because the Vaders failed to meet certain threshold requirements for presenting such a claim. The first alleged threshold was a \u201cnotice\u201d requirement pursuant to \u00a7 61-4-502, MCA. This statute reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Notice-warranty enforceable after warranty period-when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">(1) If a consumer notifies in writing the manufacturer or its agent dining the warranty period that a new motor vehicle does not conform to all applicable express warranties, the repairs necessary to conform the new motor vehicle to the express warranties shall be made by or at the expense of the warrantor, regardless of the expiration of the warranty period after notification of nonconformity is given by the consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Section 61-4-502(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u00b624 Fleetwood asserted that this statute requires a consumer to notify the manufacturer in writing during the warranty period that a motor vehicle is nonconforming as a prerequisite to invoking the remedies of the Lemon Law. Fleetwood asserted that the \u201cwarranty period\u201d referred to in this statute is found at \u00a7 61-4-501(7), MCA, which expressly defines a \u201cwarranty period\u201d as \u201cthe period ending 2 years after the date of the original delivery to the consumer of a new motor vehicle or during the first 18,000 miles of operation, whichever is earlier.\u201d According to Fleetwood, failure to comply with this \u201cnotice\u201d requirement within the statutorily-defined warranty period bars a consumer from later availing herself of a remedy under the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u00b625 In addition, Fleetwood argued that consumers were required to take certain actions within the warranty period prior to bringing a Lemon Law claim pursuant to \u00a7 61-4-503, MCA. This statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">(1) If after a reasonable number of attempts the manufacturer or its agent or authorized dealer is unable, during the warranty period, to conform the new motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition that substantially impairs the use and market value or safety of the motor vehicle to the consumer, the manufacturer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>shall replace it with a new motor vehicle of the same model and style and of equal value, unless for reasons of lack of availability replacement is impossible, in which case the manufacturer shall replace it with a motor vehicle of comparable market value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">(2) As an alternative to replacement, the manufacturer may accept return of the new motor vehicle from the consumer upon refund to the consumer of the full purchase price, plus reasonable collateral charges and incidental damages, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer\u2019s use of the motor vehicle. The refund must be paid to the consumer and to a lienholder, if any, in proportion to their interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Section 61-4-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b626 Fleetwood claimed that the Vaders failed to meet these threshold requirements because they did not present evidence that they gave Fleetwood written notice of the swaying/handling problem by the end of calendar year 2002, which it argued was the end of the warranty period. Additionally, Fleetwood claimed that the Vaders failed to make a reasonable number of attempts to have the swaying/handling problem fixed prior to the expiration of the warranty period. Fleetwood argued that the first attempt to have the swaying problem addressed occurred in July 2003 when the Vaders took the motor home to J &amp; D Repair in Helena-more than six months past the last date for obtaining relief as contemplated by \u00a7 61-4-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b627 The District Court rejected the argument that \u00a7 61-4-502, MCA, imposes a notice requirement on Lemon Law claims. The District Court concluded that the statute related to \u201cthose situations where a written notice is given prior to the expiration of the warranty and the warranty is not fulfilled during the warranty period. This is not the issue in this case, and there is no specific requirement of any particular type of notice.\u201d With regard to the second statutory requirement, the District Court found that the Vaders presented evidence at trial to the effect that they took the motor home to multiple dealers a total of approximately eight times in an attempt to have the problems resolved within the first two years of the warranty period. The District Court noted that an exhibit placed into evidence by the Vaders showed that they made a complaint about the motor home\u2019s suspension on January 7,2002, which was within the warranty period. Thus, the District Court concluded the Vaders had satisfied the statutory and evidentiary requirements for submitting the Lemon Law claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b628 Fleetwood argues that the uncontroverted evidence establishes that the warranty period expired by November 2002 and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Vaders failed to take the steps required under the Lemon Law in order to avail themselves of its remedial purposes. It asserts that the Vaders failed to provide written notice of the swaying problem and failed to make a reasonable number of attempts to have the swaying problem fixed prior to November 2002. Fleetwood concedes that the Vaders did complain in writing about problems with some of the internal components of the motor home (i.e., fixtures, appliances, furnishings and other accessories), but failed to do the same with respect to the \u201cnon-residential\u201d components (i.e., the swaying problem). Fleetwood notes that \u201cresidential\u201d components are not covered by the Lemon Law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-4-501(5)(b)(ii), MCA. Thus, any complaints about these residential components do not satisfy the notice requirement under the Lemon Law, because only written notice of an issue with a \u201cnonresidential\u201d component (in this case, the swaying/handling problem) would be sufficient. Additionally, Fleetwood reiterates the view taken in its post-trial motion that a minimum number of reasonable attempts to have the swaying/handling problem addressed simply did not occur until after the warranty period expired, and that the earliest attempt to address this problem did not actually occur until July 2003-six months after the warranty period ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">\u00b629 The Vaders urge us to affirm. They maintain that the District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 61-4-502, MCA, does not impose a notice requirement. However, even if written notice is required, they argue that evidence in the record shows it was satisfied. Furthermore, they argue that they did present evidence showing a reasonable number of attempts to have the motor home repaired within the warranty period. In general, they argue that the reasonableness of such attempts is a question of fact for the jury, and that the jury resolved this question in their favor. More specifically, they point to testimony from David Vader that he repeatedly delivered his motor home to dealerships for repair and complained of the swaying problem, but that the dealers would refuse to attempt to repair or even document the problem in a work order because they viewed it as a chassis problem for which the Ford Motor Company, not Fleetwood, was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b630 Based on the plain language of \u00a7 61-4-502, MCA, we agree with the District Court\u2019s ruling with regard to the \u201cnotice requirement\u201d under the Lemon Law. \u201cWe interpret a statute by looking first to the statute\u2019s plain language, and if the language is clear and unambiguous no further interpretation is required.\u201d <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2008 MT 318, \u00b6 26, 346 Mont. 93, \u00b6 26, 193 P.3d 925, \u00b6 26. Moreover, when interpreting statutes we view them as part of a whole statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>scheme, and construe them so as to forward the purpose of that scheme. <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6 27, 342 Mont. 499, \u00b6 27, 182 P.3d 66, \u00b6 27. The plain language of \u00a7 61-4-502, MCA, demonstrates clearly that it was not designed to impose a notice requirement on Lemon Law claims. The statute is entitled \u201cNotice-warranty enforceable after warranty period \u2014 when.\u201d The intent of this statute is to extend the enforceability of a warranty period in those situations where a consumer provides written notice of a non-conformity to a manufacturer or its agent prior to the expiration of the warranty period in order to ensure that the necessary repairs are completed under the terms of the warranty. We agree with the District Court that this statute is simply inapplicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b631  By contrast, \u00a7 61-4-503, MCA, does require a consumer to make a reasonable number of attempts to have a motor vehicle conform to any express warranties within the warranty period. At trial, David Vader testified that he made such attempts within the warranty period, but did not have documentation of these attempts because when he tried to have the swaying problem addressed, the Fleetwood dealerships would tell him to contact Ford Motor Company about the problem and would refuse to write up a work order. The jury clearly found this testimony credible. We conclude there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the Vaders had made a reasonable number of attempts to have the swaying/handling problem remedied. \u00b632 A motion for judgment as a matter of law is not a device by which parties can invoke a reviewing court\u2019s power to reexamine and reweigh the evidence before the jury. The party making this motion must demonstrate a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. <em>West, </em>\u00b6 45. Fleetwood has failed to meet this burden. While the jury was certainly not required to believe David Vader\u2019s testimony, they apparently did. Thus, the District Court did not err in denying Fleetwood\u2019s motion regarding this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">B. CPA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b633 In its post-trial motion, Fleetwood argued that the venue provisions of the CPA barred the Vaders\u2019 claims. In particular, Fleetwood pointed to \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, which states that an aggrieved customer \u201cmay bring an individual but not a class action [suit] under the rules of civil procedure in the district court of the county in which the seller, lessor, or service provider resides or has its principal place of business or is doing business to recover actual damages or $500, whichever is greater.\u201d The Vaders originally purchased their motor home in Nebraska. Fleetwood argued it was an out-of-state corporation with no presence in the state of Montana, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that the Vaders themselves no longer resided in Montana at the time of suit. Given the specific language in \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, Fleetwood argued that the CPA only contemplates claims against sellers actually present in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">\u00b634 Additionally, Fleetwood argued that the Vaders\u2019 claims were subject to a two-year statute of limitations under the CPA, and that the Vaders had failed to timely present their claims. It maintained that any CPA claims which were based on allegedly deceptive statements made in Fleetwood\u2019s sales literature would have accrued as early as December 2000, and would be prohibited after December 2002. Assuming, therefore, that only claims accruing within two years of the filing of the complaint were viable, Fleetwood argued that no evidence of such practices was offered, and that there generally was no evidentiary basis set forth which would support a CPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b635 The District Court denied the motion regarding the CPA claims as well. With respect to the \u201cvenue\u201d provisions of the CPA, the District Court deemed this argument waived because it had not been raised prior to trial. The District Court did not directly address the statute of limitations argument in its written order, but apparently concluded that the Vaders had presented sufficient evidence to rebut this claim since it did not grant Fleetwood\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b636 On appeal, Fleetwood seeks to reframe its venue argument, maintaining that the Vaders\u2019 claims are actually barred because they fail to meet the subject-matter jurisdiction provisions of the CPA. In its briefs, Fleetwood acknowledges that its use of the term \u201cvenue\u201d in the District Court instead of subject-matter jurisdiction may have caused some confusion in these proceedings, but nonetheless argues that its \u201cclear intent\u201d was to argue the jurisdictional implications of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b637 We generally do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal, or a party\u2019s change in legal theory on appeal. <em>Whitehorn v. Whitehorn Farms, Inc., </em>2008 MT 361, \u00b6 21, 346 Mont. 394, \u00b6 21, 195 P.3d 836, \u00b6 21. Having reviewed the post-trial briefs filed by Fleetwood, the transcript, and Fleetwood\u2019s briefing on appeal, we conclude that its subject-matter jurisdiction argument is a change in legal theory which was never properly raised before the District Court. Thus, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b638 Turning to Fleetwood\u2019s statute of limitations argument, the Vaders argue that Fleetwood waived this defense. While the Vaders acknowledge that Fleetwood did plead this defense affirmatively in its answer, they assert that Fleetwood\u2019s failure to even address this defense until after trial precludes it from asserting it now. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Vaders maintain that even if this defense is available to Fleetwood, they did present evidence of unfair/ deceptive trade practices occurring within two years of the filing of their complaint. First, they note that under \u00a7 61-4-533, MCA, a violation of the Lemon Law is a per se violation of the CPA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-4-533, MCA (\u201cA violation of any provision of this part is an unfair or deceptive trade practice under Title 30, chapter 14, part 2, and the penalties provided in 30-14-224(1) apply.\u201d)- The Vaders argue that Fleetwood\u2019s failure to repair the swaying problem with the motor home before the expiration of the warranty period and refusal to replace the nonconforming vehicle as required under the Lemon Law constituted a violation of the CPA. Additionally, the Vaders argue that they presented other evidence of CPA violations by Fleetwood. They note that Fleetwood promised a \u201cquiet\u201d and \u201cnearly flawless ride\u201d in its sales materials, and argue that Fleetwood failed to help them when their motor home developed a dangerous sway, simply referring them to Ford. They maintain that this evidence presents a separate basis for an unfair/deceptive act or practice and also supports their CPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b639 The jury specifically found that Fleetwood violated both the Lemon Law and the CPA. Because Fleetwood failed to affirmatively address its statute of limitations defense prior to trial, and did not attempt to limit the jury\u2019s consideration of evidence to certain dates or timeframes, there is no way to know whether or to what extent the jury arguably considered evidence of actions undertaken outside of the statute of limitations period. At a minimum, however, the Lemon Law violation is sufficient evidence that a CPA violation occurred as well. The Lemon Law violation occurred with the statute of limitations period, and was by itself sufficient to support the Vaders\u2019 CPA claim. \u00b640 Again, because Fleetwood is challenging the denial of its post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, it has the burden of demonstrating a complete absence of any evidence which would allow the Vaders to submit their CPA claim to the jury. Clearly, the Vaders presented sufficient evidence to sustain this claim, and Fleetwood has failed to meet its burden in this regard. Thus, we affirm the District Court with regard to the CPA claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">C. Breach of Warranty Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b641 Fleetwood also argued in its post-trial motion that the Vaders\u2019 claims for breach of implied and express warranties were not supported by sufficient evidence and should not have been submitted to the jury. Fleetwood argued that the evidence showed that David Vader reviewed the express warranties associated with the motor home, and knew that Fleetwood\u2019s limited warranty did not cover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>chassis and its component parts, as these were covered separately by the Ford Motor Company\u2019s warranty. The District Court rejected this argument by noting that in one of Fleetwood\u2019s \u201csales brochures, [it] promised a \u2018flawless ride.\u2019 They jury could have easily found, and probably did, that this sort of statement, although made in a sales brochure, arose to the level of an express warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b642  We agree with the District Court, and conclude that Fleetwood\u2019s appeal of the denial of its post-trial motion with regard to this claim is without merit. Once again, a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law is not an invitation to reweigh the evidence, but only to determine whether there was any evidence which would support submitting a particular claim to the jury. The District Court correctly reasoned that the jury could have concluded that one of Fleetwood\u2019s sales brochures, which was admitted into evidence and promised a \u201cflawless ride,\u201d created an express warranty which was subsequently breached. Thus, we affirm the District Court with respect to the breach of warranty claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b643 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in doubling the jury\u2019s award under the CPA ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b644 As noted above, <em>(see </em>\u00b6 13), the District Court doubled the award of damages for violations of the CPA. Fleetwood asserts the District Court abused its discretion in so doing. Although \u00a7 30-14-133, MCA, of the CPA does allow the District Court to treble damages, Fleetwood maintains that under <em>Plath </em>the increase of damages is not intended to punish but instead to be \u201ccompensatory and remedial\u201d rather than punitive. <em>See Plath, </em>\u00b6 27. Fleetwood maintains the District Court\u2019s rationale was based, in part, on a deterrence rationale which Fleetwood claims makes the doubling of the award for all practical purposes \u201ca judicially-imposed punitive damage award.\u201d Fleetwood asserts that this doubling of punitive damages is both contrary to the CPA and raises serious constitutional concerns in light of such cases as <em>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 116 S. Ct. 1589 (1996) and <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S. Ct. 1513 (2003), which address the impropriety of excessive punitive damage awards. Accordingly, Fleetwood argues the doubling of damages by the District Court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u00b645 The Vaders and the State, appearing as Amicus, both argue that the doubling of the damage award under the CPA was within the discretion of the District Court. Ironically, the Vaders also claim on cross-appeal that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to treble the damages because treble damages are allowed under the CPA and do not lead to an excessive award.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u00b646 In <em>Plath, </em>we discussed the practical application of the treble damages provision of the CPA. In that case, a district court refused to increase an award of damages under the CPA because the plaintiffs failed to show that a defendant had engaged in any \u201cculpable behavior.\u201d <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 16. We explicitly rejected the notion that such a showing was required and remanded the matter to the district court. As we stated in our holding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">The District Court erred when it ruled treble damages would not be awarded because the evidence did not support a finding generally associated with punitive damages. The purpose of the trebling provision of the Montana Consumer Protection Act is to promote or encourage private individuals to pursue violations of Montana\u2019s Consumer Protection Act by making it more economically feasible to pursue those claims where actual damages are minimal. Montana\u2019s treble damages provision is purely a discretionary function of the district court and such awards should be determined on a case-by-case basis. A district court decision whether or not to award treble damages under the Act should be guided by the overall purpose of the Act itself, which is to protect the public from unfair or deceptive practices engaged in by trade or commerce. The specific purpose of the treble damage provision is to encourage consumers to bring these civil actions by making it more economically feasible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b647 Based on a portion of the above-quoted language, Fleetwood suggests that an increase of damages cannot be made unless the actual damages are \u201cminimal.\u201d But as the State correctly notes, nothing in the statute itself suggests any such requirement. Instead, Montana\u2019s CPA gives district courts discretion, without imposing any particular criteria, to grant an award of treble damages if it finds that such an increase will further the purpose of the CPA. <em>See Plath, </em>\u00b6 22 (noting that, among jurisdictions which have consumer protection acts, Montana\u2019s CPA falls in the class of the \u201cdistinct minorit[y] of consumer protection acts [which] allow for a purely discretionary award of treble damages.\u201d). In <em>Plath, </em>we noted that the CPA\u2019s treble damage provision does not require any \u201cspecific conduct that would trigger imposition of the treble damage award\u201d and further observed that this treble damage award \u201cis not punitive in nature and ... does not require specific intentional conduct on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 27. In other words, the treble damages provision does not \u201crequire a plaintiff to prove malice, oppression, or fraud, which under Montana law is prerequisite conduct necessary to allowing punitive damages.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>T &amp; W Chevrolet v. Darvial, </em>196 Mont. 287, 293, 641 P.2d 1368, 1371 (1982)). Although, in practical terms, \u201cthe trebling function has a deterrent effect, it is used primarily as a compensatory measure, and thus is not intended to be punitive.\u201d <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b648 Fleetwood has not argued that <em>Plath </em>was wrongly decided or should be overruled. Instead, Fleetwood maintains that the District Court\u2019s reasoning shows that it was basing its decision on a deterrence rationale which went beyond the compensatory rationale adopted in <em>Plath. </em>However, in <em>Plath </em>we highlighted the fact that punitive damages are awarded in response to a plaintiffs showing of \u201cmalice, oppression, or fraud\u201d by the defendant. If the District Court stated that it was trebling damages in order to punish such conduct, then Fleetwood\u2019s case would arguably have some merit. Here, the District Court\u2019s rationale shows that the doubling of the damage award was designed to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d and deter inappropriate action by manufactures in the future. This satisfies the remedial purpose inherent in the trebling damages provision, and was within the District Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b649  Moreover, it was equally within the District Court\u2019s discretion to award only a doubling of damages, instead of a trebling of damages as requested by the Vaders. The language of the treble damages provision is discretionary, and the District Court certainly did not commit an abuse of discretion by awarding a doubling of damages, as opposed to a tripling of damages, or no increase at all. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b650 Issue Three: <em>Are the Vaders entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the CPA for fees incurred on appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b651 The Vaders assert that attorney\u2019s fees are available for consumers who successfully secure a CPA award, and that fees incurred on appeal should be awarded as well. The Vaders argue that this Court seemingly recognized the validity of such an award of attorney\u2019s fees in <em>Baird v. Northwest Bank, </em>255 Mont. 317, 843 P.2d 327 (1992). They also argue that other jurisdictions allow an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal in successfully defending an award under consumer protection laws. <em>See e.g., Cange v. Stotler &amp; Co., </em>913 F.2d 1204, 1211 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>Jordan v. Transnational Motors, Inc., </em>537 N.W.2d 471, 474 (Mich. App. 1995); <em>Wash. State Phys. Ins. Exch. &amp; Assn. v. Fisons Corp., </em>858 P.2d 1054, 1074 (Wash. 1993). The Vaders request that we remand this matter to the District Court to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees which should be awarded for defending their verdict on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b652 Given that Fleetwood has not objected to an award of attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>fees for work performed on appeal, we grant the Vaders\u2019 request to remand this matter to the District Court. Although no Montana cases explicitly hold that attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded for work performed in defending a CPA award on appeal, we did appear to implicitly recognize their availability in <em>Baird. See Baird, </em>255 Mont. at 329, 843 P.2d at 334-35. Section 30-14-133(3), MCA, of the CPA states that \u201c[i]n any action brought under this section, the court may award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees incurred in prosecuting or defending the action.\u201d Clearly, the Vaders\u2019 appeal was necessary to defend their award under the CPA. Moreover, as the Vaders note, other jurisdictions with consumer protection acts do allow attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal. Thus, we remand this matter to the District Court for a determination and assessment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b653 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Fleetwood\u2019s post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the Lemon Law, CPA, and breach of warranty claims. We further hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it doubled the award of damages pursuant to \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, of the CPA. Finally, we remand this matter to the District Court in order to determine a reasonable award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the Vaders on appeal in defending their award for violations of the CPA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
