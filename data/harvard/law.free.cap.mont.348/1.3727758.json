J.D.L. raises several issues. However, because we hold the District Court erred in not appointing a friend for J.D.L., as required by \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA, we need not discuss other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00b62 On October 4, 2007, police took J.D.L. to an emergency room for causing a \u201csevere disturbance\u201d at his apartment building. Dr. Brown, a professional person, was called to evaluate J.D.L.\u2019s mental status and to make recommendations. After Dr. Brown evaluated J.D.L., he wrote a report in which he recommended that J.D.L. be committed to MSH because he represented a danger to others. Dr. Brown\u2019s report was attached to the State\u2019s petition to commit J.D.L. At J.D.L.\u2019s initial appearance on October 4, the District Court asked defense counsel about appointing a friend as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">COURT: And then how about a friend, do we have a suggestion for friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">COUNSEL: We do not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">COURT: Why don\u2019t you, if you can line somebody up, that would be good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">J.D.L.: Do you want to represent me, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-11\">COUNSEL: I\u2019ll be representing you as long as you want me to. J.D.L.: Okay, that is great.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">\u00b63 The District Court then entered an order setting the hearing on the petition for the next day, October 5. No friend for J.D.L. was appointed. There was no further discussion concerning the appointment of a friend and no friend for J.D.L. appeared at the hearing on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">\u00b64 During the hearing, Dr. Brown, who was the only witness, testified he diagnosed J.D.L. as suffering from schizophrenia and polysubstance dependence. Dr. Brown opined that J.D.L. was substantially unable to care for his basic needs because he had no food in his apartment, he could lose his apartment, and he represented an imminent threat of injury to himself or others. Dr. Brown reiterated his recommendation that J.D.L. be committed to MSH because it would be the least restrictive means of treatment. The District Court granted the State\u2019s petition and involuntarily committed J.D.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-14\">\u00b65 J.D.L. argues for the first time on appeal that the District Court\u2019s failure to appoint a friend deprived him of a fundamental liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>interest, which is a miscarriage of justice and compromises the integrity of the judicial process. J.D.L. urges us to review the issue under the plain error doctrine and reverse the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b66 The invocation of plain error review in an involuntary commitment proceeding is an issue of first impression in Montana. Generally, this Court will not hear issues raised for the first time on appeal. However, when constitutional or substantial rights are at issue, we review errors under \u201cour inherent power and paramount obligation to interpret Montana\u2019s Constitution and to protect the various rights set forth in that document.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39,304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. We invoke plain error review sparingly and in only those limited situations where failure to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 13, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 13, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"ArE\">\u00b67 Our application of the plain error doctrine is not limited to criminal cases on direct appeal. <em>State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, \u00b6 17, 309 Mont. 63, \u00b6 17, 50 P.3d 121, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>Seyferth v. State Dept. of Justice, </em>277 Mont. 377, 922 P.2d 494 (1996) (applying plain error to review a civil appeal from the denial of a driver\u2019s license reinstatement petition)). In <em>Halldorson v. Halldorson, </em>175 Mont. 170, 573 P.2d 169 (1977), we invoked plain error review in a marriage dissolution case to determine whether a party was denied the substantial right to a fair hearing when the district court recessed trial and entered judgment without allowing a party to present his case-in-chief. We stated that plain error review can extend to issues not objected to at the trial level if parties ignored statutory requirements or an established precedent. <em>Halldorson, 175 </em>Mont. at 173-74, 573 P.2d at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b68 The statutes authorizing involuntary commitment are to be applied as to \u201cinsure that the government does not invade an individual\u2019s freedom or liberty without due notice, cause, and process.\u201d <em>Matter of R.M., </em>270 Mont. 40, 45-46, 889 P.2d 1201, 1205 (1995). We have repeatedly cautioned trial courts to strictly adhere to statutes in involuntary commitment cases because they involve a loss of liberty. <em>In re Mental Health of D.V., </em>2007 MT 351, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 340 Mont. 319, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 174 P.3d 503, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40; <em>In re G.M., </em>2007 MT 100, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 116, \u00b6 19, 157 P.3d 687, \u00b6 19; <em>In re A.K., </em>2006 MT 166, \u00b6 11, 332 Mont. 511, \u00b6 11, 139 P.3d 849, \u00b6 11; <em>In re Mental Health of D.L.T., </em>2003 MT 46, \u00b6 18, 314 Mont. 297, \u00b6 18, 67 P.3d 189, \u00b6 18, <em>overruled on other grounds, Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, 336 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>105, 152 P.3d 727; <em>In re Mental Health </em>of C.R.C., 2004 MT 389, \u00b6 13, 325 Mont. 133, \u00b6 13, 104 P.3d 1065, \u00b6 13; <em>Matter of Mental Health of L.C.B., </em>253 Mont. 1, 7, 830 P.2d 1299, 1303 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b69  We invoke plain error review in this case because a substantial right-liberty-is at stake and our failure to review the District Court\u2019s alleged error would compromise the integrity of the judicial process. \u00b610 Section 53-21-122(2), MCA, provides \u201c[t]he judge shall appoint... a friend of respondent ....\u201d The friend of the respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding is a person willing and able to assist the respondent in dealing with legal proceedings, including consultation with legal counsel and others. Section 53-21-102(8), MCA; <em>Mental Health of D.V., </em>\u00b6 36. The friend of the respondent may, in consort with counsel, waive some of the respondent\u2019s rights. Section 53-21-119, MCA. The appointment of a friend of the respondent in an involuntary commitment is important. The appointment of a friend may not be arbitrarily dispensed with by the District Court. Ultimately, it is the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to ensure a friend is appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b611 The State urges us to excuse the failure to appoint a friend because J.D.L. had no next of kin or acquaintances. The State points out that a practical problem arose in this case because no one was willing and able to serve as a friend. In some cases, finding a person to serve as a friend could be difficult for the district court. The law never requires that which is impossible. Section 1-3-222, MCA. Nevertheless, the record here indicates no real effort to locate and appoint a qualified person to serve as a friend for J.D.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b612  The record shows the District Court made no serious attempt to appoint a friend for J.D.L. The mandate of \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA, to appoint a friend was essentially ignored. Under these circumstances, we conclude reversible error exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u00b613 This case is remanded to the District Court for entry of an order vacatingits order andjudgment of October 10,2007, committing J.D.L. to the Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<judges id=\"b26-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b26-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b614 I agree with the result the Court reaches. I do not agree with the entirety of the analysis, however. The requirement that the District Court appoint a \u201cfriend\u201d is a sound one, as anyone familiar with-and concerned about-the proper handling of involuntary commitment proceedings knows. A \u201cfriend\u201d of the respondent plays many important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>roles-to the respondent, to respondent\u2019s counsel and to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b615 I write separately to encourage the Legislature to revisit and clarify certain matters relating to the appointment of a friend. It is beyond cavil that the presiding judge is to make the appointment. Nothing in the statutes, however, places the responsibility on anyone involved in the proceedings to make a serious attempt to locate a friend for appointment. Thus, notwithstanding the Court\u2019s implication at \u00b6 12 that the presiding judge must make a serious effort to <em>appoint </em>a friend, the presiding judge certainly should not-and properly cannot-shoulder the responsibility for making a serious effort to <em>locate </em>a friend for appointment. Nor does it seem appropriate for the prosecutor to bear that burden. The Legislature may want to consider clearly placing the responsibility on counsel for the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b616 In addition, as the Court suggests in \u00b6 11, there may be situations where-after a serious effort to locate a friend is made-no such person can be located. In this regard, I would encourage the Legislature to carve out a very narrow and carefully circumscribed exception to the requirement that a friend be appointed for application in such circumstances. Here again, though, I must note my disagreement with the Court\u2019s implication that it is the district court\u2019s responsibility to find a person to serve as a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b617 The bottom line in this case is that no one made an attempt at locating a friend for the respondent, even after the District Court advised counsel that it would be \u201cgood\u201d if one could be lined up. Consequently, no friend was appointed. For that reason, I concur in the result the Court reaches in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b27-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b618 I dissent from the Court\u2019s exercise of plain error appellate review. Plain error review is to be exercised \u201csparingly\u201d and only when a failure to do so will \u201cleave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 252, \u00b6 17, 190 P.3d 1091, \u00b6 17. Despite these high standards, the Court reverses without any explanation of how the fundamental fairness of this commitment proceeding was left unsettled, or how the integrity of the judicial process was compromised. J.D.L. has made no showing that the absence of a court-appointed friend had any impact whatsoever on the commitment proceedings. The Court likewise fails, offering merely that appointment of a friend \u201cis important\u201d and \u201cmay not be arbitrarily dispensed with\u201d by a district court. Opinion, \u00b6 11. While I agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>these </em>observations, they do not establish that the fairness or integrity of this proceeding was compromised in a way necessitating the exercise of plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b619 That the Court has failed in its duty is evident from the fact that, on its face, this holding would require reversal by plain error review of any and every case involving the failure to appoint a friend, because the Court has failed to articulate an unfairness or compromise of integrity here that is not universally applicable to all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b620 While this case raises a worthy issue, I would address it either where the issue has been preserved by objection, or where the failure to appoint a friend has resulted in a demonstrable unfairness in the proceeding, thus satisfying the requirements of plain error review. Here, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
