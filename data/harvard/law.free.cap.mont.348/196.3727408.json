We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b62 White pleaded guilty on February 9,1994, to the offense of theft, a felony common scheme, committed on or about October 25,1993. The District Court deferred imposition of sentence for a period of three years, subject to a number of conditions. One of the conditions prohibited White from possessing or consuming intoxicants and from patronizing any bars or other businesses where alcohol is the chief item of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u00b63 On August 16,1994, the District Court revoked White\u2019s deferred sentence as a result of her consuming alcohol. The court imposed a sentence of ten years at the Women\u2019s Correctional Facility. The court required White to serve 30 days in the Flathead County Detention Center and suspended the remainder of the sentence, subject to the conditions imposed in its February 1994 judgment. As further conditions of probation, the court ordered White to pay a fine of $1,000 and a surcharge of $100, to submit to screening for Intensive Supervised Probation, and, if accepted, to comply with all the requirements imposed by that program.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">\u00b64 On July 17, 1996, the District Court amended its February 1994 judgment, without objection, to include a requirement that White submit to an analysis of her blood, breath, or urine at the reasonable request of her probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">\u00b65 In May 1997, the District Court found that White had violated her probation by consuming alcohol. The court thus revoked her suspended sentence. On August 14, 1997, the court sentenced White to ten years at the Women\u2019s Correctional Facility. The court suspended this entire sentence, subject to the conditions imposed in its February 1994, August 1994, and July 1996judgments. In addition, the court required White to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings four times a week, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>unless allowed or directed to do otherwise by her probation officer, and to participate in any counseling deemed appropriate by her probation officer, including counseling for chemical dependency and financial difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b66 On October 19, 2006, the State filed a petition to revoke White\u2019s suspended sentence. The State alleged that White had violated the conditions of her probation by consuming alcohol and failing to remain law-abiding. White appeared in court on February 1, 2007, and admitted these violations. Accordingly, the court revoked her suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b67 On February 14, 2007, the State filed a second petition for revocation, alleging that White had continued to violate the terms of her probation by patronizing bars, consuming alcohol, and failing to remain law-abiding. White appeared in court on March 8, 2007, and admitted she had continued to violate the conditions of her probation since February 1 by being in a bar and by drinking alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b68 On April 25,2007, White filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s two petitions to revoke her suspended sentence. She argued that the District Court, in 1997, had \u201ccontinued\u201d the ten-year sentence imposed in August 1994 and that this sentence, therefore, had \u201cexpired\u201d in 2004. White\u2019s theory was that the District Court\u2019s \u201caction of adding conditions to the sentence had the legal effect of continuing the sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA (1993). On this basis, White asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction in the instant revocation proceeding to consider and rule on the State\u2019s October 2006 and February 2007 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b69 Alternatively, White argued that \u201c[ijmposition of a 24-year sentence for a charge of theft, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, is cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d (She calculated 24 years based on the assumption that the State would be recommending a sentence of 10 years to the Department of Corrections with 8 years suspended.) White pointed out that while she probably would continue serving her sentence on probation, \u201cprobation is nonetheless a form of punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b610 The District Court denied White\u2019s motion to dismiss on May 8, 2007, and sentenced her on August 16, 2007, to the Montana State Women\u2019s Prison for a term of ten years, with five years suspended. The court noted that White would receive credit for five years served, leaving a balance of five years, suspended. The court further ordered White to comply with all requirements imposed in the court\u2019s February 1994, August 1994, July 1996, and August 1997 judgments. White now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b611 The sole issue on appeal is whether the sentence imposed by the District Court in August 2007 is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b612 This Court reviews a criminal sentence that includes at least one year of actual incarceration for legality. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 174, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 174, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 174. We determine whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, \u00b6 15, 179 P.3d 502, \u00b6 15. When properly raised, we also consider whether the sentence is constitutional. <em>See e.g. State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6\u00b6 16-34, 38-39, 334 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16-34, 38-39, 145 P.3d 946, \u00b6\u00b6 16-34, 38-39. These determinations are questions of law and, as such, our review is de novo. <em>See Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 244, \u00b6 13, 194 P.3d 683, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b613 White does not deny that she consumed alcohol as alleged by the State in its October 2006 and February 2007 revocation petitions. Rather, she challenges the legality of the sentence imposed by the District Court in August 2007 on both statutory and constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">White\u2019s Statutory-Based Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">\u00b614 For purposes of the ensuing discussion, we note that the law in effect at the time an offense is committed controls as to the possible sentence for the offense, as well as a revocation of that sentence. <em>West, </em>\u00b6 21 n. 1. White\u2019s offense was committed on or about October 25,1993; thus, the 1993 version of the Montana Code Annotated applies, and all statutory references below are to the 1993 MCA, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\u00b615 As noted, the District Court in August 1994 revoked White\u2019s three-year deferred sentence and imposed a ten-year suspended sentence, subject to the conditions in the February 1994 judgment as well as the additional conditions imposed in the August 1994 judgment. The court then, in July 1996, amended its February 1994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>judgment. Finally, in May 1997, the District Court found that White had violated one or more conditions of her suspended sentence by consuming alcohol. Under \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, if a district court finds that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence, the court may (a) \u201ccontinue the suspended . . . sentence without a change in conditions\u201d; (b) \u201ccontinue the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions\u201d; or (c) \u201crevoke the suspension of sentence and require the defendant to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence.\u201d Section 46-18-203(7)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b616 One of White\u2019s theories on appeal (which is presented as an \u201calternative\u201d to her main argument) is that the District Court in 1997, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, \u201ccontinued\u201d the ten-year suspended sentence imposed in August 1994 and that this sentence, therefore, expired in August 2004, long before the State filed its petitions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA (\u201cThe petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court during the period of suspension or deferral.\u201d). Under this theory, the District Court lacked jurisdiction in 2007 to entertain the State\u2019s October 2006 and February 2007 petitions for revocation because there was no sentence for the District Court to revoke. Consequently, the new sentence imposed in 2007 is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b617 The District Court, however, considered this argument and determined that in 1997, it had \u201crevoked\u201d White\u2019s suspended sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA. White does not dispute this determination with any analysis or argument. As a result, the theory is not properly presented for appellate review. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 15, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b618 White\u2019s \u201calternative\u201d theory aside, her primary argument rests on the premise that the District Court in 1997 \u201crevoked\u201d her ten-year suspended sentence. (The State agrees with this view of events.) According to White, however, the District Court did not then follow the mandate of \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA, which states that when a district court revokes a suspended sentence, it may \u201crequire the defendant to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence.\u201d White points out that the District Court in 1997 imposed the same sentence it had imposed in August 1994, but that the court also imposed new probation conditions, which have now been carried forward into White\u2019s 2007 sentence (the sentence at issue on this appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b619 The crux of White\u2019s argument is that adding the new conditions to the 1997 sentence was not authorized by \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA, and those conditions, therefore, were illegal when imposed. As support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>for this proposition, White cites <em>State v. Rudolph, </em>2005 MT 41, 326 Mont. 132, 107 P.3d 496, and <em>State v. Richardson, </em>2000 MT 72, 299 Mont. 102, 997 P.2d 786. <em>See Rudolph, </em>\u00b6 17 (\u201cHere . . . , the court revoked Rudolph\u2019s suspended sentence and, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1997), it had no authority to add conditions to the newly imposed sentence.\u201d); <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 27 (\u201cNothing in [\u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1997),] authorizes a court to impose additional restrictions when revoking a suspended sentence.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, White argues, her current sentence is illegal because the District Court carried forward the illegal conditions of her 1997 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b620 Before proceeding, it is necessary to clarify the parameters of White\u2019s sentencing challenge. White may not, within the context of the present revocation proceeding, challenge the legality of the conditions imposed on her 1997 suspended sentence, as such a challenge is untimely. <em>See State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 22, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 22. She may, however, challenge the legality of the conditions imposed on her 2007 sentence. <em>See Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 23. Furthermore, we held in <em>State v. Seals, </em>2007 MT 71, 336 Mont. 416, 156 P.3d 15, that a district court under \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, may not continue or reimpose an illegal sentence, but may only impose \u201cany lesser sentence\u201d that is legal. <em>See Seals, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-18. Accordingly, we consider here the question of whether White\u2019s 1997 sentence was legal only for the purpose of determining whether the District Court had authority under \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA, to reimpose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b621 In response to White\u2019s arguments, the State asserts that our decision in <em>Rudolph </em>was not \u201cdictated\u201d by the wording of \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA. According to the State, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA, \u201climits the authority of the court to impose a longer term of sentence rather than its ability to condition the terms of the court\u2019s sentence.\u201d In other words, when a court revokes a suspended sentence, \u201cit is limited to the term of the suspension-which in this case was ten years-but the statute does not limit the court\u2019s authority to condition the terms of a subsequent suspension so long as those conditions-like the term of sentence-could have been imposed initially.\u201d The only authority cited by the State for this proposition is <em>Seals; </em>however, we did not articulate any such holding in <em>Seals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u00b622 Moreover, the State approaches this issue from the wrong perspective, asking whether the statute \u201climits\u201d the court\u2019s sentencing authority. District courts do not have inherent authority to impose criminal sentences except as \u201climited\u201d by statute. To the contrary, it is well-established that a district court\u2019s authority to impose a criminal sentence is defined and constrained by statute, and a district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority. <em>See State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 109, \u00b6 12, 112 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1993). A sentence not based on specific statutory authority is an illegal sentence. <em>Ruiz, </em>\u00b6 12. Thus, the question here is whether \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA, <em>authorizes </em>the sentence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b623 Again, when a court revokes a suspended sentence, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA, authorizes the court to \u201crequire the defendant to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence.\u201d Given its context, the term \u201clesser sentence\u201d must be understood as signifying a sentence which is \u201clesser\u201d than \u201cthe sentence imposed.\u201d The State attempts to portray a ten-year suspended sentence subject to Conditions A, B, and C as no different (for purposes of \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA) than a ten-year suspended sentence subject to Conditions A, B, C, D, E, and F. We are not persuaded. It is self-evident that if \u201cthe sentence imposed\u201d was a ten-year suspended sentence subject to Conditions A, B, and C, then a ten-year suspended sentence subject to Conditions A, B, and C <em>plus </em>Conditions D, E, and F is neither \u201cthe sentence imposed\u201d nor a \u201clesser\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b624  We accordingly hold that the District Court was not authorized in 1997 to add new conditions to the newly imposed suspended sentence. <em>Rudolph, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 27. Therefore, the District Court could not reimpose those illegal conditions upon revocation of the sentence in 2007. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 17. Rather, the court had to impose \u201cany lesser sentence\u201d that was legal. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 17; \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AOs\">\u00b625 The State points out that even if certain conditions on White\u2019s 2007 sentence are not statutorily authorized, \u201cthe proper remedy would be for this Court or the district court to strike the offending conditions.\u201d We agree. <em>See DeShields v. State, </em>2006 MT 58, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 329, \u00b6 11, 132 P.3d 540, \u00b6 11 (\u201cA sentence in excess of one prescribed by law is not void ab initio because of the excess, but is good insofar as the power of the court extends and is invalid only as to the excess.\u201d). White, however, contends that \u201c[t]he entirety\u201d of her August 1997 sentence \u201cwas illegal and void because it imposed new conditions not authorized by statute\u201d and, thus, her 2007 sentence is illegal as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>well and must be vacated. Yet, at the same time, citing \u00b6 11 of <em>DeShields, </em>White acknowledges that \u201can illegal sentence ... is void to the extent it exceeds statutory authority.\u201d We agree with this statement and hold that the proper remedy here is to strike the unauthorized conditions on White\u2019s 2007 sentence-namely, any conditions not included in the District Court\u2019s February 1994, August 1994, and July 1996 judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b626 As a final matter, we note that it is not necessary to disturb the District Court\u2019s decision in 2007 to revoke White\u2019s 1997 suspended sentence. White\u2019s February 1994 sentence included a condition that White not consume alcohol, and the District Court had authority to reimpose this condition (as the court did) in all of her subsequent sentences. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), (d), MCA. Thus, given White\u2019s admitted consumption of alcohol in 2006 and 2007, the District Court had a valid basis to revoke her suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b627 In sum, when it revoked White\u2019s suspended sentence in 1997, the District Court had no authority to add new conditions to the newly imposed suspended sentence. Accordingly, the court had no authority to reimpose those illegal conditions in 2007, and the conditions must therefore be stricken. White\u2019s 2007 sentence is not otherwise illegal on the statutory grounds she raises in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">White\u2019s Constitutional-Based Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">\u00b628 White claims that even if her 2007 sentence is legal under the applicable statutes, the sentence violates Article II, Sections 22 and 28 of the Montana Constitution. She notes that the maximum penalty for her 1993 burglary is ten years, <em>see </em>\u00a7 45-6-301(6)(b), MCA, but that she is still serving a sentence related to that offense more than ten years later. She claims that \u201cit is her consumption of alcohol, rather than any criminal proclivities, that has been the impetus for the previous revocations.\u201d She asserts, without any analysis, that \u201cany further punishment for a fifteen-year-old theft crime is cruel and unusual and does not serve any reformative purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b629 We conclude that White\u2019s argument in this connection is too undeveloped. The two-paragraph analysis in her opening brief and the one-paragraph analysis in her reply brief (which essentially reiterates the points made in her opening brief) do not contain any application of specific constitutional rules to the facts of this case. Nor do they contain any citation to authority standing for the proposition she asserts. It is well-established that it is not this Court\u2019s job to conduct legal research on a party\u2019s behalf or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to the position the party advances. <em>See State v. Zakovi, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>2005 MT 91, \u00b6 28, 326 Mont. 475, \u00b6 28, 110 P.3d 469, \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 219, \u00b6 33, 158 P.3d 442, \u00b6 33. Accordingly, we will not address White\u2019s constitutional-based contentions any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b630 We hold under \u00a7 46- 18-203(7)(c), MCA, that the District Court had no authority to impose new conditions on White\u2019s 1997 sentence and that the court, thus, has no authority to reimpose those illegal conditions on White\u2019s 2007 sentence. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s August 2007 judgment to that narrow extent and remand this case with instructions that the court strike all conditions on White\u2019s current sentence which are not contained in the court\u2019s February 1994, August 1994, and July 1996judgments.
