Adams County, 8 Cir., 376 F.2d 212, decided concurrently herewith, is an appeal by Armco from the separate treble-damage judgments rendered in favor of a number of North Dakota Counties for injury from violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1. As in the <em>Adams County </em>case, the violation relied on was the conspiratorial fixing of prices upon corrugated culverts during the period of 1957-1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">The amounts of the treble damages awarded are as follows: Burleigh County $28,360.35; McClean County $14,300.-73; Stark County $21,755.25; Kidder County $7,082.94; Sheridan County $12,940.38; Golden Valley County $5,-154.39; Hettinger County $1,754.22; Grant County $1,709.43; Oliver County $11,527.02; Wells County $31,630.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">The questions sought to be raised are controlled by our decisions in Armco Steel Corp. v. State of North Dakota, 8 Cir., 376 F.2d 206, and the <em>Adams County </em>case, supra, and these require af-firmance of the present judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The sum of $300.00 will be allowed appellees in partial printing cost of the supplemental record filed by them. The sum of $1,000.00 will be allowed them as a joint attorney\u2019s fee on the appeal, based upon the considerations which have been set out in our opinion in the <em>Adams County, </em>case, supra. Both allowances will be taxed as costs against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
