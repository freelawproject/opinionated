Parker and his wife, Martha, owned a wholesale and retail oil and gasoline business. On April 1, 1959, Parker and B. K. Eaves, a longtime employee, formed a Louisiana corporation incorporating Parker\u2019s business. The corporation had an authorized capital stock of 1,000 shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Parker subscribed to 800 shares and paid for them by transferring to the corporation certain property valued at $93,-400.00 to be used in the corporation\u2019s business. Eaves subscribed to the remaining 200 shares. He paid $7,500.00 cash and agreed to pay the balance of $23,350.00 over a period of 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">At the first meeting of the corporation\u2019s board of directors a resolution was passed accepting Eaves\u2019s subscription. He was issued stock certificates for the amount of stock paid for at that time (64.239 shares), and the board of directors resolved that the remainder of Eaves\u2019s stock certificates would be issued as their purchase price was paid. The Articles of Incorporation included a provision stating that none of the stock of the corporation might be transferred unless the stock were first offered to the corporation at the same price offered by the proposed transferee. (If the corporation did not accept the offer, another stockholder could.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">Parker and Eaves also entered into a stockholders\u2019 agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that whenever Eaves\u2019s employment should terminate for any reason, including death, his shares would then be purchased by Parker at a price to be governed by the fair market value per share of the corporation\u2019s assets, specifically excluding good will \u201cor any other intangible asset.\u201d The value per share was set at $116.75 for the first year of the corporation\u2019s existence (until April 1, 1960), and thereafter the price was to be set by agreement between Parker and Eaves, with arbitration if they could not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The face of all stock certificates issued to Parker and Eaves carried notice of the restriction on sale created by the Articles of Incorporation. Only the stock certificates issued to Eaves carried a legend that they were subject to the Eaves-Parker buy-and-sell agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Also, at the first meeting of the board of directors, Parker sold to the corporation certain other assets which were de-preciable property (such as motor vehicles, furniture and fixtures, and other equipment which Parker had apparently used in the business before the incorporation) worth $95,738.70. The corporation was to pay for this property in ten annual installments with interest of 5 per cent. Parker elected to treat the sale as a capital transaction, and reported the gain from it as long term capital gain. IRC \u00a7 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The present suit arises because the Internal Revenue Service treated the gain as ordinary income under IRC \u00a7 1239,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based upon the contention that the taxpayers owned more than 80 per cent \u201cin value\u201d of all outstanding stock of the corporation at the time of sale. The Service assessed deficiencies for the calendar years 1959, 1960, and 1961. Taxpayers paid the assessments under protest and sued in district court for a refund. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a). The district court granted summary judgment for the taxpayers, and the government appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">The government makes two contentions on appeal: first, that the taxpayers owned more than 80 per cent of the outstanding stock because Eaves, at the time of sale, had \u201coutstanding\u201d only those shares which he had paid for and had actually been issued to him and had a mere contract to purchase the remainder. Second, the government argues that even if the full 20 per cent of the shares allotted to Eaves was \u201coutstanding\u201d at the time of the sale, \u201cthe restrictions placed upon those shares and their inherent limitations made them worth less per share than Parker\u2019s.\u201d We disagree with the first of the government\u2019s contentions, but agree with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">The government-argues that Eaves had a mere contract to purchase stock from the corporation, and that therefore the only \u201coutstanding\u201d stock which he owned at the relevant time was the 64.239 shares for which he had paid and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>which certificates had been issued to him. It relies on 5 LSA-R.S. \u00a7 12:15, subd. A.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">\u201cA. No allotment of shares of a corporation shall be made except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">(1) Pursuant to a subscription received therefor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">(2) Pursuant to the declaration of a stock dividend; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">(3) Pursuant to purchase on payment therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The government insists that because Eaves had not paid for 135.761 shares, he failed to own them under \u00a7 12:15, subd. A(3). The government here fails to recognize that \u00a7 12:15, subd. A sets out three ways to become a shareholder. While Eaves did not qualify under \u00a7 12:15, subd. A(3), he did qualify under \u00a7 12:15, subd. A(l). The record shows that Eaves had subscribed for all of the 200 shares and that the corporation had accepted the subscription.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is only where there is no subscription that payment is a condition precedent to becoming an allottee.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The government next argues that because the 135.761 shares had been \u201callotted\u201d but not \u201cissued\u201d, they were not \u201coutstanding\u201d shares within IRC \u00a7 1239. Shares are not \u201cissued\u201d by the corporation until they are fully paid for.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But 5 LSA-R.S. \u00a7 12:1, subd. N says in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">\u201c \u2018Shareholder\u2019 means one who owns one or more shares. A subscriber becomes a shareholder upon the allotment of shares to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">A comment by the chairman of the committee which drafted the Louisiana Act says in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-14\">\u201cThe subscriber\u2019s obligation to pay the subscription price and the procedures which the corporation law establishes for enforcing this obligation lend support to the argument that a binding subscription to shares grants the subscriber the rights of a shareholder * * Dunbar and Nabors, The Louisiana Business Corporation Law, printed at 5 LSA-R.S. xxxi, xlv.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">Further, the Commissioners\u2019 Note to \u00a7 20 of the Model Act makes it clear that an allottee is a shareholder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-17\">\u201cTo express what the corporation does when it makes a subscriber a shareholder, the word \u2018allot,\u2019 which is used in the British statutes, has been adopted. Subscriptions are accepted by the allotment of shares to the subscribers; when the shares have been paid for, a certificate is issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-18\">****** \u201cThere is, however, no policy which would prevent one from being a shareholder subject to the obligation of paying for his shares in instalments. In fact, the prevailing practice permits shares to be paid for in instalments without preventing a subscriber from being a shareholder until he has paid the last instalment. Under the present scheme, the subscriber becomes a shareholder when shares are allotted to him in response to his application, but a certificate cannot be issued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>him until he has fully paid for his shares.\u201d Yol. 5 of LSA-R.S. p. 116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Eaves owned the shares subject to his obligation to pay for them. Issuance of the certificates must await full payment only because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201c * * * an express mandate of the Louisiana Constitution [La.Const. Art. 13, \u00a7 2] prohibits the issuance of a certificate of stock \u2018until the shares represented thereby have been fully paid for.\u2019 Thus, the share certificate cannot be issued in payment for services yet to be rendered, or property yet to be received. This restriction is necessitated by the negotiable qualities of the certificate. It does not prevent a subscriber from immediately becoming a shareholder upon the allotment of his shares, but does prohibit the issuance of a certificate to him until the shares are fully paid for.\u201d Bennett, Louisiana Business Corporation Act of 1928, 2 La.L.Rev. 597, 616 (1940).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">A man need not hold issued shares to be a stockholder; he need only have been allotted shares. Eaves had 200 shares allotted to him by the corporation, and those shares were therefore not subject to disposition by the corporation or anyone other than Eaves. We agree with the district court that shares allotted under the Louisiana Act are \u201coutstanding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Section 1239 prevents capital gain treatment of a \u201csale or exchange\u201d of depreciable property to a controlled corporation or a spouse. Without this section a taxpayer who had property which had been depreciated to a low basis could sell that property to a controlled corporation or spouse and pay only capital gains rates on the gain. The transferee (who is virtually identical to the trans-feror in the proscribed area) could then redepreciate the property, using the sale price as a new basis. The depreciation, of course, would be deducted from ordinary income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1239 renders such a scheme profitless by taxing the gain on the transfer at ordinary rather than capital rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The issue here, of course, is whether Parker\u2019s corporation is sufficiently Parker\u2019s slave to justify invocation of \u00a7 1239. We have concluded that Parker owned, for purposes of \u00a7 1239, exactly 80 per cent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding stock. The decisive question now is whether this 80 per cent is, under \u00a7 1239, \u201cmore than 80 per cent <em>in value </em>of the outstanding stock.\u201d [emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">We first note what \u00a7 1239 does not say. It does not use the standard of \u00a7 368(c) which is invoked by \u00a7 351 for transfers to a controlled corporation in exchange for that corporation\u2019s stock or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>securities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Control is defined by \u00a7 368 (c) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">\u201cownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined <em>voting power </em>of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total <em>number </em>of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.\u201d [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"> By contrast, \u00a7 1239 says \u201cmore than 80 per cent <em>in value.\u201d </em>The words \u201cin value\u201d in \u00a7 1239 must have some meaning. Trotz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir. 1966, 361 F.2d 927, 930. We cannot indulge in statutory interpretation by excision. Statutory explication may be an art, but it must not be artful. Further, we cannot say that by using \u201cin value\u201d Congress intended us to consider only the factors of voting power or number of shares. \u201cIf the 80% determination is to be [merely] on the basis of the number of shares outstanding, no reason exists for the use of the words \u2018in value\u2019.\u201d Trotz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, 361 F.2d at 930. Or, if number of shares and voting power were the sole indicia, Congress could have limited \u00a7 1239 by using terms similar to those which \u00a7 351 draws from \u00a7 368(c) in an analogous situation within the Code\u2019s framework. \u201cIn value\u201d is a broader phrase, and we think that it calls for the familiar, though difficult, process of fair market valuation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u201cThe value of property is an underlying factor in a great number of income tax cases, particularly in such areas of the law as those involving the receipt of income, the computation of gain or loss, depreciation and depletion.\u201d 10 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 59.01 (1964 revision). Value is not a strange or alien concept in tax law, and we have held that \u201cThere is no distinction, for most purposes * * *, in the meaning of fair market value as used in an estate tax case and one involving income tax.\u201d Champion v. Commissioner, 5 Cir. 1962, 303 F.2d 887, 892-893.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">We next note that in the present case Eaves owned exactly 20 per cent of the outstanding stock, and Parker owned exactly 80 per cent. Therefore, if any fact can be found which shows that the value per share of Parker\u2019s stock exceeded by any amount, no matter how small, the value per share of Eaves\u2019s, then Parker owned more than 80 per cent in value of the outstanding stock. While it is true that Parker and Eaves owned the same class of stock, Eaves\u2019s stock was burdened with'impedimenta from which Parker\u2019s stock was free. We hold that as a matter of law these impedimenta must have decreased the value per share of Eaves\u2019s stock, and as we need only show that this value per share was lower by any indeterminate amount, no matter how miniscule, than the value per share of Parker\u2019s stock, we are able to render judgment here without remand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">The impedimenta which depress the value spring from two sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>A. <em>The restrictions on transfer of stock. </em>Eaves\u2019s stock was encumbered by two kinds of restrictions. First, the articles of incorporation stated that the corporation had the right of first refusal of any offer to sell to a third party. Second, Eaves\u2019s agreement with Parker stated that if Eaves left the employ of the corporation for any reason, he must sell all of his stock to Parker at a price representing the value per share of the assets, specifically excluding good will. Notice to the world of these restrictions, like the mark of Cain, was on the face \u2022of Eaves\u2019s stock certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The practical effect of these restrictions was to reduce the number of opportunities for Eaves to sell or give away the stock and to place a limit (the duration of his employment) upon the period when he might hold the stock. \u201cA commodity freely salable is obviously worth more \u2022on the market than a precisely similar commodity which cannot be freely sold.\u201d Judge Woodbury for the First Circuit in Worcester County Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1 Cir. 1943, 134 F.2d 578, 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The alienability of Parker\u2019s stock was restricted only by the limitation imposed by the articles of incorporation. Whether this limitation, in the light of Parker\u2019s complete control, had any real effect on alienability we need not consider, for Eaves\u2019s stock was burdened not only by the articles but also by the extra and potent limitation of the buy-sell agreement. Even if we consider the Eaves and Parker stock as identically limited by the articles, Parker\u2019s stock was not affected by the buy-sell -agreement; Eaves\u2019s was. \u201cIn our view it must be said that the restriction necessarily has a depressing effect upon the value of the .stock in the market.\u201d Worcester County Trust Co., supra, 134 F.2d at 582. That such an extra limitation on alienability would depress market value to some greater extent is a well-recognized proposition: Mailloux v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1963, 320 F.2d 60; James v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir. 1945, 148 F.2d 236; Kirby v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1939, 102 F.2d 115; Mathews v. United States, E.D.N.Y.1964, 226 F. Supp. 1003; Baltimore National Bank v. United States, D.Md.1955, 136 F.Supp. 642. \u201cSeparation of the power of alienation from the ownership of property, or other forms of restriction against transfer, have in numerous cases been held to lessen the value of property.\u201d 10 Mer-tens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 59.20 (1964 Rev.).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">B. <em>The lack of control. </em>Eaves owned only 20 per cent of the stock. This left Parker in sole control of the corporation\u2019s affairs. Parker could, without Eaves, elect and remove directors and officers, amend the articles, and promulgate by-laws. He could dissolve, the corporation. 5 LSA-R.S. \u00a7 12:54. With these powers, Parker controlled without possibility of challenge the entire operation from the smallest detail to the largest. He exercised so much power that the corporation was his alter ego, or his slave. This is the situation at which \u00a7 1239 aims.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">Any purchaser of Eaves\u2019s stock would not be buying any degree of control over the corporation. The voting power which technically inhered in Eaves\u2019s stock was in reality worthless; Parker owned all of the real voting stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">We hold that this disability which inhered in Eaves\u2019s stock reduced its value per share below that of Parker\u2019s stock as a matter of law. Cravens v. Welch, S.D.Cal.1935, 10 F.Supp. 94; Irene de Guebriant, 14 T.C. 611 (1950), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Clafin v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir. 1951, 186 F.2d 307; Mathilde B. Hooper, 41 B.T.A. 114 (1940). See Mathews v. United States, supra; Wor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>then v. United States, D.Mass.1961, 192 F.Supp. 727.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\">\u201cEven absent any contemplated change in management, control increases the value of an investment by protecting it. The power to change the management, even while unexercised, protects the investor with control against an abrupt change by someone else and against a gradual deterioration of the incumbent management. Therefore, in a sense, controlling shares are inherently worth more than noncontrolling shares for reasons relating solely to investment value. When control is diffused, the same reasoning establishes, to a lesser degree, that shares enabling their holder to participate in control are worth more than those that do not. This is the strongest part of any argument against a broad reading of [Perlman v. Feldmann, 2 Cir. 1955, 219 F.2d 173, cert. denied 349 U.S. 952, 75 S.Ct. 880, 99 L.Ed. 1277 (1955)]. It is the kernel of truth in the assertion that a premium paid for controlling shares only shows that controlling shares are inherently worth more than minority shares.\u201d Andrews, The Stockholder\u2019s Right to Equal Opportunity in the Sale of Shares, 78 Harvard L.Rev. 505, 526 (1965).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">In the vast majority of cases, courts of appeals have remanded where, as here, the lower courts failed to take into account all of the existing impedimenta on market value. For instance, in Kirby v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201cThe Board [of Tax Appeals] * * declined to make any allowance against the value [of the stock] for the burden of the contract under which the stock had been bought and held. The result was neither, a true nor a fair, [sic] determination of value. The finding which mirrors that result cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cTherefore * * * we reverse the order of the Board, and remand * * * for a redetermination * * * \u201d 102 F.2d at 118.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">We reiterate that in the present case it is sufficient for the rendering of judgment to note that the restriction on Eaves\u2019s stock and its minority qualities combine to have some depressing effect, no matter how small, on its value per share. We hold, therefore, that Parker owned more than 80 per cent in value of the corporation\u2019s stock, and that any gain on the sale of the depreciable property was properly taxed at ordinary rates. We render judgment for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">.

Eaves had subscribed for one (1) share of the stock, without par value, in the Articles of Incorporation and desires to subscribe for one-hundred and ninety-nine (199) additional shares at the price of One Hundred Sixteen and 75/100 Dollars ($116.75) per share, for a total price of Twenty-Three Thousand Three Hundred Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($23,350.00) said subscription to be payable Seventy-Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00) cash, and the balance payable in five (5) annual installments of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) each, and a final installment of Eight Hundred Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($850.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apb-dedup-1\">\u201cNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that One Hundred Sixteen and 75/100 Dollars ($116.75) per share be fixed as the amount of consideration to be received by this corporation for said shares and that Mr. Eaves\u2019 subscription be accepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b460-21\">. \u201c\u00a7 16. Issue of certificates of stock A. A certificate of stock shall not be issued until the shares represented thereby have been fully paid for.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">. The net effect may be shown graphically in a hypothetical case: R, the transferor, holds property depreciated to a value of $2,000. R sells the property for $6,000 to E, his controlled corporation. R pays a maximum capital gains tax of 25 per cent on the $4,000 gain, or a tax of $1,000. E, with a basis of $6,000 on the property takes depreciation deductions from ordinary income. After four or five years of these deductions E has depreciated the property back to the $2,000 basis. (See depreciation guidelines in Rev.Proc. 62-21; rates of depreciation in Rev.Proc. 65-13, Appendix 1, Table A.) E has by then deducted $4,000 in depreciation from ordinary income. If E is in the 50 per cent bracket, the $4,000 in depreciation deductions has saved him $2,000 in income taxes. R has therefore paid a $1,000 capital gains tax and has saved E $2,000 in income taxes. If R and E are identical (and in cases covered by \u00a7 1239 they certainly may be considered so), then R has avoided $2,000 in taxes by paying only $1,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b461-15\">. Section 351(a) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-16\">\u201cNo gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation and immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control (as defined in section 368(c)) of the corporation. For purposes of this section, stock or securities issued for services shall not be considered as issued in return for property.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\">. The district judge stated his findings of fact and conclusions of law with explicitness. He concluded, as do we, that market valuation was the proper test for \u00a7 1239. He found as a matter of law, however, that neither the restrictions on salability of the Eaves stock nor its minority position reduced its value per share, and it is here that we disagree. However, partly because of the peculiar circumstances of this case, but largely because the district judge stated his findings and conclusions so clearly and distinctly and isolated with precision the ground for his holding, we have been able to render unnecessary the remand which would usually be required. Even though we disagree on one point, the opinion of the district judge epitomizes the result sought by Rule 52(a), and thereby promotes the \u201cjust, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action\u201d sought by Rule 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b462-14\">. In this aspect the present case differs from Trotz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra. There, the taxpayer Trotz owned 79 per cent of the outstanding stock and the lesser shareholder owned 21 per cent. The Tenth Circuit remanded the case for a factual determination by the Tax Court of whether any difference between the values per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>share of the large and small blocks brought Trotz\u2019s holding above 80 per cent in value. In contrast, in the present case any extra value per share in Parker\u2019s stock will bring his holding above 80 per cent in value. No determination is needed of how mucli more per share Parker\u2019s stock is worth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">. This entire article is concerned with the inherent disparity of value between controlling and non-controlling shares. Professor Andrews proposes a remedy to allow minority shareholders to share in the premium paid for controlling stock, but that remedy is not part of the law of Louisiana; the article\u2019s call for a remedy demonstrates how real the problem is.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
