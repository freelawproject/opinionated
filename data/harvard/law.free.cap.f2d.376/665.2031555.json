The appellees were discharged following Southern\u2019s acquisition of the A&amp;EC in September 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The only question raised in these appeals is whether the district judge correctly applied the job security provisions. Pertinent parts of the provisions follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201c4. If, as a result of the * * * [acquisition herein approved] any employee of * * * the carriers is <em>displaced, </em>that is, placed in a worse postion with respect to his compensation and rules governing his work conditions, and so long thereafter as he is unable, in the exercise of his seniority rights under existing agreements, rules, and practice, to obtain a position producing compensation equal to or exceeding the compensation he received in the position from which he was displaced, he shall be paid a monthly displacement allowance equal to the difference between the monthly compensation received by him in the position in which he is retained and the [average] monthly compensation received by him [during the last 12 months] in the position from which he was displaced. * * If his compensation in his retained position in any month is less than the aforesaid average compensation in the test period, he shall be paid the difference * * *; provided, however, * * * that if any employee elects not to exercise his seniority rights he shall be entitled to no allowance, * * *. The period during which this protection is to be given, hereinafter called the protective period, shall extend from the date on which the employee was displaced to the expiration of 4 years from the effective date of our order herein; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-13\">\u201c5. If, as a result of the transaction herein approved, any employee, hereinafter referred to as a <em>dismissed employee, </em>of the carriers is deprived of employment with said carriers because of the abolition of his position * * as a result of the transaction herein approved, he shall be accorded a monthly dismissal allowance equivalent to one-twelfth of the compensation received by him in the last 12 months of his employment in which he earned compensation prior to the date he is first deprived of employment as a result of this transaction. This allowance shall be made during the protective period to each dismissed employee while unemployed, * * *. \u201cThe dismissal allowance of any dismissed employee who is otherwise em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ployed shall be reduced to the extent that his combined monthly earnings in such other employment, any benefits received under any unemployment insurance law, and his dismissal allowance exceed the amount upon which his dismissal allowance is based. Such employee, or his representative, and the carriers, should agree upon a procedure by which the carriers shall be currently informed of the wages earned by such employee in employment other than with the carriers, and the benefits received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\u201cThe dismissal allowance shall cease prior to the expiration of the protective period in the event of the failure of the employee without good cause to return to service after being notified by the carriers of a position, the duties of which he is qualified to perform and for which he is eligible, or in the event of his resignation, death, retirement on pension, or dismissal for good cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">EDWARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Edwards was discharged after Southern\u2019s acquisition of the A&amp;EC. The only issue presented for our consideration is whether the district court erred in treating him as an \u201cemployee\u201d entitled to protection under the ICC order. We believe the district court was wrong in affording Edwards the benefit of the protective order and reverse its judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Prior to Southern\u2019s assumption of control Edwards\u2019 father was General Manager, Chairman of the Board, and controlling stockholder of the small <em>family-owned </em>railroad. Edwards was himself a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">When discharged Edwards was Chief Engineer, a position designated in reports filed with the ICC and the North Carolina Utilities Commission as a general officer of the A&amp;EC. Edwards served as advisor to his father and technical administrator with authority to execute the company budget and procure materials for track maintenance. He was responsible for the \u201cRoadway Department\u201d and supervised something over one-third of A&amp;EC\u2019s approximately one hundred and seventy employees. Edwards was -not a union member and his position was not covered by any collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">Neither the Interstate Commerce Commission nor the \u201cOklahoma conditions\u201d imposed by the ICC provide a definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d We believe, however, that \u201cemployee\u201d as used in the present context by Congress and the ICC surely does not include the principal managers of a railroad who ordinarily are in a position to protect themselves from the consequences of consolidation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Edwards occupied in the small family-owned railroad an important managerial position and, moreover, stood in a unique personal relationship to the controlling interests. We believe our decision that he is not entitled to the benefit of the protective order is supported by the legislative history of Section 5(2) (f) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the Interstate Commerce Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and by other relevant railroad law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">TAYLOR</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Taylor was discharged from the position of car inspector and repairman in which he had served ten years. Counsel agree that the sole question presented is whether the discharge was the \u201cresult\u201d of the consolidation in the sense <em>result </em>is used in Section 5(2) (f) and the employee protective conditions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We cannot say that the district court was clearly erroneous in determining that Taylor\u2019s discharge did \u201cresult\u201d from Southern\u2019s acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Taylor\u2019s responsibilities had entailed inspecting railroad cars for defects when they came into the A&amp;EC yards in New Bern. He would repair some in the yards and tag others which were then sent to the A&amp;EC shops. Taylor also assisted in making up trains and did \u201clittle odds and ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">When Southern acquired the A&amp;EC the duties of car inspector were changed so as to require the ability to operate a derrick on a flat car or drive a truck with portable repair equipment. This enabled the car inspector to make repairs in the field along, the ninety-six-mile railroad. Taylor was offered his former position as redefined by Southern but was unable to qualify because of the inability to operate a derrick or drive a truck.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The railroad did not offer him any other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">The district court concluded that Southern had effectively abolished the car inspector position <em>in the New Bern yard. </em>It found that \u201c[t]he nature of the position had materially changed\u201d and now \u201cbears little resemblance to that position from which changes took place</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">* * * <em>ft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-19\">Southern argues that Taylor\u2019s job was not eliminated but its duties expanded to promote efficiency by making car re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>pairs in the field. Southern does not contend that this was an \u201ceconomy measure which had begun before Southern\u2019s acquisition and expanded thereafter,\u201d as was found to be the cause for displacement of section laborers and clerks in Swacker v. Southern Ry., 360 F.2d 420, 428 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 837, 87 S.Ct. 83, 17 L.Ed.2d 70 (1966). Southern asserts only that the new methods of car repair <em>could have been </em>instituted before as well as after the acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">It is again unnecessary to reach the question expressly left open in Swacker: whether ICC protective conditions may benefit employees dismissed because of the adoption of technological improvements or economy measures after acquisition of control. 360 F.2d at 428.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We think that the evidence in the present record will support the inference that the requirements of Taylor\u2019s job were altered as a consequence of the redistribution of functions between the A&amp;EC and the Southern after the change of ownership.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">Moreover, there is no question that but for Southern\u2019s acquisition of the A&amp;EC Taylor would have retained his job. He could not meet the requirements of car inspector as redefined, and Southern failed to offer him alternative employment for which he could qualify. Taylor was placed in \u201ca worse position\u201d in respect to his employment. We affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">SHEPPARD</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">Southern concedes that when separated from his position as diesel mechanic\u2019s helper Sheppard was entitled to collect the dismissal allowance provided for in paragraph five of the \u201cOklahoma conditions.\u201d The present question is whether Sheppard\u2019s subsequent conduct deprives him of the right to the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>allowance during the four year protective period.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Southern did not offer or advise Sheppard of other railroad employment upon his release following the change in A&amp;EC ownership. Soon after his discharge, Sheppard learned from an independent source of an open job as spike puller with an A&amp;EC labor gang out of Morehead City. He had worked out of New Bern while a diesel mechanic\u2019s helper. \u2022 Southern admits that Sheppard sought and obtained the ppen position on his own initiative. Sheppard\u2019s new employment required different skills than his old job and paid him a lower wage rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Sheppard was discharged from the new position as spike puller after only a week because of his intemperate protest<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when asked to assist in lifting a half-ton motor car from the tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">We believe the district court was correct in treating Sheppard\u2019s employment as a spike puller \u201cin a manner as if [he] * * * had found work with an employer totally unrelated to railroading.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It was, therefore, unnecessary to determine whether Sheppard\u2019s second dismissal was for good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We interpret the \u201cOklahoma conditions\u201d to mean that an employee is not \u201cretained\u201d in a position \u2014 and thus <em>displaced </em>as opposed to <em>dismissed </em>\u2014 unless retained at the instance of the railroad. We think that displacement conditions should not be substituted for dismissal conditions except where an employee receives an offer from the railroad to continue in or return to a new position for which he is qualified. Sheppard\u2019s second discharge may or may not have resulted from his inability to perform the new work he attempted. Such inability could well account for insubordination and intemperance of language. We need not decide \u2014 because he was not notified by the carrier of a position \u201cthe duties of which he [was] * * qualified to perform.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, Sheppard\u2019s obtaining a job as spike puller on his own initiative, as the district court thought, is analogous to a dismissed railroad worker unsuccessfully attempting work other than railroad employment. Such a situation is within the scope and purpose of the dismissal benefits accorded under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">Whether the second dismissal was for cause in the sense that Sheppard could not do the work or for cause in the sense of insubordination, we think the district court rightly adjudged that he lost his job <em>as a diesel mechanic's helper </em>as a result of the acquisition of the A&amp;EC by Southern. Southern is, of course, entitled to reduce the compensation owing to Sheppard by the amount of his temporary earnings \u2014 whether as a spike puller with the A&amp;EC or in other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-19\">10.869, Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-20\">10.870, Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-21\">10,873, Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">.

Where one railroad is permitted to acquire control of a second railroad through ownership of its capital stock, as in the present case, the ICC is required by Section 5(2) (f) of the Interstate Commerce Act to impose employee protective conditions. Section 5(2) (f) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201cAs a condition of its approval, under this paragraph, of any transaction involving a carrier or carriers by railroad subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Commission shall require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the railroad employees affectocl. In its order of approval the Commission shall include terms and conditions providing that during the period of four years from the effective date of such order such transaction will not result in employees of the carrier or carriers by railroad affected by such order being in a worse position with respect to their employment, except that the protection afforded to any employee pursuant to this sentence shall not be required to continue for a longer period, following the effective date of such order, . than the period during which such employee was in the employ of such carrier or carriers prior to the effective date of such order * * 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5(2) (f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">See generally Brotherhood of M.W.E. v. United States, 366 U.S. 169, 81 S.Ct. 913, 6 L.Ed.2d 206 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">. The provisions are from paragraphs 4 and 5 of the conditions first imposed in Oklahoma Ry. Co. Trustees Abandonment, 257 I.C.C. 177 (1944), and generally referred to as the \u201cOklahoma conditions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. One federal district court considering ICC job protection provisions has ruled that \u201cemployees\u201d encompasses persons \u201c(including subordinate officials) covered by, or subject to, collective bargaining agreements under the Railway Labor Act\u201d but not, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cofficers,\u201d or \u201cdepartment heads, and those in the next echelon, such as assistants and staff members to the department heads.\u201d In the Matter of Florida E.C. Ry., No. 4827-J, S.D.Fla., January 5, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">In a 1954 unreported opinion, Judge Skelly Wright concluded that the legislative history of Section 5(2) (f) of the Interstate Commerce Act \u201cleaves no doubt that the term \u2018employee\u2019 as used therein does not include the vice-president and general manager of a railroad. * * * Nor does the every day meaning of the word \u2018employee\u2019 * * See McDow v. Louisiana S. Ry., 219 F.2d 650, 652 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir. 1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. Consideration by Congress of employee protective measures was in terms of aiding railroad \u201clabor\u201d (\u201cworkers,\u201d those \u201cwho toil,\u201d and those belonging to unions). See, e. g., discussion by George H. Harrison in Hearings Before Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the Transportation Act of 1940, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. at 34 (1939) and debate at 84 Cong.Rec. 9881-7 (1939).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">. Employee is defined in Section 1 of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 (Fifth), to include \u201cevery person in the service of a carrier * * * who performs any work defined as that of an <em>employee or subordinate official </em>in the orders of the * * * \u201d ICC. (Emphasis added.) We think it clear that Edwards carried sufficient responsibilities, especially considered against the background of immediate family relationship, to remove him from the category of subordinate official. In Beeler v. Chicago R.I. &amp; P. Ry., 169 F.2d 557 (10th Cir. 1948), cert denied, 335 U.S. 903, 69 S.Ct. 407, 93 L.Ed. 437 (1949), the Tenth Circuit held that an agent-yardmaster was an official \u2014 as distinguished from a \u201csubordinate official\u201d \u2014 and therefore not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the Railway Labor Act definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Our decision that Edwards is not an \u201cemployee\u201d is in accord with the principles laid down in the ICC decision cited by the district court. In the Matter of Regs. Concerning the Class of Employees and Subordinate Officials to Be Included Within the Term \u201cEmployee\u201d Under the Railway Labor Act, 266 I.C.C. 85 (1946). The ICC, holding that certain subordinate officials, including general roadmas-ters and foremen and supervisors and inspectors of signals, were \u201cemployees\u201d under the Railway Labor Act, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-20\">\u201cin the final analysis rank and title are not controlling in defining the work of subordinate officials, and we are unable to conclude that there is any fixed outstanding factor which will always control, without exception. We do not believe that as a practical matter it is feasible to make a definite line of demarcation between the work of subordinate officials and that of officials. * * * Each proceeding, therefore, must of necessity be decided upon the record * * Supra, 266 I.C.C. at 92.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b723-23\">.
