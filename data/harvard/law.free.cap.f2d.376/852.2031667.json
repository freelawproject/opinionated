He contended that, over his objection, incriminating statements which he had involuntarily given to investigating public officers, were used in evidence against him at his state trial, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">The district court, after an evidentiary hearing, found and concluded that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the giving of the incriminating statements does not indicate that they were involuntary and therefore inadmissible. The district court therefore denied the application for a writ of ha-beas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">On this appeal, McFarland questions the findings and conclusions which led the district court to deny the application. For the reasons stated in the comprehensive opinion of the district court, McFarland v. Wilson, N.D.Cal., 266 F.Supp. 576, we</p>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">Affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
