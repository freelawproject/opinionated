The opposer is the owner of the trademark \u201cLILLI ANN\u201d for women\u2019s wearing apparel including dresses. There is no question that the opposer is prior in use and that the parties\u2019 goods and customers are, at least in part, the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-22\">The sole issue is whether the applicant\u2019s trademark so resembles that of the opposer as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. The board, one member dissenting, found that there would be a likelihood of confusion, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">We note that the dominant parts of the two marks are pronounced the same and look alike, that \u201cLILLY\u201d is a shortening of Lillian, and that it is not an infrequent practice with ladies\u2019 clothing to identify it with its designer. Hence, the reference to a feminine name could be taken by the customer as identifying the designer, and it seems likely that a customer, having read an advertisement for \u201cLILLI ANN\u201d, might reasonably assume that she had found the advertised goods, when she found them with the trademark \u201cTHE LILLY.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">The applicant complains that the decision of the board unduly stresses the fact that the two marks are susceptible of the same connotation and fails to give weight to a number of third-party registrations introduced into evidence in which the dominant words are Lily, Lilly, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Lilli. In view of the obvious similarity of appearance and sound of the two marks, we think that, while the similar!ty of connotation was a factor in the board\u2019s decision, it was neither the principal nor the only basis for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"> All that the third-party registrations demonstrate is that their owners believe the term \u201cLILLY\u201d to be appropriate for a trademark for women\u2019s dresses. The question still remains whether the marks viewed as a whole are confusingly similar. The existence of third-party registrations of similar marks has very little weight on this question. As pointed out in In re Helene Curtis Industries, Inc., 305 F.2d 492, 49 CCPA 1367 the existence of these registrations is not evidence of what happens in the market place or that customers are familiar with their use. Moreover, as the court held there, the existence of confusingly similar marks already on the register will not aid an applicant to register another confusingly similar mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">RICH, Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
