They appeal on the ground that the jury instructions were improper in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-26\">Defendants complain, first, of the court\u2019s refusal to instruct that \u201ca preparer of a tax return is not responsible for the truth and accuracy of the information furnished by the taxpayer.\u201d If this instruction meant, as it might seem to mean, that a tax adviser may allow submission of statements known to him to be false if they were supplied by the taxpayer, it was wholly incorrect. If it merely meant that the burden was upon the government to prove that defendants knew that the returns were false, the court fully gave such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-27\">Defendants next contend that it was error to refuse to instruct that in determining wilfulness the jury should take into account certain cooperative acts of the defendants. Wilfulness is a question of fact for the jury, to be determined upon all of the evidence. While the court may comment on the evidence, it was entirely proper to refuse to tell the jury that it \u201cshould\u201d consider particular, fragmented, parts of the testimony. This is especially true where the selected evidence was of marginal value, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Finally, defendants assert that the tone of the charge was prejudicial, and in particular that the court used the term \u201cguilty\" sixteen times and the term \u201cnot guilty\u201d only five times. Defendants took no such exceptions to the charge at the time. Even if they had, we find the charge entirely fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
