Defendant at the trial resulting in his conviction was represented by competent court-appointed counsel. No appeal was taken from such conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-23\">Judge Harper, in a memorandum opinion reported at 260 F.Supp. 315, fairly sets out the grounds for relief asserted by the defendant in his motion. We have carefully examined the entire record and have given full consideration to the grounds asserted by the defendant as a basis for relief. We find that all of the defendant\u2019s asserted contentions are adequately answered in Judge Harper\u2019s reported opinion. We affirm upon the basis of such opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-24\">Defendant has attempted to raise upon appeal issues which were not raised in the trial court. Issues not raised before the District Court are entitled to no consideration upon appeal. Vincent v. United States, 8 Cir., 361 F.2d 474, 476; Jackson v. United States, 8 Cir., 304 F.2d 243, 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
