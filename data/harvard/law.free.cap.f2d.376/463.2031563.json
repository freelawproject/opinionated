(\u201cHamilton\u201d) was an Illinois corporation organized in 1933, with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. It was a manufacturer of garden equipment and children\u2019s toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On July 8, 1960, M.J.D.M. Truck Rentals, Inc. (\u201cMJDM\u201d), a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, filed a District Court breach of contract suit against Hamilton, seeking damages for rental of tractors and trailers by MJDM to Hamilton. On June 3, 1964, a jury verdict was rendered in favor of MJDM for $107,587, and judgment was entered on the verdict. Under Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, all proceedings to enforce the judgment were automatically stayed until June 13, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">On June 23, 1964, Hamilton filed a motion for stay of execution, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a motion for a new trial. On that date, the District Court denied Hamilton\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and took under advisement the motion for a new trial. At the same time, the District Court ordered \u201cexecution of judgment stayed until 10 days after ruling on motion for new trial\u201d. On January 22, 1965, Hamilton\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied upon MJDM\u2019s filing a remittitur reducing its judgment to $60,261.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">On December 9, 1964, alleging insolvency, Hamilton filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.), but Hamilton retained possession of its assets and continued the operation of its business. The referee in bankruptcy simultaneously stayed any suits against Hamilton, after finding that Hamilton was then in default in payment of debts aggregating $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">On February 19, 1965, Hamilton withdrew its arrangement petition and consented to be adjudged a bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.). On the same date, Nathan Yorke was appointed trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq4\">On February 26, 1965, the bankruptcy trustee was authorized to offer Hamilton\u2019s real estate for sale on March 15, 1965. In the order authorizing the sale, the referee directed all persons asserting liens against the real estate to show cause why it should not be sold free of any encumbrances. MJDM was given notice of this order but did not appear at the March 12th hearing on the rule to show cause. However, without notice to the bankruptcy trustee, on that date MJDM filed with the Recorder of Deeds of Cook County, Illinois, a copy of its reduced judgment. The judgment was duly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Hamilton\u2019s real estate was sold on March 16, 1965, in open court for the sum of $327,000 free of all encumbrances. On April 14,1965, the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion for summary judgment, asking the referee for an order declaring that MJDM\u2019s purported lien for $60,261 be declared null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Title and possession of Hamilton\u2019s real estate were transferred by the bankruptcy trustee to the purchaser on May 3, 1965. On December 3, 1965, the trustee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was sustained by the referee and MJDM\u2019s purported judgment lien was declared null and void. The bankruptcy court affirmed the referee\u2019s order and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">The sole issue is whether MJDM\u2019s judgment became a lien on Hamilton\u2019s real estate superior to the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s. We agree with the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that MJDM\u2019s purported lien was null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\"> MJDM first contends that the mortgaging of Hamilton's properties was fraudulent and deceitful. Nothing in this record shows that the mortgages were to avoid paying the judgment obtained by MJDM. The July 17, 1964, mortgage antedated the December 9, 1964, Chapter XI petition by almost five months and therefore was beyond the period prescribed by Sections 60 and 67 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a796 and 107). The October 15, 1964, mortgage was of course within four months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>preceding the Chapter XI petition and therefore may be a voidable preference <em>{idem). </em>To avoid being surcharged, it is to be presumed that the bankruptcy trustee, who represents all creditors, will raise any tenable objections to the mortgages in the bankruptcy court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any improprieties in the mortgages would affect all unsecured creditors equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Similarly, there is nothing in this record to show that the Chapter XI petition was filed in bad faith to avoid MJDM\u2019s judgment. Instead, the record shows that at the time of filing the Chapter XI petition, Hamilton\u2019s debts aggregated $1,000,000, resulting in Hamilton\u2019s insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">At the time of these proceedings, Section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act provided as follows (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(c)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ana\">\u201cThe trustee, as to all property, whether or not coming into possession or control of the court, upon which a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the date of bankruptcy, shall be deemed vested as of such date with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor then holding a lien thereon by such proceedings, whether or not such a creditor actually exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjYV\">This provision was enacted in 1910 to give the bankruptcy trustee \u201call the rights of an ideal judicial lien creditor\u201d. Lewis v. Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, 364 U.S. 603, 605, 81 S.Ct. 347, 348, 5 L.Ed.2d 323; 4 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed. 1964) pp. 1410-1434.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Under Section 70c, the trustee\u2019s rights as an ideal lien creditor vest \u201cat the date of bankruptcy\u201d. That date means \u201cthe date when the petition was filed\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In turn, \u201cpetition\u201d is defined as \u201ca document filed in a court of bankruptcy * * initiating a proceeding under this Act\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another provision of the Bankruptcy Act makes it clear that where, as here, a proceeding under Chapter XI is succeeded by bankruptcy, the proceeding shall be conducted \u201cas if a voluntary petition for adjudication in bankruptcy had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the petition under this chapter [XI] was filed\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By virtue of these provisions, the date of bankruptcy in this case was December 9, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">Section 1962 of the Judicial Code provides that every judgment rendered by a District Court within a State shall be a lien on the property in that State as provided by the law of the State (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962). The necessary reference to the governing Illinois statute provides that a judgment of a court of the United States shall become a lien upon the real estate of the person against whom the judgment is rendered upon filing a copy of the judgment in the office of the county recorder of deeds (Ill.Rev.Stats. 1965, c. 77, \u00a7 69a). Under these two provisions, it is clear that MJDM\u2019s judgment could not be perfected into a valid lien until it was filed with the Recorder of Deeds of Cook County. That was not done until March 12, 1965, long after the date of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Under the Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy trustee had acquired the status of a lien creditor on December 9, 1964. Since MJDM\u2019s judgment did not become a lien until March 12, 1965, that lien is null and void as against the trustee. United States v. Speers, 382 U.S. 266, 275, 86 S.Ct. 411, 15 L.Ed.2d 314; In re Goodwin Corp., 87 F.2d 468, 470 (7th Cir. 1937); In re Lustron Corp., 184 F.2d 789, 794 (7th Cir. 1950), certiorari denied, Lafayette Steel Co. v. Lustron Corp., 340 U.S. 946, 71 S.Ct. 531, 95 L.Ed. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">To rebut these authorities MJDM argues that the June 23, 1964, order (entered in the breach of contract action) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>staying execution of the June 3, 1964, judgment in MJDM\u2019s favor restrained it from recording that judgment. However, the order merely provided \u201cexecution of judgment stayed until 10 days after ruling on motion for new trial\u201d. The stay order did not prevent MJDM from recording its judgment. Execution of judgment would result in the transfer of property from Hamilton to MJDM to satisfy its judgment. Recording this judgment would not be execution because it does not result in any transfer of property. Recording would not affect any judgment creditor rights of MJDM against Hamilton; rather it would determine MJDM\u2019s position vis-a-vis others with claims on Hamilton\u2019s assets. Therefore, the stay of execution did not prevent MJDM from recording, nor could MJDM have reasonably thought so. In Illinois, a judgment lien and execution on a judgment are different things. Reconstruction Finance Corporation v. Ma-ley, 125 F.2d 131, 133 (7th Cir. 1942) recognizes this difference. There the plaintiff recorded a transcript of his judgment in Knox County, Illinois, and this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">\u201c * * * plaintiff, by the filing of such transcript, acquired a lien upon the debtor\u2019s real estate in Knox County. No execution was issued upon such transcript * * * \u201d.s</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akh-dedup-1\">In other words, the creation of a judgment lien and an execution are considered separate incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In sum, nothing in the June 23, 1964, stay order prevented MJDM from recording its judgment. Moreover, there was no stay order in effect between June 13, 1964, and June 23, 1964. MJDM has not explained its failure to record its judgment during that interval.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Chapter 77 Illinois Revised Statutes (1965) Section 1 provides that \u201ca judgment shall be a lien * * * only from the time\u201d of recording. MJDM argues that the effect of Section 2 of this Chapter is to make the effective date of its \u201clien\u201d relate back to June 23, 1964, when the stay of execution was entered by the District Court in the breach of contract suit. Section 2 provides that \u201c[w]hen the party in whose favor a judgment is rendered is restrained * * * from issuing execution or selling thereon, the time he is so restrained or delayed shall not be considered as any part of the time mentioned\u201d in Section 1. We cannot accept MJDM\u2019s argument, for Section 2 is a provision which tolls the seven-year statute of limitations on liens and executions (Section 6 of Chapter 77) while a stay of execution is in effect. Section 2 regulates the length of time for which one is entitled to a judgment lien or execution but has nothing to do with the time at which a judgment lien is created. Because Sections 1 and 2 are separate statutory provisions governing the time and manner of creating a judgment lien (Section 1) and the duration thereof (Section 2), MJDM\u2019s relation back argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">To conclude, the trustee\u2019s lien was valid against Hamilton\u2019s property as of December 9, 1964. Being perfected thereafter, any lien of MJDM was null and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy. We realize that this means MJDM will be an unsecured creditor. However, its remedy was to have promptly recorded its judgment lien or to have obtained security when the District Court stayed execution of judgment in the breach of contract case against Hamilton. Equitable relief may not be awarded now to afford MJDM a remedy at the expense of other Hamilton creditors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">.
