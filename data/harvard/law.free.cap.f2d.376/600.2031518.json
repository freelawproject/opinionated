The plaintiff moved the district court to set aside the jury verdict and grant a new trial solely on the issue of damages, asserting inadequacy of the verdict. The motion was denied and judgment was entered on the verdict. We are not persuaded that the amount of the verdict was inadequate or that resubmission of the issue of damages to a jury was required. We find no abuse of discretion by the court below in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
