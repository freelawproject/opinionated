The court therefore instructed the jury that it would not be sufficient that appellant intended to promote prostitution, but it must appear that he intended to promote the carrying on of prostitution in a manner violative of the laws of Nevada, and, specifically, in violation of N.R.S. 201.300 which made it unlawful for any person to persuade or encourage a female to become an inmate of a place where prostitution was practiced, or to agree to receive any money for procuring a female to come into the state for the purpose of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">In the course of these instructions the court told the jury that it might disregard as surplusage the two words \u201cof prostitution\u201d as they appear at the beginning of the language quoted from the indictment. Appellant argues this amounted to a prohibited amendment of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">In context, it is obvious that the court\u2019s remark that the words \u201cof prostitution\u201d might be disregarded was intended to clarify the meaning of the charge, and avoid a misinterpretation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>could only have been adverse to the appellant. At most, \u201cThe action here complained of is merely a judicial holding that a useless averment is innocuous and may be ignored.\u201d Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 602, 47 S.Ct. 531, 534, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927). See also Salinger v. United States, 272 U.S. 542, 548-549, 47 S.Ct. 173, 71 L.Ed. 398 (1926); Vincent v. United States, 337 F.2d 891, 895 (8th Cir. 1964); and Overstreet v. United States, 321 F.2d 459, 461 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Appellant asks us to review certain instructions relating to the law of Nevada, and to the issue of entrapment<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There was no objection to these instructions in the trial court (Fed.R.Crim.P. 30), and on an examination of the entire record, we are satisfied that there was no plain error affecting substantial rights. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Appellant asked the government\u2019s principal witness to name the person who first put her in contact with government agents. She refused to answer on the ground that disclosure would expose an innocent \u201cpersonal friend\u201d to needless embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The government objected to the question on the grounds of relevancy; the objection was sustained by the trial court but with the express qualification that the ruling was without prejudice to counsel\u2019s right to pursue the line of inquiry upon a demonstration of the materiality of the information sought. Counsel for appellant abandoned the inquiry without any attempt to proceed along the lines suggested by the trial judge, or to otherwise advise the court of the question\u2019s purpose. The information sought was not \u201cinevitably and patently material.\u201d On such a record we find no error. Harris v. United States, 371 F.2d 365, 366 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> Appellant's contention that the evidence establishes entrapment as a matter of law cannot survive even a casual reading of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
