Pennsylvania School Reorganization Act, 24 P.S. \u00a7 2-290, et seq., and particularly \u00a7 3-303.1. The challenge was predicated on the alleged grounds that the selection violated the said statute and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">The jurisdiction of the district court was invoked under \u00a7 1343(3) of Title 28 U.S.C.A. The court below found that there was no \u201cconstitutional infirmity in the application of the\u201d Act but held that the federal question was not \u201cplainly wanting in substance.\u201d It retained jurisdiction of the action and after a trial on the merits entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the claim based on state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">The retention of jurisdiction of the claim based on state law may be sustained as proper only if the federal question was substantial. Levering &amp; G. Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103, 105, 53 S.Ct. 549, 77 L.Ed. 1062 (1933); Mosher v. City of Phoenix, 287 U.S. 29, 30, 53 S.Ct. 67, 77 L.Ed. 148 (1932). The question must be determined \u201cby the allegations of the [complaint], and not upon the facts as they may turn out or by a decision of the merits.\u201d Ibid. We are convinced from our examination of the complaint that the federal question was unsubstantial and frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">The action will be remanded to the district court with a direction that it be dismissed for the lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
