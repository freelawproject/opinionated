There was no proof that the trial Judge knew (in fact, the trial Judge stated affirmatively on the record that he did not know) that appellant lived in an apartment in a building next door to the Judge\u2019s residence, or that he had ever seen appellant before his appearance in the courtroom. The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"avx-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
