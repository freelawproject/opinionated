The board certified the union July 21, 1965, but the company has refused to recognize and bargain with it. These facts are undisputed. The only issue raised by the company\u2019s answer to the unfair labor practice complaint was, in essence, that the board should have declared the election invalid and should not have certified the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">After the election, the company had filed timely objections, stating that conditions created by the union \u201cmade impossible a sober, informed exercise by the employees of their right to vote in said election without coercion and restraint.\u201d The regional director conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ed an investigation, and made a report, recommending that the objections be overruled. The company filed exceptions, attacking the reasoning and conclusions of the regional director, but not asserting the existence of any particular evidence to refute the conclusions drawn. The board adopted the regional director\u2019s recommendations and certified the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">On September 28, 1965, the board issued a complaint, alleging refusal to bargain. The company answered, challenging the election and certification. The general counsel moved for \u201csummary judgment on the pleadings.\u201d The trial examiner ordered the company to show cause why the motion should not be granted, and to set forth a summary of any evidence, newly discovered or not available during the representation proceeding, which the company would proffer to attack the certification. The order stated that its purpose was to enable the examiner to determine whether there was any factual issue necessitating the taking of evidence. The company produced no summary of evidence, but replied that it had a statutory right to a hearing and that a motion for summary judgment cannot be granted in an unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The examiner concluded there were no matters requiring a hearing, granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and recommended an order which the board adopted, and is now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The position of the board is that the company\u2019s objections to the election have been adequately litigated and determined, albeit without a hearing, in the representation case. The examiner in the unfair labor practice proceeding afforded an opportunity for the company to produce newly-discovered or previously unavailable evidence, if material. The company apparently was unable to produce such evidence; at least it declined to furnish the invited summary. Thereupon the examiner granted the general counsel\u2019s motion. The validity of this procedure has been decided or assumed in at least two cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160, the statute governing the unfair labor practice proceeding, does require \u201ca notice of hearing\u201d and provides to the person complained of the right \u201cto appear in person or otherwise and give testimony,\u201d it cannot logically mean that an evidentiary hearing must be held in a case where there is no issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159 governs the representation proceeding and subs, (d) thereof provides that where there is a petition for enforcement or review of an order in an unfair labor practice proceeding, based upon facts certified after a representation proceeding, the record in the representation proceeding shall be included in the record filed in court. Thus review of the propriety of the certification is accomplished by a review of the record in the representation proceeding, the certification having, as here, been relied on as \u00e1 verity in the unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159 does not require a hearing in the representation proceeding upon objections filed after an election. The board\u2019s rules require a hearing on such objections only \u201cif it appears to the regional director that substantial and material factual issues exist which can be resolved only after a hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\"> The general standard for judicial review of a certification is whether the board abused its discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And where the challenge is based, as here, upon the fact that the objections were disposed of without hearing, the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>tion is whether the objecting party\u2019s exceptions to the report or findings of the regional director show that there were substantial and material issues of fact which could be resolved only after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">As stated by the ninth circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u25a0 \u201c \u2018These exceptions do not directly meet or mention any of the facts found by the Regional Director and raise no factual issues whatsoever. They do not suggest what new facts a hearing would develop or what if any evidence would be produced. They simply question the ultimate interpretation placed by the Director upon certain conduct. A hearing apparently would not deal with matters of factual proof but would serve only to permit argument which could as well have been presented in the writing itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201c \u2018Under these circumstances it was not abuse of discretion for the Board to proceed without hearing.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlN\">The exceptions filed by the company do not indicate any disagreement with the regional director\u2019s report of the events which underlay the company\u2019s objections. These events were: a misstatement of fact by the union, threatening conversations described by two employees, and a statement by the union that initiation fees would be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The regional director concluded that the misstatement did not have a real impact on the election, that the threatening conversations were not attributable to the union, and were isolated incidents, and that the waiver of the initiation fee was not a benefit conditioned upon the employees\u2019 vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In the exceptions the company argued with the regional director\u2019s reasoning and his legal conclusions. It did not suggest that it could produce evidence to establish that the misstatement had an impact upon the free choice of the employees, nor that the threatening conversations produced an atmosphere of fear and reprisal. Under the circumstances the board\u2019s failure to hold a hearing does not destroy the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">The question then is whether the board abused its discretion in declining to invalidate the election on the basis of the regional director\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">1. <em>The misstatement. </em>On February 3 or 4, the company issued a bulletin to all employees, urging a \u201cNo\u201d vote. \u201cFact No. 3\u201d was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">\u201cIn addition to each dollar paid you in wages, the company pays an additional $.21% in fringe benefits, which include: your retirement payroll, life insurance, hospital and surgical insurance, paid vacations, and paid holidays. Remember \u2014 this union is out after your dues <em>money </em>\u2014 this <em>is all they are interested in! </em>Don\u2019t be mislead by the phony promises which they have no power to deliver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">On February 9 the union\u2019s internation-' al representative distributed a leaflet, urging a \u201cYes\u201d vote. \u201cFact No. 3\u201d was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuOq\">\u201cTwenty-one and one-half cents ($.21%) per hour is very low for fringe benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">The regional director acknowledged that 21 %0 per dollar is substantially greater than 21%^ per hour, and that the union leaflet was circulated so late that the company could not effectively point out the error. But the regional director took into consideration all the circumstances, including the fact that the statement concerned benefits the employees were receiving, that they had access to more reliable information about the figure, and that \u201cthe gravamen of [the union\u2019s] statement was not to charge that the 21% 0 per dollar was not true, but that 21% 0 per hour is \u2018very low.\u2019 \u201d The conclusion of lack of impact may be debatable, but cannot be said to be so unreasonable as to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>2. <em>The threatening telephone conversations. </em>A female employee said she received three phone calls at her home in the evening from a man who refused to identify himself. The man indicated she would be well advised to support the union side, and that if she didn\u2019t she would be looking for another job before too long. The recipient of the calls did not tell any other employees of them. As pointed out by the regional director, there is no evidence that these calls were attributable to the union. 134 employees cast ballots. We do not deem it an abuse of discretion to consider that this series of conversations, plus the threatening conversation next considered, were insufficient, if they occurred, to create an atmosphere of fear and reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">3. <em>The conversation about dynamiting. </em>Another female employee told of a conversation with a male employee who was active in soliciting authorization cards, was, with others, in frequent contact with the union representative, but was not a member of a formal union committee. According to the lady, the man approached her a few weeks before the election and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cYou know we\u2019re going to vote for the Union in a few days. If you don\u2019t vote for it the same thing could happen to you like those NFO dynamiting. You know what they did to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">She replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have said a worse thing to me. If you had really wanted me to vote for the Union, you wouldn\u2019t have talked to me like that. Just shut up and get over to the run you\u2019re working on or I\u2019ll call- \u2014 the foreman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The regional director deemed it unnecessary to determine, by hearing, whether this conversation occurred because there was no basis for an inference that the union either authorized the conduct or ratified it. The company argues upon general principles of agency that since the man was soliciting on behalf of the union, with its knowledge, the union is responsible for what the man said in connection with such solicitation. It does not appear that anyone connected with the union knew of this type of threat, nor is any course of conduct or circumstances shown from which knowledge or approval could be inferred. There is nothing to show that the conversation was overheard by other employees, nor repeated to other employees by the lady involved. In the light of the circumstances, the conclusion that the employees\u2019 freedom of choice had not been impaired by these incidents is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">4. <em>Waiver of initiation fees. </em>\u201cFact No. 2\u201d of the company\u2019s bulletin was as fallows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">\u201cYour company has paid your wages and fringe benefits without any union, <em>without any strikes, </em>and without paying to the union one per cent of <em>your pay </em>to the International Union, plus monthly Local Union dues, and your initiation fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">\u201cFact No. 2\u201d of the union\u2019s response was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-14\">\u201cThe union dues are one per cent (1%) of your wages. The <em>initiation fee </em>is waved because all employees working at Haeger Pottery when the contract is signed will be charter members. <em>No initiation fee for charter members.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">\u201cIf you received ten cents ($ .10) per hour increase with a Union you would get ($4.00) per week increase based on forty hours per week. If you made one hundred dollars ($100.00) a week your Union dues would be one dollar ($1.00) per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-16\">\u201c$4.00- \u2014 -increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-17\">\u20141.00-\u2014-Union dues</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-18\">$3.00 \u2014 Gain per week\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">The regional director found no evidence of any statement that the promised waiver was limited to those who signed authorization cards or voted for the union. Since the waiver would be available to each employee no matter how he voted, the regional director concluded that there was no offer of a <em>quid pro quo </em>for a vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The company points out that the waiver was conditioned so as to apply \u201cwhen the contract is signed\u201d and thus conditioned upon the union\u2019s winning the election. But we agree with the board that the important consideration is that the promise was not conditioned on the vote or support of the individual employee. If the union won and a \u201ccontract is signed,\u201d the employee who voted against the union would have the same benefit (i. e., waiver of fee) as the employee who voted for the union. Any persuasive effect the promise of waiver may have on an individual employee in these circumstances is no different in kind from a statement of the amount of the dues or other representations of the advantages and burdens of membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The board has held that waiver of initiation fees by a union during a pre-election campaign interferes with the conduct of the election when the waiver is promised as the <em>quid pro quo </em>for the employees\u2019 votes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the nondiscriminatory waiving of fees during the organizational period, \u201cdoes not smack of coercion but rather of promotional persuasion.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In finding no impropriety in an exemption of all who join before a contract is signed, the second circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201c* * * This statement gave adequate notice to all employees, whether they approved or disapproved of the union, that they had nothing to lose by waiting for the union to achieve recognition before applying for membership.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The first circuit has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cWe are compelled to conclude that the waiver of initiation fees predicated upon joining before the election is a substantial organizational inducement. On the other hand, we fully agree with the Board that a pre-election promise permitting all present employees, whether they vote for the union or not, to join without payment of an initiation fee up to and within a reasonable time immediately after the election would not be an inducement. Gilmore Indus., Inc., 1962, 140 N.L.R.B. 100.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acz6\">The regional director and the board correctly concluded that the promise of waiver of initiation fees did not invalidate the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">None of the first three points raised by the company, taken individually, compels the conclusion that the board abused its discretion. Neither do we find such abuse, considering them collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">The petition to set aside the board\u2019s order is denied and the board\u2019s petition for enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">.
