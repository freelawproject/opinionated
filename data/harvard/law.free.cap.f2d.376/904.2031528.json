Opposer is the prior user and owner of registrations of \u201chandinap\u201d and \u201cHANDINAPS,\u201d Reg. Nos. 616,224 and 616,225 of Nov. 15, 1955, for paper napkins. Applicant\u2019s earliest claimed date of use is July 5, 1962. The goods being in part the same, we proceed on the basis that there is no difference in the goods. The decision is therefore determined primarily by the differences and similarities in the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Both parties produced trade witnesses who testified, for the opposer, that confusion would in their opinion be likely, and, for the applicant, that confusion would not be likely. We agree with the board that this testimony is conflicting and subsequently equally balanced and therefore of no net probative force.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">It is not necessary to discuss the marks beyond noting the facts that they have the syllable \u201cnaps\u201d in common, which is obviously derived from the word \u201cnapkins,\u201d and that the remainder is \u201cE-Z\u201d in the case of applicant and \u201cHANDI\u201d in the case of opposer. It becomes a matter of subjective opinion whether, considering sound, appearance and meaning of the marks as a whole and probable manner of use by vendors, distributors, users, and purchasers, concurrent use on the same goods is likely to result in confusion, mistake or deception. The board did not think so and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">While, as we have often noted, prior decisions are not of much value in cases of this kind, we note appellant\u2019s reliance on our opinion in Magnavox Co. v. Multi-vox Corp. of America, 341 F.2d 139, 52 CCPA 1025 (1965). Several other decisions are cited but this one is stressed. A more pertinent case, in our view, is E. L. Bruce Co. v. American Termicide Co., 285 F.2d 462, 48 CCPA 762 (1960), where we held that concurrent use of \u201cTERMICIDE\u201d and \u201cTERMINIX\u201d for insect exterminating services and insecticides, respectively, particularly in the termite control field, would not be reasonably likely to cause confusion. The parallel between the syllable \u201ctermi\u201d in the termite control field and the syllable \u201cnap\u201d in the napkin field should be self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">We have considered opposer\u2019s contentions with respect to its alleged possession of a family of \u201cnap\u201d marks but, like the board, we do not find that the record supports the existence of a publicly-recognized family of such marks linked with appellant-opposer as a source. Opposer has not relied on any registrations other than the two mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
