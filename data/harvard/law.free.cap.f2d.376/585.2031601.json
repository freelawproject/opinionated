Issue was joined and discovery is proceeding under a schedule approved by the district court in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">On December 9, 1966, a ceiling in a Linden classroom collapsed while school was in session, but with no injury to anyone. The school was thereafter closed before the regular Christmas recess. On December 22, 1966, plaintiffs filed a motion, under the basic suit, with a supporting affidavit, for a preliminary injunction to prevent opening of the school after the Christmas recess on the grounds that it was \u201cboth unsafe and completely inadequate as a school structure.\u201d The court ordered a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the motion and heard evidence on December 30 and 31, 1966, which included expert testimony by both parties, directed to the question of safety of the school for continued use, and heard arguments of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The court rendered an exhaustive oral opinion which concluded \u201cthat the Linden School building is safe for the proposed continued occupancy.\u201d Formal findings of specific fact, the ultimate findings pursuant to Rule 52(a), and conclusions of law, and judgment anticipated in the oral opinion, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The appeal before us is taken from that judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (1), and our review is limited to determining whether the district court\u2019s ruling was an abuse of discretion. Graham v. Triangle Publishing Inc., 344 F.2d 775, 776 (3d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We have studied the briefs, heard oral arguments and conferred upon the records and issue. Plaintiffs have not shown in this court that the findings of the district court underlying the denial of the preliminary injunction are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d This we think is the only question before us, since if the judgment is based on findings having substantial evidentiary support, there is no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The specific findings, with a substantial basis in the evidence, support the ultimate findings that the Linden School is both structurally and otherwise sound and safe and does not constitute a safety or health hazard, that no overcrowding condition exists, and that the school is \u201csafe and suitable for continued occupancy by its regularly enrolled students.\u201d The ultimate finding supports the conclusion that no constitutional rights of plaintiffs were denied by reason of the issue raised by the motion for preliminary injunction. The judgment denying the preliminary injunction is justified upon the findings and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
