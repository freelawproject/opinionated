Construction Co., Inc., whereby H. &amp; J. Construction agreed to build a Ramada Inn in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After construction, an adjacent property owner brought suit against Allied Ho-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>t\u00e9ls and H. &amp; J. Construction in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, alleging damages to her property caused by defendants\u2019 negligence in diverting water thereon. At the trial H. &amp; J. Construction successfully interposed a demurrer to the evidence, but a verdict was returned as against Allied Hotels. The judgment entered thereon was affirmed in Allied Hotels, Ltd. v. Barden, Okl., 389 P.2d 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u25a0 Thereafter, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, Allied Hotels brought this action against H. &amp; J. Construction and its surety, claiming a contractual right to indemnity for the judgment obtained against it in the state court action. The matter was tried to the court, and from an adverse judgment Allied Hotels appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"> The conditions in the construction contract upon which Allied Hotels bases its claim for indemnity provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cSec. B(3). The contractor shall protect all existing work on adjoining property that is to remain in place, and shall replace or repair any damage occurring to the existing property due to the construction of this project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">Sec. C(l) (A). Provide protection to adjoining property including walks, roads, trees, and shrubs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">Article 12 of the American Institute of Architects general conditions provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cProtection of Work and Property. The contractor shall continuously maintain adequate protection of all his work from damage and shall protect the Owner\u2019s property from injury or loss arising in connection with the Contract. He shall make good any such damage, injury or loss, except \u00e1uch as may be directly due to errors in the Contract Documents or caused by agents or employees of the Owner, or due to causes beyond the Contractor\u2019s control and not to his fault or negligence. He shall adequately protect adjacent property as provided by law and the Contract Documents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">It is well established that courts may not read into an indemnity contract that which does not actually appear in it or which is not warranted by a reasonable interpretation thereof. \u201cThe language employed must clearly and definitely show an intention to indemnify against the loss or liability involved.\u201d Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of N. Y. v. J. A. Jones Constr. Co., 8 Cir., 325 F.2d 605, 607. See also, Sinclair Prairie Oil Co. v. Thorn-ley, 10 Cir., 127 F.2d 128. We are satisfied that no such an intention is manifest here.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Furthermore, it is apparent that the state court\u2019s judgment was based upon Allied Hotels\u2019 own wrong. There is disclosed no negligence or improper performance of the contract on the part of H. &amp; J. Construction. The record indicates that H. &amp; J. Construction completed the contract in exact compliance with the detailed plans and specifications prepared by Allied Hotels, and under the supervision of Allied Hotels\u2019 architects and engineers. In Woods v. Amulco Products, 205 Okl. 34, 235 P.2d 273, 274, the Oklahoma Supreme Court stated the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">\u201c1. A construction contractor who has followed plans and specifications furnished by the owner, his architect or engineer, and which have proved to be defective or insufficient, will not be responsible to the owner for loss or damage which results solely from the defective or insufficient plans or specifications, in the absence of any negligence on the contractor\u2019s part, or of any express warranty by him as to such plans and specifications being sufficient or free from defects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">See also, 13 Am.Jur.2d, Building, Etc. Contracts \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Allied Hotels argues that it was only constructively or vicariously liable for the damage to the adjacent landowner and that it has the right of indemnity because the damages resulted from H. &amp; J. Construction\u2019s primary or active negligence. But, as stated by the trial court, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that the injuries were caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the wrongful and unlawful acts of Allied Hotels, and Allied Hotels is concluded by that judgment. Buell v. Hall, 169 Okl. 394, 37 P.2d 308, 101 A.L.R. 100; Kansas City Operating Corp. v. Durwood, 8 Cir., 278 F.2d 354; Shell Oil Co. v. FosterWheeler Corp., E.D.Ill., 209 F.Supp. 931, aff\u2019d 320 F.2d 591; Anno. 24 A.L.R.2d 329; 42 C.J.S. Indemnity \u00a7 32(b). We agree with the trial court that under the provisions of the construction contract Allied Hotels cannot recover from H. &amp; J. Construction the amount that it was required to pay in satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
