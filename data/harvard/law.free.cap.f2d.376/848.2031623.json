Demko, 385 U.S. 149, 87 S.Ct. 382, 17 L.Ed.2d 258. It is clear that the <em>Demko </em>ease rules this one, in that the appellee was a prisoner whose injuries were incurred in the course of a work activity connected with the maintenance or operation of Maxwell Air Force Base, an institution within which appellee was confined as a civilian prisoner. In such circumstances, the compensation provisions of 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 4126 were exclusive as to the benefits provided for the appellee in such a situation. The trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain a Tort Claims Act complaint under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with directions that the complaint be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
