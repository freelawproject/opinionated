Johnson, 354 F.2d 689 (C.A.6, 1966)], the District Judge conducted a plenary hearing on petitioner\u2019s factual contentions. At the conclusion of that hearing, he found from the evidence that petitioner\u2019s claim that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to counsel was not supported by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-21\">Our review of this record convinces us that the evidence amply supports his findings and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
