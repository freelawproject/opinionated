His sole contention on appeal is that the trial judge failed to charge the jury that it might \u201ceither infer or not infer\u201d from a finding of possession that the heroin was imported and that the defendant knew that to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-18\">As in United States v. Aiken, 373 F.2d 294 (2 Cir. 1967), the trial below took place following our decision in United States v. Davis, 328 F.2d 864 (2 Cir. 1964), where we suggested that the trial judge could do well to rely upon \u201cthe clear language of the statute,\u201d id. at 866, but prior to our decision in United States v. Armone, 363 F.2d 385 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 957, 87 S.Ct. 398, 17 L. Ed.2d 303 (1966), where we recommended following the \u201cbetter practice\u201d suggested in United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63, 71 n. 7, 85 S.Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965). United States v. Armone, supra, 363 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-19\">In his charge the trial judge merely stated that the government relied upon the \u201cpresumption\u201d of Section 174 and he then read the language of the statute, adding a brief explanation which emphasized the need to find possession before the \u201cinference\u201d can arise. The trial judge ought to have made it clear that the inference of illegal importation and the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>were illegally imported was permissible and that the jury could draw the inference or not, as it chose. However, the defendant\u2019s counsel made no objection to the charge and illegal importation and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of such importation were not contested issues at trial. We do not believe that the charge constituted plain error which we are required to notice under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52 (b). United States v. Aiken, supra, 373 F.2d at 298-299.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
