Without authorization, he remained in the United States well beyond that period, residing in Arizona. In April 2013, Banaga-AIcaraz was stopped in Texas for speeding and driving without a license, taken into custody, and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which initiated removal proceedings shortly thereafter. Banaga-AIcaraz conceded that he was removable but sought cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (governing nonpermanent residents). An Immigration Judge (IJ) found that, though he met all other requirements for cancellation of removal, Ba-naga-AIcaraz had not shown that his U.S. citizen father and legal permanent resident mother, both living in Arizona, would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if he were removed, as required by \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Accordingly, in September 2013, the IJ denied Banaga-Alear-az\u2019s application and ordered removal. The IJ also denied voluntary departure, noting that Banaga-AIcaraz had not requested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-21\">Banaga-AIcaraz appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), arguing that the IJ abused its discretion in denying a continuance that would have allowed his parents to testify at the removal hearing, and that the IJ further erred in determining that the hardship requirement had not been satisfied. The BIA dismissed Bana-ga-Alcaraz\u2019s appeal in August 2014. Ba-naga-AIcaraz petitioned this court to review the merits of that dismissal, and we summarily denied the petition. <em>Banagar-Alcaraz v. Holder, </em>No. 14-60626 (5th Cir. Apr.24, 2015). While that petition was pending before our court, Banaga-AIcaraz several times asked the BIA to reopen or reconsider its decision, arguing that his counsel at the removal hearing had been ineffective. The BIA issued a series of orders in November 2014, December 2014, March 2015, and June 2015, each declining to revisit its dismissal of Banaga-Alearaz\u2019s appeal or reconsider its previous orders. Banaga-AIcaraz now petitions this court to review the BIA\u2019s June 2015 order denying reconsideration of its March 2015 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Banaga-Alcaraz challenges the fact that the BIA\u2019s March 2015 order incorporated reasoning from its November 2014 and December 2014 orders. Because Banaga-Alcaraz did not argue this point before the BIA in his motion for reconsideration, it is unexhausted and we have no jurisdiction to consider it. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see Oman v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319-21 (5th Cir.2009). We therefore DISMISS in part the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Banaga-Alcaraz also raises several arguments centering on the BIA\u2019s treatment of his claim that his counsel at the removal hearing was ineffective for failing to request voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c. Even assuming that aliens have a due process right to counsel in connection with seeking voluntary departure, Ba-naga-Alcaraz\u2019s ineffective-assistance argument can succeed only if he was prejudiced by any deficient performance. <em>De Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 884 (5th Cir. 2004). To establish prejudice, Banaga-Al-caraz must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of eligibility for voluntary departure. <em>See Anwar v. I.N.S., </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). As the BIA found, Banaga-Alcaraz did not \u201cestablish!)] by clear and convincing evidence that [he] has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\u201d \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(D). Accordingly, he cannot establish prejudice and his arguments rooted in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We DENY Banaga-Alcaraz\u2019s motion to transfer the petition for review to mediation. Because summary disposition \u201cis generally reserved for cases in which the parties concede that the issues are foreclosed by circuit precedent,\u201d <em>United States v. Oduu, </em>564 Fed.Appx. 127, 129 (5th Cir. 2014), we DENY the government\u2019s motion for summary disposition. However, because Banaga-Alcaraz\u2019s initial brief, the government\u2019s motion, and Banaga-Alcar-az\u2019s response adequately address the parties\u2019 positions, <em>see id. </em>at 129-30, we DISPENSE with further briefing and DENY Banaga-Alcaraz\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
