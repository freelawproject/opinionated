The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the decisions of the immigration judge to reopen Chen\u2019s removal proceeding and terminate his status as an asylee for knowingly making a frivolous application, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4), (d)(6), and to deny Chen\u2019s motion to terminate his removal proceeding. Chen argues that the immigration judge \u201cignored the requirement that the Department must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that [he] knowingly filed\u201d a frivolous application; that the immigration judge should have terminated the removal proceeding; and that he is entitled to withholding of removal. We deny in part and dismiss in- part Chen\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-20\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the statutory interpretation finding by the Board that [an alien has] filed a frivolous asylum application under Section 1158(d)(6).\u201d <em>Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2001). The regulations provide a process for an immigration judge to follow in determining whether an application is frivolous. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.20. That framework is designed to safeguard procedural rights, which includes ensuring that the immigration judge \u201cplac[es] the ultimate burden of proof on the Government,\u201d <em>Matter of Y-L-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 151, 158 (BIA 2007), to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was \u201cfraud in the alien\u2019s application such that [he] was not eligible for asylum at the time it was granted,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.24(a)(1), (f). If the immigration judge complies with the safeguards and finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application after being advised of the consequences of such wrongdoing, the alien is permanently ineligible to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The Board did not err in determining that the immigration judge \u201cplaced the burden\u201d of proof on the Department and that it \u201cmet its burden\u201d to prove that Chen\u2019s application was frivolous. At the commencement of the hearing to terminate, the Department submitted a forensic report establishing that Chen\u2019s card was counterfeit; a transcript of Chen\u2019s interview in April 2002 during which he signed an oath acknowledging that he would be \u201cpermanently ineligible\u201d for benefits if he filed a \u201cfrivolous application for asylum\u201d; and a copy of the application that Chen filed in September 2002. The report stated that Chen\u2019s identity card had been created using a different \u201cproduction method\u201d and that it lacked the \u201csecurity features\u201d and \u201cfine details\u201d of cards issued by the Chinese government. And the Department rebutted Chen\u2019s testimony that he did not think the card was forged because he obtained it from the Shouquan police station. As the Board stated, the Department \u201c[brought] forward evidence regarding [Chen\u2019s] knowledge and intentions\u201d through' establishing that he had supported his application with another document of dubious authenticity. The forensic report stated that a subpoena, supposedly issued by the Chinese police to require Chen to appear for questioning \u201cfor his illegal congregation and illegal preach [sic] gospel,\u201d was \u201csuspect\u201d because it was printed using \u201ctoner technology,\u201d which was \u201cinconsistent with the production of high volume forms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Board also did not err in affirming the denial of Chen\u2019s motion to terminate his removal proceeding. The immigration judge was entitled to reopen Chen\u2019s removal proceeding to determine if there was fraud in his application that warranted terminating his asylum status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.24(a)(1), <em>(\u00a3). Chen </em>argues that he was entitled to terminate the removal process and to adjust his status based on the asylum granted to his wife, but Chen\u2019s filing of a frivolous asylum application made him \u201cpermanently ineligible\u201d to benefit from his spouse\u2019s change in status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Chen\u2019s argument that he is entitled to withholding of removal. \u201c[A] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to [him] as of right.\u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). Chen argues that he provided a credible account of past persecution based on his religious beliefs, but Chen failed to present this argument to the Board. \u201c[A]bsent a cognizable excuse or exception,\u201d we \u201clack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review [when] the petitioner has [failed to] exhaust[ ] his administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We dismiss this part of Chen\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
