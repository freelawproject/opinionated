We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">In 2009, Zierke was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1). He was sentenced to 360 months in prison. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Zierke, </em>618 F.3d 755, 758 (8th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Since then, Zierke has filed numerous unsuccessful collateral challenges in the sentencing court and the Eighth Circuit, including at least four motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 and two under \u00a7 2255. In 2012, he filed a habeas petition pursuant, to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Middle District of Pennsylvania challenging his conviction and sentence. The District Court dismissed the petition without prejudice, noting that a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the sentencing court would be the appropriate vehicle for Zierke\u2019s claims and that he should seek leave from the appropriate court for such a filing. <em>See </em>Mem., <em>Zierke v. Ebert, </em>No. 3:12-cv-01394 (M.D.Pa. Dec. 13, 2012), ECF No. 11. In 2015, Zierke filed another habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 in the District Court, raising, claims that challenged his 2009 conviction in Nebraska. The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Zierke\u2019s claims could be raised only, if at all, in a \u00a7 2255 motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). We agree with the District Court that Zierke\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was not viable. He challenged the validity of his conviction, and \u201c[mjotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Although a petitioner may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 if a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. This exception applies only in rare circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">In <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251-52 (3d Cir.1997), we recognized that the exception could apply where an intervening change in the law decriminalized the conduct for which the petitioner had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>convicted, but Zierke cannot avail himself of this exception. The conduct underlying his conviction is still a crime, and he does not argue otherwise. Nor does he cite anything else that might be considered an extraordinary circumstance justifying the use of \u00a7 2241. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Instead, in his notice of appeal, he appears to argue that he should be permitted to proceed under \u00a7 2241 simply because he cannot satisfy the standards for presenting his claims in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. As we have made clear, however, a petitioner may not use \u00a7 2241 to evade the stringent gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b99-13\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
