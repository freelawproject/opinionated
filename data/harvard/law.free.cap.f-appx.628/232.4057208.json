HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n\n<p id=\"b262-6\">I.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b262-8\">In October 2007, Campbell borrowed roughly half a million dollars to buy a house in Houston. To receive the loan, Campbell signed two documents in favor of his lender, Bravo Credit: (1) a note, which set out the terms of the loan, and (2) a deed- of trust, which secured the loan with a lien on Campbell\u2019s newly purchased house. Campbell\u2019s wife, Julia Browder, also signed the deed of trust. The deed of trust listed another company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d), as \u201cnominee\u201d for Bravo and Bravo\u2019s \u201cassigns\u201d and as \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the deed of trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b263-5\">II.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b263-7\">III.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b262-5\">George Campbell lost ownership of his home to a mortgage company, DLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc., through non-judicial foreclosure in Texas state court. He thereafter sued DLJ, also in state court, seeking to avoid eviction and to invalidate both the foreclosure and the deeds transferring ownership to the property. DLJ removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss Campbell\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the motion. We affirm.</p><p id=\"b262-7\">We take the allegations in Campbell\u2019s complaint as true. <em>See Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, </em>594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2010). We also consider the documents that Campbell attached to his complaint, and the -documents that DLJ attached to its motion to dismiss that were both central to and mentioned by the complaint. <em>See id. </em>These documents include four contracts: a promissory note, a deed of trust, a contract assigning the deed of trust, and a foreclosure sale deed. To the extent that the contracts conflict with Campbell\u2019s allegations, the contracts control. <em>See Bosarge v. Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, </em>796 F.3d 435, 440-41 (5th Cir.2015).</p><p id=\"b262-11\">Sometime thereafter, Campbell fell ill with cancer. Seeking \u201cto reduce his payments during his illness,\u201d Campbell called his \u201c[ljender\u201d \u2014 the complaint does not specify just who \u2014 to ask for a loan modification or \u201csome type of arrangement.\u201d The \u201crepresentatives\u201d with whom he spoke told him \u201cto just stop making payments.\u201d Campbell took this instruction as \u201ca promise to allow [him] to stop making payments during his illness\u201d and stopped paying the note.</p><p id=\"b262-12\">In late June 2012, MERS, \u201cas nominee for Bravo [and] ... its assigns,\u201d assigned the deed of trust to DLJ, which recorded the notarized assignment the following week. DLJ thereafter applied in Texas state court for an expedited home-equity foreclosure order, which the state court issued in May 2013. A foreclosure sale followed in September 2013; DLJ bought the house at the sale. Nine months later, in June 2014, Campbell still hadn\u2019t moved out. Consequently, DLJ secured an eviction order, which a Harris County deputy constable served on June 27, 2014.</p><p id=\"b262-13\">Campbell then sued DLJ, MERS, and Bravo in state court, asserting ten state law claims and asking the court to enjoin the eviction and declare DLJ\u2019s interest in the property invalid. DLJ removed the case to federal court on the ground of diversity and filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>court thereafter entered final judgment dismissing the case\u2014with prejudice as to DLJ and without as to MERS and Bravo, whom Campbell had never served. This appeal followed.</p><p id=\"b263-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss. <em>Frame v. City of Arlington, </em>657 F.3d 215, 222 (5th Cir.2011) (en banc). Dismissal is proper if a complaint does not contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). We can affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>Taylor v. City of Shreveport, </em>798 F.3d 276, 279 (5th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).</p><p id=\"b263-8\">Campbell challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of eight of his claims. First, he argues that the district court should not have dismissed his claim for \u201ctrespass to try title.\u201d The claim is based on his contention that \u201cMERS lack[ed] the power\u201d to assign the deed of trust to DLJ and that, as a result, DLJ lacked the power to foreclose. But Texas law\u2014which the parties agree applies here\u2014recognizes assignments of deeds of trust by MERS, and, moreover, explicitly \u201cpermits MERS and its assigns to bring foreclosure actions under the Texas Property Code.\u201d <em>Farkas v. GMAC Mortgage, L.L.C., </em>737 F.3d 338, 342 (5th Cir.2013); <em>see generally Harris Cty. Texas v. MERSCORP Inc., </em>791 F.3d 545, 549-50 (5th Cir.2015) (explaining MERS\u2019s role in the mortgage industry). So this contention fails. Moreover, the only allegation in Campbell\u2019s complaint that supports this claim is his assertion that \u201cMERS is not listed nor defined as the Lender nor its nominee\u201d in the deed of trust. But the deed of trust shows the opposite: it provides that MERS will \u201cact[ ] ... as a nominee\u201d for Bravo and Bravo\u2019s \u201cassigns\u201d and names \u201cMERS ... as nominee\u201d and MERS\u2019s \u201csuccessors and assigns\u201d as \u201cbeneficiary.\u201d Thus, both Texas law and the express terms of the deed of trust permitted MERS to assign the deed of trust to DLJ. Hence the district court properly dismissed this claim.</p><p id=\"b263-10\">Second, Campbell argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for statutory fraud under the Texas Business and Commercial Code. To state a claim for statutory fraud, a plaintiff must allege, among other things, that the defendant made a \u201cfalse representation\u201d or a \u201cfalse promise\u201d with the purpose of \u201cinducing [a] person to enter into a contract.\u201d Tex. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Com.Code \u00a7 27.01. Here, Campbell\u2019s statutory fraud claim is based on his allegation that an unidentified \u201crepresentative[ ]\u201d of his \u201c[ljender\u201d instructed him \u201cto just stop making payments.\u201d He nowhere alleges that this instruction was made with the purpose of inducing him to enter a contract. So the district court correctly dismissed the claim.</p><p id=\"b263-11\">Third,: Campbell argues that the district court erred in dismissing his common law fraud claim. To plead fraud, a plaintiff must \u201cstate with particularity\u201d the circumstances of the fraud. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). We have held that, to satisfy this standard, a plaintiff must, at a minimum, set forth the \u201ctime, placet,] and contents of the false representation,\u201d \u201cthe identity of the person making the misrepresentation,\u201d and what the person making the misrepresentation gained by making it. <em>U.S. ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, </em>565 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). Here, Campbell contends that DLJ committed fraud by falsely representing that it \u201chad proper standing to foreclose when [it] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>clearly did not.\u201d Thus, Campbell\u2019s fraud claim is merely derivative of his meritless claim that DLJ lacked standing to foreclose. Hence the district court correctly dismissed the claim.</p><p id=\"b264-4\">Fourth, Campbell argues that the district court erred in dismissing his negligent misrepresentation claim. To support a claim for negligent misrepresentation under Texas law, \u201cthe misrepresentation ... must be one of existing fact.\u201d <em>BCY Water Supply Corp. v. Residential Inv., Inc,, </em>170 S.W.3d 596, 603 (Tex.App.2005). Thus, \u201ca promise to do or refrain from doing an act in the future\u201d will not support an action for negligent misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>Here, Campbell alleges that a \u201crepresentative[ ]\u201d \u2014 he does not specify who \u2014 told him that he could \u201cjust stop making payments.\u201d He characterizes this statement as \u201ca promise to allow [him] to stop making payments during his illness.\u201d He alleges no other misrepresentation beside this \u201cpromise.\u201d A promise about the future is not a statement of existing fact. <em>See Guajardo v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A, </em>605 Fed.Appx. 240, 245 (5th Cir. 2015). So the district court properly dismissed this claim as well.</p><p id=\"b264-5\">Fifth, Campbell argues that the district court erred in dismissing his promissory estoppel claim. To state a claim for promissory estoppel under Texas law, a plaintiff must allege, among other things, that his reliance on the promise was \u201creasonable and justified.\u201d <em>Gilmartin v. KVTV-Channel 13, </em>985 S.W.2d 553, 558 (Tex.App.1998). Reliance is justified only when the promise is \u201cdefinite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In contrast, reliance on \u201conly vague assurances\u201d is unjustified. <em>Id. </em>Here, Campbell\u2019s promissory estoppel claim is based on the alleged \u201cpromise to allow [him] to stop making payments during his illness.\u201d But Campbell\u2019s complaint fails to make clear who made him the promise, much less what he was promised would happen (or not happen) if he stopped paying his mortgage. Thus, he has not alleged that he was promised anything \u201cdefinite.\u201d Hence the district court properly dismissed the claim.</p><p id=\"b264-7\">Sixth, Campbell argues that the district court erred in dismissing his breach-of-contract claim. But his complaint merely lists the elements of the claim, without alleging any facts to support it. \u00d3n appeal, he contends that, assuming that he \u201chad a valid contract with ... DLJ,\u201d then DLJ breached it by \u201cmov[ing] to wrongfully foreclose.\u201d That means Campbell\u2019s breach-of-contract claim, like his fraud claim, simply relabels and restates his meritless claim that DLJ lacked standing to foreclose. So the district court correctly dismissed the claim.</p><p id=\"b264-8\">Seventh, Campbell argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for tortious interference with an existing contract. Under Texas law, to state a claim for tortious interference with a contract, a plaintiff must allege, among other things, that the defendant \u201cwillfull[y] and intentionally]\u201d interfered with an existing contract to which the plaintiff was a party. <em>Holloway v. Skinner, </em>898 S.W.2d 793, 795 (Tex.1995). In his complaint, Campbell alleged that DLJ interfered with his contract with Bravo by \u201cforclosfing] ... without ... standing to do so.\u201d But he abandons that theory \u2014 which would fail anyway, for the reasons shown above \u2014 on appeal. He now contends that DLJ interfered with his contract with Bravo by \u201cfailing to record the appropriate filings.\u201d But he does not specify which filings DLJ supposedly failed to record, much less how such a failure could have interfered\u2014 intentionally or willfully or otherwise\u2014 with any of his contracts. Hence the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>trict court properly dismissed this claim as well.</p><p id=\"b265-5\">Finally, Campbell argues that the district court should not have dismissed his claim under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.41 <em>et seq. </em>To sue under the Act, a plaintiff must establish that he is a \u201cconsumer\u201d as defined by the Act. <em>See Miller v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., </em>726 F.3d 717, 724 (5th Cir.2013) (citation omitted). To qualify as a consumer, a person must \u201cseek[ ] or acquire[ ]\u201d \u201cgoods or services\u201d \u201cby lease or purchase.\u201d Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 17.45(4). \u201cGoods\u201d include real property. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 17.45(1). In addition, the goods or services must form the basis of the person\u2019s complaint. <em>See Miller, </em>726 F.3d at 725; <em>Melody Home Mfg. Co. v. Barnes, </em>741 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex.1987). As a general rule, \u201ca pure loan transaction lies outside the [Act] because money is considered to be neither a good nor a service.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>726 F.3d at 725 (citation omitted). Here, Campbell contends that DLJ violated the Act by \u201cmaking ... misrepresentations\u201d about a \u201cpossible refinance.\u201d We have previously held that an attempted loan modification or refinancing \u201cis not sought for the acquisition of a good or service,\u201d but is, rather, a \u201cpure loan transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That means that Campbell does not qualify as a consumer and cannot bring a claim under the Act. Hence the district court correctly dismissed the claim.</p><p id=\"b265-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
