We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise le-nary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>679 F.3d 116, 120 (3d Cir.2012). For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.AR. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">In February 2015, Abdullah filed a complaint in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, which Wells Fargo and Bank of America (\u201cthe defendants\u201d) removed to the District Court. In the complaint, Abdullah alleged that the defendants violated his rights under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act when they refused to grant him a small-business loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-22\">This was Abdullah\u2019s fourth complaint concerning the defendants\u2019 refusal to extend a loan to him. He filed the first complaint in January 2013; the District Court dismissed that complaint due to its failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>E.D. Pa. Civ. A. No. 13-cv-0305. Abdullah appealed, and we summarily affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Abdullah v. Small Bus. Banking Dep\u2019t of Bank of Am., </em>532 Fed.Appx. 89 (3d Cir.2013) (non-prece-dential). Abdullah filed two more complaints in the District Court, which outlined his continuing unavailing efforts to obtain a loan. <em>See </em>E.D. Pa. Civ. A. Nos. 14-cv-5394 &amp; 14-cv-5931. The District Court dismissed both complaints for failure to state a claim. Abdullah appealed the judgment in only the latter case, but the Clerk ultimately dismissed the appeal because Abdullah failed to pay the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-23\">After the defendants removed the complaint at issue here to the District Court, Abdullah filed a motion to remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>matter to state court. He claimed that the removal had been untimely and that he did not assert a federal claim. The defendants opposed Abdullah\u2019s remand motion and also filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Abdullah did not respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and the District Court granted the motion to dismiss pursuant to E.D. Pa. Local Rule 7.1(c), which states that \u201c[i]n the absence of timely response, [a] motion may be granted as uncontested.\u201d Abdullah filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. The District Court here dismissed Abdullah\u2019s complaint due to his failure to comply with a local rule requiring parties to file briefs registering their opposition to any motion. We have previously concluded that, as a general matter, a complaint should not be \u201cdismissed solely on the basis of the local rule without any analysis of whether the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, as provided in Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Stackhouse v. Mazurkiewicz, </em>951 F.2d 29, 30 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Even if the District Court erred in dismissing the complaint on this basis, however, we may affirm on any ground apparent in the record. <em>See id., see also Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 122 n. 1 (3d Cir.2001). Here, as the defendants argued in their motion to dismiss, Abdullah\u2019s complaint is plainly barred by principles of claim preclusion. The doctrine of claim preclusion bars a suit where there has been \u201c(1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Lubrizol Corp. v. Exxon Corp., </em>929 F.2d 960, 963 (3d Cir.1991). Those factors are satisfied here, where the District Court has previously dismissed the same allegations against the same defendants for failure to state a claim. <em>See Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 399 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981); <em>Cieszkowska v. Gray Line N.Y., </em>295 F.3d 204, 205-06 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam). While Abdullah now asserts a new legal theory, he could have presented that theory in a previous complaint, and the claim is therefore barred. . <em>See Churchill v. Star Enters., 183 </em>F.3d 184, 195 <em>(3d </em>Cir.1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-19\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. The District Court did not rule on Abdul-lah\u2019s motion to remand the matter to \u25a0 state court. Because \"the district court must be certain that federal subject-matter jurisdiction is proper before entertaining a defendant's motion under Federal Civil Rule 12 to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\u201d 14C Charles Alan Wright <em>et at, Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3739 (4th ed.2015), district courts should usually turn first to a motion to remand, <em>see generally Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 411 (11th Cir. 1999). In this case, however, the District Court unquestionably possessed diversity jurisdiction, because the action was between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; <em>Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. 303, 307, 126 S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797 (2006) (discussing diversity rules for national banks). Abdullah argued that he presented only a state claim, but the District Court's jurisdiction was premised on the diversity of the parties, not the presence of a federal question. Moreover, while Abdullah claimed that the defendants did not remove the case before the expiration of the 30-day deadline imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b), that requirement is procedural, not jurisdictional, <em>see Farina v. Nokia Inc., </em>625 F.3d 97, 114 (3d Cir.2010), and, in any case, it appears that the defendants did remove the case within 30 days of being served with the complaint, <em>see Murphy Bros. v. Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc., </em>526 U.S. 344, 347-48, 119 S.Ct. 1322, 143 L.Ed.2d 448 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
