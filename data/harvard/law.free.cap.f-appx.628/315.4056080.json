Benningfield seeks to challenge certain enhancements to his offense level, and he argues that the appeal waiver provision of his plea agreement is unenforceable because he did not knowingly waive his right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>We assume without deciding that the waiver is unenforceable and address instead the sentencing issues raised by the instant appeal. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that an appeal waiver does not implicate our jurisdiction). Accordingly, we DENY the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal based on the waiver provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Benningfield argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2000). As set forth in the Presentence Report, this enhancement was imposed because Benningfield, after meeting with government officials who were investigating his tax evasion, fled to Mexico, where he remained as a fugitive for over nine years. Benningfield contends that the enhancement should not have been applied because his flight to Mexico was a pre-custodial evasion of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">As he concedes, Benningfield\u2019s failure to make a contemporaneous objection to the enhancement results in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Navejar, </em>963 F.2d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1992). To establish plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or' obvious and that affects his substantial rights; if he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We agree with the Government\u2019s contention that, under our precedent, the district court\u2019s determination that Benningfield obstructed justice by fleeing to Mexico during the investigation of his tax evasion offense is a factual finding that can never constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Claiborne, </em>676 F.3d 434, 438 (5th Cir. 2012) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991). In his reply brief, Benningfield preserves for possible en banc or Supreme Court review the question whether our precedent in this regard is erroneous. As an alternative ground for our decision on this issue, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding Benningfield\u2019s prior escape from custody in Texas and his fugitive status in 1989 in Tennessee support the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Benningfield obstructed justice by fleeing to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">We also may affirm the enhancement on any alternative ground apparent from the record. <em>See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). Following a review of the merits of Benningfield\u2019s challenge to the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, we conclude that Benningfield has not made the requisite showing of clear or obvious error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. In this respect, while we are cognizant that \u201cavoiding or fleeing from arrest\u201d is ordinarily not covered by the enhancement, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 5(D), Benning-field\u2019s flight to Mexico and his extended stay in that country as a fugitive was obstructive and not an ordinary case of avoidance of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Benningfield also challenges the imposition of a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l). This issue, too, is subject to plain error review due to the lack of a contemporaneous objection at sentencing. <em>See Navejar, </em>963 F.2d at 734. As explained below, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court committed clear or obvious error in applying the \u00a7 -2Tl.l(b)(l) enhancement, we conclude that Benningfield is not entitled to relief because he fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201cIn the sentencing context, ... an appellant can show an impact on substantial rights \u2014 and therefore a basis for reversal on plain error review \u2014 where the appellant can show a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error, the appellant would have received a lower sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). The appellant has the burden of establishing a reasonable probability of receiving a lower sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 647-48. Where, as here, the sentence imposed falls within both the correct and incorrect guidelines, we have \u201cshown considerable reluctance in finding a reasonable probability that the district court would have settled on a lower sentence,\u201d and we \u201cdo not assume, in the absence of additional evidence, that the sentence affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 416 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Benningfield argues that there is a reasonable probability of a lower sentence in view of the gap between the correct guidelines range (33 to 41 months of imprisonment) and the incorrect guidelines range (41 to 51 months of imprisonment), in conjunction with the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing regarding his age and health. After a thorough examination of the record, we have determined that Ben-ningfield fails to meet his burden under the plain error standard. <em>See Davis, </em>602 F.3d at 647-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
