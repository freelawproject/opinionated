As he did in district court, he contends the sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">Herrera\u2019s sentence is within the adviso- \u25a0 ry Guidelines sentencing range; therefore, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Herrera asserts the court failed to account for his personal circumstances, and his motive for re-entering the United States. The court, which was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d, considered Herrera\u2019s mitigating contentions, addressed them at sentencing, and imposed a sentence within the advisory sentencing range. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339., Accordingly, Hexrera\u2019s contentions are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Moreover, our court has repeatedly rejected Herrera\u2019s assertion that Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s double-counting of a prior conviction, in calculating a defendant\u2019s offense level and criminal history score, necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Similarly, we have repeatedly rejected substantive-reasonableness challenges based on the alleged lack of seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>E.g., United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Finally, as Herrera concedes, his contention that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis, is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent. (He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.) <em>E.g., Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31; <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir,2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
