Her brief and record excerpts have been read. It appears that Ms. Bell lost custody of children in a Texas court in 2001. She has complained about that in eight federal lawsuits she has filed, and at this point no justifiable legal claim is stated or briefed. She has received prior judgments ruling that her claims are frivolous, and at least two district judges have threatened sanctions. The courts have decided and Ms. Bell has to accept that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
