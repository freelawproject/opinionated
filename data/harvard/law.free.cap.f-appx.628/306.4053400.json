He was sentenced to an above-guidelines sentence of 24 months for the false claim of citizenship offense and a consecutive 24-month sentence for the aggravated theft offense. He was also sen- \u25a0 fenced to a total term of three years of supervised release and ordered to pay a within-guidelines f\u00edne of $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">On appeal, Morales-Ruiz challenges the substantive reasonableness of his fine and his 24-month sentence for the false claim of citizenship offense. Because he raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-20\">Morales-Ruiz\u2019s arguments challenging the fine were rejected in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Alvarado, </em>782 F.3d 213, 217-22 (5th Cir.2015). Nothing in the record or in Morales-Ruiz\u2019s arguments compels a different conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-21\">As to the substantive reasonableness of the above-guidelines 24-month sentence, the record demonstrates that the district court made an individualized assessment of the facts and determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was insufficient to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court adopted the presentence report, which detailed Morales-Ruiz\u2019s personal history, and it acknowledged the recommended guidelines range of two to eight months. The district court was particularly concerned, however, with Morales-Ruiz\u2019s criminal history and the danger his criminal conduct had posed to the public in the past and could pose to the public in the future. Morales-Ruiz\u2019s mere disagreement with the court\u2019s assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not establish that the sentence was an abuse of discretion or unreasonable, much less that it was plainly erroneous. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
