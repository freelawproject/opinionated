For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-20\">Lane, a federal prisoner, pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and one count of conspiracy to launder money in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), (a)(l)(A)(i), <em>see </em>D.C.Crim. No. 01-0003. On March 12, 2002, the District Court sentenced him to a 360-month prison term on the drug count and a concurrent 240-month term on the money laundering count, to be followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-24\">On appeal, Lane contested the District Court\u2019s imposition of a three-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for his aggravating role in the offense. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment and upheld the adjustment, stating \u201cthe record and the PSR bear ample proof that Lane engaged in the type of activity that our previous line of cases has held to be worthy of sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, 52 </em>Fed.Appx. 838, 839 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-25\">In 2004, Lane challenged his sentence pursuant to a motion to vacate sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, filed in the sentencing court, in which he alleged that his attorney was constitutionally ineffective for failing to negotiate a favorable plea. Specifically, Lane argued that the Guidelines were improperly applied to calculate his offense level. The District Court denied \u00a7 2255 relief, concluding that the record showed that Lane\u2019s attorney had negotiated a favorable plea but Lane had rejected it, and that his stand-alone Guidelines claim could not be pursued in a \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see United States v. Lane, </em>2005 WL 1421496 (S.D.Ind. June 16, 2005). The Seventh Circuit denied his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>On March 23, 2015, Lane filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where he is confined. Lane claimed that his sentence is illegal and a miscarriage of justice because his Indictment referenced only \u201cin excess of 500 grams\u201d of methamphetamine, whereas he was sentenced under the Guidelines for \u201cin excess of 15 kilograms\u201d of the drug. The Magistrate Judge filed a Report and Recommendation, recommending that the petition be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, citing <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 345-46, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) (\u00a7 2255 motions are exclusive means by which federal prisoner can challenge conviction or sentence that allegedly is in violation of Constitution or federal laws or that is otherwise subject to collateral attack). Lane filed Objections. The District Court then overruled those objections, and dismissed Lane\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. Lane filed a timely motion for reconsideration and then also filed a notice of appeal on July 22, 2015. In an order entered on July 24, 2015, the Court denied Lane\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Lane appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our Clerk granted him leave to appeal <em>informa pauperis </em>and advised him that the appeal was subject to summary dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) or summary action under Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Lane has submitted a summary action response and a motion for appointment of counsel. In his summary action response, Lane argues that the Indictment authorized \u201cthe proper Sentence\u201d to be \u201clevel 32 - (770 grams 841(1)(1)) + the Seven(7) Points in Enhancements = a Level 39-3 = level 36 = 188 months to 235 months.\u201d (Response, at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. The District Court properly dismissed Lane\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because a motion filed under \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). In certain limited circumstances, a petitioner may seek relief under \u00a7 2241 if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, <em>see In re: Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997), but \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply because the sentencing court does not grant relief on the petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion or because the petitioner is unable to meet the gatekeeping requirements, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), for a second \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We have only applied the \u00a7 2255 \u201csafety valve\u201d where the petitioner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for actions deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 (citing <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251). Lane did not contend that, as a result of a Supreme Court decision issued after he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, the conduct for which he was convicted is now not criminal. Lane appears to contend that his sentence is unconstitutional because the District Court determined the length of it based on a drug quantity that was not specified in the Indictment, admitted to in the guilty plea, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. Although he did not, as he might have, specifically cite <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we note that neither case decriminalized the conduct for which Lane was convicted. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court dismissing Lane\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. His motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-21\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">. A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal from the denial of \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Burkey </em>v. <em>Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-11\">. We reject as unpersuasive Lane\u2019s assertion that an argument that the grand jury indicted him only for \"in excess of 500 grams\u201d of methamphetamine is tantamount to an argument that he is \"actually innocent\u201d so as to permit him to resort to a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
