He argues that the district court clearly erred in refusing to grant a two-level reduction in his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because of his allegedly minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In order to be eligible for a \u00a7 3B1.2 sentencing reduction, a defendant must show that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in the subject offense. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir. 2005). In this case, the district court denied a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction to Malady based on its finding that Malady was an \u201caverage participant\u201d in a drug trafficking operation. The district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. The record established that, during the course of certain wiretap intercepts, Malady was identified discussing the buying and selling of methamphetamine from other participants in the operation in order to supply his customers. Malady met with methamphetamine suppliers on several occasions to obtain methamphetamine. Malady also admitted that he used a supplier\u2019s vehicle to transport and deliver methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Malady avers that the district court denied him a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction because his sentence was based on the criminal activity in which he was actually involved. Malady claims this was error. While a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction \u201cremains available for a defendant ... who was only held accountable for the conduct in which he was personally involved,\u201d it is not available to an average participant. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. In this case, the district court denied Malady a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction on the grounds that Malady was an \u201caverage participant\u201d and not because he was being held accountable for the illegal conduct in which he was personally involved. Because the district court\u2019s finding that Malady was an average participant is not clearly erroneous, the district court did not commit error in denying Malady a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
