Tran argues that the BIA failed to properly weigh the factors pertinent to the \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B) waiver, and he insists that his removal from this country would cause an extreme hardship to his wife and children, all of whom are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-21\">The jurisdiction stripping provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae provide that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review\u201d the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decision to deny \u00a7 1182(h) relief. <em>See Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 541 (5th Cir.2008). We likewise lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen an order denying \u00a7 1182(h) relief. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th <em>Cir.2004).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>We may, however, consider legal or constitutional challenges to the denial of relief under \u00a7 1182(h). \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Martinez, </em>519 F.3d at 541. This principle does not provide Tran any succor because his challenges to the BIA\u2019s denials of relief raise factual questions. <em>See Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2014); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider Tran\u2019s petitions for review, and they are DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
