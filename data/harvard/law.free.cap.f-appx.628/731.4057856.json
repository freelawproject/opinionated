Specifically, Mowatt argues the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion as untimely, that equitable tolling is applicable in his case, and the standard enumerated in <em>In re Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) violates the Administrative Procedure Act. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we deny the petition in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We may review a final order of removal only after an alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). This requirement is jurisdictional, and thus, precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-50 (11th Cir. 2006). We lack jurisdiction to review Mowatt\u2019s claim for equitable tolling and his argument that <em>Velarde </em>violates the APA, because he failed to raise these arguments before the BIA and thus, did not exhaust the claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The INA provides an alien may file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, but \u201cthe motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i). This 90-day time limit is subject to specifically enumerated exceptions, such as changed conditions arising in the county to which deportation has been ordered, or if the petitioner is a battered spouse, child, or parent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv). The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Mowatt\u2019s motion to reopen, as the motion was untimely and met none of the statutory exceptions to allow for the untimely filing of a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\">, We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.
