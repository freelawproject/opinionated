The district court properly held that Doherty failed to state any plausible claim of a substantive or procedural due process violation under either the United States or Texas constitutions. The district court similarly did not err in its determination that Doherty\u2019s remaining claims \u2014 including his unlawful taking claim, his Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 claims, and his conspiracy claim \u2014 warranted dismissal for their collective failure to allege a plausible right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of a}l claims asserted by Doherty.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
