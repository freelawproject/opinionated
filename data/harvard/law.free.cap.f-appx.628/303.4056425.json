We review the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">For the intentional deprivation of property to give rise to a due process violation, the deprivation must have been officially authorized and the plaintiff must challenge both the deprivation and the procedure under which it was authorized. <em>See Stotter v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, </em>508 F.3d 812, 821-22 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)). Brewer never asserted that he was deprived of his property as the result of an unconstitutional storage policy; therefore, his argument that the district court erred by applying the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>analysis to his claim is without merit. <em>See Allen v. Thomas, </em>388 F.3d 147, 148-49 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Brewer\u2019s argument that he had no adequate post-deprivation remedy is without merit. <em>See Myers v. Klevenhagen, </em>97 F.3d 91, 94 (5th Cir.1996). In addition to administrative relief, Texas\u2019s tort of conversion provides adequate state post-depriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tion remedies to prisoners who claim due process violations based on deprivation of their property. <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 501.007, 501.008.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">As the party opposing summary judgment of his retaliation claim, Brewer was required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which the evidence supported his claim. <em>See Ragas v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., </em>136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir.1998). He was required to show, inter alia, a retaliatory adverse act and a retaliatory motive. See <em>Bibbs v. Early, </em>541 F.3d 267, 270 (5th Cir.2008). Brewer failed to make this showing; therefore, the district court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1325 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In light of the foregoing, we do not reach the merits of Brewer\u2019s arguments concerning Eleventh Amendment immunity and the exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>See Spiller v. City of Tex. City, Police Dep\u2019t, </em>130 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir. 1997). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Brewer\u2019s discover requests. <em>See McCreary v. Richardson, </em>738 F.3d 651, 654 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
