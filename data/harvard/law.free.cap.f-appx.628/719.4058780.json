The district court found that his prior conviction for escape, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40, qualified as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s residual clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Cummings objected, arguing that the residual clause was. unconstitutionally vague. The court overruled that objection and sentenced him as a career criminal based on that conviction and two other prior convictions. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-23\">The Supreme Court invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2556-57, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Because of <em>Johnson, </em>Cummings\u2019 escape conviction can serve as a predicate offense only if it qualifies as a violent felony under a different ACCA provision. It does not. The government agrees that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40 does not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d is not \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d and does not involve the \u201cuse of explosives.\u201d 18 U.S:C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) \u2014 (ii). The ACCA applies only if the defendant has three qualifying offenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and Cummings is one offense short of that require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ment. For that reason, we vacate his sentence and remand for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-18\">. He also requests that we remand the case so that the district court can consider whether his two prior drug convictions are qualifying offenses under the ACCA. Because he cannot be sentenced under the ACCA anyway, that is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
