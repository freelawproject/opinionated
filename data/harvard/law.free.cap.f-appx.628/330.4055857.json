By moving to proceed IFP, Coleman is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith, <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">As Coleman concedes, the district court implicitly found him eligible for the reduction but declined to exercise its discretion to reduce the sentence. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). Coleman contends that the court abused its discretion in denying a sentencing reduction because it did not consider all of the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) sentencing factors or the particular facts of his case and did not articulate the reasons for denying the motion. We need not address Coleman\u2019s additional contentions alleging that the government breached the plea agreement and that the district court committed various pre-trial, trial, and sentencing errors because those issues are beyond the scope of the guidelines amendment and therefore are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Contrary to Coleman\u2019s assertions, the record reflects that the district court considered his motion as a whole, gave specific reasons for its denial, and referenced the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, expressly determining that relief was unwarranted, in particular, based on the seriousness of the offense, the need to protect the public from danger, and the fact that Coleman had callously committed his crimes in the presence of children. Coleman\u2019s conclusional assertions are not sufficient to demonstrate that the court based its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of, the facts. Thus, Coleman cannot show an abuse of discretion. <em>See Larry, </em>632 F.3d at 936; <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Coleman has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the IFP motion is DENIED. Coleman\u2019s motion for immediate release is likewise DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
