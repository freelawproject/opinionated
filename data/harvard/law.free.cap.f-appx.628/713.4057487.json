In the district court, Jones pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The record reflects that the sentencing judge determined Jones was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, considered what the recommended sentence would be but-for Jones\u2019s status as a career offender, and made a downward adjustment from the recommended sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court imposed a sentence of 156 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-24\">Jones filed a motion with the district court to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Jones argued that because the sentencing judge did not. impose a sentence within the career offender range of 188 to 235 months, but instead imposed a sentence within the range that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>would have applied were he not a career criminal, the sentencing judge actually \u201cbased\u201d Jones\u2019s sentence on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, not \u00a7 461.1, and therefore Jones may seek the benefit of Amendment 782. The district court denied the motion because Jones was a career offender and Amendment 782 did not alter the career offender guideline. On appeal, Jones argues (1) the district erred in determining it lacked authority to reduce his sentence; and (2) his conviction for fleeing and eluding a police officer is not a crime of violence under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), which means he was wrongly determined to be a career offender. After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not have authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Jones\u2019s sentence. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) de novo. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>772 F.3d 662, 666 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless: (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, and (2) a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the range \u201cdetermined <em>before </em>consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The , district court did not have authority to reduce Jones\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Where a defendant has been sentenced as a career offender, the relevant base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 plays \u201cno role in the calculation of the[] guideline range[ ].\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327, 1330 (11th Cir.2008)). Unless the amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines alters the definition or qualifications for career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, \u201c \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Jones seeks a reduced sentence in light of Amendment 782. However, this Amendment only altered \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); it did not alter \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, because Amendment 782 did not lower the guideline range upon which Jones\u2019s sentence was based, the district court did not have authority to reduce Jones\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">For the first time on appeal, Jones argues that fleeing and eluding a police officer is not a crime of violence under the residual clause of the career offender sentencing guideline, and therefore the sentencing court erred in determining he was a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. This argument fails because it is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Under the present procedural posture, the district court did not have authority to evaluate whether Jones is a career offender. A \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding is not a de novo resentencing, and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir. 2000). Therefore, Jones\u2019s argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>he was erroneously classified as a career offender is unavailing because it was a determination made at the original sentencing, unaffected by Amendment 782. <em>See United States v. Dillon, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
