Alternatively, the district court ruled that Hammonds failed to prove that the legitimate reasons provided for the employment decisions were pretexts for retaliation'. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Brown v. Alabama Dep\u2019t of Tramp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1173 (11th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). Mere conclusions and factual allegations unsupported by evidence are insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">Hammonds failed to establish a causal connection between any adverse employment action and her protected activity. <em>See Brown, </em>597 F.3d at 1182. Although Heard denied Hammonds\u2019s first request for additional employment in January 2011 and arguably contributed to the denial of Hammonds\u2019s second request in February 2011, those actions were too remote to Hammonds\u2019s protected activity in the summer of 2009 to establish causation based on temporal proximity. <em>See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). With respect to the denial of Hammonds\u2019s requests for leave, the undisputed evidence established that Colonel Jimmy Butts was the ultimate decision-maker and he was unaware of Ham-monds\u2019s statement about Heard, which eliminated any potential motive for retaliation. <em>See Brungart v. BellSouth Tele-comms., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000). And Sheriff Jackson testified, without dispute, that he did not know of Ham-monds\u2019s protected activity and that he transferred her to the jail to satisfy a court decree that required him to staff the facility with more supervisors. <em>See id. </em>Ham-monds alleged that Heard attended staffing meetings and could have recommended the transfer, but Hammonds failed to provide any evidence, beyond her speculation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>that Jackson then served as a \u201cmere conduit, or \u2018cat\u2019s paw* to give effect to [Heard\u2019s retaliatory] animus.\u201d <em>See Stimp-son v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Sheriff Jackson.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
