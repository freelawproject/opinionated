Dos Anjos Oliveira challenges the denial of his motion for a downward departure, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2M5.2, cmt. n. 1 (Nov.2014), which he contends made his sentence procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Dos Anjos Oliveira\u2019s motion for a downward departure. We cannot review a discretionary decision not to depart downward \u201cunless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked the statutory authority to depart from the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Norris, </em>452 F.3d 1275, 1282 (11th Cir.2006). The district court reviewed the commentary of section 2M5.2, considered the parties\u2019 arguments, and questioned the government about how Dos Anjos Oliveira\u2019s case differed from a defendant for whom the government had requested a departure. The record establishes that the district court understood that it could depart and declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-20\">Dos Anjos Oliveira\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. He attempted to export to Brazil four disassembled AR-15 assault rifles by disguising the parts as tools, toys, or electrical components. The district court granted the motion of the government to reduce Dos Anjos Oliveira\u2019s offense level by three points for his acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and correctly calculated his adjusted advisory guideline range of 46 to 57 months. Even so, the district court decided to vary downward from the low end of that range by 8 months. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 38 months of imprisonment took into account Dos Anjos Oliveira\u2019s lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>of a criminal history and his \u201cdepression from which he has been off of work as a military police officer for some time\u201d and addressed the need to \u201cpromote respect for the law and provide deterrence to others.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing Dos Anjos Oliveira to a term that is far below his maximum statutory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We AFFIRM Dos Anjos Oliveira\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
