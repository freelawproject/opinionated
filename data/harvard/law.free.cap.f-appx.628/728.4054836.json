In conjunction with that petition, Bolin moved for a stay of execution. On December 30, 2015, the District Court dismissed Bolin\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction because Bolin failed to show that he was entitled to file a second or successive habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court denied his request for a stay as well.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Because the District Court was correct to dismiss Bolin\u2019s successive habeas petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and because our precedent establishes that such a dismissal does not constitute a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), we affirm that dismissal as a \u201cfinal decision\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The District Court correctly held that Bolin lacked jurisdiction to bring a second or successive petition because he failed to first obtain authorization to do so from this Court as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons given in our order denying Bolin\u2019s application for leave to file a second or successive habeas petition, <em>see In re: Oscar Ray Bolin, Jr., </em>No. 15-15710-P, at 6-13 (11th Cir. Jan. 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>2016), Bolin is unable to show either that he is entitled to bring a successive habeas petition in line with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 or that the claims he seeks to bring \u201cf[a]ll within [the] small subset of unavailable claims that could not reasonably be categorized as \u2018successive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stewmart v. United States, </em>646 F.3d 856, 861 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Leal Garcia v. Quarterman, </em>573 F.3d 214, 222, 224 (5th Cir.2009)). Therefore, the District Court properly held that it was barred from hearing Bolin\u2019s latest battery of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Before concluding, we pause briefly to note why a COA need not issue before we can affirm a district court\u2019s dismissal of a second or successive habeas petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. As we have previously held, a dismissal of a successive habeas petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction does not constitute a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). <em>Hubbard v. Campbell, </em>379 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.2004). If it did, due to the limits Congress imposed on our jurisdiction, either a COA would first have to issue or our review would be precluded. Instead, such a dismissal is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and a COA is thus \u201cunnecessary to permit us to review the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">With that in mind, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Bolin\u2019s successive habeas petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">. Bolin has also filed an application seeking from this Court authorization for the district court to consider a second or successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We have denied that application in a separate order. <em>See In re: Oscar Ray Bolin, Jr., </em>No. 15 \u2014 15710\u2014 P (11th Cir. Jan. 4, 2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. The court did, however, grant a certificate of appealability (COA) that reads, in full: \"Bolin is granted a [COA] on the issue of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Oscar Ray Bolin, Jr. v. Secy, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>Case No. 8:15\u2014 cv-2943-T-27MAP, at 5-6 (M.D.Fla. Dec. 30, 2015) (emphasis added). That COA was granted in error on a broad jurisdictional question rather than a specific constitutional denial as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). As we made clear in <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>federal courts \u201ccannot ignore the clear command\u201d that \"Congress articulated in subsections 2253(c)(2) and (3).\u201d 773 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir.2014) (en banc). Those provisions provide that a COA may issue \"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and \"shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy [that] showing.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253(c)(2), (3). Though we ultimately exercised our discretion to rule on the merits in Spencer despite a faulty COA because of the \"late hour\u201d at which the issue was raised and the substantial judicial resources already expended, we also noted that \"[w]e will not be so lenient in future appeals when a certificate fails to conform to the gatekeeping requirements imposed by Congress.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>773 F.3d at 1137-38; <em>see also Damren v. Florida, </em>776 F.3d 816, 820-21 (11th Cir.2015) (reiterating that \u201cwe are reluctant to disregard the gatekeeping requirements Congress has set up\u201d but choosing to reach the merits because of the litigation\u2019s \"lengthy procedural journey,\u201d which lasted more than a decade and involved a previous appeal before this Court). We ended our discussion of the correct process for issuing a COA by warning that a \"failure to specify\u201d the underlying constitutional issue, whether committed by this Court or a district court, \"will result in the vacatur of the certificate.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>773 F.3d at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Here, the District Court failed to identify with any meaningful degree of specificity a potential <em>constitutional </em>denial. Rather, the COA encompasses only a <em>jurisdictional </em>question \u2014 and an extraordinarily capacious one at that. Given that the entirety of this round of Bolin\u2019s habeas litigation has lasted only a handful of days, we see no reason not to make good on our warning in <em>Spencer. </em>Were we not affirming the District Court's dismissal of Bolin\u2019s successive petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we would vacate the COA as improvidently granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-13\">.Section 2244(b)(3)(A) provides, \"Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b754-7\">ED CARNES, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzH\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">I agree with the Court that we are bound by precedent to hold that a certificate of appealability is not required before a petitioner can appeal a district court\u2019s dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) &amp; (3)(A) of a habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Hubbard v. Campbell, </em>379 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir.2004). ' That is unfortunate because <em>Hubbard </em>wrongly decided that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">A habeas petitioner is required to obtain a COA to appeal <em>\u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding </em>in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Where a district court dismisses a habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction, \u201cthe petitioner has no further recourse in the district court, and, as such, the dismissal is a final order by that court.\u201d <em>United States v. Harper, </em>545 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir.2008). And the order is obviously \u201cin a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d <em>See Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir.2004). That, being so, \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) expressly prohibits a petitioner whose petition was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction from appealing that dismissal without a COA. All the circuits to address the issue have reached that conclusion. <em>See Harper, </em>545 F.3d at 1233; <em>Resendiz v. Quarterman, </em>454 F.3d 456, 458 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Sveum v. Smith, </em>403 F.3d 447, 448 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Jones, </em>392 F.3d at 688-89. Except us.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">Without the benefit of the later decisions from those four other circuits, the <em>Hubbard </em>opinion\u2019s entire discussion of the COA issue consists of just three sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">Section 2253(c) has no application here because the district court\u2019s decision dismissing the Amended Petition is not \u201ca final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Rather, the decision is a final order dismissing the Amended Petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We have jurisdiction to review the order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">379 F.3d at 1247. Each of those three sentences is purely conclusory. None of them explains why a jurisdictional dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>al, which is <em>\u201ca </em>final order dismissing [a petition] for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d is not <em>\u201ca </em>final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d An order dismissing a habeas proceeding for lack of jurisdiction is as much a final order as one dismissing a habeas proceeding for lack of merit. Both finally dispose of the proceeding. The <em>Hubbard </em>opinion does not explain why an order dismissing a habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 1291, but not a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc), we held that \u201ca certificate of appealability is required for the appeal of any denial of a [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 60(b) motion for relief from a judgment in a [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2254 ... proceeding.\u201d We reiterated that holding in <em>Jackson v. Crosby, </em>437 F.3d 1290, 1294-95 (11th Cir.2006). Given our en banc holding in <em>Gonzalez, </em>what' <em>Hubbard </em>means is that if a petitioner labels his successive pleading a Rule 60(b) motion he must obtain a COA to appeal the dismissal of it on jurisdictional grounds, <em>Gonzalez, </em>366 F.3d at 1263, but if he labels it a \u00a7 2254 petition he can appeal the dismissal of it on jurisdictional grounds without a COA, <em>Hubbard, </em>379 F.3d at 1247. That illustrates <em>Hubbard\u2019s </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">If we were free of the <em>Hubbard </em>decision, I would hold that the dismissal of a habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding\u201d that requires a COA under \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). Given that we must follow <em>Hubbard </em>until it is overturned, I join the Court in addressing the \u201cmerits\u201d of the district court\u2019s decision that under \u00a7 2244(b)(2) &amp; (3)(A) Bolin\u2019s petition was due to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and I agree that decision should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
