On appeal, Rameriz-Rodriguez asserts that (1) the district court erred in denying Rameriz-Rodriguez a two-level reduction for his minor participation in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), and (2) his total sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly applied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the facts and circumstances relevant to his case. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">. I. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Rameriz-Rodriguez argues that he was entitled to a two-level reduction for his role in the offense, averring he was only a \u201cminor participant.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant qualifies as a \u201cminor participant\u201d if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants\u201d but had more than a \u201cminimal\u201d role in the offense. <em>See id. </em>cmt. n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant does not qualify for a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The district court should \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role\u201d in the offense against: (1) \u201cthe relevant conduct for which [the defendant] was held accountable at sentencing\u201d and (2) \u201cthe other participants, to the extent that they are\u2019 discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 940, 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Here, in denying Rameriz-Rodriguez a mitigating role reduction, the district court considered both <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prongs and reached a conclusion supported by the record. <em>See id. </em>at 947 (\u201cSo long as the district court\u2019s conclusion as to defendant\u2019s role in the offense is supported by the record, and the court has resolved any disputed factual issues ..., a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d). Rameriz-Rodriguez failed to bear his burden under either prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 939 (\u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">First, Rameriz-Rodriguez has not shown that he played a minor role as compared to the conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 945. Even though Rameriz-Rodriguez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>co-conspirators \u2014 rather than Rameriz-Rodriguez himself \u2014 restrained the victim and had a knife during the robbery, Ram-eriz-Rodriguez initiated the chain of events that resulted in the restraint and robbery with a knife present. In fact, Rameriz-Rodriguez participated in the relevant conspiracy from beginning to end: he identified the potential victim, notified the purported leader of the conspiracy of that identification, served as a lookout during the robbery, helped with the vehicle exchange after the robbery, and profited from the robbery. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (\u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Second, Rameriz-Rodriguez also has not shown that he \u201cwas less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [the] relevant conduct\u201d because he initiated the relevant offense by identifying the victim and contacting the purported leader / of the conspiracy, served as a lookout during the robbery, helped exchange vehicles after the robbery, and profited from the robbery. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of 'other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Thus, Rameriz-Rodriguez has not shown he was entitled to a minor-role reduction, and the district court did not clearly err in declining to reduce his offense level on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">II. Procedural and Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Rameriz-Rodriguez next challenges the reasonableness of his within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">We review the district court\u2019s sentencing decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must consider the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ].\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>accord Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50 n. 6, 128 S.Ct. at 596 n. 6; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Here, Rameriz-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively sound. The district court correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines range, \u201ctreat[ed] the Guidelines as\u201d advisory, \u201cconsidered] the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d did not select Rameriz-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence \u201cbased on clearly erroneous facts,\u201d and \u201cadequately explain[ed]\u201d the sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (\u201cAn acknowledgment the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The district court fully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Rameriz-Rod-riguez\u2019s family and criminal history, the need for deterrence, the nature of the violent offense, and Rameriz-Rodriguez\u2019s role in the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (\u2018We will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unless the district court has made a clear error of judgment and has imposed a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The district court also considered Rameriz-Rodriguez\u2019s arguments regarding sentencing disparities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and the conditions of his pretrial confinement. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 53-56, 128 S.Ct. at 599-600 (\u201cSince the [district [jjudge correctly calculated and carefully reviewed the Guidelines range, he necessarily gave significant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.\u201d); <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (\u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Ultimately, the district court\u2019s sentence was not \u201coutside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (internal quotation marks omitted) (\u201cWe ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, and the appellant has the burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). Further, the total sentence imposed was \u201cwell below\u201d the statutory maximum, which is also a factor indicating reasonableness. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its substantial discretion in imposing this within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude the district court neither clearly erred in declining to apply a minor-role reduction, nor abused its discretion in imposing a total 70-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
