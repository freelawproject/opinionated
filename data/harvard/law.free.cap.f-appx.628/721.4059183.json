On appeal, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion by not considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and by counting his prior convictions against him twice. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>772 F.3d 662, 666 (11th Cir,2014). A district court has discretion to reduce an imprisonment term if a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">To obtain a reduction in a term of imprisonment based on an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, the relevant amendment must be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Because it is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d), Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d). Amendment 782 reduced by two levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 and 2D1.11. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). Section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a resentencing; rather, it permits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Here, Morrison\u2019s base offense level was determined by the application of \u00a7 4B1.1, which was not revised by Amendment 782. Because Morrison\u2019s base level Was not determined by a section effected by Amendment 782, that amendment does not lower his guideline range. Accordingly, he is not eligible for a sentence reduction based on that amendment, and the district court correctly determined that it did not have the authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Furthermore, \u00a7 3582 does not authorize a resentencing, or allow this Court to review whether Morrison was sentenced as a career offender in error. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
