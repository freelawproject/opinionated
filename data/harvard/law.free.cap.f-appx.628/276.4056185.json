He contends the combined 45-month sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Regarding Lagos\u2019 claim that the 27-month sentence imposed for his illegal-reentry offense is substantively unreasonable, the sentence is within the advisory Guidelines sentencing range; therefore, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant Weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">As Lagos concedes, his assertion the presumption does not apply, based on his claim Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based, is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). (He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.) Moreover, we have repeatedly rejected assertions that: double-counting of prior convictions necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable; and, the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 529-30; <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682-83 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">Additionally, Lagos\u2019 contention he returned to the United States because he faced extortion and violent treatment in Honduras and Mexico was considered by the district court and addressed at sentencing. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Lagos\u2019 assertions are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">For Lagos\u2019 challenge to the 18-month sentence imposed for revocation of his su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>pervised release, such sentences are reviewed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Because the sentence fell within the advisory range, and was consistent with Guidelines policy regarding consecutive sentences, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4; U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. B, intro, comment. As with 'his challenge to his sentence for illegal reentry, Lagos\u2019 claim that the revocation sentence was greater than necessary to meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a), similarly fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 808-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
