Peterson argued that he was unfairly denied his right to a jury trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Peterson\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment. \u201cThe right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution ... is preserved to the parties inviolate,\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 38(a), but that right is waived \u201cunless its demand is properly served and filed,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(d), within 14 days after the defendants serve their answer, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(b). Peterson failed to demand a jury trial in his <em>pro se </em>complaint or his amended complaint. He later agreed to proceed without a jury by appearing at his bench trial and by failing to object. <em>See Southland Reship, Inc. v. Flegel, </em>534 F.2d 639, 645 (5th Cir.1976). Peterson argues that he was misadvised by appointed counsel that he waived a jury trial by consenting to have his case decided by a magistrate judge, but Peterson failed to demand a jury trial before the district court appointed his counsel. Peterson failed to establish that his circumstances were so extraordinary to entitle him to relief from the judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), or that there was \u201ca justification so compelling that the [district] court was required to vacate\u201d the judgment against him, <em>Solaroll Shade &amp; Shutter Corp., Inc. v. Bio-Energy Sys., Inc., </em>803 F.2d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">We AFFIRM the denial of Peterson\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
