On appeal, Iglesi-as-Cruz argues that his 40-month sentence, three months above the advisory guidelines range of 30 to 37 months, is procedurally unreasonable because the district court miscalculated his advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>guidelines range and is also substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">A.Two Prior Deportations and 1995 Drug Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">In 1989, Defendant Iglesias-Cruz, who is a citizen of El Salvador, illegally entered the United States. After his asylum application was denied, Iglesias-Cruz failed to report for voluntary departure and was ordered deported in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">In 1994, Iglesias-Cruz was arrested in Washington, D.C. during an undercover drug operation. Stemming from that arrest, in 1995, Iglesias-Cruz was convicted of two counts of a felony drug trafficking offense in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court imposed concurrent 12-month sentences, followed by six years of supervised release. After his release, Iglesias-Cruz was deported on November 22,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">In May 1997, Iglesias-Criiz again was arrested in Washington, D.C., which brought him to the attention of immigration officials. In December 1997, Iglesias-Cruz pled guilty to illegal reentry of a deported alien and received a 40-month sentence. In addition, Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s supervised release as to his 1995 cocaine convictions was revoked, and he was ordered to serve a 10-month sentence consecutive to his 40-month sentence for the illegal reentry conviction. On March 16, 2001, Iglesias-Cruz was released and deported for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">B. Indictment and Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">On August 2, 2014, Iglesias-Cruz was stopped and arrested in Georgia for vehicle-related offenses. After he pled guilty in state court to driving with a suspended license, Iglesias-Cruz was sentenced to 12 months\u2019 probation on that charge, and served 10 days in jail before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">Iglesias-Cruz was held in ICE custody for 41 days before he was indicted for the instant federal offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Iglesias-Cruz was charged with, and pled guilty to, being found in the United States on or about August 2, 2014, after having been deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">C. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI recommended a 12-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), because (1) Iglesias-Cruz had been deported in November 1995 after his May 1995 convictions for drug trafficking offenses, and (2) his May 1995 convictions were assigned three criminal history points. The PSI applied a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, yielding a total offense level of 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>The PSI assigned Iglesias-Cruz a total of six criminal history points, 3 criminal history points- for his 1997 illegal reentry conviction and 3 criminal history points for his 1995 cocaine convictions. The PSI explained that the 1995 cocaine convictions received 3 points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(a) and 4A1.2(k)(l), because although Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s original prison term was for 12 months, he served an additional 10 months in prison after his supervised release was revoked, for a total of 22 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The six criminal history points resulted in a criminal history category of III. A total offense level of 17 and criminal history category of III yielded an advisory guidelines range of 30 to 37 months. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">D. Objections and Request for Downward Departures</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Iglesias-Cruz objected to the 3 criminal history points the PSI assigned to his 1995 cocaine convictions and consequently to the 12-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), which applied only if the 1995 cocaine convictions received the 3 criminal history points. Iglesias-Cruz relied upon recently amended commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which defined the term \u201csentence imposed\u201d to include only those revocation sentences imposed before deportation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(vii). Although Iglesias-Cruz acknowledged that the amended definition explicitly applied only to \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s offense-level calculation, he contended that the amendment\u2019s rationale should extend to the scoring of a defendant\u2019s criminal history under \u00a7 4A1.2 as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">According to Iglesias-Cruz, if his 1995 cocaine convictions did not receive 3 criminal history points, his criminal history category would be II rather than III and his offense level would be increased by 8-levels, rather than by 12-levels, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 13, rather than 17. Thus, Iglesias-Cruz argued that his correctly calculated advisory guidelines range was 15 to 21 months, rather than 30 to 37 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Alternatively, Iglesias-Cruz argued that the district court should depart downward, pursuant to Application Note 7 to \u00a7 2L1.2, because his adjusted offense level overrepresented the seriousness of his 1995 cocaine convictions and, pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l), because a criminal history category III overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history. Iglesias-Cruz asked the district court to depart downward to the advisory guidelines range of 15 to 21 months he said would apply if his 1995 convictions did not received 3 criminal history points. Iglesias-Cruz asked for a further downward departure, pursuant to Application Note 8 to \u00a7 2L1.2, to account for the -time he was held in ICE custody before his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">E. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s objections, denied his requests for a downward departure, and adopted the PSI. The district court found that the advisory guidelines range was 30 to 37 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">. Iglesias-Cruz requested a downward variance, pointing out that: (1) he had a difficult childhood in El Salvador, where he was forced to fight as a child soldier in the civil war; (2) he committed his last non-immigration offense 18 years ago; (3) since his release from prison in 2001, he married, started a family and worked as a house painter to support his children; and (4) he returned to the United States only to care for his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">The district court stated that the guidelines range was not going to be \u201ca controlling factor in [its] ultimate determination.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>Instead, the district court pointed out that deterrence was \u201can important factor to consider here,\u201d Iglesias-Cruz was already deported multiple times, and his previous 40-month sentence for his 1997 illegal reentry offense had not deterred him from returning to the United States. The district court also noted that, based on the ages of his U.S.-born children, Iglesias-Cruz returned to the United States \u201cvery shortly after he had been deported the last time.\u201d The district court admired \u201cthose who have the work ethic to come here to work\u201d and was \u201cvery hesitant to criticize those who come to support their families and to work,\u201d but stressed that in Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s case it was \u201cin violation of the law.\u201d The court said it was \u201cgiving rather great weight to the fact that a [prior] 40-month sentence didn\u2019t deter [Iglesias-Cruz] last time.\u201d The district court imposed a 40-month sentence, stating it was \u201ccertainly ... not going to go below that when it\u2019s a repeat of the previous offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_HB\">Iglesias-Cruz reiterated his request for a downward departure for the time he spent in ICE custody awaiting transfer to the custody of the U.S. Marshals. The district court stated, \u201cI generally do that. That\u2019s a factor I\u2019ve taken into consideration, but under the circumstances as to the sentence I imposed, I\u2019ll leave the determination of what credit this defendant is to receive\u201d to the Bureau of Prisons. When Iglesias-Cruz stressed that the Bureau of Prisons would not credit him for this time, the district court responded that it understood that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">II. PROCEDURAL REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court still must calculate the advisory guidelines range correctly. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence based on a miscalculated advisory guidelines range is procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">Iglesias-Cruz contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred in applying the 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G \u00a7 2L1.2 and in assigning 3 criminal history points to his 1995 drug convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We first review the applicable guidelines used to calculate Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s offense level and criminal history score and then address his particular claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">A. Offense Level Under \u00a7 2L1.2 After a Drpg Trafficking Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2, an illegal reentry defendant begins with a base offense level of 8. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). If the defendant was previously deported after a felony drug trafficking conviction, his offense level is increased, but the extent of the increase depends upon two things: (1) the length of the sentence imposed for the prior drug trafficking conviction; and (2) whether the conviction receives criminal history points. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Specifically, \u00a7 2L1.2(b) provides that if a defendant was previously deported after a drug trafficking conviction, and \u201cthe sentence imposed exceeded 13 months\u201d for that conviction, a 16-level increase applies if that conviction receives criminal history points; and a 12-level increase applies if it does not. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). If \u201cthe sentence imposed was 13 months or less,\u201d for that prior conviction, a 12-level increase applies if that conviction receives criminal history points, and an 8-level increase applies if it does not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 explains that the phrase \u201csentence imposed\u201d has the same meaning as the phrase \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(b) and Application Note 2 (used to compute a defendant\u2019s criminal history score), \u201cwithout regard to the date of the conviction.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(vii). In 2012, the Sentencing Commission amended the definition of the \u201csentence imposed\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s commentary to clarify that \u201cthe length of the sentence imposed\u201d includes \u201cany term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release, <em>but only if the revocation occurred before the defendant was deport</em>ed\u2014 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 764.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, when counting the length of the \u201csentence imposed,\u201d post-deportation revocation sentences of imprisonment are not counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">On appeal, Iglesias-Cruz does not dispute that his 1995 cocaine convictions were \u201cdrug trafficking offenses\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) and that the \u201csentence imposed\u201d \u2014 that is, his original 12-month concurrent sentences without reference to his later 10-month revocation sentence-r-was for \u201c13 months or less.\u201d Iglesias-Cruz disputes only whether his 1995 cocaine convictions properly received criminal history points under Chapter Four, the final requirement for the 12-level increase to apply. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">B. Criminal History Points for a Prior Drug Trafficking Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">Under Chapter Four, three points are added to a defendant\u2019s criminal history score \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Otherwise, only two points are added \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>one point is added for all other prior sentences of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">In turn, a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d is defined as \u201ca sentence of incarceration and refers to the maximum sentence imposed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(b). The commentary explains that although the defendant \u201cmust have actually served a period of imprisonment,\u201d the \u201clength of a sentence of imprisonment is the stated maximum\u201d and \u201ccriminal history points are based on the sentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Important to this appeal and for purposes of calculating criminal history points, any additional term of imprisonment imposed because of a prior revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release is added to the original term of imprisonment, and the sum is used to compute the defendant\u2019s criminal history points under \u00a7 4A1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 11 (explaining that the original sentence and the revocation sentence are added together and \u201cthe total should be counted as if it were one sentence\u201d). If, however, a sentence was imposed more than 15 years before the commencement of the charged offense, it is not included in the criminal history score unless the sentence, \u201cwhenever imposed,\u201d resulted in the defendant being incarcerated during any part of the 15-year period. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">With this background about criminal history points, we conclude that under the plain language of \u00a7 4A1.2, Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d for his 1995 cocaine convictions was 22 months. Although his original sentence in 1995 was for 12 months, Iglesias-Cruz received an additional 10-month sentence in 1997 when his supervised release was revoked. Moreover, Iglesias-Cruz did not finish serving his 10-month revocation sentence until March 2001, because he was ordered to serve it consecutive to his 40-month sentence for his 1997 illegal reentry conviction. Therefore, Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s incarceration for the 1995 cocaine convictions extended into the 15-year period before the August 2, 2014 commencement of his charged offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l), (k)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Put simply, for purposes of computing the number of criminal history points, this additional 10-month prison term is added to the original 12-month prison term, for a total of 22 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(k). Given that Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d for his 1995 cocaine convictions exceeded one year and one month, the district court properly added three criminal history points, pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(a). And, because Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s 1995 cocaine convictions received criminal history points under Chapter 4, the district court also properly increased Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s offense level by 12 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">C. Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s Policy Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">Iglesias-Cruz argues that the Sentencing Commission, in amending the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2, \u201cexpressly prohibited] the increase of a defendant\u2019s offense level for a post-deportation supervised release revocation,\u201d and that \u201cthe Commission would also oppose the increase of Mr. Igle-sias-Cruz\u2019s offense level due to him receiving criminal history points for a post-deportation supervised release revocation.\u201d Iglesias-Cruz contends the district court \u201cignored the expressed intent of the Sentencing Commission\u201d by assessing those three criminal history points and imposing the 12-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">Because the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(a) and 4A1.2 is clear and expressly addresses criminal history points, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>this Court need look no further to determine the meaning of these two guideline provisions. <em>See United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1012 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that to determine the meaning of a guideline, this Court first looks to the plain language, and where there is no ambiguity, further inquiry is not needed). Section 4A1.2 explicitly requires all revocation sentences, without regard to when they were imposed, to be added to the original sentence when computing criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b) and (c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l) &amp; cmt. n. 11 (explaining that \u00a7 4A1.2(k) \u201ccovers revocations of probation and other conditional sentences where the original term of imprisonment imposed, if any, did not exceed one year and one month). This ends the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Even if we were to inquire further, however, the definition of the \u201csentence imposed\u201d <em>in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 </em>applies only to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), not to \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 or 4A1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B) (providing that the definitions are \u201c[f]or purposes of subsection (b)(1)\u201d). Contrary to Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s assertion, Amendment 764, which amended the definition of \u201csentence imposed,\u201d did not expressly prohibit increasing a defendant\u2019s offense level based on a post-deportation revocation sentence. In fact, the amended language of Amendment 764 does not refer to offense levels at all. Instead, Amendment 764 excluded post-deportation revocation sentences from \u201cthe <em>length </em>of the sentence imposed,\u201d which in turn determines whether a 16-level increase applies. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(vii) (emphasis added); <em>Id. </em>app. C, amend. 764. Amendment 764 said nothing about criminal history points, which determines whether a 12-level increase applies, or about the meaning of the phrase \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d found in \u00a7 4A1.1 and defined in \u00a7 4A1.2. In short, Amendment 764 applies only to 16-level increases, not to 12-level increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Had the Sentencing Commission intended to exclude post-deportation revocation sentences from criminal history scoring, and thus from counting toward 12-level increases, it easily could have done so. Yet, no such exclusion appears in Chapter 4. Rather, \u00a7 4A1.2 explicitly requires revocation sentences to be added in calculating criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">In light of all of the above, we can glean no intent on the part of the Sentencing Commission to exclude post-deportation revocation sentences when computing criminal history points under \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 and 4A1.2 or when determining whether to impose a 12-level increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). Accordingly, Iglesias-Cruz has not shown that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">III. SUBSTANTIVE REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">In choosing the appropriate sentence, the district court- must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but need not address each factor separately on the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The weight to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>be given any \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). If the district court decides to impose an upward variance, the court \u201cmust \u2018consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">We examine whether a sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. In reviewing the reasonableness of a variance from the advisory guidelines range, we take into account the district court\u2019s justification and the extent of the variance, but we do not require extraordinary circumstances to justify such a sentence or presume that such a sentence is unreasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95. \u2018We must give \u2018due deference\u2019 to the district court\u2019s \u2018decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>762 F.3d 1300, 1307 (11th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597) (alteration omitted). We will vacate such a sentence \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Here, the district court imposed a 40-month sentence, three months above the advisory guidelines range of 30 to 37 months. The district court explained that a sentence below 40 months would not provide adequate deterrence. Iglesias-Cruz had already been deported two times and, after each deportation, he returned to the United States. Moreover, Iglesias-Cruz had already reentered the United States after being convicted in federal district court- of illegal reentry and serving a 40-month sentence. The district court\u2019s reason for imposing a three-month upward variance is sufficiently compelling to justify the extent of the variance and is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">There is no merit to Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s claim that the district court failed to consider his difficult life history or the fact that he had returned to the United States to care for his family. The district court heard Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s mitigation arguments, and even acknowledged some of the mitigating circumstances explicitly. As the district court explained, however, the court attached great weight to the need for deterrence, which outweighed the mitigating factors Iglesias-Cruz emphasized. <em>See United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 764, 190 L.Ed.2d 636 (2014) (explaining that the district court may attach great weight to one factor over others). Iglesi-as-Cruz\u2019s argument essentially asks us to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we do not do. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. Under the particular circumstances of this case with two prior deportations and a prior 40-month sentence, we cannot say the district court\u2019s decision to vary upward by three months was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">. The presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d) stated at one point that Iglesias-Cruz was convicted of two counts of unlawful distribution of cocaine base and at another point that Iglesias-Cruz was convicted of two counts of unlawful possession of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school. On appeal, the government states that the judgment of conviction indicates that the convictions were for cocaine distribution. We need not resolve this issue because neither party disputes that Iglesias-Cruz's 1995 cocaine offenses, whatever their precise nature, qualified as felony \"drug trafficking offenses\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1025-19\">. Although the parties and the PSI agreed that Iglesias-Cruz was held in ICE custody for 41 days, the PSI also stated that Igelsias-Cruz was transferred to ICE custody on August 21, 2014 and indicted on September 23, 2014, which is in fact 33 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. We review the sentencing court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1358 (11th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1186, 191 L.Ed.2d 142 (2015). We review <em>de novo </em>the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation of a provision of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">. Iglesias-Cruz also argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court denied his request for a downward departure under Application Notes 7 and 8 of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l). We lack jurisdiction to review the merits of these departure claims, however, because it is apparent from the record that the district court understood it had the authority to depart downward on each ground, but declined to do so in Iglesias-Cruz\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mignott, </em>184 F.3d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, to the extent Iglesias-Crus seeks review of these rulings, we dismiss his appeal,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">.
