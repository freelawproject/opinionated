Construing her arguments liberally, Bennett appears to argue that her counterclaim independently supports the removal of this action from state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court had federal subject matter jurisdiction following removal. <em>Castleberry v. Goldome Credit Corp., </em>408 F.3d 773, 780-81 (11th Cir.2005). Generally, a defendant may remove an action initiated in state court to a federal district court as long as that federal district court would have had original jurisdiction over the action. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. However, if that district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it shall remand the case to state court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1447(c). Under \u00a7 1442(a)(3), a person that is an \u201cofficer of the courts of the United States, for or relating to any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties\u201d may remove a civil action directed against them to the relevant federal district court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1442(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">Because Bennett is not an \u201cofficer of the courts of the United States,\u201d the district court did not err in denying Bennett\u2019s motion for relief from judgment based on her argument that removal was proper under \u00a7 1442(a)(3). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
