(\u201cNNPA\u201d) appeals a district court judgment affirming the dismissal of its petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. NNPA also appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of its motion to extend the automatic stay pending appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">On July 24, 2009, the Texas Secretary of State forfeited NNPA\u2019s corporate charter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Texas law, NNPA remained a legal entity for three years after its termination in order to carry out specific, limited purposes, such as defending against legal claims and liquidating assets. <em>See </em>Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code \u00a7 11.356(a). In December 2010, Creditor-Appellee Peter Tarbox, MD filed suit against NNPA in state court, alleging multiple causes of action, including shareholder oppression and breach of contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 19, 2014, nearly five years after the forfeiture of its charter, NNPA sought protection under the Bankruptcy Code by filing a Chapter 7 petition for relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, Tarbox filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy proceeding, arguing that NNPA, as a terminated entity, does not qualify as a \u201cperson\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(b) and \u00a7 101(41) and therefore has no standing to proceed with its petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court granted the motion, concluding that NNPA \u201cis not a \u2018person\u2019 under the Bankruptcy Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and, as such, the [bankruptcy court] has no jurisdiction to grant relief.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">A. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">NNPA filed a notice of appeal to the district court on August 21, 2014, appealing the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of its petition for relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> NNPA later filed its record on appeal, and on October 21, 2014, the district court clerk sent a \u201cNotice of Docketing Record on Appeal\u201d to the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As the district court noted in its dismissal order, under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8009(\u00e1)(l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> NNPA\u2019s brief was due on November 4, 2014.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Based on NNPA\u2019s failure to file its brief, on December 4, 2014, Tarbox filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On December 8, 2014, over a month after NNPA\u2019s brief was due, it simultaneously filed 1) a motion to extend the deadline to file its brief and 2) the brief itself.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In its motion, NNPA maintained that its counsel never received the Notice of Docketing Record and that the e-mail address on file for lead counsel was outdated and had not been used in two years.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">The district court denied NNPA\u2019s motion to extend time to file its brief and granted Tarbox\u2019s motion to dismiss, \u201cfind[ing] that Appellant\u2019s neglect was not excusable.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> NNPA now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-19\">B. Motion to Extend the Automatic Stay Pending Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">After filing a notice of appeal to the district court, NNPA filed a motion to extend the automatic stay pending appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court denied the motion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While NNPA challenged the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling in its untimely filed district court brief,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it failed to comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8006 to properly challenge the ruling on appeal to the district court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the appeal was dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>for failure to timely file, the district court never addressed this issue.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In its brief to this Court, NNPA again challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the motion to extend the automatic stay, arguing that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying the motion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over NNPA\u2019s petition for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334 and \u00a7 157. The district court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). This Court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s dismissal as a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We review district court decisions to extend filing deadlines for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Salts v. Epps, </em>676 F.3d 468, 474 &amp; n. 13 (5th Cir.2012). \u201c[Djeference ... is the hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review.\u201d <em>Love v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>677 F.3d 258, 262 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 137, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997)). An abuse of discretion occurs if a district court \u201c(1) relies on clearly erroneous factual findings; (2) relies on erroneous conclusions of law; or (3) misapplies the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McClure v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 404, 408 (5th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), district courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to extend filing deadlines. <em>Hetzel v. Bethlehem, Steel Corp., </em>50 F.3d 360, 367 (5th Cir.1995). A district court may extend the time to file a motion for \u201cgood cause\u201d \u201cif the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1)(B). In determining whether a party\u2019s neglect was \u201cexcusable,\u201d a district court considers the following factors: \u201c(1) \u2018the possibility of prejudice to the other parties,\u2019 (2) \u2018the length of the applicant\u2019s delay and its impact on the proceeding,\u2019 (3) \u2018the reason for the delay and whether it was within the control of the movant,\u2019 and (4) \u2018whether the movant has acted in good faith.\u2019\u201d <em>Salts, </em>676 F.3d at 474 (quoting Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 1165). Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8001(a) states that \u201c[a]n appellant\u2019s failure to take any step other than timely filing a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground[s] only for such action as the district court .,. deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing NNPA\u2019s bankruptcy appeal reasonably considers each of the <em>Salts v. Epps </em>factors. The district court\u2019s careful consideration of each factor places its decision squarely within the court\u2019s discretion. In the order granting Tarbox\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court found: 1) \u201cthe delay of over one month has prejudiced Appellee\u201d in its state court suit against NNPA; 2) the \u201cthirty-four day delay\u201d \u201cis substantial, and could have been easily avoided through basic diligence\u201d; 3) \u201cAppellant\u2019s failure to exercise diligence in filing and pursuing its appeal was the sole reason for the delay\u201d; and 4) \u201cAppellant has not shown good cause to excuse the late filing.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Considering these factors, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal and denial of the motion to extend the time to file was reasonable in light of the relevant circumstances. Therefore, considering the governing deferential standard, the district court\u2019s dismissal of NNPA\u2019s bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>appeal does not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">NNPA also appeals the bankruptcy-court\u2019s denial of its motion to extend the automatic stay pending appeal. Although raised in NNPA\u2019s untimely filed brief, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the entire bankruptcy appeal rendered this issue moot. Therefore, in light of. our affirmance of the district court\u2019s motion to dismiss, this Court also need not address the motion to extend the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court dismissing NNPA\u2019s bankruptcy appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

In order to appeal an issue to the district court, under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8006, the appellant must file 1) a designation of items to be included in the record on appeal and 2) a statement of issues to be addressed on appeal. A review of the bankruptcy and district court records reveals that NNPA never filed a statement of issues and the designation of the record on appeal does not include any filings relevant to the motion to extend the automatic stay. \u201cIt is \u2018clear under the law of this circuit that an issue that is not designated in the statement of issues in the district court is waived on appeal when the district court rules on the merits,' 'even if the issue was argued before the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re McClendon, </em>765 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>In re McCombs, </em>659 F.3d 503, 510 (5th Cir.2011)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">.
