Gadsden pleaded guilty to opening or causing others to open bank accounts with minimum deposits and using bad checks from those accounts to buy things from various businesses. Law enforcement agents identified over 200 members of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">In calculating Gadsden\u2019s offense level, the district court imposed a two-level sophisticated-means enhancement, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C), and a fourteen-level enhancement based on a loss calculation of $1,000,000, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). On appeal, Gadsden first argues that the district court erred by concluding that the monetary loss was $1,000,000 because the government had failed to substantiate that amount. He next argues that the district court erred in overruling his objection regarding sophisticated means because the scheme was simple and no fraudulent identities were used. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s determination of monetary loss for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cA sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tenting court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 893 (11th Cir.2005). If the loss amount is more than $400,000 but not more than $1,000,000, then the defendant\u2019s offense level increases by 14. USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H-I). If the loss amount is more than $1,000,000 but not more than $2,500,000, then the offense level increases by 16. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I-J).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Invited error occurs when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error. <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009). If a party induces or invites the district court into making an error, we are precluded from reviewing that error on appeal. <em>Id. </em>For example, in <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154 (11th Cir.2006), we held that the defendant was precluded from appealing a term of supervised release he had invited the district court to impose. <em>Id. </em>at 1157. The defendant invited this error by expressly acknowledging in his plea agreement the district court\u2019s ability to impose the term and by \u201crepeatedly requesting]\u201d supervised release in lieu of additional jail time at his sentence hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In similar fashion, we are precluded from reviewing the district court\u2019s loss-amount finding because Gadsden invited the error he contends the district court made. At the sentence hearing, he objected to the government\u2019s loss-amount figure of around $1.4 million, which would have resulted in a 16-level increase under the Guidelines. USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I). The district court asked him what loss amount and corresponding increase he was suggesting, and Gadsden responded that the loss amount was \u201cdefinitely above 400,-000,\u201d which is the bottom end for a 14-level increase. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). After being given time to confirm his estimate, he stated that the loss amount was between $800,000 and $1,000,000, the latter figure being at the top of the range for a 14-level increase. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">After hearing testimony on the issue, the district court sustained Gadsden\u2019s objection and made a loss-amount finding of $1,000,000, yielding a 14-level increase. Although Gadsden later preserved an objection to the sophisticated-means enhancement, he raised no objection to the loss amount. From this record, it is clear that Gadsden argued for a loss amount that would necessarily result in a 14-level increase. We are therefore precluded from reviewing the loss calculation and corresponding enhancement. <em>See Love, </em>449 F.3d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court may apply a two-level enhancement if the offense \u201cinvolved sophisticated means.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C). We review <em>de novo </em>the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and its application of the Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. McGill, </em>450 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). A district court\u2019s finding that sophisticated means were used is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">\u201cSophisticated means\u201d refers to \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(B)). The Guidelines commentary identifies \u201cthe use of fictitious entities\u201d as a type of conduct that, among others, \u201cordinarily indicates sophisticated means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, each action by a defendant need not be sophisticated in order to support this enhancement; it \u201cis sufficient if the totality of the scheme was sophisticated.\u201d <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1199. A sophisticated-means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u25a0 enhancement may be appropriate upon a showing that the defendant engaged in \u201crepetitive, coordinated conduct designed to allow him to execute fraud and evade detection.\u201d <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 826-27 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Gadsden argues that the district court clearly erred by finding that the conspiracy involved sophisticated means because the scheme, using bad checks to purchase goods to resell, was \u201csimple in nature.\u201d Furthermore, Gadsden argues, neither he nor the people he and his brother recruited attempted to conceal their involvement by use of false identities or fictitious entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The district court did not clearly err in applying a sophisticated-means enhancement. Gadsden\u2019s scheme involved as many as 200 people whom he and his brother used to execute and conceal the fraud. It spanned several years and affected businesses in Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. The operation consisted of coordinated and repetitive acts \u2014 the brothers recruited people to open fraudulent bank accounts; targeted businesses from which to purchase merchandise; and resold those goods at a profit. - <em>See Bane, </em>720 F.3d at 826-27 (holding sophisticated-means enhancement was not clear error when the defendant\u2019s \u201crepetitive, coordinated\u201d conduct allowed him to evade detection). In fact, Gadsden and his co-conspirators were coordinated enough to take orders from customers, later buying those items from specific businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Gadsden may. not have concealed his identity or used fictitious entities in the perpetration of this scheme. However, he and his brother coordinated as many as 200 people operating in a wide geographic area to achieve their ends. They bought goods for their customers in an organized, systematic fashion. Even if certain elements of the conspiracy resembled typical fraud, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the totality of the scheme was sophisticated. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1199. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
