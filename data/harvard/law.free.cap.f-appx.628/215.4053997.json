Frazier appeals the 51-month sentence imposed on his guilty plea conviction for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371,1341,1343,1344. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">We reject Frazier\u2019s claim that it was clear error to apply the two-level sophisticated means enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) to his offense level. <em>See United States v. Conner, </em>537 F.3d 480, 492 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1340 (5th Cir.1996). Guidelines commentary defines the term sophisticated means as involving \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or .concealment of an offense.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(B)). The instant case involved the use of sophisticated means in both the execution and the concealment of the offenses, including extensive planning and obscuring of the truth in deceitfully moving assets from one entity to another and to unauthorized personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Frazier knowingly made false statements to lenders about how borrowed funds were used and to a construction surety company about the status of construction projects. He used forged signatures, including on architectural plans and subcontractors\u2019 releases, to obtain funds from the surety. In addition he and a brother diverted funds to the brother\u2019s personal account and then into accounts of fictitious or shell entities. These are a few examples of Frazier\u2019s complex activities and acts of omission that easily meet the standard for application of the enhancement. See, <em>e.g., Conner, </em>537 F.3d at 492; <em>Clements, </em>73 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Because we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the district court, we find no clear error. <em>Clements, </em>73 F.3d at 1340. Consequently, we do not disturb the judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
