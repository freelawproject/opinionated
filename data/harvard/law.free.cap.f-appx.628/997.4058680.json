L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160 (1997), and the denial of his motion to reopen. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-26\">In 1988, Talavera entered the United States without inspection. Talavera applied for an adjustment of status under the Nicaraguan Relief Act, but he abandoned the application. In 2009, the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>notified Talavera that he was removable for having entered the United States without admission or parole. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). The Department also charged Talavera as removable for being convicted in a Florida court of felony battery, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041, a crime of moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Talavera conceded removability on both charges and renewed his application to adjust his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">During his removal hearing, Talavera testified regarding his ten arrests for .offenses involving alcohol and violence and his convictions for reckless driving, driving under the influence, disorderly intoxication, and resisting a police officer, Ta-lavera also testified that he pleaded guilty to felony battery based on his involvement in a brawl during which he and his brothers beat and kicked a man, damaging several of his teeth, and used a machete that severed a tendon in the man\u2019s hand, which required three surgeries to repair. In his written closing argument, Talavera conceded that felony battery was a \u201cviolent or dangerous erime[ ]\u201d and that he could not obtain a waiver of inadmissibility in the absence of evidence that his removal would result in an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.7(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">An immigration judge denied Talavera\u2019s application to adjust his status and entered an order of removal. The immigration judge found that Talavera \u201cconceded that he ha[d] been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude\u201d and failed to establish that his removal would result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to warrant a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See id. </em>The immigration judge also found that Talavera did not otherwise merit relief as a matter of discretion because his favorable attributes did not outweigh his \u201cextensive criminal history\u201d and the \u201cseriousness of [his] conviction for felony battery.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">The Board dismissed Talavera\u2019s appeal. The Board refused to \u201cdisturb\u201d that classification of Talavera\u2019s offense because he had conceded that the offense \u201csatisfied] the violent or dangerous definition,\u201d and in the alternative,, the Board \u201cindependently conclude[d] that the offense so qualifies\u201d based on the factual findings of the immigration judge. Because removal would cause Talavera, his wife, and his mother \u201cthe type of harms typically associated with deportation,\u201d the Board determined that Talavera could not \u201csatisfy the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard ... [and did] not merit a favorable exercise of discretion with respect to his waiver application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Talavera filed a motion to reopen his case, which the Board denied. Talavera\u2019s arguments that his prior conviction might no longer qualify as a crime of moral turpitude due to a change in the law lacked merit, the Board ruled, because he had conceded he was inadmissible and he failed to establish how recent decisions affected his case. The Board also ruled that the evidence regarding the birth of Talavera\u2019s child, the anxiety suffered by his wife and mother while awaiting his removal, and the inferior medical and mental health services in Nicaragua failed to qualify as an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to warrant a waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of discretionary relief, including the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(h)(2), 1252(a)(2)(B), and we lack jurisdiction to review an order of removal based on the commission of a crime of moral turpitude, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), 1252(a)(2)(C). But we have jurisdiction to review constitutional issues or questions of law. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). \u201c[Ajbsent a cognizable excuse or exception, we [also] lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the [Board].\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>468 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Two standards govern our review of Ta-lavera\u2019s petition. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThis review is limited to determining whether the [Board] exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the conclusions of law by the Board. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Talavera argues that the Attorney General exceeded his statutory authority by issuing regulation 1212.7(d) because it imposed a heightened hardship standard to be eligible for an adjustment of status, but this argument fails. Regulation 1212.7(d) did not affect Talavera\u2019s statutory eligibility for a discretionary waiver. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). \u201c[T]he Attorney General, in his discretion, and pursuant to such terms, conditions and procedures as he may by regulations prescribe, [can] consent[] to ... [an] adjustment of status,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1182(h)(2), and could issue regulation 1212.7(d) to provide guidance about how to weigh an alien\u2019s criminal offense against any hardships caused by his removal. Consistent with the regulation, the Board balanced the seriousness of Talavera\u2019s misconduct with the resulting hardships to determine whether he merited a waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Talavera also argues that the Board endorsed the use of an elements-based test to classify his prior conviction as a violent and dangerous felony and engaged in impermissible fact-finding regarding the crime, but Talavera misinterprets the decision of the Board. The Board approved of \u201cthe immigration judge\u2019s decision to treat the conviction in [a] manner\u201d consistent with Talavera\u2019s admission that his prior conviction qualified as a violent or dangerous felony. And the Board relied the \u201cfactual findings [of the immigration judge] regarding the incident ... to independently conclude that [Talavera\u2019s] offense so qualifie[d].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">The Board did not abuse its discretion when it denied Talavera\u2019s motion to reopen. We cannot classify as arbitrary and capricious the finding that the hardships faced by Talavera\u2019s family were not exceptional and extremely unusual when the Board gave reasoned consideration to Talavera\u2019s new evidence. <em>See Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319. Talavera argues that the Board required that a health issue be \u201cpermanent\u201d to, satisfy the hardship standard, but the Board considered the permanence of Talavera\u2019s wife\u2019s and mother\u2019s impairments to determine whether they could obtain adequate medical care in Nicaragua. Talavera also argues that the \u201cBoard erred by holding [him] to the ... concession by his trial counsel that his conviction for felony battery constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude,\u201d but Talavera failed to exhaust this argument before the Board. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Even if we were to assume that Talavera could establish grounds for allowing him to withdraw his concession, he fails to argue that the Board abused its discretion by refusing to reopen his case on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">We DENY Talavera\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
