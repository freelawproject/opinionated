On appeal, Rousseau challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence found during the execution of a search warrant at the fire station where Rousseau worked. During the search, federal agents found Rousseau\u2019s laptop, which contained over 100 videos of child pornography and, at the time of the search, was actively downloading child pornography using an unsecured wireless network. Rousseau argues that the district court: (1) should have held a Franks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing to determine whether the search warrant application contained material misrepresentations about who could access the wireless network; and (2) should have suppressed the evidence found during the search because the search warrant was unconstitutionally broad. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">I. <em>FRANKS </em>CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"AOM\">A. General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">A defendant seeking a <em>Franks </em>hearing must make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d that (1) an affiant, applying for a search warrant made intentionally false or recklessly misleading statements, and (2) those statements were necessary to the finding of probable cause. <em>United States v. Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1883, 191 L.Ed.2d 753 (2015). The defendant\u2019s substantiality requirement \u201cis not lightly met.\u201d <em>United States v. Arbolaez, </em>450 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir.2006). Allegations of deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth \u201cmust be accompanied by an offer of proof.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">In addition, the defendant must show that, if the misrepresentations were removed from, or the omitted facts were included in, the warrant affidavit, then probable cause would be lacking. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>767 F.3d 1264, 1275 (11th Cir.2014) (involving omissions), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1448, 191 L.Ed.2d 403 (2015); <em>Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d at 1329 (involving misstatements). If the warrant would still support probable cause, then no <em>Franks </em>hearing is necessary. <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2013). In the search warrant context, probable cause exists when, under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthere is a fair probability of finding ... evidence [of a crime] at a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>lar location.\u201d <em>United States v. Brundidge, </em>170 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">B. Warrant Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">FBI Special Agent Alexis Carpinteri\u2019s warrant affidavit stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that her investigation had identified a computer with the user name \u201canon_ae3d4aee@ Ares\u201d and an IP address assigned to \u201cMiami Fire Station 6\u201d that was using the ARES peer-to-peer (\u201cP2P\u201d) file sharing network to share files containing child pornography. Surveillance of the Station revealed one open (i.e., not secured by a password) wireless Internet network with limited geographic scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">Specifically, Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit stated that \u201c[a] check for open wireless networks was conducted,\u201d which revealed \u201cone open wireless network labeled \u2018WiFi-Repeaterl.\u2019 \u201d That wireless network \u201ccould only be detected while pulled up directly to the front of the building,\u201d and \u201c[t]he only area for a vehicle to pull up to the building was directly in front of the four (4) bay garage doors where the emergency vehicles for the station were housed.\u201d There was no visitor parking, and the employee parking behind the building was secured by a gated entrance. Further, \u201c[i]t did not appear that any area along the perimeter of the [Station] was viable to access and utilize the unsecured network that was observed at the [Station].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">The investigation further revealed that the IP address had shared files containing child pornography on the P2P network \u201con a consistent basis, starting on June 1, 2013,\u201d with the majority of the time on the P2P network observed \u201cafter 8:00 p.m., often after 10:00 p.m., and ending before 4:00 a.m.\u201d Agents also learned that individual firefighters assigned to the Station worked in 24-hour shifts beginning at 7:30 a.m., and that each firefighter worked one day on-duty, followed by two days off-duty, with some flexibility for contractual days off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">C. Rousseau\u2019s Claim of Misrepresentation in Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">Rousseau identifies as false or misleading Agent Carpinteri\u2019s statements that the wireless network could only be accessed directly in front of the Station and did not appear to be' accessible around the Station\u2019s perimeter. Rousseau argues that Agent Carpinteri did not accurately describe the area around the Station, which included a sidewalk on the east side of the Station and a public park on the west side of the Station, and that, in fact, the unsecured wireless network \u201ccan be easily accessed by any member of the public\u201d from these omitted areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit misrepresented the accessibility of the wireless network to people outside the Station, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold a <em>Franks </em>hearing. This is so because, even if the wireless network could conceivably be accessed from either the sidewalk or the park, the other information in Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit showed a fair probability that it was someone inside the Station who was using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>wireless network to download and share the child pornography.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, as the district court explained, Agent Carpin-teri\u2019s affidavit stated that the illegal downloads from the IP address under that user-name were done \u201con a consistent basis\u201d for over six months and mostly at night between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., making it more likely the user was someone inside the Station than someone outside on the sidewalk or in the public park.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">For the first time on appeal, Rousseau contends that Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit also omitted that Rousseau was the sole target of the investigation. To the contrary, the trial record shows that Rousseau was not the sole target. Specifically, Agent Carpinteri testified that, from comparing the records of employees\u2019 shifts, she identified Rousseau as the only employee on duty at all the relevant times. But, Carpinteri also explained that this fact did not necessarily tell her that Rousseau was the individual downloading and sharing files, because she still did not know who was on the computer and \u201cwho [was] doing what at any given time.\u201d Therefore, Rousseau was \u201cnot the only one\u201d targeted by the FBI investigation. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1294 n. 16 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining this Court may consider evidence subsequently introduced at trial in reviewing a motion to suppress). Accordingly, Rousseau has not shown error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">In sum, because Rousseau failed to make a substantial preliminary showing of a material misrepresentation in Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit, the district court was not required to hold a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">II. PARTICULARITY OF THE SEARCH WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">A. General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">The Fourth Amendment requires that a search warrant particularly describe the place to be searched and the things to be seized. U.S. Const, amend. IV. \u201cA warrant which fails to sufficiently particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized is unconstitutionally over broad.\u201d <em>United States v. Travers, </em>233 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2000). The particularity requirement, however, does not require \u201celaborate specificity.\u201d <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>734 F.2d 750, 754 (11th Cir. 1984). \u201cThe standard is one of practical accuracy rather than technical nicety.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 755 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">With regard to the place to be searched, the warrant\u2019s description need only have \u201csufficient particularity to direct the searcher, to confine his examination to the place described, and to advise those being searched of his authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Burke, </em>784 F.2d 1090, 1092 (11th Cir. 1986). As to the materials to be seized, \u201ca description is sufficiently particular when it enables the searcher reasonably to ascertain and identify the things to be seized.\u201d <em>United States v. Santarelli, </em>778 F.2d 609, 614 (11th Cir.1985). If the applicant for the warrant cannot give an exact description, but has probable cause to believe that such materials exist, the warrant is sufficiently particular if it is as specific as the circumstances and nature of the activity under investigation permit. <em>Id. </em>Further, where it is not feasible at the time the warrant is issued to give an exact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>description of the materials to be seized, the warrant satisfies the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement if it limits the seizure of items to only those items that constitute evidence of criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 615.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">B. Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The search warrant described the property to be searched as any computers, including, among other things, data storage devices, cellular telephones, tablets, and external hard drivers, found in the Station. The search warrant described the items to be seized as, among other things, any visual depictions of child pornography, any records of communication relating to sharing- child pornography, communications with an Internet service provider, communications relating to ownership or use of computers at the Station, computer software, computer passwords, and any computers and cameras that may be used to view or store child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit provided general information about the typical behavior of persons involved in child pornography, including how they use computers and other electronic devices to store and transmit images. Among other things, the affidavit explained that \u201c[v]irtually any type of computer,\u201d including \u201ccellular telephones, smartphones, tablets, and other such electronic mobile devices\u201d can access the Internet and P2P networks using certain \u201capps\u201d and wireless networks and that \u201c[a]ny of these computers, if connected to the internet through a home network, would be associated with the IP address assigned to that home network ..., just the same as would a laptop or desktop computer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Agent Carpinteri\u2019s affidavit also provided information about how computers are seized and searched by forensic analysts for child pornography in a laboratory. The affidavit explained that ordinarily agents must \u201cseize most or all computer items ... to be processed later\u201d in the laboratory. In this case, however, \u201c[i]n order to narrow down which computers need to be seized [from the Station] for further examination,\u201d agents would conduct \u201con-site evidentiary previews\u201d that would \u201cidentify which computers contain evidence of criminal activity and require seizure and which computers are unrelated to the possession, receipt, and distribution of child pornography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">C, Rousseau\u2019s Claim That Warrant Was Overbroad</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">The district court properly denied Rousseau\u2019s motion to suppress on particularity or overbreadth grounds. The warrant sufficiently described the places to be searched as the Station \u2014 including the address and a description of the building\u2014 and any \u201ccomputers\u201d and \u201cdata storage devices\u201d found in the Station. The warrant further contained a very detailed list of the items to be seized, including visual depictions of child pornography; digital and paper documents pertaining to, <em>inter alia, </em>the possession, receipt, or transmission of child pornography, Internet service provider accounts, or online or remote electronic storage; computer software, including P2P file sharing software; and photographic equipment containing child pornography. These descriptions were sufficient to enable a searcher to confine the search to the places described and to reasonably ascertain and identify the things to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>To the extent the descriptions did not identify a specific location within the Station or specific item (such as a particular computer or cell phone), they were as specific as the circumstances and nature of the activity being investigated would permit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agents were investigating the downloading and sharing of child pornography using an IP address registered to the Station and an open wireless network accessible inside the Station. The investigators did not know which or how many Station employees might be involved in the activity, much less which computers or electronic storage devices in the Station were being used. The warrant made clear that a search of the computers required the seizure of \u201cmost or all computer items\u201d to perform the search thoroughly, and that \u201con-site evidentiary previews\u201d would be conducted to minimize the burden, on individuals and devices that were not involved in the illegal activity. The warrant also only authorized the seizure of items that were \u201c[ejvidence of possession, receipt, and distribution of child pornography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">Contrary to Rousseau\u2019s assertion, agents did not conclude that a desktop computer was the only device associated with the anon_ae3d4aee@Ares username. The warrant application stated that any type of computer, including mobile devices such as cell phones, smartphones, and tablets, could use a home wireless network, access P2P networks using certain apps, and store large amounts of electronic data. Dr. Sam Malek\u2019s trial testimony \u2014 that a P2P network is essentially \u201cjust computers,\u201d such as personal laptops and desktops, communicating with each other\u2014 does not contradict the warrant application on this point. Dr. Malek did not testify that a P2P network can be accessed using only a desktop or laptop computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Again, and also contrary to Rousseau\u2019s contention, the record does not show that agents identified Rousseau as the only suspect. Agent Carpinteri testified that, although Rousseau was the only Station employee on duty every time child pornography was shared via the P2P network, this did not necessarily mean that he was the only one using a computer to do so. Moreover, even if Rousseau had been confirmed as the only target, the record does not show that the search could have been limited to his quarters or computers. Firefighters at the Station did not have individual quarters, and it was not known that Rousseau had his own laptop at the Station until the warrant was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Under the circumstances, the warrant was as specific as it could be and it was not feasible for the agents to identify ahead of time a particular computer or storage device inside the Station to be seized and searched. For all these reasons, the district court did not err in denying Rousseau\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2676, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">.

Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>whether a search warrant affidavit established probable cause, taking care \u201cboth to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>United States v.

Because we, like the district court, conclude that the unchallenged portions of the warrant affidavit provide probable cause to believe someone inside the Station was downloading the child pornography, we do not address the government\u2019s other arguments that Rousseau failed to submit affidavits or other evidence in support of his factual assertions and thus failed to offer proof that Agent Carpinteri made any misrepresentations, much less ones that were intentional or reckless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">.

Based on the information in the warrant application, there existed a fair probability that evidence of the possession, receipt or distribution of child pornography would be found on one or more computers and storage devices inside the Station.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
