He contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 to the sentencing guidelines lowered his advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">In 2013 Stirling pleaded guilty under a plea agreement to one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503 and 70506. In the plea agreement, made under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), Stirling and the government agreed to jointly recommend that the district court impose a sentence of 90 months. The plea agreement explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he defendant is aware that under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) this recommendation would bind the court once the court accepts [the] plea agreement.\u201d The agreement did not reference the sentencing guidelines or the drug weight attributable to Stirling. A factual proffer submitted at the change of plea hearing, however, stated that Stirling was the master of a vessel .that contained 381 kilograms of cocaine and 1.001 kilograms of heroin. At sentencing the district court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Stirling to 90 months in prison based solely on the recommendation in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">In 2014 Stirling filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, contending that Amendment 782, which retroactively amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, lowered his advisory guidelines range. The district court denied Stirling\u2019s motion, finding that his 90-month sentence was well below the amended guidelines range that would be applicable to an offense involving the drug quantities that had been attributed to him in the factual proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about its authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). We can affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cty., </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1088 n. 21 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">The district court correctly denied Stirling\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, although it did so for the wrong reasons. The fact that the proffer submitted at Stirling\u2019s change of plea hearing included the amount of drugs found on his vessel is irrelevant. The court lacked the authority to reduce his sentence because the sentencing judge based that sentence on the terms of his Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Freeman, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2695-96, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (explaining that a defendant sentenced under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is generally ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because his original sentence was dictated by the terms of the plea agreement, not the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tencing guidelines); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2012) (noting that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion constitutes the holding of Freeman). A defendant who pleaded guilty under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement may be eligible for a sentence reduction if the plea agreement\u2019s sentence recommendation is explicitly based on a particular guidelines range. <em>See Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2698-98 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). But that\u2019s not the case here. Stirling\u2019s plea agreement did not mention the sentencing guidelines, and neither did the district judge at sentencing. Because Stirling\u2019s sentence was not based on the sentencing guidelines, he was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
