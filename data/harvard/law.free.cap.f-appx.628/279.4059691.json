That court reasoned that the General Release and Settlement of All Claims (the \u201cRelease\u201d) executed by the parties in reference to all \u201cpast and present, or future medical expenses or workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or any other damages arising out of or in any way connected with any personal injuries\u201d sustained by Decedent while employed by USX \u201cor subsequent thereto, or while seeking benefits under the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for that injury ... or otherwise\u201d was both unambiguous and sufficiently broad to cover the claims of Decedent, as now prosecuted by Appellant, for bad faith denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by USX and LM.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Our review of the record on appeal satisfies us that the conclusion reached by the district court is correct and free of error, to wit: \u201cBecause the language of the Release clearly and unambiguously discharges and releases Defendants from any and all claims relating to or arising out of the work accident, the bad faith and emotional distress claims brought by Plaintiff in this case are barred.\u201d Therefore, the District Court\u2019s Final Judgment of June 9, 2015, is</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
