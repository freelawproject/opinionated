HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Mario Irias pled guilty to illegally reentering the United States after his deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Irias\u2019s presentence report, prepared by a probation officer, recommended a sentence of 46 to 57 months in prison after including a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement for Irias\u2019s 2001 California conviction for continuous sexual abuse of a child. The district court sentenced him to 46 months. Irias now challenges that sentence, arguing that that the district court erred in applying the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement. He also challenges the district court\u2019s treatment of his California conviction as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">As an initial matter, Irias concedes that he did not object to the enhancement at sentencing. Thus, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d 310, 311 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">A defendant convicted of illegal re-entry is subject to a 16-level enhancement if he was convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d prior to his removal. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2014). The application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 enumerate the offenses that qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u2014 \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is one. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. l(B)(iii). When an offense category is \u201cneither clearly defined in the Guidelines nor an offense defined at common law\u201d \u2014 as we have held is true for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d \u2014 then we derive its \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d from \u201ccommon usage as stated in legal and other well-accepted dictionaries.\u201d <em>United States v. Vigil, </em>774 F.3d 331, 334 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 552 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc)). We have previously defined the key terms in the phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d according to this method:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201cSexual\u201d is defined as \u201c[o]f, pertaining to, affecting, or characteristic of sex, the sexes, or the sex organs and their functions.\u201d We have defined \u201cabuse\u201d as \u201c \u2018to take unfair or undue advantage of or \u2018to use or treat so as to injure, hurt, or damage.\u2019 \u201d We have repeatedly endorsed the definition of \u201csexual abuse\u201d set forth in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which is \u201can illegal or wrongful sex act, esp. one performed against a minor by an adult.\u201d Finally, our en banc court has defined \u201cminor\u201d as a person under the age of eighteen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Having determined the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d we must next determine whether the California statute defining Irias\u2019s offense of conviction comports with that generic meaning. <em>Id. </em>Irias was convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child, in violation of CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288.5(a). In 1996,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 288.5(a) contained disjunctive elements as it applied to any person either residing in the same \u25a0 home as a minor child, or having recurrent access to the child: it prohibited such persons from engaging in either (1) three or more acts of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d or (2) three or more acts of \u201clewd or lascivious conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288.5(a) (West 1996). To determine which of these disjunctive elements formed the basis of Irias\u2019s conviction, we can look at so-called <em>Shepard </em>documents, which include the charging document and the judgment. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480-81 (5th Cir.2008). We consult these documents \u201conly for the limited purpose of ascertaining which of the disjunctive elements the charged conduct implicated.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda-Ortegon, </em>670 F.3d 661, 663 (5th Cir.2012). Here, Irias\u2019s charging document and judgment indicate that he was charged with and convicted of residing in the same home as the victim and engaging in three or more acts of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">In 1996, the California Penal Code defined \u201csubstantial sexual conduct\u201d as the \u201cpenetration of the vagina or rectum of either the victim or the offender by the penis of the other or by any foreign object, oral copulation, or masturbation of either the victim or the offender.\u201d CaLPenal Code \u00a7 1203.066(b) (West 1996). Irias\u2019s charging document and judgment do not reflect which one of these disjunctive elements formed the basis of his conviction, so it is not possible to narrow Irias\u2019s offense any further. Consequently, we must determine whether the \u201cleast culpable act\u201d constituting a violation of the statute can be considered sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s crime-of-violence enhancement. <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449 (5th Cir.2008). The least culpable act criminalized by the California statute is \u201cmasturbation of either the victim or the offender,\u201d three or more times, with a victim under the-age of fourteen who resides in the same home as the offender. We conclude that such an act easily fits within our generic definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of sexual abuse as \u201can illegal or wrongful sex act, esp. one performed against a minor by an adult.\u201d <em>Vigil, </em>774 F.3d at 334. That means the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, by applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Mas responds in three ways. First, he argues that the generic definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d should require an age differential of at least four years between the victim and perpetrator. But he concedes, correctly, that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 562 n. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Second, he argues that the \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d category is narrower than \u00a7 288.5(a) because we have defined \u201csexual\u201d to require that the perpetrator act with the purpose of \u201csexual gratification,\u201d and \u00a7 288.5(a) has no such requirement. Irias misreads our case law. We have repeatedly defined the term \u201csexual\u201d without reference to a purpose of sexual gratification. <em>See, e.g., Vigil, </em>774 F.3d at 334. So this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Finally, he argues that the \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d category is narrower than \u00a7 288.5(a) because the word \u201cabuse\u201d requires that the victim be physically or psychologically harmed, and \u00a7 288.5(a) lacks this requirement. He further contends that the least culpable act criminalized by the statute would not result in physical or psychological harm. Specifically, he suggests that the following hypothetical scenario could support a conviction under the statute: \u201cthree instances of a girl ... one day under 14 masturbating in front of her live-in friend ... one day over 14.\u201d He asserts that \u201cthis sort of consensual sexual activity between young teenagers\u201d would not result in psychological harm to either party. But Mas cannot rely on \u201clegal imagination\u201d to conjure a theoretical possibility that \u00a7 288.5(a) criminalizes conduct beyond our generic definition. <em>United States v. Ramos-Sanchez, </em>483 F.3d 400, 403 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). He must demonstrate a realistic probability that it does, by \u201cpoint[ing] to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403-04. Irias\u2019s own case does not provide such an example \u2014 he was in his thirties at the time of the offense \u2014 and he has failed to point to any other case that does. Thus, we hold that \u201che has failed to show a realistic probability that [California] would in fact punish conduct of the type he describes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Mas also challenges the district court\u2019s treatment of his California conviction as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). As defined by the statute, the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes, among other offenses, \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). We interpret the phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d the same with respect to both \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 512 n. 2 (5th Cir.2008). Hence this challenge also fails, for the reasons shown above.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The judgment of the distinct court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47,5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. Irias\u2019s offense conduct occurred between 1996 and 1999. The provisions of \u00a7 288.5(a) did not change between 1996 and 1999. We cite to the 1996 version of \u00a7 288.5(a) in this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
