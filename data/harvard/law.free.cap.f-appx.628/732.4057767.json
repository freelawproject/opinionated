His motion was based on Amendment 782 to the guidelines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>which lowered the base offense level for the drug offenses for which Alvarez was convicted. The district court correctly denied Alvarez\u2019s motion because, although Amendment 782 lowered the base offense level for the offenses of conviction, it had no effect on Alvarez\u2019s sentence under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Alvarez pleaded guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 by conspiring, with several codefendants, to possess more than 500 grams of cocaine with intent to distribute it. The presentence investigation report (PSR) stated that his base offense level was 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but set his offense level at 34 because Alvarez qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. It then deducted three levels from that number for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 31. Pairing Alvarez\u2019s total offense level with his criminal history category of VI, the PSR calculated his guidelines range to be 188 to 235 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">At sentencing Alvarez objected to being classified as a career offender. The district court overruled his objection and expressly adopted the PSR\u2019s guidelines calculations. In light of the much lower sentences Alvarez\u2019s codefendants had received, however, the district court decided that a within-guidelines sentence would be excessive. It asked the probation officer what Alvarez\u2019s guidelines range would have been had he not been a career offender, and the probation officer responded that it would have been 46 to 57 months in prison. After noting that the career-offender enhancement made the low end of Alvarez\u2019s guidelines range four times higher than it otherwise would have been, the district judge announced: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sentence him as a career offender as a matter of variance, not as a guideline departure, but as a matter of variance. I think that would be excessive. I think it would be unreasonably disparate as to the codefendants.\u201d The court ultimately imposed a sentence of 72 months in prison, followed by 96 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">After the court imposed the sentence, the U.S. Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 782, which effected a two-level reduction in the base offense level for most of the offenses covered by the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). After Amendment 782 was made retroactive, Alvarez moved, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce his sentence. He argued that Amendment 782 reduced his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, and that the reduction meant a lower guidelines range in his case. The district court denied that motion on the ground that Alvarez\u2019s \u201coffense level was determined based on his status as a career offender,\u201d so that his guidelines range in no way depended on his base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guidelines amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (saying essentially the same thing). Amendment 782 amended only the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Thus, unless Alvarez\u2019s sentence was at least partly predicated on that table, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Alvarez\u2019s sentence was not based on the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The district court formally adopted the PSR, which calculated Alvarez\u2019s sentence by applying the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1, instead of the regular drug offender guideline in \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court\u2019s decision to vary from that guideline in imposing the sentence does not mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the court applied some other guideline; that is not what a variance entails. When a sentencing court varies from a range calculated under a guideline, it does so, not by applying a different guideline, but by applying the factors from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to the original guidelines calculation. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, the fact that the district court applied a variance in calculating Alvarez\u2019s sentence does not change the fact that his guidelines range was fixed under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. Amendment 782 thus had no effect on his guidelines range, meaning \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
