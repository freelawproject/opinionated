Hayes argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Hayes at the low end of his guideline range. Hayes profited from forcing two 14-year-old girls to engage in sexual activities to such an extent that one girl required treatment at a hospital. And Hayes controlled the minor victims by threatening to harm them and having them watch him physically abuse his female coconspirator. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 360 months, which is well below the statutory maximum of imprisonment for life, addressed the need \u201cto protect the public\u201d and to \u201cdeter future criminal history\u201d and accounted for Hayes\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Hayes argues that there is an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and the lesser term given to a coconspirator, Manuel Walcott, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), but as the district court stated, the two men were not \u201con the same playing field ... with regard to the nature and circumstances of their offenses.\u201d <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009). Hayes was the leader of the conspiracy, mistreated the minor victims, and amassed substantial criminal history points for crimes involving firearms and crimes of violence, and was not similarly situated to Walcott, who had been apprehended during a sting operation and had a lower criminal history category. Hayes\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">We AFFIRM Hayes\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
