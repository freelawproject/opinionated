Barchard argues the district court erred in affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) determination that she can perform work in the national economy with very little, if any, vocational adjustments. However, we hold that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">After the Commissioner denied Barch-ard\u2019s application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits, Barchard requested and received a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ found that, \u201cconsidering [Barchard\u2019s] age, education and transferable work skills,\u201d she is \u201cnot disabled.\u201d Barchard appealed. The Appeals Council remanded the case, asserting the ALJ did not adequately address the transferability of Barchard\u2019s vocational skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">On remand, a vocational expert (VE) testified that Barchard can work as an \u201cinformation clerk\u201d without any vocational adjustments. The VE based this conclusion on his specific finding that Barchard acquired skills in her past employment that are transferable to an information clerk. Furthermore, the VE stated that 1,100 information clerk positions exist in Barchard\u2019s local area, 7,300 exist statewide, and 97,000 exist nationally. The VE provided this testimony in response to a hypothetical question about the ability of a person who has all Barchard\u2019s impairments to perform work. In reaching his findings, the VE relied on his expertise in the field of vocational capacity, Barchard\u2019s testimony regarding her impairments and prior work experience, a review of the administrative record, and the applicable regulatory definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The ALJ again ruled that Barchard is \u201cnot disabled,\u201d finding, <em>inter alia, </em>she can perform work in .the national economy with very little, if any, vocational adjustments. The ALJ stated that he relied on the VE\u2019s testimony in reaching this conclusion. Barchard then requested review of the decision by the district court. The district court affirmed. On appeal, Barchard solely challenges the district court\u2019s determination that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s ruling on her ability to perform work.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s decision on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we must defer to the decision \u201ceven if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam) (internal quotation mark omitted). Nevertheless, this Court will not affirm \u201csimply because some rationale might have supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Win-schel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ must \u201cstate with at least some measure of clarity the grounds for his decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">An ALJ may rely on the testimony of a VE when determining whether a claimant is able to engage in work in the national economy. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1230 (11th Cir.1999); <em>McSwain v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 617, 619-20 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (holding substantial evidence supported ALJ finding regarding claimant\u2019s ability to work where a VE considered all of claimant\u2019s impairments and testified that claimant had transferable skills which allowed him to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>work). At the same time, \u201c[i]n order for a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question [to the YE] that accounts for all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In considering a claim for Social Security disability benefits, an ALJ must determine whether the claimant is able to perform work that exists in the national economy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 404.1560(c)(2). \u201c[W]ork exists in the national economy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region where [the claimant] live[s] or .in several other regions of the country.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(a). When the claimant is age 60 or older and her impairments limit her to light work, only jobs requiring \u201cvery little, if any, vocational adjustment in terms of tools, work processes, work settings, or the industry\u201d may be considered. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1568(d)(4), 416.968(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Barchard claims the ALJ erred in ruling she is able to perform work that complies with this standard. However, in response to a hypothetical question comprising all Barchard\u2019s impairments, the VE testified that Barchard has the ability to work as an information clerk and does not require vocational adjustments to perform the duties of the position; Barchard\u2019s relevant medical records and her own description of her past work experience supported the VE\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Barchard does not dispute that a significant number of infor- \u25a0 mation clerk jobs exist in the national economy. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Barchard can perform work in the national economy with very little, if any, vocational adjustments is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See McSwain, </em>814 F.2d at 619-20,</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. An ALJ engages in a five-step process to determine whether a claimant is entitled to social security benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The fifth step requires an analysis of the claimant\u2019s ability to perform work that exists in the national economy. The first four steps are not at issue here. Therefore, our discussion is limited to the fifth step.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-21\">. On appeal, Barchard argues that she is incapable of working as an information clerk because the position requires a greater \"reasoning level\u201d than her previous employment. However, this argument was never made below. \"As a general principle, this court will not address an argument that has not been raised in the district court.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>26 F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir.1994). While exceptions to this rule exist, none apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
