Sanford, Texas prisoner #0492400, filed a civil rights complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, .alleging that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. He further alleged that Officer Clark violated his constitutional rights by using excessive force. Sanford timely appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>A district court shall dismiss a prisoner\u2019s in forma pauperis civil rights complaint if the court determines that the action fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). \u201cA dismissal of a civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>using the same standard applicable to dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013). A complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when it does not contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Before this court, Sanford does not brief any claim against the Tarrant County Sheriffs Department. He does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the Tarrant County Sheriffs Department is not an entity capable of being sued. Even if we liberally construed Sanford\u2019s complaint to allege a claim against Tarrant County, Texas, Sanford does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that a governmental entity cannot be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employees under a theory of respondeat superior. Further, Sanford does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to allege that Tarrant County had executed a custom or policy that deprived Sanford of a constitutional right, Sanford has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s decision dismissing his action against the Tarrant County Sheriffs Department for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">A review of Sanford\u2019s medical records does not demonstrate deliberate indifference on the part of John Peter Smith Hospital. As noted at the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing, there is no evidence in the medical records that Sanford suffered a concussion. At most, Sanford\u2019s complaint that he received only ibuprofen for pain amounts to a mere disagreement with medical treatment, which does not constitute a constitutional violation. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 107, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>see also Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). Sanford has failed to show that any employee of John Peter Smith Hospital ignored his complaints, refused treatment, \u201cor engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Treen, 759 </em>F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing his action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">As to Sanford\u2019s excessive force claim, there is no indication that Officer Clark maliciously and sadistically used force to cause Sanford harm. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Sanford\u2019s claim does not show that, under the circumstances, the officer used more force than was reasonably necessary to secure Sanford and maintain order. <em>See id. </em>at <em>6-7. </em>Further, the record belies Sanford\u2019s assertion that the defendants\u2019 attorney admitted at the <em>Spears </em>hearing to tampering with evidence that would have supported Sanford\u2019s excessive force claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The district court did not err in dismissing Sanford\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l); <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Additionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sanford\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>335 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987). Sanford\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel on appeal and entry of default judgment are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
