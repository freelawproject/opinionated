Cobb, federal prisoner # 60806-080, seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on Amendments 782 and 788 to the Sentencing Guidelines. By moving to proceed IFP, Cobb is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that Ms appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>First, Cobb challenges several factual statements made by the district court in giving reasons for denying the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The factual statements made, by the district court are grounded in facts recited in the presentence report. Cobb\u2019s challenges to the facts used to determine his original sentence are unavailing insofar as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not the appropriate vehicle to raise issues related to the original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Second, Cobb contends, the district court\u2019s denial of relief indicates that it was blind to the amendments\u2019 purpose of reducing the overpopulation of the federal prison system. However, in denying relief, the district court referenced the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its order reflects that it gave due consideration to Cobb\u2019s motion as a whole. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant Cobb a reduction in his sentence. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011); <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Cobb has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
