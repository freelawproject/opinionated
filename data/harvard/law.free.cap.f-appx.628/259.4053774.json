Monjaras-Pichar-do argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without determining whether he was individually responsible for 270 kilograms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of heroin. He argues that the entire conspiracy was responsible for 270 kilograms of heroin and that he should be sentenced only on the portion for which he was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">By moving to proceed IFP, Monjaras-Pichardo is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a sentence if the defendant is sentenced to a prison term based upon a sentencing range that subsequently is lowered by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Amendment 782 did not reduce Monjar-as-Pichardo\u2019s guidelines sentencing range, and, thus, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2) <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n. 1(A)); <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>632 F.3d 906, 910-11 (5th Cir.2011). Monjaras-Pi-chardo\u2019s arguments challenging the amount of heroin for which he was held responsible at sentencing are without merit. Motions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) may not be used to challenge the correctness of the sentence as it was originally imposed. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Monjaras-Pichardo fails to demonstrate a nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
