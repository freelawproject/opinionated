He contends that the district court erred in applying the crime-of-violence (COV) enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his 2006 conviction for infliction of corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant under California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5(a). He acknowledges that we have held that an offense under \u00a7 273.5(a) categorically qualifies as a COV under \u00a7 2L1.2 in <em>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d 274, 276 (5th Cir.2010), and <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>371 Fed.Appx. 550, 551 (5th Cir. 2010), but he argues that these cases were overruled by <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and that we ignored a conflicting Ninth Circuit case, <em>Morales-Garcia v. Holder, </em>567 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Iraheta argues that <em>Descamps </em>precludes application of the modified categorical approach, but he does not explain why the modified categorical approach would need to be applied, when we have already held that the statute, by its very terms, is a categorical COV because the use of physical force against the person of another is an element of the statute. <em>See Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d at 276. The decision in <em>Morales-Garcia, </em>567 F.3d at 1064-67, was based on the law pertaining to crimes of moral turpitude in the immigration context and is irrelevant to the determination whether the statute is a COV under the use of force prong rather than the enumerated offense prong in \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In reviewing a challenge to a COV enhancement that was preserved in the district court, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Chacon, </em>742 F.3d 219, 220 (5th Cir. 2014). <em>\u201cA </em>factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>609 F.3d 699, 708 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">We have held that an offense under \u00a7 273.5(a) categorically qualifies as a COV under \u00a7 2L1.2 because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. <em>Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d at 276, We cited with approval our prior unpublished opinion in Gutierrez and the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Laurico-Yeno, </em>590 F.3d 818 (9th Cir.2010), which rejected the argument that a conviction under \u00a7 273.5(a) does not qualify as a COV because it could have been committed merely by minimal, non-violent touchings. <em>See Laurico-Yeno, </em>590 F.3d at 821-22; <em>Gutierrez, </em>371 Fed.Appx. at 551. The cases interpreting the statute have held that a defendant can be convicted of \u00a7 273.5 only if he intentionally uses direct physical force against the person of another resulting in a traumatic condition. <em>See Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d at 276; <em>Laurico-Yeno, </em>590 F.3d at 821-23; <em>Banuelos-Ayon v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 1080, 1083-85 (9th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Ayalar-Nicanor, </em>659 F.3d 744, 749-52 (9th Cir. 2011). \u201cThe critical aspect of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 16(a) is that a crime of violence is one involving the \u2018use ... of physical force against the person or property of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 9, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). Iraheta\u2019s argument that \u00a7 273.5 is a simple battery and not in the category of a violent crime as defined in <em>Leocal </em>has also been rejected by the previously cited authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">None of Iraheta\u2019s arguments shows that our decision in <em>Cruz-Rodriguez </em>has been overruled by the Supreme Court or this Circuit en banc. <em>See United States v. Segura, </em>747 F.3d 323, 328 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance. Summary affirmance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>not appropriate, and the Government\u2019s motion is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found, for Relief and Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is also DENIED, as Iraheta is not entitled to relief and further briefing is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
