No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIf the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, this Court must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, re-weigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">A person who applies for SSI benefits must first prove that he is disabled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(l)-(2). The claimant bears the burden of proving his disability and must produce evidence supporting his claim. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The ALJ applied correctly the five-step evaluation process set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a) and determined that Stultz \u25a0was not disabled for purposes of demonstrating SSI eligibility. The ALJ first determined that Stultz had engaged in no substantial gainful activity since his application date and that Stultz had a severe impairment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ then concluded that, even though Stultz could no longer perform his past relevant work as a painter and welder, Stultz had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform a full range of light work. Given Stultz\u2019s age (43), high school education, and ability to perform a full range of light work, the ALJ concluded that the medical-vocational guidelines mandated a finding of \u201cnot disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">On appeal, Stultz argues that the ALJ erred by failing to give adequate weight to the opinions of two of his treating physicians, Drs. Vinas and Johnson, and to Nurse Branoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Absent \u201cgood cause\u201d to the contrary, the ALJ must give substantial weight to the opinion, diagnosis, and medical evidence of a treating physician. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159. Good cause may exist under these circumstances: (1) the treating phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>sician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) the treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ must articulate clearly reasons for giving less weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In his June 2010 progress notes, Dr. Vinas (Stultz\u2019s neurosurgeon) opined that Stultz had symptoms of severe post-concussion syndrome and was \u201ccurrently unable to work.\u201d The ALJ concluded that Dr. Vinas\u2019s opinion was unsupported by Dr. Vinas\u2019s own medical examination and that Dr. Vinas\u2019s progress notes from October 2010 contained no similar diagnosis or restriction on Stultz\u2019s ability to work. The ALJ\u2019s reasoning is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Dr. Vinas\u2019s progress notes show that \u2014 although Stultz had a chronic, non-healing head wound\u2014 Stultz had no functional limitations, had normal physical and neurological findings, and reported no headaches or difficulty walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In November 2011, Dr. Johnson (a primary-care physician) wrote a letter opining that Stultz was unable to return to work. The ALJ afforded Dr. Johnson\u2019s letter no weight for two reasons: (1) Dr. Johnson\u2019s progress note included only benign findings; and (2) Dr. Johnson\u2019s letter was based only on Stultz\u2019s subjective complaints, which were inconsistent with the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The ALJ\u2019s reasons are supported by substantial evidence. Dr. Johnson\u2019s only progress note \u2014 dated May 2011 \u2014 reports that Stultz experienced chronic pain, but includes no other significant findings or physical limitations. In concluding that Stultz was unable to work, Dr. Johnson relied not on his own medical examination but, instead, appears to have relied on Stultz\u2019s own subjective complaints of pain and dizziness and on Nurse Branoffs \u201cPhysical Medical Source Statement.\u201d While Stultz complained of pain and dizziness during his visits to Dr. Johnson and to Nurse Branoff, no similar complaints were reflected in the treatment notes from the other doctors who treated Stultz regularly after his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">The ALJ articulated sufficiently his reasons for not giving substantial weight to the opinions of Drs. Vinas and Johnson, and these reasons were supported by substantial evidence in the record. Good cause existed to discount Dr. Vinas\u2019s and Dr. Johnson\u2019s opinions. Moreover, determinations about whether a claimant is disabled or unable to work are left to the Commissioner as administrative findings and are not considered \u201cmedical opinions.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">We also see no error in the ALJ\u2019s decision to give limited weight to the opinion of Nurse Branoff. Nurse Branoffs assessment of Stultz\u2019s physical restrictions was unsupported by her own examinations of Stultz or by other evidence in the record. Moreover, a nurse practitioner is not considered an \u201cacceptable medical source\u201d under the Social Security regulations whose opinion is entitled to substantial weight. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.913(a), (d), 416.927(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Stultz argues that the ALJ erred in determining that Stultz\u2019s testimony was not fully credible. Stultz also contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>that the ALJ relied too heavily on the opinions of two non-examining doctors: Dr. Cloninger, a board-certified neurosurgeon, and Dr. Stanley, the state agency reviewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201c[Credibility determinations are the province of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. An ALJ must make explicit credibility findings when subjective pain is an issue. <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir.1995). We will not disturb \u201c[a] clearly articulated credibility finding with substantial supporting evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The ALJ explained adequately his determination that Stultz\u2019s testimony and subjective complaints of pain were not fully credible, and that determination is supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ explained that Stultz\u2019s work history\u2014 which contained almost no earnings since 1991 \u2014 was a factor in evaluating Stultz\u2019s credibility about his inability to maintain gainful employment. Moreover, Stultz\u2019s medical records support the ALJ\u2019s observation that Stultz had been untruthful about his history of alcohol abuse. Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Stultz continued to smoke despite repeated warnings that doing so would impede healing and exacerbate Stultz\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In determining how much weight to give a non-treating doctor\u2019s medical opinion, the ALJ must consider, among other things, these three factors: (1) the extent to which the doctor\u2019s opinion is supported by medical evidence; (2) how consistent the \u201copinion is with the record as a whole\u201d; and (3) the doctor\u2019s medical specialty. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The ALJ\u2019s decision to afford substantial weight to Dr. Cloninger\u2019s opinion testimony and to Dr. Stanley\u2019s RFC determination was supported by substantial evi- \u2019 dence. Both doctors\u2019 assessments of Stultz\u2019s RFC were based on a review of Stultz\u2019s medical records, which showed normal neurological and physical findings and no severe cognitive impairment. In making their determinations, both doctors considered expressly the complications associated with Stultz\u2019s non-healing head wound. Although neither Dr. Cloninger nor Dr. Stanley reviewed Stultz\u2019s most recent medical records, nothing in those records was inconsistent with doctors\u2019 determinations about Stultz\u2019s RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s denial of SSI benefits; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\">.We note that Stultz failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and that, under this Court\u2019s current rules, such a failure can constitute a waiver of the right to appeal the district court\u2019s order based on unobjected-to factual or legal conclusions. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 3-1. In this case, however, the magistrate judge arguably provided no clear notice to Stultz that a failure to file objections would waive <em>entirely </em>his right to appeal the district court\u2019s decision. The magistrate judge said only that \u2018\u2018[fjailure to file timely objections waives a party's right to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d Because of this questionable warning, we do not apply Rule 3-1's waiver rule in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-14\">.
