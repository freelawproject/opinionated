He challenges the sixteen-level enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), which was based on his Texas conviction for posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>sion with intent to deliver more than 200 grams but less than 400 grams of cocaine. He argues that this conviction does not qualify as a drug trafficking offense because Texas\u2019s definition of delivery, which includes administering, is broader than the definition of a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. For the same reasons, he contends that the Texas offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">His arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). In that case, we held that there is no realistic probability that Texas would prosecute the crime under an \u201cadministering\u201d theory in a way that does not also constitute either \u201cdispensing\u201d or \u201cdistributing\u201d under the federal sentencing guidelines. We noted that \u201c[e]ven without considering the drug type or quantity, conviction under the administer prong is not a realistic probability because no previous Texas case has involved a conviction under this prong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. The Texas offense of possession with intent to deliver cocaine is therefore a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines and an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See id. </em>at 461-62 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
