The charge arose from the seizure of a pistol from Hampton\u2019s pants pocket by law enforcement officers who effected a traffic stop of a vehicle in which Hampton had been a back seat passenger. Hampton moved to suppress the firearm and, after a suppression hearing, the district court denied the motion. Hampton was convicted by a jury after a two-day trial. The district court imposed a sentence of 300 months incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Upon this timely appeal, Hampton challenges both his conviction and his sentence. First, he contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress, insisting that the officer violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures when he ordered Hampton to get out of the vehicle. Second, he contends that the district court erred in calculating his advisory sentencing guidelines range in three ways: (1) by applying a six-level enhancement to his base offense level pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) (dealing with assault on a law enforcement officer); (2) by applying a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (dealing with possession of a firearm in connection with a felony offense); and (3) by impermissibly \u201cdouble counting\u201d the two objected-to enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) and 2K2.1(b)(6). For the reasons set forth below, we reject all of Hampton\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">On July 9, 2007, Hampton was the backseat passenger in a red Honda automobile. Deputy Sheriff Gerald Atkinson of Richland County, South Carolina effected a traffic stop of the Honda for a broken tail light after following and observing the vehicle for a short distance. Two other deputies who were in the area, Deputies Warren Cavanagh and Joseph Andaloro, arrived as back-up. Atkinson approached the car, obtained the operator\u2019s license and registration, and returned to his vehicle. During this time, the other deputies noticed that the backseat passenger, Hampton, was sweating profusely, moving around, and exhibiting signs of nervousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">Having learned that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for the driver of the Honda, Atkinson returned to the vehicle and placed the driver under arrest. At about the same time, one of the deputies ordered Hampton to exit the vehicle. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>he climbed out, and after a brief verbal exchange with one of the deputies, Hampton shoved Cavanagh in the chest and fled from the scene. The deputies chased Hampton, and Cavanagh was the first to catch up to him. Hampton struggled and was able to throw Cavanagh off of him. Atkinson then tackled Hampton and held him to the ground. At this point, Hampton was face down on the ground with Atkinson on top of him. Atkinson provided several instructions to Hampton to put his hands behind his back, but Hampton continued to struggle and to make multiple attempts to retrieve something from his pocket. Atkinson then used his taser on Hampton in an effort to subdue him. After using the taser, Atkinson was able to place one of Hampton\u2019s hands in the handcuffs, but while he did so, Hampton was able to work his other hand underneath his chest. At that point, Atkinson again used the taser on Hampton. Atkinson was then able to fully handcuff Hampton and pat him down. The search revealed a fully loaded Taurus .38 caliber revolver in Hampton\u2019s back pants pocket, a bag containing marijuana, and digital scales. In the course of his attempts to control Hampton, Deputy Atkinson injured his rotator cuff and the ligament in his shoulder, which required medical attention and six weeks of physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Hampton was indicted in one count for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. He filed a pretrial motion to suppress. After an evidentiary hearing, at which limited video and audio recordings of the encounter at the traffic stop were presented, the district court found that, under <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), the deputies permissibly ordered Hampton to step out of the Honda. Furthermore, the district court found, albeit only implicitly, that when Hampton shoved Deputy Cavanagh, there arose probable cause for Hampton\u2019s arrest. Therefore, the firearm was constitutionally seized, and the court denied the motion to suppress. Hampton proceeded to trial before a jury and was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">At the sentencing hearing, the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) revealed that Hampton\u2019s record of prior convictions exposed him to sentencing as an armed career criminal and a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration for 180 months and a maximum of life. Under the advisory sentencing guidelines, Hampton\u2019s base offense level was determined to be 24. He received a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because the firearm he possessed was stolen. Over Hampton\u2019s timely objection, the district court adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendation and applied a six-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l), finding that Hampton had created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury while assaulting a law enforcement officer. Similarly, the district court applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for possessing the firearm in connection with another felony, namely, assaulting a police officer while resisting arrest. Thus, Hampton\u2019s final offense level was 36. As Hampton\u2019s criminal history category was VI, this resulted in an advisory sentencing guidelines range of 324 to 405 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">In addition to his objections to the six- and four-level enhancements, Hampton also timely and separately objected to the application of <em>both </em>enhancements, contending that the combined ten-level enhancement constituted impermissible double counting. The district court overruled all of the objections. Hampton then sought a variance sentence, which the court grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ed, at least in part, because of the conceded overlap of the enhancements. The court sentenced Hampton to 300 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We first consider the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress. Our standard of review is well known:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8x\">In assessing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we review factual findings for clear error and legal determinations <em>de novo. </em>When a motion to suppress has been denied in the court below, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apk\"><em>United States v. Green, </em>599 F.3d 360, 375 (4th Cir.2010), cert. denied \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 271, 178 L.Ed.2d 179 (2010) and <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 340, 178 L.Ed.2d 221 (2010) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Hampton does not contest the legality of the vehicle stop. He argues only that the deputies did not have reason to order him out of the car or chase him upon his flight. He contends that the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), is misplaced because <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), overruled <em>Wilson </em>to the extent <em>Wilson </em>permitted an officer to order a passenger to exit a vehicle. This is not correct, as we have already held.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\"><em>Wilson </em>established that an officer making a traffic stop may order passengers to get out of the car pending completion of the stop. <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. at 415, 117 S.Ct. 882. The officers may do so as a precautionary measure, without reasonable suspicion that the passenger poses a safety risk. <em>Id. </em>at 414-415, 117 S.Ct. 882. The <em>Wilson </em>Court reasoned that the danger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver in a stopped vehicle and the additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">Hampton acknowledges that we explicitly rejected his argument that <em>Gant </em>fatally undermined <em>Wilson </em>in <em>United States v. Rumley, </em>588 F.3d 202 (4th Cir.2009). Nevertheless, he asserts the argument simply to preserve the issue. In <em>Rumley, </em>we determined that an officer acted lawfully in ordering a passenger to exit a car absent any suspicion that the passenger had done anything wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 206. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-16\">Long before its holding in <em>Gant </em>or the events giving rise to this appeal, the Supreme Court held that an officer conducting a lawful traffic stop may, as a safety measure, order any passenger to exit the vehicle as a matter of course. <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 414-15 [117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41] (1997); <em>see also United States v. Sakyi, </em>160 F.3d 164, 168 (4th Cir.1998). Nothing in <em>Gant, </em>which limits permissible searches incident to arrest, undermines the bright-line rule established in <em>Wilson.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">Under <em>Rumley </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>Deputy Atkinson\u2019s order to Hampton to exit the vehicle was constitutionally permissible. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, quite apart from the issue of whether reasonable suspicion existed to conduct an immediate frisk of Hampton after he stepped out of the vehicle, when Hampton shoved Deputy Cavanagh in his effort to flee from the deputies, that act provided the deputies probable cause to arrest Hampton for simple assault (and to conduct a search of his person incident thereto). Thus, the district court did not err in denying Hampton\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We now turn to Hampton\u2019s three challenges to his sentence, each based on the district court\u2019s advisory guidelines calculations. When considering the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review factual findings for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">It is undisputed that Hampton qualified as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and therefore faced a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration of 180 months and a maximum sentence of life in prison. Although he does not challenge that aspect of his sentencing, Hampton does contend that the district court erred in its calculation of his advisory guidelines range by applying two enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Hampton\u2019s base offense level was determined to be 24. The two disputed enhancements applied by the district court added a total of 10 offense levels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the court applied a six-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.2(c)(l) for \u201ccreating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury\u201d while assaulting an officer \u201cduring the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom.\u201d Second, the court applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) based on its finding that Hampton possessed the firearm in connection with another felony, namely, assaulting a law enforcement officer while resisting arrest. Hampton argues that it was error to apply either of these two enhancements and, even if either would apply, it was error to apply both, eumulatively. We consider his contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Hampton first argues that the district court erred in applying the six-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) because the evidence before the district court did not establish that he assaulted either of the arresting deputies in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. We reject this contention and conclude that the evidence before the district court was sufficient to support its application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">In considering Hampton\u2019s argument, we look first to the language of the enhancement. Section 3A1.2(c)(1) provides for a six-level enhancement where a defendant \u201cin a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury,\u201d and \u201cknowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement officer, assaulted such officer during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom.\u201d Application note 4(A) to \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) states that the provision applies in circumstances \u201ctantamount to aggravated assault.\u201d Application note 4(B) provides that \u201c \u2018[substantial risk of serious bodily injury\u2019 includes any more serious injury that was risked, <em>as well as actual serious bodily injury\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The Guidelines define \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as \u201cinjury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; <em>or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>In light of these definitions and the largely undisputed facts before the district court at sentencing, the elements justifying application of the enhancement are clearly established. Hampton does not dispute that he knew Atkinson and Cavanagh were law enforcement officers. It is also clear that Atkinson suffered \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d during his struggle to detain and handcuff Hampton after Hampton tried to flee the scene of the traffic stop. Atkinson\u2019s injury to his rotator cuff and ligament in his shoulder required medical attention and six weeks of physical therapy. Under the Guidelines\u2019 definition, this constitutes a \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Of course, the mere fact that Atkinson suffered a serious bodily injury does not alone satisfy the provision; we must also determine whether the district court committed clear error in finding that the evidence established that Hampton \u201cassaulted\u201d Deputy Atkinson in a manner creating a substantial risk of such injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">As the Sentencing Guidelines do not provide a definition of \u201cassault,\u201d we turn to the common meaning of the word for guidance. <em>Cf. United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d 343, 348-49 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cBecause the Sentencing Guidelines do not define the phrase [\u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019], we interpret it by employing the common meaning of the words that the Sentencing Commission used.\u201d). We begin with the dictionary definition of \u201cassault.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Webster\u2019s </em>and <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>lists several definitions of \u201cassault\u201d: a \u201cthreat or use of force\u201d inflicting \u201ca reasonable apprehension\u201d of harm; \u201can attempt to commit battery\u201d; \u201ca battery\u201d; and \u201cany attack.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>130 (9th ed.2009). <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines the term as \u201ca violent physical or verbal attack\u201d; and \u201ca threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact\u201d creating \u201cimmediate danger\u201d or \u201capprehension of such harm.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary </em>(11th ed.2010). These definitions reveal that in common usage, \u201cassault\u201d is synonymous with \u201cattack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">At least one other circuit court of appeals has looked to the common law to define \u201cassault\u201d within the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>199 F.3d 16, 17 (1st Cir.1999) (applying the common law definition of assault to the \u201cOfficial Victim\u201d enhancement we consider in this ease, now located at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l)). It is worth noting that application of the common law meaning of \u201cassault\u201d provides us with the same result we reach by considering its common meaning. At common law, assault consisted of either attempted battery or the \u201cdeliberate infliction upon another of a reasonable fear of physical injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Delis, </em>558 F.3d 177, 180-81 (2d Cir.2009) (citing 3 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>* 120; 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 16.3, at 565-66, 568 (2d ed.2003)). In contrast, common law battery consisted of \u201cthe unlawful application of force to the person of another,\u201d and required no specific intent to commit the act. <em>Id. </em>(citing 2 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16.2, at 552). Over the years, however, battery has come to be defined as a completed assault, and thus an assault is necessarily included in every battery. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[E]ven as a formal matter, a battery has generally been considered to constitute the successful completion of, and therefore necessarily to include, an assault.\u201d) (citing Rollin M. Perkins, <em>Non-Homicide Offenses Against the Person, </em>26 B.U.L.Rev. 119, 119-20 (1946) (\u201cA battery includes an assault.... Hence a defendant may be convicted of assault although the evidence shows also a battery.\u201d); <em>People v. Heise, </em>217 Cal. 671, 20 P.2d 317, 318 (1933) (\u201cBat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tery includes assault; in fact, battery is a consummated assault. Assault is, therefore, necessarily included in battery.\u201d); <em>State v. Hefner, </em>199 N.C. 778, 155 S.E. 879, 880-81 (1930) (discussing a statute criminalizing \u201cassault! ] ... inflicting] serious injury not resulting in death\u201d and noting that, although \u201c[a]n assault is an offer or attempt by force or violence to do injury!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 every battery includes an assault [and] an assault inflicting serious injury necessarily implies a battery\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Consonant with this historical development, several states, as well as the drafters of the Model Penal Code, have merged the two offenses. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law, \u00a7 3 \u2014 201(b) (\u201c \u2018Assault\u2019 means the crimes of assault, battery, and assault and battery, which retain their judicially determined meanings.\u201d); Arizona Rev. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 13-1203(A) (\u201cA person commits assault by: 1. Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing any physical injury to another person; or 2. Intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury; or 3. Knowingly touching another person with the intent to injure, insult or provoke such person.\u201d); Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1 (\u201c... A person is guilty of assault if he: (a) attempts to cause or purposely, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another----\u201d). The effect of these changes is that the two crimes have become nearly synonymous. <em>See Delis, </em>558 F.3d at 181 (noting that the terms assault and battery are often used interchangeably) (citing 2 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16.1, at 551 (\u201c[T]he word \u2018assault\u2019 is sometimes used loosely to include a battery. ...\u201d); Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at 119-20 &amp; n. 1 (\u201cIt is not uncommon to detail the facts constituting a battery in speaking of an assault....\u201d)). Considering both this history and the common meaning of the word, we readily conclude that battery of a law enforcement officer was intended to and in fact does satisfy U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l)\u2019s assault requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The district court, expressly adopting the analysis of the probation officer contained in the PSR, concluded that Hampton assaulted Atkinson wh.en Hampton struggled with the deputy while at the same time attempted to retrieve the firearm from his pocket and use it in a manner to cause serious bodily injury. The district court also concluded that Atkinson injured his shoulder and rotator cuff while attempting to apprehend and secure Hampton. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar6\">[T]he facts of the situation are such that the defendant obviously intended to struggle with and avoid and resist arrest, and in the course of that he did so in a manner which created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, and in fact there was an injury to the officer as a result of the struggle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">In light of our conclusion that a completed battery satisfies \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l)\u2019s assault requirement and the district court\u2019s findings of fact, it is clear to us that the district court did not err in concluding that Hampton assaulted Atkinson when he struggled with him while resisting arrest. Consequently, because Hampton assaulted Atkinson with knowledge that Atkinson was a law enforcement officer, application of the enhancement is justified, both because (1) Hampton \u201ccreated a substantial risk of serious bodily injury\u201d by his assaultive resistance to arrest and because as a result of the struggle, (2) Atkinson suffered an \u201cactual serious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">On the first ground, we find that the facts of this case established that Hampton created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to Deputy Atkinson. The facts established that Hampton attempted to flee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>shoved away one deputy, and required the second deputy to tackle him to prevent his escape. Once tackled, Hampton struggled and attempted to retrieve his firearm, despite orders from the deputies to place his hands behind his back and stop struggling. Atkinson was then forced to use his taser on Hampton in order to prevent him from reaching into his pocket and to place him in handcuffs. Even after Atkinson used the taser, Hampton continued to struggle, and Atkinson was forced to use the taser a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">While application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b) is often based on actual injury to the officer or a willful attempt by the defendant to inflict serious injury, <em>see United States v. Harrison, </em>272 F.3d 220, 222-223 (4th Cir.2001) (finding conduct that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury where a codefendant fired a gun at the officers); <em>United States v. Sloley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1994) (finding conduct that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury where the defendant engaged in a struggle with the officer, grabbed the officer\u2019s gun from his holster, and raised it towards the officer), courts have also found application of the enhancement proper where direct harm is less likely than it is when the defendant takes actual possession of a firearm; the defendant\u2019s conduct still created a substantial risk of harm, <em>see United States v. Hill, </em>583 F.3d 1075, 1080 (8th Cir.2009) (finding conduct that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury where defendant made multiple attempts to retrieve his loaded weapon during a struggle with law enforcement); <em>United States v. Bowie, </em>198 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C.Cir.1999) (finding that defendant who struggled with arresting officers while attempting to pull a pistol from his waistband assaulted officer in a manner creating risk of serious bodily injury sufficient to support the enhancement); <em>cf. United States v. Easter, </em>553 F.3d 519, 524 (7th Cir.2009) (finding, in the context of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 (\u201cReckless Endangerment During Flight\u201d), that \u201csimply reaching for a loaded gun is enough to create a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to another person\u201d). We find that here, Hampton\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, and conclude that the district court did not err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">As we noted, however, application of the \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(1) enhancement is proper in this case not only because Hampton\u2019s assaultive conduct created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, but also because serious bodily injury actually occurred. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(e)(l), Application Note 4(B). The district court found that there was an injury to Atkinson\u2019s shoulder as a result of his struggle with Hampton. There is no question that the injury, which required medical attention and weeks of attendance at therapy, is sufficiently serious to satisfy the enhancement provision. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 (stating that any injury requiring medical intervention such as physical rehabilitation constitutes a serious bodily injury). We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in determining that Hampton assaulted the officer in such a way that his actions caused an actual serious injury to Deputy Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Hampton next contests the application of the four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Section 2K2.1(b)(6) provides for a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d Hampton argues that he did not assault any of the officers while resisting arrest and thus did not commit a felony for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Although we did not look to South Carolina law to define assault as used in \u00a7 3A1.2(e)(l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we find that the language of the relevant South Carolina statute is sufficiently broad to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hampton committed felonious assault on Deputy Atkinson in the course of the struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In South Carolina, the felony of assaulting an officer while resisting arrest requires that a defendant \u201cassault, beat, or wound an officer when the person is resisting an arrest being made by one whom the person knows or reasonably should know is a law enforcement officer.\u201d Code of Laws of S.C., 1976 Ann. \u00a7 16-9-320. The above analysis, in which we conclude that the district court correctly found that Hampton had committed an assault for purposes of \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l), establishes that Hampton committed a felony assault on a law enforcement officer while resisting arrest under South Carolina law for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The final element of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) requires that the government prove that Hampton used or possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d commission of the felony. While this issue presents a closer call, we conclude that the government has met its burden on this element. We have determined that a weapon is used or possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another offense if the weapon \u201cfacilitates or has a tendency to facilitate the [other] offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001)). In other words, \u201cthe firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the ... crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith v. United States, 508 </em>U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">In <em>Blount, </em>we determined that the government failed to meet its burden by showing only that Blount stole a weapon during the commission of a burglary; however, we noted that the government could have satisfied its burden by showing that the defendant kept the weapon accessible in preparation for any problems that might have arisen during the burglary. <em>Id. </em>Similarly here, the district court found that Hampton had the weapon close at hand and, more importantly, that he made multiple attempts to access it during the course of the assault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given these facts, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s finding that the presence of the firearm facili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tated Hampton as he resisted arrest, and in applying the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>566 F.3d 160, 163 (4th Cir.2009) (stating that this court will not disturb factual determinations based on the specific circumstances of a case unless \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 239 (4th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Finally, we consider whether the district court engaged in impermissible double counting by imposing both the six-level and four-level enhancements discussed above. While Hampton acknowledges that there is a presumption double counting is permissible except where expressly prohibited, he argues that here the presumption is rebutted because both enhancements are based on his \u201calleged creation of a substantial risk of harm by way of an assault upon the arresting officer.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 21. Therefore, he says, the enhancements \u201cserve identical policies, and are not divergent as applied to the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Hampton\u2019s claim is without merit. As he acknowledges, there is a presumption that double counting is proper where not expressly prohibited by the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Schaal, </em>340 F.3d 196, 198 (4th Cir.2003). Hampton admits that there is no express prohibition against double counting here. He claims only that the presumption in favor of double counting is rebutted where the two provisions serve identical policies. The premise for this claim has been explicitly rejected by the Eighth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">[T]he \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 and 3A1.2 enhancements may be applied cumulatively because they are based on distinct aspects of Hill\u2019s conduct. <em>See United States v. Zech, </em>553 F.3d 663, 668 (8th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (approving cumulative application of two enhancements because the guidelines \u201caddress conceptually separate sentencing notions\u201d). The \u00a7 2K2.1 enhancement addresses the connection between a felony and use of a firearm, whereas the \u00a7 3A1.2 adjustment concerns the identity of the victim of Hill\u2019s assaultive conduct. <em>Cf. United States v. Joiner, </em>418 F.3d 863, 870 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that double counting was permissible because official victim adjustment addressed a different consideration from the guideline for obstruction of justice offenses).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-9\"><em>United States v. Hill, </em>583 F.3d 1075, 1081 (8th Cir.2009). As in <em>Hill, </em>each of the enhancements in this case addresses different aspects of Hampton\u2019s conduct: the \u00a7 3A1.2 enhancement addresses his conduct resulting in the injury to a law enforcement officer, and the \u00a7 2K2.1 enhancement addresses his use of a firearm while violently resisting arrest. Consequently, we hold that the district court\u2019s application of cumulative enhancements under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) and \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) is not impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">. The district court applied a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because the firearm Hampton possessed had been stolen. Hampton does not dispute this enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\">. As noted <em>supra </em>in Section III.B., because the Sentencing Guidelines do not provide a definition of assault, we turned to both the common meaning of the word and the common law for guidance. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d 343, 348-49 (4th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>199 F.3d 16, 17 (1st Cir.1999). However, to determine whether Hampton used or possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense,\u201d we must determine whether Hampton's conduct constitutes a felony under either federal, state, or local law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, Application 14(C) (noting that \u201c[a]nother felony offense\u201d means \"any Federal, state, or local offense,\u201d other than the predicate firearms offense, \"regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained\u201d). We choose here to analyze whether Hampton\u2019s conduct constituted felonious assault under South Carolina law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-12\">. We note that Hampton made no argument before the district court that his possession of the firearm was other than \u201cin connection with\u201d the assault on Deputy Atkinson, and he has not made that argument on appeal. Instead, counsel has argued only that Hampton did not commit a violent assault on a. law enforcement officer as he was being placed under arrest, seeming to refer mainly (if not only) to Hampton's shove of Cavanagh as he exited the vehicle and took flight. Thus, because counsel failed to make the argument regarding possession of the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the assault on Deputy Atkinson, the district court made no explicit finding that the firearm was in fact possessed \"in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tion with\u201d that assault. We readily conclude, however, that implicit in the district court\u2019s factual determination that Hampton made repeated attempts to access the weapon during the course of the commission of the felony assault on Atkinson is the conclusion that the weapon had some facilitative purpose and effect with respect to the assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
