On appeal, King challenges his convictions on several grounds. We vacate one of his convictions and the accompanying sentence for being a felon in possession and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">King\u2019s convictions stem from two separate incidents, one occurring in Greenville, North Carolina and the other in Wilmington, North Carolina. We set forth the facts of each incident and then describe the pretrial and trial proceedings that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-18\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-19\">On March 19, 2004, Greenville police officers received information that two African-American men planned to use a gray Ford Explorer to transport a large amount of heroin from the local bus station. The officers initiated surveillance of the station and observed two African-American men drive away from the station in a gray Ford Explorer. The police followed the Explorer to a nearby strip mall, at which the men left the car and entered a laundromat. Shortly thereafter, the men returned with King and, after King placed a green gym bag in the Explorer, the three men drove away together. When the officers stopped and searched the Explorer, they found the green gym bag, which contained 100 dosage units of heroin packaged in ink-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>stamped wax paper. The police arrested King and the other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Two detectives then returned to the laundromat from which King had emerged and spoke with Nina Woods. After learning that Woods shared an apartment with King, the detectives obtained her consent to search that apartment. Within its sole bedroom, they found approximately 426 plastic bags of cocaine and seven dosage units of heroin packaged in the same ink-stamped wax paper as the heroin found in the green gym bag that King had placed in the Explorer. They also found cutting agent, one gram of marijuana packaged in a plastic bag, and a firearm. In the bedroom closet, they found two coffee grinders (which drug traffickers often use to mix drugs and cutting agents), two boxes of bullets, and two more firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The police subsequently interviewed King, and he admitted ownership of the cocaine, heroin, coffee grinders, cutting agent, and firearms. King was charged with various violations of state law, and after agreeing to cooperate with the police, King secured his release on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Nine months later, on December 8, 2004, Shatiek Bilal reported to Wilmington police officers that King had kidnapped and assaulted him. Bilal also told the officers that King rented an apartment at which Bilal was living and that King kept drugs and guns at the apartment and in a separate storage unit. Based on Bilal\u2019s information, the officers obtained a search warrant to the apartment, in which both King and Bilal lived, and to the storage unit, to which only King had access.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">After watching the apartment for approximately four hours, the police saw King enter the apartment with a woman at about 3:30 a.m. on December 9. The officers then executed the search warrant. In a bedroom, in which King was lying near the bed, they found a box containing 5.2 grams of crack cocaine packed in green dime bags, 1.3 grams of heroin, and 14 bags of marijuana. Nearby they found digital scales, a heat sealer, and a handgun. In the same room they also found King\u2019s identification card and state registration card bearing the apartment\u2019s address. In another bedroom, containing Bilal\u2019s personal effects, the officers found one green dime bag of marijuana and a larger clear plastic bag containing similar green bags. The officers found no contraband in the storage unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">When the officers interviewed King, he told the police that he knew nothing about the kidnapping or beating of Bilal, and he denied responsibility for the contraband in the apartment. Nevertheless, King was charged with Bilal\u2019s kidnapping and assault, along with drug trafficking and firearm possession in violation of state law. Neither federal nor state authorities charged Bilal with any crime arising from evidence found in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">A year later, all state charges against King were dismissed when a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging him with six federal crimes. The first three pertain to the Greenville incident: (1) possession with intent to distribute cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count One); (2) possession of three firearms after being convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Two); and (3) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm, during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(i) (Count Three). The remaining three counts allege crimes assertedly committed in Wilmington: (1) possession of crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count Four); (2) possession of a firearm after being convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Five); and (3) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm, during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (Count Six). The Government did not bring any federal charges against King for his alleged assault and kidnapping of Bilal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">From the outset of the Wilmington proceedings, King moved to compel disclosure of all information regarding Bilal and his cooperation with the police. The district court found King\u2019s first pre-trial motion for this evidence moot \u201cbecause the Government already has been engaging in virtual open file document discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Months later, after this Court consolidated the various charges pending against King and assigned the cases to another district judge, King renewed his motion to compel disclosure of all documents regarding Bilal, including Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> King also maintained that the Government had suppressed exculpatory information regarding Bilal\u2019s post-indictment trafficking charges and alleged perjury in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">With respect to the latter information, the Government acknowledged that Bilal had told a New York prosecutor something to the effect of \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to North Carolina. I wasn\u2019t involved in anything down there.\u201d The Government lawyer contended, however, that she had kept King\u2019s prior defense counsel informed of Bilal\u2019s activities in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">As for Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony, the prosecutor admitted that the Government possessed, but had refused to produce, that testimony. The prosecutor maintained that the grand jury testimony contained no exculpatory information. The district court suggested that the Government \u201cmight want to\u201d disclose Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony \u201cout of an abundance of precaution,\u201d but declined to order such disclosure because it \u201c[didn\u2019t] know what\u2019s in the testimony regarding Mr. Bilal and we have to rely on the government\u2019s good faith in these situations.\u201d At no point did the court examine the grand jury transcript or rule on the materiality of the information contained in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">At trial, the police officers testified to the evidence recovered in the Greenville and Wilmington searches, as outlined above. King testified in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">With respect to the Greenville offenses, King admitted that he owned the cocaine and heroin, that he had cut and packaged the cocaine for distribution the night before its seizure, and that, although he knew he was a convicted felon, he owned two of the three firearms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But King denied any link between the firearms and drug distribution, claiming that he had acquired the guns for protection after he had been burglarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">As to the Wilmington charges, King denied responsibility for the drugs and firearms found in the apartment he shared with Bilal; he claimed that Bilal owned all of the contraband. King testified that although he paid rent on the apartment in which the police found him, only Bilal lived there permanently. King further maintained that, on the night in question, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>entered the apartment only to \u201chave relations\u201d with his female companion. Although Bilal had testified before the grand jury, he did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The jury convicted King of all three Greenville crimes (Counts One, Two, and Three) and one of the Wilmington crimes (Count Five). The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts Four and Six on which the jury could not reach agreement. At sentencing, the court applied an eight-level enhancement based on King\u2019s alleged kidnapping of Bilal and then imposed an aggregate sentence of 408 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">On appeal, King challenges two of his convictions growing out of the Greenville search and the sole conviction arising from the Wilmington search.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">With respect to the Greenville offenses, King contends that the charges as to Counts One and Three were duplicitous and that Count Three did not charge him with a crime. He also maintains that the convictions on both counts rested on insufficient evidence. All of these arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">At the outset, we note that King has waived his duplicity challenges because he failed to raise them prior to trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) (requiring defendants to bring a \u201cmotion alleging a defect in the indictment\u201d before trial); <em>United States v. Price, </em>763 F.2d 640, 643 (4th Cir.1985) (finding duplicity challenge waived when brought after trial). Only upon a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d can a defendant avoid waiving a forfeited duplicity claim. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e). King has not even attempted to make such a showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">We must also reject King\u2019s contention that Count Three failed to charge a violation of \u00a7 924(c). Because this argument attacks the sufficiency of the indictment, and not merely its alleged duplicity, King\u2019s failure to raise this argument before trial does not waive it. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). But this failure restricts our review to plain error. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must demonstrate: (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We will then exercise our discretion to reverse only if \u201cthe error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). Moreover, we will construe the indictment \u201cliberally\u201d and indulge \u201cevery intendment ... in support of [its] sufficiency.\u201d <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>961 F.2d 476, 479 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">Section 924(c) mandates that a court increase by five years the sentence of a drug offender \u201cwho, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The statute thus penalizes two separate types of conduct: (1) the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a drug trafficking crime; or (2) the possession of a firearm in furtherance of such a crime. The indictment in this case omitted the statute\u2019s \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 language, alleging only that King used, carried, and possessed a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d drug trafficking. King argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>that this impermissibly relaxed the nexus to trafficking required for conviction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Given the rigorous plain error standard, King cannot prevail. An error qualifies as \u201cplain\u201d only if it contravenes \u201cthe settled law of the Supreme Court or this circuit.\u201d <em>United States v. Reid, </em>523 F.3d 310, 316 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation omitted). King has not pointed to, nor has our research revealed, any binding precedent supporting his claim that the language omitted from the indictment creates plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, our sister circuits disagree on whether an indictment\u2019s mixing of the elements of \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cuse and carry\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d prongs constitutes reversible error. <em>Compare United States v. Combs, </em>369 F.3d 925, 933 (6th Cir.2004) (reversing conviction because the indictment \u201cconfused the elements\u201d of \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s prongs) <em>with United States v. Harvey, </em>484 F.3d 453, 456-57 (7th Cir. 2007) (affirming conviction); <em>United States v. Avery, </em>295 F.3d 1158, 1174-76 (10th Cir.2002) (same). Given the dearth of binding authority, King cannot possibly demonstrate plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Accordingly, King\u2019s challenges to the indictment fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">King additionally maintains that his convictions on Counts One and Three rest on insufficient evidence. In assessing sufficiency of the evidence, we affirm if, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the verdict is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d consists of \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 862). Throughout our review, we \u201cassume that the jury resolved any conflicting evidence in the prosecution\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>570 F.3d 557, 565 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">King argues that we should reverse his conviction on Count One for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, heroin, and marijuana because the jury unreasonably concluded that the evidence established intent to distribute marijuana. He points out that at trial the police officers admitted that the quantity of marijuana found in his Greenville apartment was consistent with personal use and that they found no marijuana packaging material.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">This argument also fails. This is so because of the overwhelming evidence\u2014 including King\u2019s own admissions \u2014 of his intent to distribute illegal narcotics. Indeed, the police seized from King\u2019s bedroom 426 plastic bags of cocaine, seven dosage units of heroin, cutting agent, and three firearms, one of which was found close to the bag of marijuana. After his arrest, King admitted ownership of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>cocaine, heroin, cutting agent, and firearms, and he later testified that he intended to distribute the cocaine. This undisputed evidence of King\u2019s cocaine trafficking \u201ctended to show the existence of a continuing narcotics business and therefore to show [King\u2019s] knowledge of the drug trade.\u201d <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>354 F.3d 305, 312 (4th Cir.2004). From this evidence of King\u2019s participation in the drug trade, the jury could draw an inference that King intended to sell all of the drugs in his possession \u2014 including the marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Rooks, </em>596 F.3d 204, 211 (4th Cir.2010). The presence of the firearm next to the marijuana further supports this inference of distribution. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>912 F.2d 728, 731 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Accordingly, although a small amount of marijuana found alone would not itself justify a finding of distribution, <em>see United States v. Fountain, </em>993 F.2d 1136, 1138-39 (4th Cir.1993), the evidence in this case, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, suffices to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Sufficient evidence similarly supports King\u2019s conviction on Count Three for violation of \u00a7 924(c), use of a firearm in a drug offense. We have made clear that \u201cthere are many factors that might lead a fact finder to conclude that a connection existed between a ... firearm and ... drug trafficking activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002). These include the \u201ctype of weapon,\u201d \u201cthe status of the possession (legitimate or illegal),\u201d and the firearm\u2019s \u201cproximity to drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">All three of these factors support the jury\u2019s verdict on Count Three in this case. First, all of the firearms were handguns and so uniquely suited for drug transactions. <em>See United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 267 n. 7 (4th Cir.2000). Second, King admitted that he knew his prior felony conviction barred him from legally possessing firearms. Third, King stored the firearms in the same room as the drugs, and one gun rested on the headboard of the bed next to the marijuana. Based on this evidence, the jury was entitled to conclude that King possessed the firearms in furtherance of his drug trafficking crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Finally, we turn to King\u2019s challenge to Count Five (possession of a firearm by a convicted felon), the only conviction growing out of the Wilmington search. Throughout this case, King has steadfastly contended that the gun (and other contraband) in the Wilmington apartment belonged not to him, but to Bilal. And King has repeatedly asked the Government to reveal its information about Bilal, which King believes will substantiate his claim. King maintains that the Government\u2019s failure to do so violates <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), which requires a court to vacate a conviction and order a new trial if it finds that the prosecution suppressed materially exculpatory evidence. To secure relief under <em>Brady, </em>a defendant must: (1) identify the existence of evidence favorable to the accused; (2) show that the government suppressed the evidence; and (3) demonstrate that the suppression was material. <em>Monroe v. Angelone, </em>323 F.3d 286, 299 (4th Cir.2003). The burden of proof rests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>with the defendant. <em>See United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 502 (4th Cir.2001). In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of King\u2019s <em>Brady </em>motion, we review its legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Walker v. Kelly, </em>589 F.3d 127, 140 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">King first contends that the prosecution violated <em>Brady </em>by failing to timely disclose Bilal\u2019s arraignment on drug trafficking charges in New York, Bilal\u2019s alleged perjury at his brother\u2019s assault trial, and Bilal\u2019s statement to the New York District Attorney that he \u201cwasn\u2019t involved in anything down [in North Carolina].\u201d King\u2019s assertions on these points fall short of establishing a basis for finding a <em>Brady </em>violation. Even if we were to assume the materiality of this evidence, King fails to demonstrate that the Government suppressed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The prosecutor consistently stated that she kept defense counsel apprised of Bilal\u2019s activities in New York. That King\u2019s <em>trial </em>counsel could not recall receiving this information does not cast doubt on the prosecutor\u2019s representation because, as the prosecutor explained, she informed one of King\u2019s <em>pretrial </em>attorneys, who represented him at the time the information surfaced. We recognize that some information may have failed to reach King\u2019s trial counsel, given that King changed attorneys three times and that his escape from custody forced the court to reschedule the trial. But the Government need only <em>disclose </em>exculpatory evidence, not ensure that the defense further develop and utilize that evidence. <em>See Fullwood v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 663, 686 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The Government, however, does not dispute that it refused to disclose Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony. Indeed, the record is cleai' that the Government specifically rebuffed both King\u2019s written and oral demands that it disclose that testimony and the district court\u2019s suggestion that it do so. The Government explained its refusal to turn over the testimony by observing that it \u201cwould need a court order\u201d to reveal grand jury testimony. Although the district court apparently offered to provide such an order, the court declined to compel disclosure, reasoning that \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the testimony regarding Mr. Bilal and we have to rely on the government\u2019s good faith in these situations.\u201d Here, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Normally, of course, a defendant must specifically prove the materiality of suppressed evidence, demonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (internal quotation omitted). This materiality requirement ensures that <em>\u201cBrady </em>obligations do not become unduly burdensome\u201d and guards against the conversion of <em>Brady </em>rights into a \u201cfull-scale, constitutionally-mandated discovery right for criminal defendants.\u201d <em>Monroe, </em>323 F.3d at 316 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">But a defendant cannot demonstrate that suppressed evidence would have changed the trial\u2019s outcome if the Government prevents him from ever seeing that evidence. This problem only rarely plagues <em>Brady </em>cases, which typically involve a defendant\u2019s post-trial discovery of evidence that the government has assertedly suppressed. <em>See United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (noting that <em>Brady </em>violations usually involve \u201cthe discovery, after trial of information which had been known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>to the prosecution but unknown to the defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In a few atypical cases, however, \u201cit is impossible to say whether\u201d requested information \u201cmay be relevant to [a] claim of innocence.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 57, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). In those cases, in which \u201can accused cannot possibly know, but may only suspect, that particular information exists which meets [the <em>Brady </em>] requirements, he is not required ... to make a particular showing of the exact information sought and how it is material and favorable.\u201d <em>Love v. Johnson, </em>57 F.3d 1305, 1313 (4th Cir.1995). In such circumstances, a defendant need only \u201cmake some plausible showing\u201d that exculpatory material exists. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 58 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 989; <em>Love, </em>57 F.3d at 1313. Once he has done so, he becomes \u201centitled ... to have the information\u201d \u2014 not immediately disclosed to him \u2014 but \u201csubmitted to the trial court for <em>in camera </em>inspection\u201d to determine if in fact the information is <em>Brady </em>material subject to disclosure. <em>Love, </em>57 F.3d at 1313; <em>see also Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 58, 107 S.Ct. 989. In making the requisite \u201cplausible showing\u201d of the existence of exculpatory information, a defendant must \u201cidentify the requested confidential material with some degree of specificity.\u201d <em>United States v. Trevino, </em>89 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In this case, the Government deprived King of any access to the grand jury testimony and so prevented him from specifically proving its materiality. King, however, made the required \u201cplausible showing\u201d of possible exculpatory information by identifying the grand jury transcript of one particular witness \u2014 an identification more specific than that which the Supreme Court or we have previously held sufficient to trigger such an <em>in camera </em>inspection. <em>See Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. at 60-61, 107 S.Ct. 989 (finding that defendant became entitled to an <em>in camera </em>examination of all of a victim\u2019s records with Pennsylvania\u2019s Children and Youth Services agency); <em>Love, </em>57 F.3d at 1307 (granting <em>in camera </em>examination in response to request for \u201calleged victim\u2019s entire file maintained by the Wake County Department of Social Services\u201d). The Government certainly could have granted King\u2019s request for this one particular document pertaining to one grand jury witness without embarking on a \u201cgroundless fishing expedition[ ].\u201d <em>Trevino, </em>89 F.3d at 192 (quoting <em>United States v. Zolin, </em>491 U.S. 554, 571, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> King thus identified the information sought with sufficient particularity so as to trigger his right to an <em>in camera </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Of course, Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony may contain nothing helpful to King. And we are mindful that, as a general matter, evidence that merely impeaches those who do not testify lacks relevance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>much less materiality. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 197 (4th Cir. 1997). King, however, has demonstrated that Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony <em>could </em>contain materially favorable evidence. Even though Bilal never testified, he figured prominently in King\u2019s trial. King\u2019s entire defense to the Wilmington charges turned on persuading the jury that the seized contraband belonged to Bilal. To that end, King testified extensively that Bilal set him up, and defense counsel focused on Bilal\u2019s relationship to the Wilmington contraband in both her opening and closing statements. Moreover, it is undisputed that Bilal and King shared the Wilmington apartment and that the police relied heavily on Bilal\u2019s statements in determining that the seized contraband belonged to King and not Bilal. Given Bilal\u2019s pivotal role in the trial, the district court recognized that \u201cthe history of Bilal\u2019s relationship with Mr. King here is relevant because it would cast a question on ... whose drugs were in the apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Accordingly, although the jury disbelieved King\u2019s story about Bilal, it remains plausible that Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony contained information that might have affected that disbelief. Indeed, information pertaining to Bilal\u2019s history with King and thus his possible motive to ensure King\u2019s arrest, evidence of Bilal\u2019s firearm ownership, or statements illuminating the tenancy arrangement at the Wilmington apartment all could have provided King important ammunition for his defense. If Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony were to contain revelations regarding any such pivotal subject, it could \u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 290, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (quoting <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In addition, King has made a plausible showing that Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony contained evidence material to his sentence. <em>See Basden v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 602, 611 (4th Cir.2002) (noting that <em>Brady </em>applies to evidence material to sentencing). The district court, over King\u2019s objection, applied an eight-level enhancement premised on King\u2019s alleged kidnapping of Bilal. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1, 2A4.1. In applying the enhancement, the court expressly credited Bilal\u2019s statements regarding the kidnapping. Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony may have contained evidence that would have materially undermined the plausibility of Bilal\u2019s account and thus significantly reduced King\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">We therefore vacate Bang\u2019s conviction and sentence with respect to Count Five and remand for the district court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>inspection of Bilal\u2019s grand jury testimony. <em>Love, </em>57 F.3d at 1316. After examining the grand jury transcript, the district court should rule on the materiality and favorability to King of any evidence contained therein, taking any \u201cremedial or other action as is required by its determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">. Twenty months elapsed after King's indictment prior to trial because King escaped from custody once and changed counsel three times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-15\">. Although King told police when he was arrested that he owned all three firearms, he testified at trial that he only owned two of them but \u201ctook responsibility for\u201d the third.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. In the course of rejecting a challenge to jury instructions, we remarked in an unpublished opinion that \u00a7 924(c) \"creates distinct 'use and carry' and 'possession' offenses\" and so if a defendant is \"indicted for one \u00a7 924(c) offense but convicted of the other, this would of course mandate reversal under our precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Woods, </em>271 Fed.Appx. 338, 343 (4th Cir.2008). Because <em>Woods </em>dealt with the mismatch between a jury instruction and an admittedly sufficient indictment, we had no opportunity to assess the sufficiency of an indictment that intermixes \u00a7 924(c)'s elements. Moreover, this unpublished non-precedential opinion can establish no basis for a finding of plain error. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>595 F.3d 197, 199 n. 1 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">. We also note that the police found no paraphernalia or other evidence indicative of personal marijuana use in King's apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">. In <em>Trevino, </em>we recognized and followed <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Love </em>but found presentence reports \u201centitled to a greater degree of protection from examination and disclosure\u201d because, in contrast to <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Love, </em>no statute authorized their disclosure \"to third parties by court order.\u201d <em>Trevino, </em>89 F.3d at 191. The Government does not contend that <em>Trevino </em>exempts Bilal's grand jury testimony from <em>in camera </em>examination. Nor could it, for unlike the records at issue in <em>Trevino, </em>but like those in <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Love, </em>grand jury transcripts are subject to a statute providing for their <em>in camera </em>inspection and disclosure. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b). Thus, judges have long enjoyed wide discretion to inspect grand jury testimony \u201cwhere a particular need is shown,\u201d <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>364 F.2d 598, 600 (4th Cir. 1966), in part because the <em>in camera </em>procedure effectively safeguards the government\u2019s interest in the preservation of grand jury secrecy. <em>See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>884 F.2d 124, 126 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
