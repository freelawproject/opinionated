The district court found him to be a career offender under the United States Sentencing Guidelines and so enhanced his sentence, imposing a 140-month term of imprisonment. Hood appeals, challenging only the sentence enhancement. He contends that a prior North Carolina conviction for possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction does not constitute a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d justifying a sentence as a career criminal under the Guidelines. We agree with the district court that this offense does constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The Guidelines provide that a court should enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence as a career offender if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-16\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-17\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-19\">Hood concedes that he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the instant offense, as required by \u00a7 4B.1(1), and that the instant felony offense is a controlled substance offense, as required by \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(2). He further concedes that a prior conviction for felony robbery constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. Therefore, the sole question before us is whether the other prior conviction on which the Government relies \u2014 a 1996 North Carolina conviction for felony possession of \u201ca weapon of mass death and destruction,\u201d namely a sawed-off shotgun<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014also constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d so as to provide the Government with the second predicate conviction necessary for a sentence as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-20\">The Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-21\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-22\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-23\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Because \u00a7 4B1.2(a) does not expressly enumerate felony possession of a sawed-off shotgun, it constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d only if it falls under the \u201cresidual\u201d or \u201cotherwise\u201d clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Thus, to qualify, it must \u201cotherwise involve! ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In 2001, we considered this very question and held that possession of a sawed-off shotgun qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the residual clause of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330 (4th Cir.2001). In <em>Johnson, </em>however, our inquiry focused solely on whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. Because we found it did, we held that possession of a sawed-off shotgun constituted a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See id. </em>at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Hood acknowledges our holding in <em>Johnson, </em>but contends that <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), requires that we overrule <em>Johnson. </em>In <em>Begay, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a DUI conviction qualifies as a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of a sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2006), <em>not </em>a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. We have held, however, that because \u201csubstantially similar\u201d language defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA and a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines, the <em>Begay </em>\u201canalysis is applicable to \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Seay, </em>553 F.3d 732, 738-39 (4th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Rivers, </em>595 F.3d 558, 560 n. 1 (4th Cir.2010). Moreover, \u201c[bjecause we are now bound to apply the <em>Begay </em>framework,\u201d we have noted that the analysis we employed in cases like <em>Johnson </em>\u201cis no longer controlling.\u201d <em>United States v. Roseboro, </em>551 F.3d 226, 234 (4th Cir.2009) <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rivers, </em>595 F.3d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\"><em>Begay </em>instructs that when, as here, a predicate offense is not one of the listed crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and use of explosives), evaluation of the risk of physical injury presented by the predicate offense constitutes only the first step of the proper inquiry. 553 U.S. at 142, 128 S.Ct. 1581. A court must also determine whether the asserted predicate offense \u201cinvolve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Thus, we must determine whether, in light of <em>Begay, </em>Hood\u2019s prior conviction for felony possession of a sawed-off shotgun constitutes a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Hood maintains that the two-step analysis established in <em>Begay </em>requires us to find that the challenged predicate does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. He does not argue that possession of a sawed-off shotgun fails the first <em>Begay </em>prong, i.e., he does not dispute that it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10-11. Hood does argue, however, that possession of a sawed-off shotgun fails the second prong of the <em>Be-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>gay </em>analysis because it is not similar in kind or degree of risk present in the Guidelines\u2019 enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In support of this contention, Hood heavily relies on our unpublished opinion in <em>United States v. Haste, </em>292 Fed.Appx. 249 (4th Cir.2008), in which we applied <em>Begay </em>to hold that possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of the same North Carolina statute did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. As an unpublished opinion, <em>Haste </em>of course provides no precedential authority. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 392 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\u201d). However, even if <em>Haste </em>constituted binding precedent, we would not find <em>Haste, </em>which interpreted ACCA, controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">This is so because of a fundamental difference between ACCA and the Guidelines with respect to their treatment of sawed-off shotguns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While in ACCA, Congress provided no guidance through relevant history or commentary as to whether a sawed-off shotgun constituted a predicate \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the Sentencing Commission has expressly addressed the question of whether a sawed-off shotgun constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The commentary accompanying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 specifically defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include \u201c[unlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) <em>(e.g., </em>a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The Supreme Court has long held that \u201ccommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 485 (4th Cir.1995). Hood offers no evidence or even any argument that the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 conflicts with or constitutes a plainly erroneous reading of the guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In fact, this commentary, rather than conflicting with \u00a7 4B1.2 or reading it erroneously, offers helpful interpretation of the guideline in question. Indeed, the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 speaks to the very <em>intent </em>question the <em>Begay </em>Court found sufficiently unclear in ACCA as to necessitate the second prong of its analysis, i.e. which crimes involving the risk of serious physical injury Congress intended to include as predicate offenses for purposes of the sentence enhancement. <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 142, 128 S.Ct. 1581. The <em>Be-gay </em>Court explained that the enumeration of specific offenses \u201cindicates that the statute covers only <em>similar </em>crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court repeatedly referred to what Congress \u201cmeant\u201d by the ACCA\u2019s text, ultimately concluding that Congress \u201cmeant\u201d to limit the residual clause to crimes like the enumerated ones. <em>Id. </em>Unlike Congress, the Commission has clearly stated what it meant on this issue. Because the Commission\u2019s stated intent is not contrary to the language of the guideline itself, or plainly erroneous, we must defer to the Commission. <em>United States v. Mason, </em>284 F.3d 555, 559 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Commission\u2019s interpretive commentary is akin to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own legislative rules,\u201d and so \u201centitled to substantial deference\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Our holding that possession of a sawed-off shotgun constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(2) of the Guidelines parallels that of the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>554 F.3d 615 (6th Cir.2009). Moreover, the Sixth Circuit deferred to the Guidelines commentary in determining that possession of a sawed-off shotgun would constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines, while also affirming its prior holding in <em>United States v. Amos, </em>501 F.3d 524, 530 (6th Cir.2007), that the same offense did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. In words equally applicable here, the <em>Hawkins </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">Unlike the provision found in the ACCA, the career offender enhancement at issue here, through its Application Notes, specifically defines the term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 to include unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun. We stated in <em>Amos </em>that, \u2018if Congress had wanted the ACCA to cover offenses for possession of firearms as predicate offenses, it could easily have done so explicitly (i.e., the definition of violent felony could have included \u2018possession of a firearm in violation of state or federal law\u2019).\u2019 In its Application Notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, the Sentencing Commission has done just that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-10\"><em>Hawkins, </em>554 F.3d at 617 (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">For all of these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-11\">. Hood pled guilty to felony possession of a sawed-off shotgun, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-288.8 (2010). <em>See </em>Appellant's Br. at 5. That statute criminalizes the possession of a weapon \"of mass death and destruction,\u201d \u00a7 14-288.8(a), which it defines to include \u201cany shotgun with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length or an overall length of less than 26 inches.\u201d \u00a7 14-288.8(c)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. At sentencing, Hood acknowledged that the challenged predicate \u2014 possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-288.8 \u2014 \"has to be knowing.\u201d Accordingly, as he has also acknowledged, he argues only that the asserted predicate \"doesn't meet the violent and aggressive requirements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. It is important to note that our holding is expressly limited to the possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Although the Guidelines and ACCA normally parallel each other, they can diverge where the commentary explicitly enumerates forbidden conduct. Where the commentary, however, is silent, no such divergence occurs. Additionally, we note that possession of a sawed-off shotgun is unique in that the weapon has no non-nefarious purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. It bears note that the Commission has not sought to revise the commentary with respect to its classification of sawed-off shotguns in light of <em>Begay. </em>Rather, although the \"Sentencing Commission submitted proposed amendments to the Guidelines to Congress on May 1, 2009, more than a year after <em>Begay,\u201d </em>those \"proposed amendments include a technical revision to the \u00a7 4B1.2 commentary, but do not change the definition of \u2018crime of violence' that includes possession of a sawed-off shotgun.\u201d <em>United. States v. Vincent, </em>575 F.3d 820, 826 n. 5 (8th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b701-22\">. The Eleventh Circuit has also recognized the authoritative nature of the Guidelines commentary in this context, holding that carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law does not constitute a \"crime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008). The court reasoned that because the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 specifies that \" '[c]rime of violence' does not include the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon,\u201d non-felon possession of a firearm therefore should not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines either. <em>Id. </em>at 1352.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
