Stat. \u00a7 843.01, and (2) fleeing and eluding at high speed, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">We reject Nix\u2019s challenge to the \u00a7 843.01 conviction, holding that a such conviction constitutes a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This is the same holding we recently reached in <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>2010 WL 3489973 (September 8, 2010). Although the <em>Hayes </em>decision was not published, we are persuaded by its rationale regarding \u00a7 843.01 and therefore adopt its holding. Nix\u2019s challenge to the \u00a7 316.1935(3) conviction is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2009), which we are bound to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-29\">.
