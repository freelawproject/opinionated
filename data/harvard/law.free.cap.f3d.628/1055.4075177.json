R.App. P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">The petition for rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1084-7\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYq\">dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Am attorney representing an asylum seeker has a duty to investigate all grounds upon which an applicant may be entitled to relief. However, the panel majority in this case erroneously and absurdly concludes otherwise. The panel majority holds that an attorney does not provide ineffective assistance of counsel when she fails to inquire as to whether her female client has suffered female genital mutilation when (1) nearly 90 percent of women in the client\u2019s home country endure such a brutal procedure, and (2) it is well-settled that female genital mutilation constitutes persecution sufficient to warrant a grant of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">Specifically, the panel majority tells us that an attorney does not perform incompetently in these circumstances by failing \u201cto inquire of his or her own accord into the condition of a client\u2019s genitals.... \u201d <em>Teclezghi v. Holder, </em>378 Fed.Appx. 615, 618 (9th Cir.2010). As Judge Betty Fletcher wrote in her dissent, the panel majority elevates the \u201cpotential discomfort a lawyer might feel in asking a woman whether she has suffered female genital mutilation over the lawyer\u2019s duty to do his or her job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619 (B. Fletcher, J., dissenting). Because I believe the panel majority\u2019s decision will have a detrimental effect on asylum seekers and is completely contrary to our precedent, I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-13\">Teclezghi timely applied for political asylum claiming persecution on account of religion. Her asylum application was denied by the IJ, the BIA, and this court. <em>See Teclezghi v. Gonzales, </em>187 Fed.Appx. 749, 750-51 (9th Cir.2006). Teclezghi filed a motion to reopen based on the ineffective assistance of her previous attorneys, who all failed to ask her whether she had suffered female genital mutilation, a basis upon which she could have applied for asylum. <em>Teclezghi, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 616. The BIA denied Teclezghi\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and this court dismissed her petition for review. <em>Id. </em>at 616-17. We voted on whether to rehear this case en banc, and a majority of the active judges of this court did not vote for a rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc. The BIA clearly erred in failing to equitably toll the deadline for Teclezghi to file her motion to reopen until she defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>tively discovered her prior attorneys\u2019 ineffective assistance. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir.2007). The panel majority\u2019s conclusion that Teclezghi did not suffer ineffective assistance of counsel and the panel majority\u2019s refusal to equitably toll the deadline until Teclezghi discovered her prior counsels\u2019 incompetence is contrary to our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, \u201cthe petitioner must demonstrate first that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and, second, that she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">A. Failure to Perform with Sufficient Competence</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Teclezghi\u2019s attorneys undoubtedly failed to perform with sufficient competence. The 2005 Department of State Report on Human Rights practices in Eritrea, which was submitted to the court, shows that nearly 90 percent of women in Eritrea endure female genital mutilation. <em>Teclezghi, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 619 (B. Fletcher, J., dissenting). The attorneys in this case <em>should have known </em>of the \u201chigh probability that Teclezghi would be eligible for asylum because she had undergone this brutal procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, all of Teclezghi\u2019s attorneys failed to inquire into and raise female genital mutilation as a ground for asylum. This clearly falls below the standards of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">Nevertheless, the panel majority concludes that Teclezghi\u2019s attorneys did not fail to perform with sufficient competence when they \u201cfailed to ask her an intensely personal question and raise a claim for relief that [she] admittedly never mentioned to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618. But this is to be expected. Most women who have been sexually traumatized (because of sexual violence, forced abortions, or female genital mutilation) \u201cfind it extremely difficult to talk about [their experiences].\u201d Nahla Valji, Lee Anne De La Hunt, <em>Gender Guidelines for Asylum Determination, </em>THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN-LEGAL AID CLINIC, NATIONAL CONSORTIUM ON REFUGEE AFFAIRS, 23 (1999), <em>available at </em>www.web. net/ccr/safr.PDF. In a South African case study, of the 678 female client files reviewed, \u201cnone mentioned [Female Genital Cutting] as a reason for seeking asylum.\u201d Lindsay M. Harris, <em>Untold Stories: Gender Related Persecution and Asylum in South Africa, </em>15 MICH. J. GENDER &amp; L. 291, 314 (2009). Harris also interviewed eighteen women who had experienced some form of gender-related persecution and \u201c[s]everal women ... failed to realize that such disclosure was necessary to obtain refugee status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. Some women did not disclose details of their gender-related persecution \u201cbecause they were not asked questions to elicit such information\u201d and \u201cdid not understand the importance of disclosing details of their persecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">Contrary to the panel majority\u2019s view, immigration attorneys do have a duty to identify all forms of relief that are available to their clients, including female genital mutilation. In turn, clients should be able to rely on their attorneys to competently perform this duty. Teclezghi had no reason to know that her female genital mutilation would qualify as a basis of asylum in the United States. The panel majority, however, erroneously places the burden on the asylum seeker to relay all types of personal facts to her attorney, regardless of whether the asylum seeker knows the facts are relevant to her asylum claim. Whereas this court has recognized that the burden of inquiry and investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>tion of potential forms of immigration relief is on the attorney, <em>see Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 792 n. 7, the panel majority here incorrectly shifted the burden of inquiry to the asylum seeker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Furthermore, the panel majority\u2019s holding runs contrary to the ethical standards of competence and diligence that govern all attorney conduct. The advisory committee notes for Rule 1.1 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct explain that \u201ccompetent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem....\u201d MODEL RULES OF PROF\u2019L CONDUCT R. 1.1 cmt. 5 (2002). The panel majority forgives attorneys for failing to inquire about or investigate relevant country conditions that have a 90 percent likelihood of applying to their clients\u2019 claims for political asylum. This abrogates the attorney\u2019s responsibility to inquire about and analyze the factual and legal elements relevant to her client\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>This is not \u201ccompetent handling\u201d and would likely lead to unfair and unfortunate results in asylum proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">\u201c[Prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it <em>may </em>have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 793-94 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Teclezghi certainly suffered prejudice because of her attorneys\u2019 inadequate performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">We have recognized that female genital mutilation is a ground for asylum in the United States. <em>See In re Kasinga, </em>211. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 357, 361 (BIA 1996); <em>Benyamin v. Holder, </em>579 F.3d 970 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 795-96; <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc). In fact, we found in <em>Mohammed </em>that a woman whose attorney failed to present evidence that she had suffered female genital mutilation in the past was prejudiced by her attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance. 400 F.3d at 801-03. Had Teclezghi\u2019s prior attorneys told her that female genital mutilation is a ground for asylum in the United States and asked her whether she had suffered this brutal experience, she undoubtedly would have told them that she had. Thus, I believe the outcome would have been different. At the very least, Teclezghi has satisfied her burden of showing that the outcome <em>may </em>have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 793-94. Therefore, Teclezghi was prejudiced by her attorneys\u2019 failure to perform with sufficient competence and should have prevailed on her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">II. Equitable Tolling</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">Because Teclezghi suffered ineffective assistance of counsel, the panel majority should have tolled the deadline to file her motion to reopen until she definitively discovered her prior counsels\u2019 ineffective assistance. <em>See Singh, </em>491 F.3d at 1096. The panel majority\u2019s refusal to toll the deadline conflicts with our precedent in <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir.2003) and <em>Wenqin Sun v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 802 (9th Cir.2009). The panel majority correctly quoted <em>Iturribarria </em>for the rule that equitable tolling of deadlines is appropriate when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of \u201cdeception, fraud, or error.\u201d 321 F.3d at 897, <em>see Teclezghi, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 618. However, the panel majority only discusses cases of attorney deception and fraud, but not cases involving attorney error, such as in <em>Wenqin Sun. Id. </em>In <em>Wenqin Sun, </em>we found that a lawyer\u2019s innocent legal error may equitably toll a motion to reopen deadline. 555 F.3d at 805-06. Specifically, this court stated that \u201cequitable tolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>... applies when a petitioner acts promptly after discovering counsel\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Teclezghi\u2019s attorneys\u2019 failure to inquire about whether she had suffered female genital mutilation were errors. Thus, the panel majority should have equitably tolled her deadline for filing a motion to reopen and determined whether Teclezghi acted promptly after discovering her previous counsels\u2019 errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">The panel majority fails to recognize that most political asylum applications are intensely personal, often painful, and may involve questions of sexual torture, rape, and humiliation. It is entirely expected that clients may not want to readily reveal such circumstances to their attorneys. It is precisely because the subject matter of an asylum claim based on female genital mutilation is so intensely personal and our immigration system so complex that an attorney has a special responsibility to adequately explain to her female clients their rights to asylum and diligently investigate all grounds for relief. The panel majority\u2019s decision allowing attorneys to forego investigating intensely personal facts in an asylum claim diminishes the attorney\u2019s role in the asylum process. Our precedent tells us that competent attorney performance requires more. I believe that our court should instill a greater sense of professional responsibility in attorneys who represent asylum seekers. Accordingly, I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
