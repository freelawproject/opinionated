The Master <em>(R. Peter Shapiro, </em>Esq.), in a recommendation approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the Superior Court (Temple, J.), denied the defendant/employee\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that the release of the employer was not a bar to the suit against the employee. We affirm the denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">This case arises out of an automobile accident which occurred in Exeter on June 9, 1980. The plaintiffs, Elena B. Waters and B. Gordon Waters, sued Prudential Insurance Company of America alleging that the negligent conduct of Arthur Hedberg, acting in his capacity as a Prudential employee and within the scope of his employment, caused the accident. No independent basis of liability other than the doctrine of respondeat superior was alleged against Prudential. Hedberg was not named in the suit. Prudential brought an indemnity action against Hedberg. Prudential\u2019s move to consolidate the indemnity action with the Waters\u2019 suit against it was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The case against Prudential was tried, but before verdict the parties settled the case. The docket was marked, \u201cNeither party. No costs. No further action for the same cause.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiffs released Prudential and Prudential\u2019s liability insurance carrier from all claims regarding the accident, in exchange for a cash settlement substantially less than the damages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Following the settlement, plaintiffs sued Hedberg, alleging that his negligent operation of the motor vehicle caused the accident. Hedberg moved to dismiss on the ground that the suit was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and by the release of Prudential, his employer. The motion was denied on the ground that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel barred the suit. The defendant appeals this ruling. The interlocutory appeal also raises the question of what effect the release granted to the employer has upon the suit against the employee, under RSA 507:7-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">At the outset, we note that the <em>consent judgment </em>entered on the docket in settlement of the Waters\u2019 suit against Prudential, which states \u201cNeither party. No costs. No further action for the same cause,\u201d is the relevant disposition for determining whether res judicata or collateral estoppel bars the suit against Hedberg. On the other hand, the <em>release </em>of Prudential by the Waterses is the document having legal significance under RSA 507:7-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> \u201cThe heart of the doctrine of res judicata is that a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive upon the parties in a subsequent litigation involving the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Concrete Constructors, Inc. v. The Manchester Bank, </em>117 N.H. 670, 672, 377 A.2d 612, 614 (1977). \u201cThe same result can follow from a consent judgment resulting in docket markings such as those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>entered in this case.\u201d <em>Id.; Moore v. Lebanon, </em>96 N.H. 20, 22, 69 A.2d 516, 518-19 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Defendant Hedberg was not a party to the consent judgment and is bound by the doctrine of res judicata only if he is in privity with a bound party. <em>Sanderson v. Balfour, </em>109 N.H. 213, 214, 247 A.2d 185, 186 (1968); <em>see </em>R. Wiebusch, 5 New Hampshire Practice, Civil Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1870, at 389-90 n.52 (1984). The privity exception applies where the non-party\u2019s interests were in fact represented and protected in the litigation although he was not a formal party to the proceedings. M. Green, Basic Civil Procedure at 212 (1972). In this context, if the employee, though not a party to the suit, takes control of the suit, the judgment will bind the employee. M. Green, <em>supra at </em>213; <em>cf. Eaton v. Clarke, </em>80 N.H. 577, 578, 120 A. 433, 434 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In this case, Hedberg did not take control of the suit. He is, therefore, not protected under res judicata by the consent judgment entered. <em>See Moore v. Lebanon supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Nor is Hedberg protected by the rules of collateral estoppel. The doctrine of collateral estoppel \u201cprecludes the relitigation of an issue of fact which has been fully and fairly litigated\u201d in a prior action. <em>Loundsbury v. City of Keene, </em>122 N.H. 1006, 1008, 453 A.2d 1278, 1280 (1982); <em>see </em>R. Wiebusch, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 1871, at 391-92. \u201c[Collateral estoppel may be invoked ... by a party to a later case who was not a party or in privity with a party to the earlier case.\u201d <em>Caouette v. Town of New Ipswich, </em>125 N.H. 547, 554, 484 A.2d 1106, 1111 (1984). The party to be estopped, however, must have been a party or in privity with a party to the prior action. In this case, the \u201cjudgment\u201d does not preclude litigation of any issues because the docket markings reflect a judgment for \u201cneither party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We next turn to the effect of RSA 507:7-b on the facts of this case. RSA 507:7-b provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cRelease or Covenant Not to Sue: Joint Tortfeasors. When a release or covenant not to sue is given in good faith to one of 2 or more persons liable in tort for the same injury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms expressly so provide, but it reduces the claim against the others in the amount of the consideration paid for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">In <em>Morrill v. Webb, </em>123 N.H. 276, 461 A.2d 93 (1983), we interpreted this statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cWhen a release or a covenant not to sue is entered into with one joint tortfeasor, it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability, absent any expression to the contrary. <em>See </em>RSA 507:7-b (Supp. 1979). However, the settlement with one tortfeasor does reduce the claim against the others to the extent of the consideration paid for the release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 279, 461 A.2d at 95 (citing <em>Burke v. Burnham, </em>97 N.H. 203, 210, 84 A.2d 918, 924 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In <em>Burke v. Burnham supra </em>we stated the prior law in New Hampshire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201c\u2018When one is injured by joint wrongdoers, a settlement with one of them is presumptively in full satisfaction for the injury .... But if the settlement with one is not intended as full satisfaction, the others are released only to the extent of the amount paid.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 210, 84 A.2d at 924 (quoting <em>Masterson v. Railway, </em>83 N.H. 190, 192, 139 A. 753, 755 (1927)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">RSA 507:7-b, then, changes the prior law, so that now a release of one joint tortfeasor is presumed not to be a release of all, whereas previously, the release was presumed to release all unless a contrary intent was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Several States have construed a statute similar to RSA 507:7-b found in the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act \u00a7 4. For purposes of this case, the two statutes are functionally equivalent. We, therefore, do not hesitate to consider other States\u2019 interpretations of the Uniform Act \u00a7 4 for guidance in interpreting our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Our interpretation of RSA 507:7-b is in accord with the interpretation of the Uniform Act \u00a7 4. In <em>Brown v. Pittsburgh, </em>409 Pa. 357, 362, 186 A.2d 399, 402 (1962), the court observed that the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act \u201cdrastically changed the [common] law on this subject and since that enactment a release by the injured party to one jointly liable does not release others also liable, unless the release expressly so provides.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Hayden v. Ford Motor Company, </em>278 F. Supp. 267, 271 (D. Mass. 1967), the court noted that the Uniform Act had changed the prior law so that a release of one joint tortfeasor no longer released all others unless the intention to release all was found. <em>See also Smith v. Raparot, </em>101 R.I. 565, 567-68, 225 A.2d 666, 667-68 (1967) (Uniform Act plainly and unambiguously changes common law rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">The central question in this case is whether an employee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>employer <em>are </em>joint tortfeasors within the meaning of the release statute where the only basis of liability for the employer is the doctrine of respondeat superior. We have suggested that masters and servants who are jointly liable under respondeat superior are not true joint tortfeasors, but that liability for the servant\u2019s wrong is merely imputed to the master to give the aggrieved party redress. <em>See McNamara v. Chapman, </em>81 N.H. 169, 172-74, 123 A. 229, 230-31 (1923). Hence, the master\u2019s liability is strictly derivative.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The weight of authority is that the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act \u00a7 4 applies to persons whose liability is derived vicariously from the primary negligent conduct of another. <em>See Smith v. Raparot supra </em>(release of servant does not release master from liability under respondeat superior); <em>Blackshear v. Clark, </em>391 A.2d 747, 748 (Del. 1978) (release of hospital/employer does not release doctor/employee); <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Sweat, </em>568 P.2d 916, 929 (Alaska 1977) (release of independent contractor negligently performing licensed common carrier\u2019s non-delegable duty does not release carrier); <em>Wouldridge v. Zimmerman, </em>21 Cal. App. 3d 656, 658-59, 98 Cal. Rptr. 778, 779 (1971) (release of owners for false representations of agent does not release agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Some cases under the Uniform Act are contrary. In <em>Kinetics, Inc. v. El Paso Products Co., </em>99 N.M. 22, 653 P.2d 522 (Ct. App. 1982), the court held that a partner, who was vicariously liable for the tort of a partnership, was released from liability when the partnership was released. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 653 P.2d at 527. The court reasoned that the liability of the partnership was direct and that that of the partners was merely imputed. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce the partnership was released, the means by which liability was imputed to the partners was destroyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, the parties were not \u201cjoint tortfeasors,\u201d and that prior common law applied. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 653 P.2d at 528. <em>See also Witucke v. Presque Isle Bank, </em>68 Mich. App. 599, 608-10, 243 N.W. 2d 907, 911-12 (1976) (construing statute somewhat different than the Uniform Act to determine that a master and servant are not joint tortfeasors because liability arises by operation of law, not wrongdoing).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We reject the reasoning of these latter cases for the reasons stated in <em>Blackshear v. Clark, supra </em>at 748:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cThe <em>basis </em>of liability is not relevant, nor is the relationship among those liable for the tort. In short, it makes no difference whether the [employer\u2019s] liability is based on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>or any other legal concept. The point is that both it and the [employee] are (at least) \u2018severally\u2019 liable for the same injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In interpreting a statute identical to New Hampshire\u2019s in that it does not define \u201cjoint tort-feasor,\u201d the Alaska Supreme Court has stated: \u201cIt may be that [the vicariously liable carrier] is not technically a \u2018tort-feasor,\u2019 but it is \u2018one of two or more liable in tort for the same injury.\u2019\u201d <em>Alaska Airlines v. Sweat, supra </em>at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Our discussion is in accord with the policy underlying the adoption of RSA 507:7-b. Whereas the common law rule left a plaintiff with the option of settling with all tortfeasors or none at all, RSA 507:7-b permits settlement in part with some of those liable to him, while leaving the plaintiff free to seek the remainder of his recovery from others. In <em>Bishop v. Klein, </em>380 Mass. 285, 294, 402 N.E.2d 1365, 1371-72 (1980), the court concluded that the Uniform Act \u201cwas drafted to encourage settlements in multiple party tort actions by clearly delineating the effect settlement will have on collateral rights and liabilities in future litigation.\u201d We think the same applies to RSA 507:7-b settlements. \u201cThe policy favoring termination of the litigation and encouraging settlement agreements should here prevail.\u201d <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Sweat, </em>568 P.2d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The change from the common law reflected in RSA 507:7-b is amply justified by the strong public policy promoting resolution of civil suits and favoring the amicable settlement of litigation. <em>Cities Service Oil Company v. Coleman Oil Company, Inc., </em>470 F.2d 925, 929 (1st Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 967 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Moreover, we find no compelling intent manifested by the use of the technically limited term \u201ctortfeasor\u201d in the title of RSA 507:7-b which would require us to disregard the plainly expansive language of the text of the statute. <em>See State v. Kilgus, </em>125 N.H. 739, 742, 484 A.2d 1208, 1212 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The trial court\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">\n<em>Affirmed; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
