LeClair, Jr.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b493-9\">May 8, 1985</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-16\"><em>Stephen E.

The complaint alleged that the defendant purposely obtained \u201ca Panasonic Color Television, serial PJ 2650823, the property of Bradlee\u2019s Department Store, with a purpose to permanently deprive said store thereof, without authority of said Bradlee\u2019s Dept. Store to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>During trial, the State moved to introduce into evidence the Panasonic color television set found in the defendant\u2019s possession shortly after he left the store. The defendant objected, alleging that insufficient evidence was introduced to identify that television as the one taken from Bradlees Department Store. The Superior Court <em>(Pappagianis, </em>J.) admitted the television set into evidence, noting the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The defendant was convicted and sentenced by the trial judge to twelve months in the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Two Bradlees employees had seen the defendant leave the store with a boxed television set. Defendant had not paid for Bradlees\u2019 property before exiting. A call to the police led to a police stop of LeClair five minutes later and a mile away.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">A complaint must include all of the elements that constitute the offense charged. <em>See State v. Stiles, </em>123 N.H. 680, 683, 465 A.2d 908, 910 (1983) (indictment). The defendant here was charged with theft by unauthorized taking, which is defined as obtaining \u201cunauthorized control over the property of another with a purpose to deprive him thereof.\u201d RSA 637:3, I. The complaint alleged in part that the defendant obtained \u201ca Panasonic Color Television, serial PJ 2650823, the property of Bradlee\u2019s Department Store ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The defendant does not, and could not, contend that the serial number of the stolen television set was required to be set forth in the complaint. Rather, he argues that since the serial number was in fact included in the complaint, the State was obligated to prove the serial number of the television set before it could introduce the television set into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">This court has consistently held that immaterial or superfluous allegations contained in a complaint or indictment need not be proven at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201c[Ajverments in an indictment that are in excess of those required by the statute defining the offense may be treated as superfluous, and thus do not necessarily control the State\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\"><em>State v. Boone, </em>119 N.H. 594, 596, 406 A.2d 113, 114 (1979); <em>see </em>R. McNamara, 1 New Hampshire Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 311 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">The evidence introduced at trial clearly identified the packaged Panasonic color television set found in the defendant\u2019s possession as the one taken from Bradlees Department Store. Stacy Moretto, a Bradlees employee, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Q. \u201c[By prosecutor]. Was the television you saw in the car the same television you have, that he walked out with?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Q. \u201cWhat if any doubt do you have as to that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">A. \u201cNone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In light of this and other testimony, a sufficient foundation existed and the trial court properly admitted into evidence the television set found in the defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
