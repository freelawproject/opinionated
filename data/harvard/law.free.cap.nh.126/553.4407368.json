The sole basis of the employer\u2019s alleged liability is the doctrine of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">Our decision of this date in <em>Waters v. Hedberg, </em>126 N.H. 546, 496 A.2d 333 (1985) presented the obverse of this case. The release in <em>Waters </em>was given to the employer, and the suit was then permitted to be maintained against the employee. The considerations are no different in this case, and the suit likewise is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
