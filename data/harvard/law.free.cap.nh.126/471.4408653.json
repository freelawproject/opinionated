RSA 632-A:2 (Supp. 1983). He appeals the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Bean, </em>J.) denial of his motions for a mistrial and for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">During the trial by jury, the prosecutor asked a police officer whether the officer had requested the victim to take a polygraph test. The defendant objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion and instructed the jury to disregard the question. If we fail to reverse this conviction, we risk creating the impression that such a reference to a polygraph test is error, but not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-18\"> We have consistently held that the results of polygraph tests are not admissible as evidence of guilt or innocence in criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>trials. <em>State v. French, </em>119 N.H. 500, 503, 403 A.2d 424, 426, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 954 (1979); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>116 N.H. 585, 588-89, 364 A.2d 621, 623-24 (1976); <em>State v. LaForest, </em>106 N.H. 159, 160-61, 207 A.2d 429, 430-31 (1965). This rule of inadmissibility is based upon the unreliability of such tests, as well as the danger that a jury will rely upon them to establish the truth or falsity of a witness\u2019 statements. <em>State v. French, supra </em>at 503, 403 A.2d at 426. Accordingly, it is error to refer to such a test.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A question asking whether a victim has been asked to take a polygraph test cannot produce admissible evidence. Furthermore, if the jury speculates from such a question that the victim was not asked to take a polygraph test, the victim\u2019s credibility will be enhanced. Because the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to bolster the State\u2019s witness by a reference to a polygraph test was, therefore, not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>State v. Ruelke, </em>116 N.H. 692, 694, 366 A.2d 497, 498 (1976), we must reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The defendant also argues that denial of his motion for a directed verdict was error because the prosecution introduced insufficient evidence to prove sexual penetration. We have reviewed the evidence presented at trial and find that this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
