BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts in this case are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant drove his vehicle into a fence one night in Portland. Paramedics and law enforcement responded to the scene, evaluated defendant, and determined that he was he was intoxicated. Defendant was arrested and transported to the police station, where Officer Ladd was waiting. Ladd informed defendant that he had been in a crash and was at the police station because he \"smelled of an alcoholic beverage pretty strongly.\" Ladd explained that he was \"going to read [defendant] some information\" and that he would \"like [defendant] to open [his] mouth.\" When Ladd asked defendant, \"Can I look in your mouth,\" defendant responded, \"No.\" Ladd then explained that, \"if you don't [open it], then I can't help you maybe take a breath test.\" After defendant responded that he would not open his mouth, Ladd read defendant the \"rights and consequences\" required by law. Ladd explained that defendant was \"about to be asked to submit to a breath test *** under the implied consent law,\" and he provided information on the consequences for refusing or failing the test, including that his refusal to submit to the breath test \"may be\n   offered against [him].\" After reading\n   the form, Ladd asked defendant, \"[W]ill you take a breath test?\" Defendant responded that he would not. Ladd did not obtain defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC). Defendant was charged with DUII, reckless driving, and criminal mischief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence of his refusal to consent to the breath test. His position was that use of his refusal as substantive evidence of his guilt, as permitted under ORS 813.310, is unconstitutional. Defendant argued that use of his refusal would violate his right against self-incrimination under Article I, section 12, and his right against unreasonable searches and seizures under Article I, section 9. With respect to the latter, defendant argued that the use of his refusal as evidence as of his guilt placed too great a burden on his exercise of his Article I, section 9, right. The trial court denied the motion, the state presented evidence of defendant's refusal to support the inference that defendant knew he was intoxicated, and defendant was convicted of DUII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant appealed his judgment of conviction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414429\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/718/\">\n    286 Or.

On the Article I, section 9, issue, the only issue that we address,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court of Appeals explained that Ladd had a lawful right to conduct a warrantless seizure and search\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on a warrant exception-the existence of probable cause and exigent circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414429\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414429\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/718/\">\n    at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414429\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/718/\">\n    401 P.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the court reasoned, defendant had no right to refuse to consent to that search, and his right against unreasonable searches and seizures was not violated by the use of his refusal as evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414429\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/286/718/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant sought review in this court, which we allowed. In this court, defendant does not argue that Ladd did not have probable cause or that exigent circumstances did not exist to permit a warrantless search of his breath. Instead, he argues, as he did in the proceedings below, that his refusal to take a breath test was an invocation of his right under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution to refuse to give his consent to a warrantless search. That exercise of a constitutional right, he submits, cannot be used as substantive evidence of his guilt and may not be commented on at trial without violating that constitutional provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The state does not take issue with that latter proposition. The state acknowledges that, \"as a general rule, a person's choice to refuse to consent to a warrantless search and seizure is not admissible as substantive evidence against him.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, the state contends, under the implied-consent statutes, defendant agreed, by driving on a public highway, to submit to a breath test if arrested for DUII and, therefore, did not have a constitutional right at the time of arrest to refuse to provide the consent that Ladd requested. Second, the state argues, defendant's refusal was not an invocation of a constitutional right. When Ladd asked defendant to take to a breath test, he was not asking defendant to waive his Article I, section 9, right; rather, he was seeking defendant's physical cooperation and submission to a breath test that Ladd had lawful authority to conduct. Third, the state asserts, even if defendant's refusal was an invocation of a constitutional right, it can be used against him because Ladd had another lawful basis for obtaining a breath sample from defendant without a warrant and without his consent-probable cause and exigent circumstances. We address each of those arguments in succession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

Generally, Article I, section 9, requires that law enforcement obtain a warrant before performing a search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Art I, \u00a7 9 (\"[N]o warrant shall issue but upon probable cause.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in interpreting that constitutional provision, this court has recognized various exceptions to the warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state relies on ORS 813.100(1), which provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle upon premises open to the public or the highways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to the implied consent law, to a chemical test of the person's breath *** for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of the person's blood if the person is arrested for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The problem with the state's argument, however, is that the implied-consent statutes also include a provision that permits a person who drives on public roads to later refuse to take a breath test if and when the person is arrested for DUII.

Because the implied-consent statutes preserve a driver's right to decide, at the point of arrest, whether to consent to a search of his or her breath or blood, it is that point in time that is relevant. Law enforcement officers may conduct a search of a driver's breath at that time, but they must have a constitutional basis to do so. The fact that the driver drove a vehicle on public roads prior to the arrest does not supply such a basis because Oregon law does not make the driver's implied consent irrevocable; rather, it gives the driver the opportunity to make a different choice at the time of arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of arrest, the constitutional bases for an officer's search may include the driver's voluntary consent given at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 813.100(5) (\"Nothing in this section precludes a police officer from obtaining a chemical test of the person's breath or blood through any lawful means *** including, but not limited to, obtaining a search warrant.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, ORS 813.140(1) provides that a police officer may obtain a chemical test of a driver's breath \"[i]f, when requested by a police officer, the [driver] expressly consents to such a test.\" We reject the state's argument that, by driving on a public highway, defendant irrevocably gave his consent to a later search of his breath and had no constitutional right to refuse a request to search at the time of arrest.\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The state did not meet its burden to prove that defendant's refusal to consent to a breath test was admissible\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state's second argument is that, when Ladd asked defendant to take a breath test, Ladd was not asking defendant to provide a constitutional basis for that search; rather, Ladd had a constitutional basis for the search provided by another warrant exception-probable cause and exigent circumstances-and was seeking only defendant's agreement to submit to the requested test.

ORS 813.100(5) permits an officer to obtain chemical tests of a driver's blood or breath \"through any lawful means *** including, but not limited to, obtaining a search warrant.\" And, ORS 813.140(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   specifically describes those lawful\n   means as including obtaining a driver's \"express[ ] consent[ ]\" to take such a test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Other statutes also reflect a difference between a request for physical submission and a request for express consent to search. For instance, and specifically relevant here, ORS 813.310 provides that, \"[i]f a person refuses to\n   <em>\n    submit\n   </em>\n   to a chemical test under ORS 813.100\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   refuses to\n   <em>\n    consent\n   </em>\n   to chemical tests under ORS 813.140, evidence of the person's refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action[.]\" (Emphases added.) Other statutes allow the imposition of other consequences only when a driver refuses to submit to a test under ORS 813.100.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 813.100(3) (driver who refuses to submit under ORS 813.100 subject to license suspension); ORS 813.095 ($650 fine for refusing to submit under ORS 813.100 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, given the various provisions of the implied-consent statutes, an officer's question\n   to a driver asking whether the driver will take a breath test may be either (1) a request under ORS 813.140 for express consent to search the driver's breath that, if given, will supply a constitutional basis for the test; or (2) a request under ORS 813.100 that the driver \"submit\" to a breath test that finds its constitutional justification elsewhere.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated another way, a driver's refusal to answer that question affirmatively may be either an invocation of a constitutional right or a refusal to cooperate without constitutional significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As discussed above, the invocation of a constitutional right cannot be admitted at trial as evidence of a defendant's guilt. However, no similar bar applies when an officer seeks only a driver's physical cooperation in conducting a constitutionally-authorized search. Defendant does not take issue with that notion, nor does he argue that the consequence that ORS 813.310 imposes for failure to submit under ORS 813.100 is unlawful. Rather, he contends only that the consequence that ORS 813.310 imposes for failure\n   to give express consent under ORS 813.140 is unconstitutional. And, he argues, he understood Ladd's question as seeking that express consent to search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When the state seeks admission of a defendant's refusal to take a breath test, the state, as the proponent of the evidence, has the burden to establish its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Fish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"746129\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/321/48/#p59\">\n    321 Or. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"746129\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/321/48/#p59\">\n    893 P.2d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (\"As proponent of the evidence of defendant's refusal [to take field sobriety tests], the state has the burden, after appropriate objection has been raised, of establishing the admissibility of the evidence.\"). The state must demonstrate that the officer's question could reasonably be understood only as a request to provide physical cooperation and not as a request for constitutionally-significant consent to search. If the state fails to establish that fact, then a driver's refusal cannot be admitted in evidence against the driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In this case, the state did not meet its burden. Ladd's question-\"[W]ill you take a breath test?\"-was ambiguous. Ladd could have been asking defendant to physically submit to a test that was justified by a warrant exception, or Ladd could have been asking defendant for his consent to search, thereby establishing a warrant exception. Ladd told defendant that he would be asked to submit to a breath test \"under the implied consent law,\" but he did not specify the aspect of the implied-consent law to which he was referring. As explained, ORS 813.100 and ORS 813.140 provide that a driver's consent to take a breath test may serve two different functions, one of which has constitutional significance. Here, the state did not meet its burden to establish that Ladd's request was solely a request for physical cooperation and could not reasonably be understood as a request for constitutionally significant consent to search. Consequently, the state did not establish that defendant's refusal to take the test was admissible as evidence of his guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The fact that the state had a constitutional basis to search does not make defendant's refusal to provide consent admissible.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As indicated, the state's third and final argument is that, even if (1) an officer's request that a driver take a breath test is a request for constitutionally significant\n   consent to search, and (2) a defendant's refusal to provide consent to search is, as a general rule, not admissible against the defendant, we nevertheless should recognize an exception to that rule when an officer has a constitutional basis to search other than the defendant's consent. That is, the state contends, even if an officer is requesting constitutionally significant consent to search, the existence of an alternative basis for that search permits the admission of the driver's refusal. Applying that proposed exception here, the state argues that defendant's\n   Article I, section 9, rights were not burdened by admitting evidence of his refusal to provide constitutional consent because Ladd had an unstated lawful basis for obtaining a breath sample from defendant without a warrant and without his consent-probable cause and exigent circumstances. The parties have not cited any Oregon Supreme Court case that has addressed that issue,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   but other courts have done so, albeit outside the drunk driving context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Those statutes also raise difficult constitutional questions and interrelated questions of statutory construction. For that reason, this court has often struggled with how to interpret and apply those statutes. Recent attempts by this court to answer even relatively straight-forward questions relating to those statutes have required the court to grapple with past inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Swan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568312\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/9/\">\n     363 Or. 121\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568312\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/9/\">\n     420 P.3d 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018). Unfortunately, the approach that the majority takes in this case makes some of these questions more complicated than they need to be and finds ambiguity where the statutes contain none. While I agree with much that the majority has to say, the effect of the opinion is to introduce unnecessary confusion into the implied-consent statutes, and into their implementation. For that reason, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The question in this case is whether Article I, section 9, prohibits defendant's refusal to take a breath test from being introduced as evidence against him in a criminal case. Although the issue presented in this case has constitutional dimensions, the principal dispute between the parties is rooted in questions of statutory construction. For that reason, I begin with an overview of the statutes at issue, Oregon's implied-consent laws. Those laws are oriented around a key provision, found in ORS 813.100(1) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    \"Any person who operates a motor vehicle upon premises open to the public or the highways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to the implied consent law, to a chemical test of the person's breath *** for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of the person's blood if the person is arrested for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or of a municipal ordinance. A test shall be administered upon the request of a police officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person arrested to have been driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or of a municipal ordinance. Before the test is administered the person requested to take the test shall be informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    That provision accomplishes several things. First, it establishes-or at least attempts to establish-that an individual's act of driving a motor vehicle constitutes that person's\n    \"consent\" to a test of his or her breath. That is significant because a breath test is a search, and under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution a police officer generally cannot conduct a search, or force a person to submit to a search, without first obtaining a warrant, unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, the implied-consent statutes are a mechanism for obtaining constitutional authorization to perform the search. I discuss the legal effectiveness of that statutory mechanism below.\n    Second, the statute provides that the test shall be administered only after the suspect is informed of the consequences of\n    <em>\n     refusing\n    </em>\n    to submit to a breath test and of certain statutory rights in the breath test process. Those consequences are defined elsewhere in the statutory scheme. They include a driver's license suspension of at least one year, ORS 813.420 ; being found guilty of a traffic violation with a presumptive $650 fine,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ORS 813.100(3) and ORS 813.095 ; and introduction of the refusal to take the test as evidence of guilt in a subsequent criminal prosecution, ORS 813.310 -the last, of course, being at issue in this case. One right that the implied-consent laws provide to suspects is the right to \"refuse\" to \"submit\" to a breath test, set out in ORS 813.100(2) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    \"No chemical test of the person's breath or blood shall be given, under subsection (1) of this section, to a person under arrest for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or of a municipal ordinance, if the person refuses the request of a police officer to submit to the chemical test after the person has been informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Note that ORS 813.100(2) does not speak of the driver\n    <em>\n     revoking\n    </em>\n    the\n    <em>\n     consent\n    </em>\n    that he or she is deemed to have given under ORS 813.100(1) ; rather, focusing on the practical realities of performing a breath test, the statute describes the \"refusal\" of the driver to \"submit\" to the test. As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Swan\n    </em>\n    , \"[t]he implied-consent statutes thus provide that, notwithstanding the consent implied by driving on the public highways, a DUII suspect retains a statutory right to refuse to take a breath test at the point of arrest.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568312\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/9/\">\n     363 Or. at 139\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568312\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/9/\">\n     420 P.3d 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That the state accords such a statutory right is understandable. Even where the constitution does not prohibit the state from conducting a breath test, the state is faced with the practical difficulty of getting the suspect to give the required breath sample. As we have previously recognized, \"[a] person may, of course,\n    <em>\n     physically\n    </em>\n    refuse to take the test, and the legislature has chosen to forbid the use of physical force to compel drivers to submit to the test.\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Cabanilla\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/#p632\">\n     351 Or. 622\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 628,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/#p632\">\n     273 P.3d 125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012) (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Therefore, at least with respect to breath tests, the implied-consent laws envision a three-step process. First, the driver \"consents\" to the test by the act of driving, which gives the state constitutional authorization to perform the breath test. Second, after the driver is arrested because police believe she is driving under the influence of intoxicants, the officer requests that she submit to a breath test and advises her of her rights, including the statutory right to refuse a search, and of the consequences of refusing a search. Third, the driver makes her choice, no doubt influenced by the consequences of refusal that she has just been read. If the driver says yes, then the officer is statutorily authorized to perform the breath test. If the driver says no, exercising her right, then ORS 813.100(2) forbids the officer from performing the breath test, but the other consequences, mentioned above, are triggered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The state's first argument in this case focuses on the first step of that process, the implied consent itself. The state argues that, because defendant consented to the eventual search of his breath when he made the decision\n    to drive, defendant had no right to withhold consent after he had been arrested, and thus no constitutional provision protected defendant's refusal to consent. The majority responds to that argument by noting, as we held in\n    <em>\n     Swan\n    </em>\n    , \"that the implied-consent statutes also include a provision that permits a person who drives on public roads to later refuse to take a breath test if and when the person is arrested for DUII.\" 364 Or. at 338, 434 P.3d at 365. But all we held in\n    <em>\n     Swan\n    </em>\n    was that a suspect has \"a\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n    right to refuse to take a breath test at the point of arrest.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568312\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/9/\">\n     363 Or. at 139\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568312\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/9/\">\n     420 P.3d 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). We did not hold that, upon arrest, a suspect's\n    <em>\n     constitutional\n    </em>\n    right to withhold consent is restored. The majority's holding that implied consent disappears, or is no longer binding, at the point of arrest leaves implied consent with no role to play in the statutory scheme. That is contrary to the structure of the statute, as I have explained above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that the state's first argument fails, albeit for a different reason. Statutorily-implied consent is not the equivalent of, or a substitute for, constitutional consent. The implied-consent\n    statutes purport to authorize a search on the basis that \"[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle upon premises open to the public or the highways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent\" to certain searches of her breath or blood under specified circumstances. ORS 813.100(1). But whether a person has given constitutionally valid consent to a search or seizure is a question of constitutional law and the fact that a statute states that all drivers have given consent does not mean that, as a legal or factual matter, the drivers actually have done so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We have called the theory of implied consent into question before.\n    <em>\n     State v. Newton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2169558\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/291/788/#p800\">\n     291 Or. 788\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 801,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2169558\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/291/788/#p800\">\n     636 P.2d 393\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1981) (plurality opinion)\n    <em>\n     overruled on other grounds by\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

By this, we mean actual consent. Defendant's statutorily implied consent cannot excuse an otherwise unconstitutional seizure.\"). Moreover, despite a multitude of implied-consent cases, we have never upheld an otherwise-impermissible search on a theory of implied consent. And, outside the implied-consent context, we recently reaffirmed that consent for purposes of Article I, section 9, must be actual consent, determined by the authorization that the individual intended to give: \"[I]n determining whether a particular search falls within the scope of a defendant's consent, the trial court will determine, based on the totality of circumstances, what the defendant actually intended.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

The state cannot, consistent with that principle, impute consent to an individual who does not intend to give it.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Although the concept of \"implied,\" as opposed to express, consent may be valuable, and appropriately used, in certain other contexts, as a matter of constitutional law the existence of a statute that \"deems\" a driver to have\n    irrevocably consented to a search whenever he or she operates a motor vehicle, is problematic.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Although the state provided some briefing on the matter, it is not relevant in this case whether \"deemed\" consent might fall into or satisfy a warrant exception other than the consent exception.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    And that question may be\n    something of a red herring in general. Although the constitutional authorization for the search of suspects' breath, under the implied-consent laws, likely cannot rest on the \"implied\" or \"deemed\" consent that ORS 813.100(1) purports to establish, ORS 813.100(5)\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    makes clear that the state may derive constitutional authority to perform a breath test from\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    sources. One well-established warrant exception available to the state in most DUII cases is the exigent circumstances exception. Under that exception, the police may perform a search without obtaining a warrant, provided that they can \"establish both that the officers had probable cause and that exigent circumstances justified the officers' warrantless search.\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Ritz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415027\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/781/#p790\">\n     361 Or. 781\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 790,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415027\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/781/#p790\">\n     399 P.3d 421\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017). ORS 813.100(1), by its terms, applies only after the suspect has been arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants, which requires probable cause. ORS 133.310(1) (providing for warrantless arrest based on probable cause). And, as this court has recognized, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream will almost always qualify as an exigent circumstance:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    \"It may be true, phenomenologically, that, among such cases, there will be instances in which a warrant could have been both obtained and executed in a timely fashion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    The mere possibility, however, that such situations may occur from time to time does not justify ignoring the inescapable fact that, in every such case, evidence is disappearing and minutes count. We therefore declare that, for purposes of the Oregon Constitution, the evanescent nature of a suspect's blood alcohol content is an exigent circumstance that will ordinarily permit a warrantless blood draw of the kind taken here. We do so, however, understanding that particular facts may show, in the rare case, that a warrant could have been obtained and executed\n    <em>\n     significantly\n    </em>\n    faster than the actual process otherwise used under the circumstances. We anticipate that only in those rare cases will a warrantless blood draw be unconstitutional.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     State v. Machuca\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671526\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/644/#p656\">\n     347 Or. 644\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 656-57,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671526\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/644/#p656\">\n     227 P.3d 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010) (emphasis in original). What is true of blood draws will also be true of breath tests, which present precisely the same exigency. Thus, in the substantial majority of cases in which an officer conducts a search in accordance with the implied-consent laws, both probable cause and an exigency will be present, and thus neither a warrant nor any other warrant exception will be necessary.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    And in the rare cases where there is no exigency the officer will presumably be able to obtain a warrant and will not need a warrant exception at all.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    In any event, it is undisputed that in this case the state had both probable cause and exigent circumstances, and it is unnecessary to ground police authority to conduct the search (the breath test) on the dubious concept of implied consent as a source of constitutional authorization. Thus, under the implied-consent statutes, and under\n    Article I, section 9, there was no impediment to the state requiring defendant to submit to a breath test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Here, I reach the point upon which this case turns. The state argues that the second step of the implied-consent process that I have outlined above, where the suspect is asked to submit to a breath test, is a request to physically cooperate in the administration of the test, and not a request for defendant to give constitutionally sufficient\n    <em>\n     consent\n    </em>\n    to a search that otherwise would violate Article I, section 9. Defendant argues, however, that he was asked to consent to an otherwise unconstitutional search and that his refusal to do so cannot be used against him. The disagreement at the heart of this case, then, is whether an officer's request under ORS 813.100(2) is a request for consent to a search or a request for physical compliance in the administration of the breath test. If the state is correct, then defendant simply was not asked to consent at all, and his refusal was not an exercise of his Article I, section 9, rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    I agree with the majority that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    \"an officer's question to a driver asking whether the driver will take a breath test may be either (1) a request under ORS 813.140 for express consent to search the driver's breath that, if given, will supply a constitutional basis for the test; or (2) a request under ORS 813.100 that the driver 'submit' to a breath test that finds its constitutional justification elsewhere.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    364 Or. at 342,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20P.3d%20367\">\n     434 P.3d 367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -68. Because that question is more central to how I would resolve this case, and because various particulars of the statute play into my disagreement with the majority, I discuss that statutory question in some detail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The unambiguous text of Oregon's implied-consent statutes draws a consistent distinction between a request to\n    <em>\n     submit\n    </em>\n    to a breath test under ORS 813.100(2) and a request for the kind of express\n    <em>\n     consent\n    </em>\n    necessary to satisfy Article I, section 9. As discussed above, ORS 813.100(1) provides, in part, that when the requisite conditions are met \"[a] test\n    <em>\n     shall be administered\n    </em>\n    upon the request of a police officer.\" (Emphasis added.) ORS 813.100(2) creates an exception to that otherwise mandatory rule:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    \"No chemical test of the person's breath or blood shall be given, under subsection (1) of this section * * * if the person\n    <em>\n     refuses the request of a police officer to submit\n    </em>\n    to the chemical test after the person has been informed of consequences and rights as described under ORS 813.130.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Put together, the first two subsections of ORS 813.100 create a dichotomy between cases where the test \"shall be administered\" and those where the suspect \"refuses the request of a police officer to submit\" to a chemical test. The statute thus treats compliance as the default and carves out an exception for refusal. That choice of words suggests that the administering officer's \"request\" is intended only to determine whether the suspect will submit to or refuse to participate in the administration of the test, and perhaps to persuade him not to refuse; it was not designed to obtain the suspect's consent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cabanilla\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/#p632\">\n     351 Or. at 634-35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/#p632\">\n     273 P.3d 125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he legislative history of ORS 813.130 [setting out the rights and consequences to be read to a suspect] suggests that the legislature's concern in enacting that statute was mainly with devising a simple form to serve as a persuasive tool to compel submission to the tests.\"). That reading is bolstered by the structure of ORS 813.100, discussed above, which takes for granted that the suspect already has \"consented\" simply by driving. As I outlined above, asking a suspect to give a breath sample under ORS 813.100(1) - (2) is a second step that is meant to take place only after the state has obtained constitutional authorization for the search. Thus, not only does nothing in ORS 813.100(2) indicate that the officer's request is intended to elicit a waiver of constitutional rights, but the logic of the statute dictates that such a waiver would be unnecessary at that point.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Moreover, other portions of the implied-consent laws do discuss situations where an officer requests or obtains a waiver of the suspect's Article I, section 9, rights, and do so in quite different terms. ORS 813.140 states,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    \"Nothing in ORS 813.100 is intended to preclude the administration of a chemical test described in this section.

The words \"expressly consents\" in ORS 813.140 contrast with the implied (or \"deemed\") consent of ORS 813.100(1), and the alternate option of \"refusal\" of an officer's \"request,\" in ORS 813.100(2). That contrast is made explicit by ORS 813.310 :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    \"If a person\n    <em>\n     refuses to submit\n    </em>\n    to a chemical test under ORS 813.100 or\n    <em>\n     refuses to consent\n    </em>\n    to chemical tests under ORS 813.140, evidence of the person's refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving a motor vehicle on premises open to the public or the highways while under the influence of intoxicants.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    (Emphases added.)

But that the statute gives suspects a\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n    right, and directs officers to respect the exercise of that right, does not entail that a request under the statute asks suspects to waive a\n    <em>\n     constitutional\n    </em>\n    right. Thus, an officer's request under ORS 813.100 is not intended to elicit actual, or express, consent, but something akin to compliance-compliance, subject to a statutory right not to comply. For that reason, an affirmative response to an officer's request under ORS 813.100, or a subsequent blow into a breathalyzer, is not a waiver of constitutional rights or express consent to the search.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    An affirmative response is best parsed as \"Yes, I will submit to the search\"-all that the officer is asking-not \"Yes, I will consent to the search.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The majority, however, concludes that defendant was not given a request under\n    ORS 813.100 at all-or at least that the state has not proven that he was. The majority states,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    \"Defendant does not take issue with that notion [that a refusal to physically cooperate may be introduced at trial], nor does he argue that the consequence that ORS 813.310 imposes for failure to submit under ORS 813.100 is unlawful. Rather, he contends only that the consequence that ORS 813.310 imposes for failure to give express consent under ORS 813.140 is unconstitutional. And, he argues, he understood [the officer's] question as seeking the latter and not the former.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    That is something of a charitable reconstruction of defendant's argument because defendant never cited ORS 813.140 in his briefing, or argued that the officer's request\n    was something other than a request under ORS 813.100. Instead, he argued before this court that ORS 813.130 -the statute establishing \"the requirements for information about rights and consequences for purposes of ORS 813.100,\" ORS 813.130 -\"creates incentives for a defendant to consent to a breath test.\" That argument is mistaken because, as discussed above, ORS 813.100 and ORS 813.130 are geared toward obtaining physical compliance, not consent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In any event, there should be no doubt in this case that the officer's request was made pursuant to ORS 813.100. Here, the officer's request followed a recitation of rights and consequences, as required by ORS 813.100(1) - (2) but not by ORS 813.140. While reading that warning, the officer spoke in the language of ORS 813.100(2), informing defendant that he was \"about to be asked to submit to a breath test.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nowhere in the request did the officer ask defendant for \"consent\" or otherwise indicate that he was seeking consent. Most tellingly of all, two of the consequences of refusal that defendant was read, including a $650 fine and a driver's license suspension, may be imposed only as a consequence for a refusal to submit under ORS 813.100, not for a refusal to consent under ORS 813.140.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ORS 813.095(1) (fine), ORS 813.100(3) (license suspension). Most of the warning that defendant was read concerned those two consequences. Based on that evidence, I have no difficulty concluding that the officer's request was made under ORS 813.100(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The majority does not discuss any of that evidence. Instead, it focuses on the officer's final phrasing of the request: \"[W]ill you take a breath test?\" 364 Or. at 343, 434 P.3d at 368 and on what the officer\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    say: \"[the officer] told defendant that he would be asked to submit to a breath test 'under the implied consent law,' but he did not specify the aspect of the implied-consent law to which he was referring.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    But what matters is whether the officer's request, taken as a whole, was ambiguous, not whether particular lines are ambiguous out of context. The phrasing of the officer's final question is\n    not ambiguous if, as here, it is asked of a suspect who has just been informed that he is \"about to be asked to submit to a breath test.\" Even if the officer did not explicitly mention ORS 813.100, the use of the word \"submit,\" the reading of rights and consequences as required by ORS 813.100(1) - (2), and the focus on consequences that can only be imposed upon a refusal of a request under ORS 813.100 make it clear that that the officer was making a request under ORS 813.100. In this case, there was ample evidence that the officer was requesting defendant's physical compliance with the breath test and no evidence whatsoever that he was requesting consent. Even if the state bears a burden of proving that the request was made under ORS 813.100, 364 Or. at 343, 434 P.3d at 368, surely that burden was carried here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    For that reason, I conclude that defendant was not asked to give constitutionally valid consent. All he was asked to do was physically to participate in the administration of the breath test. Defendant exercised not a constitutional right, but a statutory right, to refuse the search.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Thus, the question that defendant asks us to decide, whether introduction of his exercise of a constitutional right can be used as evidence against him in a criminal case, simply is not presented here. The question is,\n    instead, whether defendant's assertion of a\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n    right can be introduced as evidence against him in a criminal case. Because defendant was not asked to give consent to a search, did not consent to a search, and no search was performed, his Article I, section 9, rights would not be burdened, much less violated, by the introduction of defendant's exercise of the statutory right as evidence of his guilt.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The majority's decision may do more harm than good for the rights of suspects. Recall that, in impaired driving cases where a suspect has been arrested, probable cause and exigent circumstances are almost always present, and\n    an order by an officer to a suspect to submit to a chemical test would not ordinarily present constitutional problems. The legislature extended to suspects the right to refuse a breath test with the intent of avoiding the use of physical force or criminal penalties against suspects who refuse to participate in the testing procedure. Such an approach is likely to reduce the unnecessary use of force by police and prevent confrontations that may endanger officers and suspects alike. But, in the majority's analysis, it appears that the statutory right, and the attendant fact that the officer requested rather than demanded defendant's compliance, is a source of the ambiguity that requires evidence of defendant's refusal to be excluded. By turning a statutory right into a source of constitutional difficulty for the state, the majority makes the further creation of such statutory rights less likely. I would avoid those difficulties, hold that the officer's request, understood in the context of the statutory framework, was not a request for defendant's consent to a search, and affirm defendant's conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Nakamoto, J., joins in this dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-115\">\n     Of course, if the officer conducts a search (a blood draw, for example) based solely on the exigency, which does justify it, then the evidence discovered as a result of the search will be admissible even though the defendant's refusal to consent will not be.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-117\">\n     I note that this position appears to be a developing consensus in other states.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      State v.
