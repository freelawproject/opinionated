Dao, M.D. (\n   <strong>\n    Dao\n   </strong>\n   ) in violation of certain provisions of the Land Use Ordinance\n   <strong>\n    (LUO)\n   </strong>\n   of the City and County of Honolulu, codified as Revised Ordinances of Honolulu\n   <strong>\n    (ROH)\n   </strong>\n   Chapter 21 (1990).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dao appeals from the Final Judgment\n   <strong>\n    (Judgment)\n   </strong>\n   entered on July 29, 2015, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit\n   <strong>\n    (Circuit Court).\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On secondary appeal, Dao contends that the Circuit Court erred in affirming the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City and County of Honolulu\n   <strong>\n    (ZBA)\n   </strong>\n   , which upheld the actions of the Director\n   <strong>\n    (Director)\n   </strong>\n   of the Department of Planning and Permitting of the City and County of Honolulu\n   <strong>\n    (DPP)\n   </strong>\n   . Dao requests that this court vacate the decision of the Circuit Court and enter judgment in favor of Dao, vacating two Notices of Order issued by the Director against him. In the alternative, Dao requests that judgment be entered in favor of Dao and against the Director, vacating the first Notice of Order and reducing the civil fines imposed by the second Notice of Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that: (1) a transient vacation unit rental violation cannot be established based solely on a DPP inspector's report of a conversation with an unidentified person who is encountered at a subject property; (2) if an agency's factual determination that a violation occurred and is continuing is not grounded in reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, including any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, then the agency's decision may be determined to be clearly erroneous and therefore unjust and unreasonable in its consequences, warranting reversal or modification; (3) in this case, the Director permissibly determined that notwithstanding the existence of written rental agreements for periods of thirty or more days, based on the parties' actual intent, understanding, agreement, and undertaking, Dao had in fact provided a dwelling unit or lodging unit to transient occupants for less than thirty days; (4) the LUO's prohibition of transient vacation unit rentals in residential districts is violated when, and only during the period that, the prohibited use occurs; and (5) although we note that the Director's discretion to determine an appropriate fine for a violation of the LUO must be exercised within the parameters stated in the DPP's administrative rules, because the fines levied against Dao are vacated on other grounds, we need not reach the issue of whether the amounts levied were improper. As explained below, we conclude that the ZBA and the Circuit Court erred in affirming Dao's first alleged transient vacation rental unit violation, and this case must be remanded for further proceedings to re-determine the period of Dao's second alleged violation, as well as the fines stemming from the second alleged transient vacation rental unit violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Alleged Violations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dao is the owner of a residential property on Kamehameha Highway in Haleiwa, Hawai'i (the\n   <strong>\n    Property)\n   </strong>\n   . On October 3, 2011, the DPP received a complaint from the public alleging that unlawful transient vacation rentals were taking place at the Property. DPP Inspector Todd Labang\n   <strong>\n    (Labang)\n   </strong>\n   responded to the complaint by conducting an inspection of the Property on October 12, 2011, where he spoke with a man who did not identify himself. The unidentified man reportedly told Labang that he was renting the Property from October 11, 2011, through October 13, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On behalf of the Director, Labang issued a DPP Notice of Violation No. 2011/NOV-10-082\n   <strong>\n    (NOV #1)\n   </strong>\n   on October 13, 2011. The notice was addressed to Dao and specified that the dwelling on the Property was being used as a transient vacation unit without a nonconforming use certificate, in violation of ROH \u00a7\u00a7 21-3.70-1 and 21-4.110-1 (1990).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   notice instructed Dao to \"restore the area immediately and complete all work within 30 days\" and to call Labang \"after the corrections have been made\" or civil fines would be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 20, 2011, Dao sent a letter to Labang confirming receipt of NOV #1 and stating that he only had long-term renters on the Property and many guests during the surfing season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It appears that on November 30, 2011, Labang reinspected the Property. No one was present at the Property on November 30, 2011. According to his Inspector's Report, the reinspection \"revealed no change.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 14, 2011, the Director issued Notice of Order No. 2011/NOO-289 (\n   <strong>\n    NOO #1\n   </strong>\n   ), which ordered Dao to (1) pay an initial fine of $1,000 by January 17, 2012, and (2) correct the violation by December 29, 2011. NOO #1 stated that if the correction was not completed by that date, daily fines of $1,000 would be assessed until the correction was completed. The notice also specified that Dao \"was responsible for contacting the inspector ... to verify the corrective action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 16, 2011, Dao re-submitted his letter dated October 20, 2011, attaching a \"rental agreement statement by tenant and bank statement of funds deposited for her payment.\" The \"rental agreement statement\" was purportedly an e-mail from Monika Iseli\n   <strong>\n    (Iseli)\n   </strong>\n   , stating that she rented the Property from October 3, 2011, through November 7, 2011. The \"bank statement\" indicated that Iseli paid $6,869.00 on September 2, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to a further Inspector's Report, on December 30, 2011, Labang reinspected the Property and determined that the violation was corrected because \"[t]he people who were there previously moved out\" and Dao had \"provided a rental contract and proof of payment for the new occupant[ ] of the dwelling, Benedict Strasser.\" This written contract\n   <strong>\n    (Strasser Lease)\n   </strong>\n   was dated December 22, 2011, and provided that Strasser paid $3,077.59 to rent the Property from December 22, 2011, through January 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It appears based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   Labang's notes that on January 10, 2012, the DPP received another complaint from the public requesting investigation into alleged transient vacation rentals on the Property. On January 11, 2012, Labang inspected the Property again. According to the Inspector's Report, this inspection revealed that the dwelling was \"being rented by the Lawson [Heath] family from Australia for 3 days\" and that \"Mr. Lawson [Heath] said they are not renting for 30 days.\" The report noted that these were different people than those who were identified in the Strasser Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 12, 2012, for the Director, Labang issued Notice of Violation No. 2012/NOV-01-080\n   <strong>\n    (NOV #2)\n   </strong>\n   . NOV #2 differed from NOV #1 in designating the violation as a \"recurring violation\" requiring immediate correction \"within 0 days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 17, 2012, Dao sent a Petition for Appeal to the ZBA regarding NOV #1, NOO #1, and NOV #2. Dao's petition asserted,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the \"appeal is to verify that the Director's actions are based on an erroneous findings of material facts, and has acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and manifestly abused his discretion in imposing this fine.\" In the petition, Dao detailed his prior communications with Labang. Dao stated that upon contacting Labang regarding NOV #1, Labang asked for a rental agreement and proof of payment. After Dao submitted the e-mail from Iseli,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Labang told him that the e-mail was not sufficient and requested a rental agreement for a new tenant. Dao noted that after he provided the Strasser Lease, which corrected the violation underlying NOV #1 and NOO #1, he received a letter from the DPP dated January 5, 2012, which stated that the initial fine was still due and owing. Regarding NOV #2, Dao\n   stated that \"[t]he current tenant is renting a separate room from the previously mentioned tenant, both have valid rental agreements, for rental for 30 days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 23, 2012, the Director issued DPP Notice of Order No. 2012/NOO-011\n   <strong>\n    (NOO #2)\n   </strong>\n   , which ordered Dao to (1) pay an initial fine of $1,000 by February 23, 2012, and (2) correct the violation by January 30, 2012. Like NOO #1, NOO #2 informed Dao that daily fines of $1,000 would be assessed if the violation was not corrected by the date specified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 30, 2012, Dao sent a letter to Labang confirming receipt of NOV #2 and stating that Dao only had long-term renters on the Property. Attached to this letter were purported bank statements showing deposits of $1,288.90 and $872.79 dated December 8, 2011, and August 31, 2011, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 2, 2012, Dao sent a thirty-day rental contract and proof of payment to Labang which provided that Lawson Heath\n   <strong>\n    (Heath)\n   </strong>\n   was renting the Property from January 9, 2012, through February 9, 2012\n   <strong>\n    (Heath Lease)\n   </strong>\n   . The Heath Lease was dated January 9, 2012, and indicated that Heath had paid $1,655.54. After noting in his report that the Heath Lease conflicted with the Strasser Lease, Labang determined that the violation underlying NOV #2 and NOO #2 was not corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to his notes, on February 8, 2012, Labang reinspected the Property and found that the dwelling was \"being rented by Tim Crane\n   <strong>\n    [Crane]\n   </strong>\n   and his girlfriend, Jessie Robinson,\" from February 6, 2012, through February 10, 2012, with no thirty-day rental contract. Labang noted that the violation was not corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 22, 2012, Dao sent a second Petition for Appeal to the ZBA regarding NOV #1, NOO #1, NOV #2, and NOO #2. This petition re-asserted the facts as they had been described in the first petition and asserted that ROH \u00a7 21-5.550\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   was implicated in this matter. In addition, Dao stated that \"multiple attempts have been made to try and show the Inspector the rental agreements of each tenant via fax and telephone messages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 5, 2012, John M. Friedel, for the Director, sent a letter to Dao stating that the violation underlying NOV #2 and NOO #2 was corrected on April 2, 2012, when a re-inspection of the Property revealed that \"the transient vacation use was discontinued and the dwelling was occupied by the owner.\" The letter also notified Dao that \"[a]lthough the violation was resolved, the $1,000 initial fine and daily fines [of] $62,000 remain unpaid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter noted that the DPP would accept $16,500 in settlement of the outstanding fines because the violation was corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Contested Case Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 27, 2012, the ZBA notified Dao that the ZBA would hold a contested case hearing to consider his petition of appeal filed on January 17, 2012. On February 24, 2012, the ZBA notified Dao that the ZBA would hold a contested case hearing to consider his petition filed on February 22, 2012. The latter notice specified that the issue to be addressed in the appeal was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Whether the action of the Director in issuing Notice of Order Nos. 2011/NOO-289 and 2012/NOO-011 for violations of ROH Sections 21-3.70-1 and 21-4.110-1 was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or whether the Director acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, or manifestly abused his discretion[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 8, 2012, the ZBA consolidated Dao's two appeals. On April 23, 2012, the\n   contested case hearing was rescheduled to July 12, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 25, 2012, Dao filed his Position Statement. In his Position Statement, Dao re-asserted the facts as they were described in his petitions for appeal. In addition, Dao asserted that he rented rooms on his Property for thirty days or more pursuant to ROH \u00a7 21-5.550. Attached to his Position Statement were the Strasser Lease, the Heath Lease, a Rental Agreement from Crane\n   <strong>\n    (Crane Lease)\n   </strong>\n   , and e-mails from the Strassers and Crane stating that they had rented specific rooms. The Crane Lease provided that Crane had paid $2,018.90 to rent the Property for thirty-one days beginning on February 6, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 3, 2012, the Director filed a Position Statement. The Director argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the issuance of NOO #1 and NOO #2 was not based on an erroneous finding of fact and that the actions of the Director were rational based on the site inspections and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After a further rescheduling, on August 9, 2012, the contested case hearing took place. Dao, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , called himself and Iseli as witnesses. DPP Inspector Colin Ishikawa (\n   <strong>\n    Ishikawa\n   </strong>\n   ), neighbors Joyce Farrell (\n   <strong>\n    Farrell\n   </strong>\n   ) and Beau Sheil (\n   <strong>\n    Sheil\n   </strong>\n   ), and Labang testified on behalf of the Director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding NOV #1 and NOO #1, Dao testified that the unidentified man who had spoken with Labang on October 12, 2011, was a friend who was not renting. Dao further testified that he had created a rental agreement with Iseli after-the-fact to reflect her stay in 2011. Regarding NOV #2, Dao testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Labang did not investigate sufficiently and did not know that we rent several rooms in the home and the tenant that he was inquiring about rents a room separately from the initial tenant and they both had valid rental agreements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   We had multiple attempts to try to show these to Mr. Labang; however, we were not able to give that to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In summarizing his position, Dao stated \"it is likely that the [DPP] has not been provided with all the facts and, therefore ... the director acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and manifestly abused his discretion in not closing this file.\" Following Dao's testimony, the Director objected to Exhibits I, J, K, and L\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Dao's Position Statement on the grounds that they were not provided to the Director \"during the course of the events.\" The Director's objections were noted, but not sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On cross-examination, Dao confirmed that he did not have a nonconforming use certificate allowing rentals of his Property for less than thirty days. Upon further questioning, Dao testified that his tenants \"would rent for the month,\" that they \"were there during the 30 days at some point,\" but \"if they left early then they would have left early.\" Dao further testified that he \"did not have leases at the time\" and \"started creating leases after Mr. Labang asked [him] to.\" Counsel for the Director then questioned Dao regarding the various amounts paid for the leases, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] So the amounts that they paid for their lease, does that reflect the value based on your property for a 30-day rental or for the amount of time that they expected to stay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Dao:] It could be either.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:] Do you have a set room rate for each room?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Dao:] In general we do, but we do vary that sometimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:] Okay. What accounts for the variance? Ms. Iseli, for example, paid about $196 per day whereas Mr. Heath paid about $51 per day. It's almost a quarter less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Dao:] Just depends if we know the person, you know. If they're a friend of a person we may give them a discount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:] I see.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Dao:] If they think they may be leaving early.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:] ... So just to be clear, your testimony is that you had a prior understanding that these folks-Strasser, Heath and Crane-were staying for less than 30 days but you entered into a lease term of 30 days?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Dao:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Upon follow-up questions from the ZBA, Dao further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE CHAIR:\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And you said that you gained a lot of your tenants from a website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [Dao:] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE CHAIR: What website is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [Dao:] We use homeaway.com and VRBO.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE CHAIR: ... V-R-B-O?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [Dao:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE CHAIR: Is that an abbreviation for something?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Dao:] Vacation rental by owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dao also testified that he spent an average of four nights a week at the Property, and a caretaker and family member lived at the Property while Dao was away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ishikawa testified that inspections are triggered primarily by complaints from the public. Upon cross-examination, Ishikawa further testified that with the type of violations at issue, the DPP will \"accept a 30-day contract with proof of payment,\" but \"during that 30-day period, nobody else can be in that house.\" Ishikawa also confirmed that rental situations involving no written rental agreement are \"very common,\" elaborating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   We make an inspection of the people. I ask them if they're renting. We ask them if they have a 30-day contract. If they have a 30-day contract, we don't do anything. If they don't have a 30-day contract, they say they're renting for less than 30 days, we'll issue a notice of violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Upon further questioning, Ishikawa confirmed that the basis of NOO #1 was the statement given to Labang by the unidentified man who said he rented the Property from October 11 through October 13, 2011. Ishikawa also confirmed that the primary basis of NOO #2 was the rental of the Property by the Strassers and the Lawsons. Upon recross-examination, Ishikawa confirmed that the DPP will issue a notice of violation even where the renter does not provide identification. On redirect, Ishikawa testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:] What if somebody provided you with a lease for more than 30 days and also a sworn statement that they never intended to rent for that period of time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [Ishikawa:] ... I think that'll be a violation if they provide us a written statement saying that they're not going to rent for 30 days. I think that'll be a violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Labang also testified regarding the standard process for transient vacation rental inspections, which are unannounced. Labang testified that the \"objective is to meet with somebody at the Property and to determine whether or not they are renting the Property and for how long.\" Further, \"[o]ne of the first questions [he asks] is if the person is the owner of the Property. If they are not, [he asks] if the owner is present or staying at the Property.\" When asked whether inspectors have \"any ability to ask for identification,\" Labang testified that he \"can ask,\" but that he \"can't get it out of them\" if they do not wish to be identified. Regarding the unidentified man who was at the Property on October 12, 2011, Labang testified that this person said he was renting the Property and that he did not know the owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Labang also testified that Dao's letter of October 20, 2011, which stated that there was no vacation rental, was not acceptable as a valid means of correcting the violation. Labang testified that he had explained to Dao that the DPP \"would either need a 30-day contract with the occupant's-the renter's names on it as well as proof of payment for that time period or [Labang] would need to perform a site inspection to verify that the dwelling was vacant.\" Labang also testified that Dao's re-submission of the same letter\n   with an e-mail and bank statement from Iseli attached was also not sufficient because \"that was not a valid rental contract and ... it would need to be a valid rental contract for it to be corrected.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Labang confirmed that the violation underlying NOO #1 was corrected based on the Strasser Lease, but testified that had he known the Strasser Lease was made with the understanding that Strasser would be staying less than 30 days, then he would not have accepted the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Regarding NOV #2, Labang testified that a \"recurring violation\" means \"it was the second time [the DPP] issued for the same violation,\" therefore Dao \"was given zero days to correct it and it was automatically referred for civil fines.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Labang testified that he did not accept the Heath Lease as a correction of the violation because there was overlap with the Strasser Lease, which is a violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The ZBA asked Labang a number of follow-up questions regarding why the overlap in the leases constituted a violation. Upon questioning, Labang confirmed that he enforces DPP policy such \"that when the lease does not specify a particular part of the property, that that is construed to mean the entire property.\" Labang also confirmed that the DPP viewed Dao's Property as a single dwelling\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"based upon what [the Property] was initially constructed as or permitted as.\" This view, coupled with the fact that the leases did not specify rented rooms, led to the conclusion that \"when the Strassers rented the property, they rented the whole house.\" Labang confirmed that this meant that \"even if [the Strassers] left early, the house should have been vacant until January 21st, 2012,\" but instead Labang reinspected the Property on January 11, 2012, and found the Heath family at the Property and received a statement from Heath that they were renting for about three days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Farrell, who lived \"directly next door,\" testified that Dao did not live at the Property and that the number of cars driving down their dead-end street had \"increased decidedly,\" with twenty-three different cars staying at the Property overnight over an eight-week period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farrell estimated an average of three or four different cars per week would stay overnight. Upon further questioning, Farrell testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [Mr. Jayaram:] How do you know they weren't there for the day, to spend the day at the beach as guests of Dr. Dao?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [Ms. Farrell:] I'll see a car-it's a rent-a-car-come in and I see people open their trunk and I see them take luggage out and they walk into one of the places. And then three or four days later they come out and they put their luggage in their trunks and they drive out and then I don't see that car again.

The Sheils sent their car logs to the DPP on a weekly basis beginning with the week of January 10, 2012. During the period from January 10 through January 21, 2012, the period covered by the Strasser Lease, Sheil counted four different cars staying overnight at the Property that were all new to the neighborhood, with each car staying less than three days. Between January 9 and February 7, 2012, which was the period covered by the Heath Lease, Sheil testified that thirteen different cars were observed to stay at the Property overnight, with none of them staying longer than seven days. For the period of the Crane Lease, which commenced on February 6, 2012, Sheil testified that he and his neighbors logged fourteen different cars staying overnight over the thirty-one days, with none staying longer than seven days. In addition, for that period there was never an absence of cars. When asked what kind of cars were observed, Sheil clarified that they were all rental cars and \"recently-registered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Sheil confirmed that Dao visited the Property about four days a week, but Sheil also testified that Dao did not stay overnight very often, estimating \"maybe half a dozen times in the last six months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   At the conclusion of the contested case hearing, the ZBA orally denied both of Dao's appeals. A ZBA Board member moved for the denial of the first appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   When the notice of violation was issued, it created a situation where the owners-the owner now has the burden to produce evidence that the inspection produced the wrong result. And we have not been presented with and we have not seen any evidence to rebut the inspection result which was that that was being used by a short-term renter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The same ZBA Board member moved for the denial of the second appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Under the same situation, upon issuance of the notice of violation, it became incumbent upon the owner to rebut the violation. That violation related specifically to the inspection which was conducted on January 11, 2012 where the inspector talked to Mr. Lawson Heath....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   And we have two situations, the testimony and the evidence with respect to the note ... that the inspector spoke to Mr. Heath. Mr. Heath told him he was staying only for three days and was leaving on January 12 and was not renting for 30 days and had no contract. So we have that testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   We also have testimony from the petitioner that Mr. Lawson Heath signed the lease ... on January 9th and he met with Mr. Lawson Heath on that day to sign this contract. To me those are totally irreconcilable differences. How could Mr. Heath sign this on January 9th, yet two days later when he talked to the inspector admit that he signed no lease, that he was staying not for 30 days but for three days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   In such a situation, my view on that point is that we got to believe somebody and not believe somebody else. In that case, I'm believing as credible Mr. Labang and not believing as not credible Dr. Dao on that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Both motions were seconded and approved by the ZBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On July 12, 2013, the ZBA filed its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order\n   <strong>\n    (ZBA Order)\n   </strong>\n   .

The subject Property is within a residential district.

Dao argues that no violation was established based on the inspector's visit on October 12, 2011, because: (1) the person who Labang spoke with refused to identify himself, thus leaving Dao unable to specifically respond to the allegation; (2) Dao testified that there was no such renter, but that he had allowed various friends to use the Property during the winter months and that the person at the Property on that day must have been a friend who had not paid any money; and (3) there was no evidence whatsoever that the unnamed person paid money to Dao.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The ZBA found and concluded that the Director's issuance of NOO #1 was not based on an erroneous finding of a material fact. The Director argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Dao failed to carry the heavy burden to demonstrate that ZBA's finding was clearly erroneous in view of the \"reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Regarding Dao's first argument-that no violation was established based on Labang's October 12, 2011 discussion with an unidentified person at the Property-we note Labang's testimony was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   I went out to [the Property] and I spoke to a gentleman who told me that he was renting the property from October 11, 2011 through October 13, 2011. I asked the gentleman if he would identify himself. He did not. He said also there was someone else renting the property upstairs but he did not know how long the person was renting for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   I asked the person if he had a 30-day contract, rental contract. He said he did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   (Format altered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Labang also testified that the unidentified person said that the owner was not present at the Property. On cross-examination, Labang again stated that he spoke to a gentleman, who did not identify himself. Labang testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   I asked him if he was the owner of the property. He said he was not. I asked him if he was renting the property. He said he was. I asked him if the owner was present at the property. He said he was not. And I asked him how long he was staying. He gave me the dates he was staying. I asked him if he had a 30-day contract. He said he had no 30-day contract. And so based on that information, we issued the notice of violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   (Format altered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   When asked by Dao whether he could give Dao any more information about the person, Labang responded, \"I cannot tell you any more information about the person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   With respect to NOO #1, Ishikawa testified that the DPP received a telephone complaint regarding the Property on October 3, 2011, but Ishikawa declined to identify the complainant. Ishikawa testified that the October 3rd complaint was the first complaint received concerning the Property. There was no other testimony or evidence of the violation stated in NOO #1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Under the clearly erroneous standard, the ZBA's finding and conclusion that the Property was being operated as a transient vacation unit on October 12, 2011, thereby violating the LUO, must be upheld if it \"supported by 'reliable, probative, and substantial\n   evidence' on the whole record.\"\n   <em>\n    Price v.

The record before the ZBA does not contain reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supporting its conclusion that an LUO violation, as set forth in NOO #1, in fact occurred on October 12, 2011. The only evidence in the record is Labang's testimony that an unidentified male, in essence, stated that a violation occurred. Labang reported no corroborating personal observations, did not talk to any of Dao's neighbors at that time, and did not otherwise investigate or seek to verify the unidentified man's statement. There are no details of a monetary transaction or other indicia of compensation or any other supporting details or evidence of any kind. We recognize that \"[t]he admission of irrelevant or incompetent matter before an administrative agency does not constitute reversible error if there is substantial evidence in the record to sustain the agency's determination.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surfrider Found. v.

However, in this case, there is no other evidence whatsoever supporting the ZBA's finding and conclusion concerning NOO #1.

Therefore, on this basis, we vacate the Circuit Court's Judgment and the ZBA Order to the extent that they found and concluded that the Director's issuance of NOO #1 was not clearly erroneous and that Dao's appeal of NOO #1 must be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    NOO #2 and Dao's Continuing Violation Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In his first point of error, Dao also challenges the ZBA's findings and conclusions upholding NOO #2. However, Dao does not appear to argue on appeal to this court that the evidence supporting the violation cited in NOO #2 was of insufficient quality or probative value to establish any violation of the LUO; rather, Dao argues that there was no evidence of a \"continuing violation\" from the time that Labang visited the Property on January 11, 2012, until the DPP deemed the violation corrected as of April 2, 2012, which was based on an inspection that showed that Dao was occupying the Property as of April 2, 2012. This argument is also addressed, in part, in Dao's second and third points of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Dao argues that transient vacation rentals cannot be deemed \"continuing violations\" in the same manner that many other types of LUO violations might be viewed as continuing violations. This argument is perhaps best understood, in the first instance, in a hypothetical context. The thrust of this argument is that transient vacation rentals are inherently transitory, and if a unit is rented out for three days and discontinued thereafter, then the LUO violation is continuing for three days and not for thirty days or sixty days or some other period of time. Whereas, for example, if a structure projects into a required yard or height setback, that violation arguably is continuing until the structure is removed or the violation is otherwise remedied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Director argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that there was sufficient evidence to support that an illegal vacation rental was being conducted during this period of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Director\n   further submits that once a notice of violation was issued, it was Dao's responsibility to demonstrate that there was no violation or that it was corrected, apparently relying on the cases cited elsewhere in its brief that an agency's decision \"carries a presumption of validity and appellant has the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that the decision is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v.

This latter proposition is well-established in Hawai'i law. Nevertheless, if an agency's factual determination that a violation occurred and is continuing is not grounded in reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, including any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, then the agency's decision may be determined to be clearly erroneous and therefore unjust and unreasonable in its consequences, warranting reversal or modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 91-14(g) (5) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 91-14(g) (1)-(4) and (6) (setting forth other statutory grounds for the reversal or modification of agency orders). Accordingly, we turn to the LUO violation set forth in NOO #2, and the evidence supporting that violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   NOO #2 described the violation as a \"Transient vacation use on a residential property without a Nonconforming Use Certificate\" and referenced NOV #2, which cited ROH \u00a7\u00a7 21-3.70-1 and 21-4.110.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As set forth above, pursuant to. ROH \u00a7 21-2.150-2, \"if the director determines that any person is violating any provision of [Chapter 21 of the LUO], ... the director may have the person served ... with a notice of violation and order.\" DPPRPP \u00a7 10-1.01(c) requires,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the order \"state separately each violation [and] ... what corrective action is necessary [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the violation constituted providing a dwelling unit or lodging unit for compensation to transient occupants for less than thirty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ROH \u00a7 21-10.1 (defining transient vacation unit; as set forth in n.2 above). NOO #2 further described the violation as a \"1st Recurring Violation.\" DPPRPP \u00a7 1-1 defines recurring violation as \"a repetition of the same type of violation of the [LUO] ..., at the same location, by the same responsible party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   At the ZBA's August 9, 2012 contested case hearing on Dao's appeal from NOO #1 and NOO #2, the following evidence was adduced by the Director regarding the factual determination of the violation stated in NOO #2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Ishikawa testified that Dao does not have a nonconforming use certificate that would allow transient vacation rentals at the Property. He also testified that there were two complaints to the DPP, one on October 3, 2011, by an unnamed person, and one on January 10, 2012, by Farrell and Joanne Martin\n   <strong>\n    (Martin)\n   </strong>\n   . Ishikawa also testified that he thought NOO #2 was based on the rental of the property by the Heath party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Farrell testified that she has lived next door to the Property for over forty years and that she was one of the complainants on January 10, 2012. She testified that \"in the old days\" hardly any cars went down the street and the number of cars has decidedly increased. Farrell said that in an eight-week\n   period, there were about twenty-three different cars that stayed overnight at the Property, about three or four different cars a week overnight. She described them as rental cars, with people taking luggage out and then three or four days later putting luggage back into their trunks. Farrell's initial testimony was not specific as to the time frame of her observations, but she was asked whether between December of 2011 and the first part of March of 2012 there were \"vast periods of time\" when the Property was vacant; she responded no. Relatedly, Farrell was asked if the Property was vacant three out of four weeks for each of those months; again, she answered no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Shell testified that Martin is his wife and, since 2010, they have lived on a private, dead-end road that has eight houses, including Dao's Property. Based on Ishikawa's suggestion on January 10, 2012, Sheil and his wife began keeping track of the cars that stayed overnight at the Property. Sheil was asked about various leases, including the Strasser Lease that ran from December 22, 2011, to January 21, 2012. He noted that he was not keeping track until January 10, 2012, but his recollection was that he saw more than one car during that period. Between January 10 and 21, 2012, he observed four different cars overnight (not counting cars associated with Dao). Sheil was asked next about the period of the Heath Lease that ran from January 9, 2012, to February 7, 2012, and Sheil testified that there were thirteen separate cars observed overnight during that period, none staying longer than seven days. Finally, Shell was asked about the period of the Crane Lease that ran from February 6, 2012, for a period of thirty-one days. During that period, Sheil, his wife, or his neighbors logged fourteen different cars, none staying more than seven days. On cross-examination, Sheil testified they were rental cars, all recently-registered cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Labang testified that NOO #1 was determined to be corrected on January 4, 2012, based on Dao's transmission of the Strasser Lease and proof of payment. He was assigned to reinspect the Property on January 11, 2012, based upon receipt of another complaint. He met with a gentleman, Heath, who explained that he was renting the Property from Dao for three days and that he did not have a 30-day contract. Labang testified that on February 2, 2012, Dao faxed him the Heath Lease and proof of payment, but that because the Heath Lease overlapped with the Strasser Lease, it was considered a violation of the LUO. Dao's explanation to Labang for the overlap was that he had rented out different parts of the house to different people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Labang reinspected the Property on February 8, 2012, at Dao's request, and found Crane was there. Crane told Labang that he and his girlfriend were renting the Property from February 6, to February 10, 2012, and that he did not have a 30-day rental contract. On cross-examination, Labang testified that he did his next and final reinspection on April 2, 2012, and had no recollection of Dao calling much earlier than that date. On questions from the ZBA, Labang testified that, although the zoning would allow a two-family dwelling, the Property was only permitted for a one-family dwelling. Labang further testified that none of the leases provided by Dao specified that the upstairs, the downstairs, or particular rooms were being leased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In addition to the evidence adduced by the Director regarding the factual determination of the violation stated in NOO #2, parts of Dao's own testimony support the Director's factual determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Dao testified that he provided Labang a rental agreement for a rental period from December 22, 2011, to January 21, 2012 (the Strasser Lease), as well as other leases for periods of at least thirty days. On cross-examination, Dao admitted that he does not have a nonconforming use certificate, but said that he rented out rooms pursuant to ROH \u00a7 21-5.550.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dao testified that Strasser\n   did not stay the entire period of the lease, but did not recall how long he stayed. Dao also testified that Heath did not stay the entire time of his rental period, which was from January 9, 2012, to February 9, 2012, but Dao did not recall how long he stayed. In addition, Dao testified that he did not believe Crane stayed the entire period of his rental agreement, which was from February 6, 2012, for a period of thirty-one days. Dao further testified that he had a prior understanding that Heath, Strasser, and Crane would be staying for less than thirty days, but Dao nevertheless entered into thirty-day agreements with each of them. When asked about the different sums charged to the renters, Dao also testified that the length of the stay can be a factor in how he calculated the lease amounts, as well as what room the renters occupied and whether the renters were acquaintances or friends of friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Based on this evidence, we conclude that the Director did not clearly err in NOO #2 in determining that a transient vacation unit use of a residential property without a nonconforming use certificate had occurred at the Property. Although not stated in any rules or written policies and procedures regarding transient vacation unit rentals, we conclude that, in this case, the Direct permissibly determined that notwithstanding the existence of written rental agreements for periods of thirty or more days, based on the parties' actual intent, understanding, agreement, and undertaking, Dao had in fact provided a dwelling unit or lodging unit to transient occupants for less than thirty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hawaiian Elec.

We hold that the LUO's prohibition of transient vacation rentals in residential districts is violated when, and only during the period that, the prohibited use occurs. No other conclusion is support by the LUO or the DPP's rules. Thus, for a determination that a violation of the LUO occurred for a continuous period of time to be upheld, there must be \"credible evidence of a sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion\" that the violation occurred throughout that period of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surfrider Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310997\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/95/#p107\">\n    136 Hawai'i at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310997\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/95/#p107\">\n    358 P.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Here, in addition to the evidence that the Strasser, Heath, and Crane rentals constituted violations, the testimony of Farrell and Sheil, along with reasonable inferences therefrom, constitute substantial evidence of continuing violations from January 10, 2012, to some time in March of 2012. Farrell's testimony addressed the period between the end of December of 2011 and \"the first part of March\" of 2012. Sheil's testimony arguably addressed the 31-day period that ran from February 6, 2012. No witness was presented or other evidence whatsoever was adduced for any later period. Thus, we conclude that the Director's determination that a violation was continuing throughout the period from January 11, 2012, to April 2, 2012, is not grounded in reliable, probative and substantial evidence, and is therefore clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the ZBA Order and the Circuit Court's Judgment must be vacated\n   and remanded for a re-determination of the period of the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Fines Stemming From NOO #2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Dao argues that the fines levied against him must be reduced. We agree, but for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The Director abused its discretion in levying fines against Dao for NOO #1, as the Director clearly erred in issuing NOO #1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   As to NOO #2, to the extent that the administrative and/or daily fines levied were based on the violation cited in NOO #2 being construed as a \"recurring violation,\" the Director abused its discretion because, with the setting aside of NOO #1, NOO #2 is Dao's initial violation. In addition, the period of that violation must be redetermined. Assuming that the Director again determines that daily., fines from January 31, 2012, to the end of the newly-determined period are warranted, the daily fines must nevertheless be limited to that period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Finally, we note that, notwithstanding the discretion vested in the Director to determine an appropriate fine for a violation of the LUO, that discretion must be exercised within the parameters stated in the DPP's administrative rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DPPRPP \u00a7 10-1. For example, DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3(a) states a range of fines for use violations ranging from $50 to $1,000. While the $1,000 fine levied against Dao does not exceed that range, it appears inconsistent with DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3(b), which states that \"[i]n general, the fine for an initial violation shall be the lowest for that type of violation.\" Although the Director may vary the fine based on the considerations stated in DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3(b)(1-5), there are no reasons stated, either in NOO #2 or elsewhere in the record, for imposing the highest fine, rather than the lowest for the initial violation here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   We further note that DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3(c) specifically contemplates an escalating schedule of administrative fines for\n   <em>\n    recurring\n   </em>\n   violations, from $100 for the first recurrence, $250 for the second, $500 for the third, $750 for the fourth, and $1,000 thereafter. The fine schedule in DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3(c) also reflects a slower graduation of fines for use violations, as opposed to, for example, violations of development standards or permit conditions. There is no explanation in the record for the degree of the departure from that schedule for the single violation for which Dao was properly cited, i.e., the violation stated in NOO #2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Similarly, DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3 (e) provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a schedule for daily fines, beginning at $50 a day for the first three months for an initial violation, increasing quarterly, until the daily fine reaches $1,000 a day in the fifteenth month. The same daily fine schedule is stated for the first recurrence, and then is increased and accelerated for subsequent recurrences. Again, although the Director has discretion to determine the appropriateness of a fine based on considerations stated in DPPRPP \u00a7 10-3(g), in this instance there is no rationale stated for the degree of the Director's departure from the daily fine schedule for the single violation for which Dao was properly cited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   However, as the fines levied against Dao are vacated on other grounds and we are remanding this case for redetermination of the fines, we need not reach the issue of whether, in light of the DPP's rules stating its policies as to the imposition of civil fines, the fines levied against Dao were \"[a]rbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 91-14 (g) (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Circuit Court's Judgment and the ZBA's Order are vacated, and pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91-14(g),\n   this case is remanded to the ZBA for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    ROH \u00a7 21-10.1 provides, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n    \"Transient vacation unit\" means a dwelling unit or lodging unit which is provided for compensation to transient occupants for less than 30 days, other than a bed and breakfast home.

However, Dao was self-represented before the ZBA, and upon review of the entire transcript of the ZBA hearing, it appears that Dao attempted to challenge the DPP's findings that he was in violation of the LUO for the entire period that he was assessed daily fines, as well as arguing that his actions should not be construed as violations of the LUO, and that he argued that the Director's actions in assessing the fines were arbitrary and capricious and a manifest abuse of discretion. Represented by counsel on appeal to the Circuit Court, Dao more specifically articulated this argument. On this record, we decline to resolve this appeal by concluding that Dao waived his challenge to the imposition of daily fines for the continuous 62-day period from January 31, 2012, through April 1, 2012.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     O'Connor v.
