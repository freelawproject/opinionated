HSTA does not cite any authority supporting the proposition that its requests to the OCRC pertained to wages, hours, or \"other terms and conditions of employment.\" Rather, HSTA relies on a broad assertion that it has a duty to \"represent\" and \"assist\" the teachers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   without explaining how that assistance relates to its statutory duties under HRS Chapter 89. HSTA also asserts that the Teacher 1 and Teacher 2's \"employment and terms and conditions of employment were in question[.]\" However, HSTA does not explain which terms or conditions of employment those were or otherwise support its assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We reject HSTA's reliance on cases related to a union's \"role\" during an investigatory interview for the proposition that such representation entitles it to information under the duty to bargain in good faith. It is well-established under federal law that Teacher 1 and Teacher 2 had a right to have an HSTA representative at the meeting with the OCRC. Specifically, the right to organize includes the right to have a union representative present at an employer-meeting or interview that the employee reasonably believes could result in disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

In sum, we cannot conclude, based on the authorities cited by HSTA, that HLRB erred in considering the nature and timing of OCRC's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   HSTA also argues that the \"refusal to produce the documents and information' was a wilful violation of Article IV section A\" and that HSTA is entitled to summary judgment on its claim regarding HRS \u00a7 89-13 (a)(8)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Article IV, Section A of the collective bargaining agreement covering the period from July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2009 (\n   <strong>\n    CBA\n   </strong>\n   ), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ARTICLE IV - ASSOCIATION RIGHTS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. EMPLOYER INFORMATION\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to any obligation under Chapter 89, HRS, to furnish information in its possession, the Employer will furnish such other information in its possession, in response to reasonable requests by the Association which will assist the Association in effectively representing the teacher in the collective bargaining process and in the\n   <em>\n    processing of grievances\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   .... The Employer need not perform compilation of facts or information for the purpose of responding to such Association requests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   HSTA failed to establish how its requests were related to assisting it in representing a teacher \"in the collective bargaining process\" or in the \"processing of grievances.\" Grievances are expressly defined in the CBA as claims by HSTA or employees that the Board is not abiding by terms in the CBA. HSTA fails to demonstrate that its requests related to either of these processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, HSTA argues that HLRB erred in granting summary judgment \"in favor of respondents on the merits related to the remaining allegations in CE-05-669,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , interference of employees' rights, refusal or failure to comply with other Chapter 89 and contractual provisions, where material facts were in dispute.\" HSTA asserts that \"[t]he facts related to claims in the complaint such as the prior rights and incorporation provision of the unit 5 agreement (Article XXI) were not ripe for determination given the uncertainty with respect to the scope of the school code, the transition to the standard practices under Article XXI\" and therefore, should not have been decided by summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   HSTA fails to identify what \"material facts\" were still in dispute regarding these topics, or explain how those facts relate to its argument pursuant to HRS \u00a7 89-13(a). HSTA submitted hundreds of pages of argument, declarations, policies, letters, administrative rules, and other evidence to support and defend its position. HLRB received this evidence and argument in advance of the July 29, 2008 hearing, and then HLRB heard both parties' arguments regarding all of the claims. HSTA does not indicate what evidence it did not have the opportunity to produce, or how its \"substantial rights\" may have been prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 91-14(g) (provided that the \"court may ... reverse or modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced\" by legal or factual errors by the administrative agency).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Also, it appears that HSTA argues that provisions in HAR Chapter 41 constitute \"Standard Practices\" within the meaning of Article XXI, Section A, of the CBA which provides that the teachers \"shall retain all rights, benefits and privileges pertaining to their conditions of employment contained in the Standard Practices at the time of the execution of this Agreement.\" Yet, Section B of that article also provides that \"nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as interfering with the Employer's right to make, amend, revise, or delete any portion of the Standard Practices; provided, however, that the Association shall be consulted on any changes to be made.\" Thus, as HLRB concluded, even if HAR Chapter 41 was \"incorporated\" into the agreement, HLRB has a contractual right to change those practices after consulting with HSTA. HSTA did not allege that Respondents violated this part of the CBA by failing to consult with HSTA regarding \"Standard Practices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For these reasons, the Circuit Court's August 25, 2015 Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Honorable Rhonda A.
