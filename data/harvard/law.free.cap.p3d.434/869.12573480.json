(\"RJC\") when she could not make the payments. We restate the issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    1.

(\"Cherry Creek\") to purchase a mobile home in March 2009. The purchase price of the mobile home was $ 53,500. Cherry Creek retained a security interest in the mobile home to secure Kapor's payment obligations. Kapor paid $ 4,280 down and agreed to pay $ 544 per month for fifteen years to pay off the $ 49,220 balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 Cherry Creek assigned the Contract to its parent company, RJC. On multiple occasions, Kapor defaulted on her payment obligations. In March 2015, Kapor voluntarily vacated the mobile home and allowed RJC to take possession of it. When Kapor returned the mobile home to RJC, she owed $ 39,791.80. Kapor signed a Full Release of Contract (the \"Release\"), under which she released all rights to the mobile home. The Release reads in full as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I/We\n   <strong>\n    Deneige Phillips\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   herby [sic] release all rights to the manufactured home located at 4 Skeena St., Billings, MT 59105 described by serial number\n   <strong>\n    HX12359\n   </strong>\n   am [sic] releasing myself and removing my name off the contract currently in place with\n   RJC Investment, Inc. I am fully aware that by signing this I am completely removing my rights to all aspects of the home and I will not be entitled to any rights of this home and or refund of all money applied to the home including but not limited to the down payment, and all payments made on the home and the lot up to this day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Release was executed by Kapor and Roy Clause, the President of RJC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b64 RJC resold the mobile home in April 2015, without notice to Kapor, for $ 53,500, which Kapor alleges is $ 13,708.20 more than the principal she owed when she returned the mobile home. RJC did not refund any surplus to Kapor, and disputes that a surplus was in fact realized. Kapor sued RJC for failing to pay her the surplus allegedly realized on the resale of the mobile home as required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"U.C.C.\"). RJC moved for summary judgment, asserting that the Release terminated the underlying Contract and any further application of U.C.C. Article 9. RJC alternatively asserted that Kapor was equitably estopped from pursuing her claims because she made false representations that she would not pursue her rights under the U.C.C. by signing the Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 The District Court granted RJC's motion for summary judgment on three separate and independent grounds: (1) U.C.C. Article 9 no longer applied after Kapor executed the Release; (2) even if U.C.C. Article 9 applied, the Release constituted an acceptance of the collateral in full satisfaction of the secured obligation; and (3) Kapor's execution of the Release was a representation that equitably estopped her from pursuing the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b66 We review de novo a district court's grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the criteria of M.

The U.C.C. is meant \"to simplify, clarify, and modernize the law governing commercial transactions.\" Section 30-1-102(1)(a), MCA. It must be liberally construed \"to permit the continued expansion of commercial practices through custom, usage, and agreement of the parties\" and \"to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.\" Section 30-1-102(1)(b), (c), MCA. The parties here do not dispute that the U.C.C. governed the original sale of the mobile home and underlying security agreement. The District Court relied on principles of general contract law when it concluded that the Release Kapor signed terminated the U.C.C.'s application because Kapor no longer was a debtor once she relinquished her interest in the mobile home.

The court rejected the notion that the U.C.C. does not allow a mutual release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b611 Title 30, chapter 9A, part 6, MCA, governs default in secured\n   transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sections 30-9A-608(1)(d) and -615(4)(a), MCA, provide that a \"secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus\" from proceeds of the sale of collateral.

The Official Comments to \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA, provide that \"while principles of common law and equity may\n   <em>\n    supplement\n   </em>\n   provisions of the [U.C.C.], they may not be used to\n   <em>\n    supplant\n   </em>\n   its provisions.\" Section 30-1-103, MCA, cmt. 2.1 (emphasis in original). Provisions of the U.C.C. preempt other principles of law even without \"explicit displacement\" in the code's text when those other principles are inconsistent with the purposes, policies, or text of the U.C.C. Section 30-1-103, MCA, cmt. 2.1. The U.C.C.'s provision regarding waiver and variance is specific and displaces general provisions of law regarding release, as it states expressly that a party may not waive her\n   right to recover surplus proceeds of collateral. Section 30-9A-602(5), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b613 The District Court's analysis overlooked the operation of \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA.

Except as allowed under other U.C.C. provisions, that discharge or release cannot, however, waive or vary RJC's duty to account for or Kapor's right to receive any surplus proceeds from the resale of the mobile home.

Kapor's relationship to RJC was one of debtor to creditor through a secured transaction governed by U.C.C. Article 9. When Kapor defaulted on her obligations under the Contract, RJC's rights and responsibilities as a creditor also were governed by U.C.C. Article 9. RJC's argument that Article 9 no longer governed the parties' relationship following execution of the Release is based on its representation that it agreed in the Release \"to absolve [Kapor] from any further contractual obligation she owed to RJC.\" As support for this statement, RJC cites the affidavit of Roy Clause, not any language in the Release itself. The Release did not, by its express terms, lift the parties' relationship from that of debtor and creditor under U.C.C. Article 9 or render obsolete the protections afforded a debtor under \u00a7\u00a7 30-9A-608(1)(d) and -615(4)(a), MCA. We conclude that the District Court erred when it granted RJC summary judgment on the ground that the U.C.C. no longer applied after Kapor signed the Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615\n   <em>\n    2. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the release constituted an acceptance of the collateral in full satisfaction of Kapor's secured obligation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 After a debtor defaults, a secured creditor in possession of the collateral has three options. First, the creditor may file suit on the obligation and reduce its claim to judgment. Section 30-9A-601(1)(a), MCA (a secured party \"may reduce a claim to judgment, foreclose, or otherwise enforce the claim [or] security interest ... by any available judicial procedure\"). Second, the creditor \"may sell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its present condition or following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 30-9A-610(1), MCA. Third, the creditor \"may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures[.]\" Section 30-9A-620(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b617 The District Court held in the alternative that the Release constituted RJC's acceptance of the collateral in full satisfaction of the secured obligation under \u00a7 30-9A-620(1), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Known as strict foreclosure, the statute sets forth \"a procedure by which the secured party acquires the debtor's interest in the collateral without the need for a sale or other disposition\" of the collateral. Section 30-9A-620, MCA, cmt. 2. When strict foreclosure occurs, the secured party loses its right to hold the debtor liable for any deficiency, and the debtor loses its right to a surplus that it would have received had the collateral been disposed of for more than the indebtedness. 9C Frederick H. Miller &amp; Carl S. Bjerre,\n   <em>\n    Uniform Commercial Code Series\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 9-620:1 [Rev] (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b618 Enacted in 1999, the provision replaced former \u00a7 30-9-505, MCA, to eliminate the requirement that the secured party present\n   a \"proposal\" for retention to which the debtor had a fixed time to respond. 1999 Mont. Laws, ch. 305, \u00a7 117. Under prior law, a secured party's delay in disposing of collateral often led to the debtor's claim that the creditor should be deemed to have elected to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. Courts adopted varying approaches to resolving such claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Drayer L. Bott,\n   <em>\n    Commercial Law and Practice Guide\n   </em>\n   ch. 32, \u00a7 32.03[2][b][ii] (Barry L. Zaretsky, Gerald T. McLaughlin, &amp; Neil B. Cohen eds., 2018). Some courts held that \"[a]n election to take the collateral in full satisfaction [of the debt] will not be implied; it must be made by written notice to the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Chrysler Credit Corp. v.

The affidavit, executed after RJC had sold the mobile home for the alleged surplus and after Kapor had instituted this litigation, cannot supply new terms of the unambiguous Release that were omitted when the parties executed it. The District Court commented that parties to a secured transaction should be able to discharge their obligations to one another through a mutual release. True.

RJC argues that by removing her name from the Contract, Kapor represented that she was waiving all of her rights, including non-waivable rights under the U.C.C. RJC claims that it changed its position for the worse because when it sold the mobile home to a third party, it bore the risk that the mobile home may not sell for the outstanding amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b635 As explained above, Kapor's right to a repayment of the surplus could not be waived, and the Release she signed did not transfer risk of deficiency to RJC. What's more, Kapor signed a document prepared by RJC stating that she was removing her name from the Contract and that she would have no rights to the home, or to a refund from\n   payments made on the home or her down payment. The District Court noted that the facts known to Kapor at the time of signing the document were the facts stated in the plain language of the Release. There was no other admissible evidence to suggest what Kapor knew at the time she executed the Release. Kapor expressly knew that she would not be entitled to possess the home or to a refund of any payments she had made. There was no language in the document to suggest that Kapor knew of her rights under the U.C.C. or knew that the Release was an attempt to waive all of her rights under the U.C.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b636 There also is no evidence that RJC changed its position for the worse. After default a secured party has the right to take possession of and sell the collateral. Sections 30-9A-609 and -610, MCA. There is no evidence to suggest that RJC would not have exercised its right to repossess and sell the mobile home, just as it did after the Release was executed. RJC therefore has not proven that any representation Kapor made led it to sell the mobile home to a third party or that it changed its position for the worse based on the Release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b637 Because all six elements of equitable estoppel cannot be satisfied, the District Court erred in granting RJC summary judgment based on its determination that Kapor was equitably estopped from pursuing her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b638 We reverse and vacate the order of summary judgment.

Kapor's summary judgment argument, however, did not raise a new issue; the basis of her complaint was that RJC failed to comply with the governing U.C.C. provisions, and she made the argument that the U.C.C. obligations could not be discharged in response to RJC's claim that the Release terminated the U.C.C.'s application.

However, the Court creates new requirements for parties attempting to terminate a security agreement through \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA (strict foreclosure), by finding RJC did not properly consent to accepting Kapor's mobile home in satisfaction of her obligation to RJC. In doing so, the Court elevates form over substance, overlooking the plain language of the 2015 Agreement and the very reasons RJC and Kapor signed it in the first place. I would find the parties met the requirements under \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, for strict foreclosure. Kapor\n   transferred her rights in the mobile home to RJC in exchange for RJC's discharge of Kapor's obligation. Kapor is not entitled to a surplus from RJC's sale of the mobile home. Therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b640 The parties' initial security agreement for the mobile home placed them squarely within the ambit of Title 30, chapter 9A, MCA. Section 30-9A-109, MCA. The Court soundly analyses why principles of common law and equity cannot supplant provisions of Title 30, MCA. However, the Court's analysis omits \u00a7 30-1-302, MCA, which specifies that parties may, in fact, contract around many provisions of Title 30, MCA. This option for contracting parties merits further discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b641 Under \u00a7 30-1-302, MCA, parties are generally free to vary the provisions of Title 30, MCA, by agreement. Parties may not, however, vary obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, care, or certain other provisions of Title 30, MCA, that prohibit variation by agreement. Section 30-1-302(1), (2), MCA. Section 30-9A-602, MCA, is one such limiting provision-it expressly prevents parties from varying, by agreement, the rules in several statutes regarding default, including \u00a7\u00a7 30-9A-608(1) and -615(4), MCA, \"to the extent that they require accounting for or payment of surplus proceeds of collateral.\" Section 30-9A-602(5), MCA. Sections 30-9A-608(1) and -615(4), MCA, specifically govern a debtor's right to a surplus\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   default, and \u00a7 30-9A-602(5), MCA, prevents the debtor from waiving her right to a surplus if she is in default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-607, MCA (collection and enforcement procedure after default); \u00a7 30-9A-608, MCA (application of proceeds of collection or enforcement after default); \u00a7 30-9A-610, MCA (disposition of collateral after default); \u00a7 30-9A-615, MCA (application of proceeds of disposition of collateral after default). However, no similar right exists when the debtor\n   <em>\n    is not\n   </em>\n   in default: the statutes leave open the possibility that the debtor and creditor could mutually agree to exchange the collateral and terminate their security agreement without triggering \u00a7 30-9A-602(5), MCA. Section 30-9A-602, MCA, simply prevents the parties from waiving or varying-whether as part of their initial security agreement or pursuant to a later agreement-certain rights and duties that arise upon the debtor entering default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b642 After Kapor defaulted on her security agreement with RJC, Kapor and RJC attempted to execute an instrument-the 2015 Agreement-that obviated further rights or duties arising from the initial security agreement between them. RJC argues standard contract rules should apply to the parties' relationship because RJC was no longer a \"secured party\" and Kapor was no longer a \"debtor\" after signing the 2015 Agreement. However,\n   Title 30, chapter 9A, MCA, clearly began regulating their relationship when the parties signed their initial security agreement, and it still regulated their relationship when they signed the 2015 Agreement. When signing the 2015 Agreement, the parties could not, as a matter of law, vary certain provisions of Title 30, MCA, including the rights and duties enumerated in\n   \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA. Section 30-1-302, MCA ; \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA. Yet, to some degree, the 2015 Agreement attempted to do just that. While the parties were generally free to contract around Title 30, MCA, they\n   <em>\n    could not\n   </em>\n   contract around the rights and duties enumerated in \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA. Those rights and duties, which Kapor was entitled to at the time because she was in default, continued beyond the 2015 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b643 RJC also argues, pointing to Comment 3 of \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA, that the general prohibition against waiving certain rights and duties under \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA, should not apply because the 2015 Agreement was an attempt by the parties to settle a claim. Comment 3 states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   This section provides generally that the specified rights and duties \"may not be waived or varied.\" However, it does not restrict the ability of parties to agree to settle, compromise, or renounce claims for past conduct that may have constituted a violation or breach of those rights and duties, even if the settlement involves an express \"waiver.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Section 30-9A-602, MCA, Official Comment 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b644 Comment 3 encourages parties to settle and waive claims for conduct that may have violated the enumerated rights and duties in \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11 Part II David Frisch &amp; Scott Siegner,\n   <em>\n    Lawrence's Anderson on the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uniform Commercial Code\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-602:3 (3d. ed. 2017) (\" UCC 9-602 [Rev] does not ... restrict the ability of parties to agree to settle, compromise, or renounce\n   <em>\n    claims for past conduct\n   </em>\n   that may have been a violation, or breach, of those rights or duties.\" (emphasis added)). Comment 3 allows a party to expressly waive a past violation of a particular right, but it does not indicate the party may waive the right\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   . For example, if a secured party violates a debtor's rights under \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA, the debtor can \"waive\" or \"renounce\n   <em>\n    claims for past conduct\n   </em>\n   \" against the secured party as part of a settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA, Official Comment 3 (emphasis added).

Because strict foreclosure does not require the secured party to dispose of the collateral, its finality prevents the secured party from seeking a deficiency and the debtor from seeking a surplus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miller,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9C \u00a7 9-620-1 [Rev] (discussing the advantages and disadvantages of strict foreclosure, including the debtor's loss of the right to a surplus and the secured party's loss of the right to a deficiency);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-620(5), MCA (stating, in strict foreclosure, the secured party must dispose of the collateral only in certain circumstances);\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-620 to - 622 (strict foreclosure\n   process). The Court concludes RJC did not properly consent to strict foreclosure, centering much of its analysis on a questionable interpretation of Comment 5 to \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA. As I will explain, Comment 5 is a protective measure for secured parties. The Court uses it as a sword against RJC-but it is really a shield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b647 To execute a strict foreclosure after default, \u00a7 30-9A-620(2)(a), MCA, requires the secured party to consent to accepting the collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation the collateral secures. The secured party may consent through an \"authenticated record\" or by sending \"a proposal to the debtor\" after certain other conditions are\n   met. Section 30-9A-620(2), MCA. However, \"[a] debtor's voluntary surrender of collateral to a secured party and the secured party's acceptance of possession of the collateral does not, of itself, necessarily raise an implication that the secured party intends or is proposing to accept the collateral in satisfaction of the secured obligation under this section.\" Section 30-9A-620, MCA, Official Comment 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b648 The Court interprets Comment 5 to mean the \"authenticated record\" between the debtor and secured party must include definite, express language that a secured party \"accepted or consented to accept the collateral in full satisfaction of the debt\" and \"relinquished its right to pursue a deficiency judgment.\" Opinion, \u00b6 23. The Court goes on to criticize RJC and imply that it should have intended the 2015 Agreement to satisfy the explicit requirements of \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, before it could properly consent to a strict foreclosure. Opinion, \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b649 The Court's criticisms of the 2015 Agreement disregard a fundamental principle of contracts, and especially, secured transactions: that of substance over form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-109 (\"[T]his chapter applies to ... any transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-3-219, MCA (\"The law respects form less than substance.\");\n   <em>\n    In re Charles M.

The Court generates several formal language requirements for an authenticated record under \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, when here, although the 2015 Agreement does not contain definite language that RJC \"accepted or consented to accept the collateral in full satisfaction of the debt\" and \"relinquished its right to pursue a deficiency judgment,\" the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of the 2015 Agreement is clear and unambiguous.

Adopted by the Legislature in 1999, \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, replaced former \u00a7 30-9-505, MCA (repealed 1999). 1999 Mont. Laws ch. 305. Prior to 1999, some debtors' interpretations of former \u00a7 30-9-505, MCA, confronted courts with the issue of \"constructive\" strict foreclosures: occasionally, debtors attempted to force strict foreclosures upon unwilling secured creditors after the creditors took possession of the collateral without taking further action. In the absence of a modifying agreement, some courts held the creditor had constructively, strictly foreclosed, barring it from pursuing any deficiency. 4 James J. White, Robert S. Summers, &amp; Robert A. Hillman,\n   <em>\n    Uniform\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commercial Code:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Practitioner Treatise Series\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34:20, at 596 (6th ed. 2015);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 30-9A-620, MCA, Official Comment 2, 5.

A fuller reading of Comment 5 reveals the requirement of the secured party's consent under \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, now exists to prevent the same:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   To ensure that the debtor cannot unilaterally cause an acceptance of collateral, [subsection (2) ] provides that compliance with [subsection (1) ] is necessary but not sufficient to cause an acceptance of collateral. Rather, under [subsection (2) ], acceptance does not occur unless, in addition, the secured party consents to the acceptance in an authenticated record or sends to the\n   debtor a proposal. For this reason, a mere delay in collection or disposition of collateral does not constitute a \"constructive\" strict foreclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Section 30-9A-602, MCA, Official Comment 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b651 Section 30-9A-620, MCA, requires creditors to consent to a strict foreclosure as a protective measure. If the statute did not require a creditor's consent before a debtor could impose a strict foreclosure, the creditor could lose its right to pursue a deficiency without ever intending to do so. Comment 5 only serves to negate any presumption of the creditor's intent without its taking further action. Comment 5 does not create affirmative language requirements for the authenticated record itself, especially where the record-the contract's plain language and, if necessary, extrinsic evidence-shows the creditor intended to release the debtor from the debtor's obligation in exchange for the debtor's rights in the collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b652 This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Peoples Bank\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Royal Palm Senior Investors, LLC\n   </em>\n   , which the Court relies upon.

First, as I will explain, unlike the purported authenticated records in each of the other cases, the 2015 Agreement explicitly states the parties agreed to \"releasing [Kapor] and removing [her] name\" from the installment sales contract and security agreement-i.e., the parties agreed to terminate it. Second, in each of the other cases, the debtor claimed the creditor\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   consent to strict foreclosure while the creditor claimed it\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   . Kapor, however, claims RJC\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   consent to strict foreclosure while RJC claims it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   . The distinction is important-here we have a debtor who raises no issues about whether\n   <em>\n    she\n   </em>\n   consented to transfer her rights in the collateral in exchange for terminating her obligation. Instead, her argument rests on the bizarre premise that the 2015 Agreement did not actually terminate her obligation because RJC,\n   <em>\n    the creditor\n   </em>\n   , did not consent. Put another way, Kapor simply has buyer's remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b654 Today, the Court turns a protective measure for secured parties against them, and it creates additional requirements-unsupported by the statute-for strict foreclosure, elevating form over substance. In a case such as this, the statute requires only that \"the secured party consents to the acceptance [of the collateral] in an authenticated record.\" Section 30-9A-620(2), MCA. That provision exists to prevent debtors from imposing strict foreclosure onto unwilling creditors. The Court's interpretation, however, essentially tells secured parties they cannot consent to strict foreclosure-\n   <em>\n    the very thing\n   </em>\n   they attempt to consent to-unless their authenticated record contains certain express language. The Court states, \"RJC's afterthought in reply that the [2015 Agreement's] purpose satisfied the elements of strict foreclosure is further indication that RJC did not\n   intend the [2015 Agreement] to satisfy \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, when it was executed.\" Opinion, \u00b6 27. However, whether RJC had the specific legal doctrine of strict\n   foreclosure and a specific statute in mind before it signed the 2015 Agreement does not change whether the 2015 Agreement met the requirements of strict foreclosure. The 2015 Agreement clearly establishes that RJC consented to accepting the mobile home in satisfaction of Kapor's debt. The Court's contrary holding sends a problematic message to creditors: the form of a strict foreclosure takes priority over its substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b655 But that is not how Montana courts construct and interpret agreements.

As the Court recognizes, Opinion, \u00b6 24, if a contract provision is clear and unambiguous, a court must apply the language as written; however, if the provision is ambiguous, the parties' intent is a question of fact that the court may allow the parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to prove.\n   <em>\n    Watters\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b656 Kapor and RJC signed the 2015 Agreement where Kapor agreed: \"[I hereby] release all rights to the manufactured home ... [and am] releasing myself and removing my name off the contract currently in place with RJC Investment, Inc.\" Kapor further agreed to release any rights in the home, including any refund of payments she previously made. These two provisions represent the\n   <em>\n    entirety\n   </em>\n   of the 2015 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b657 Through the plain meaning of the text, Kapor was clearly attempting to release any rights she had in the manufactured home, and RJC was clearly attempting to release Kapor from any further obligations by terminating the installment sales contract and security agreement. The Court faults RJC because it did not specify that it accepted the mobile home in satisfaction of Kapor's debt and would not pursue a deficiency against her. However, the phrase \"releasing myself and removing my name off the contract currently in place with RJC\" is clear and unambiguous language indicating the parties were agreeing to release Kapor from her obligations and terminate their contract-they did not need to say more. The parties wrote the phrase from Kapor's first-person point-of-view, but both parties signed the agreement. The phrase clearly represented a mutual understanding that the parties intended to terminate their installment sales contract and security agreement. The 2015 Agreement left both RJC and Kapor without any remaining rights against each other, including their respective rights to pursue a deficiency and surplus. Substantively, the parties intended to execute a strict foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b658 Alternatively, even if the contract is ambiguous and the phrase \"releasing myself and removing my name off the contract currently in place with RJC\" is unclear, the parties do not dispute any material facts, and they do not dispute their intent. The record shows the parties agreed that the \"contract\" they intended the 2015 Agreement to refer to is the installment sales contract and security agreement between Kapor and RJC that financed Kapor's mobile home. The parties also agreed Kapor was in default on their contract, that she vacated her mobile home, and that she allowed RJC to take possession of it by the time they signed the 2015 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b659 Kapor could not terminate her contract with RJC and transfer ownership unilaterally-she needed RJC's consent in an authenticated record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-620(2), MCA. Despite that, the parties awkwardly wrote and framed the 2015 Agreement from Kapor's first-person point-of-view, which arguably generated some ambiguity for some of its terms. The agreement states, from Kapor's point-of-view, \"[I] ... release all rights to the manufactured home ... [and] am releasing myself and removing my name off the contract....\" However, Kapor clearly could not release herself or remove her name from the contract (i.e., terminate it) or transfer ownership of the mobile home to RJC without RJC's consent. Notwithstanding, RJC\n   <em>\n    gave\n   </em>\n   its consent when it signed the 2015 Agreement. RJC's co-owner stated the following in a sworn affidavit: \"As part of vacating the mobile home, [Kapor] signed [the\n   2015 Agreement] on March 12, 2015. The purpose of the [2015 Agreement] was to terminate the Contract, and extinguish any further obligations [Kapor] would have to RJC under its terms and vice versa. I signed the [2015 Agreement] on behalf of RJC.\" Kapor never disputed RJC's affirmation about the parties' intent when entering into the 2015 Agreement-indeed, she agreed in her answer to RJC's motion for summary judgment that the parties did not dispute any material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b660 Thus, the surrounding circumstances demonstrate Kapor was attempting to give up any rights she had in the mobile home, transfer her rights to RJC, and terminate the security agreement with RJC, just like a debtor would in strict foreclosure. The surrounding circumstances also indicate RJC consented to Kapor giving up her rights in the mobile home, transferring her interest in the home to RJC, and terminating the security agreement between them-effectively, the parties executed a strict foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b661 The language of the parties' 2015 Agreement is clear, even if it does not specifically itemize which rights the parties agreed to forego\n   by signing it: the language states Kapor released any rights in the mobile home and RJC agreed to release Kapor and terminate the parties' installment sales contract and security agreement. In substance, the parties intended to execute a strict foreclosure. Nevertheless, even if the 2015 Agreement is ambiguous, the parties do not dispute any material facts. By looking to the circumstances under which the parties executed it and the extrinsic evidence regarding the parties' intent, the purpose of the 2015 Agreement is plain. Either way, this case simply involves a debtor and a creditor, through a signed agreement, attempting to consent to a transfer of collateral to the creditor in full satisfaction of the debtor's obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA. The Court turns a blind eye to the 2015 Agreement's plain language and invalidates the very thing the parties attempted to do-worse, it invalidates the 2015 Agreement by elevating form over substance, and it dismisses the 2015 Agreement because of technicalities the Court itself has only fashioned today. Although I would hold Title 30, MCA, governs the parties' attempt to terminate their initial security agreement, I would hold the parties met the requirements of \u00a7 30-9A-620, MCA, for strict foreclosure. I therefore would hold Kapor is not entitled to whatever surplus RJC received from the mobile home's sale. Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   DIRK M.
