In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that it was not, and that Mr. Tarango's motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the stop should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we hold that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish his unlawful possession of a second firearm located in the vehicle after it was stopped. We reverse his firearm possession convictions and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 At around 2:00 in the afternoon on a winter day in 2016, Carlos Matthews drove to a neighborhood grocery store in Spokane, parking his car next to a Chevrolet Suburban\n   in which music was playing loudly. A man was sitting in the passenger seat of the Suburban, next to its female driver. When Mr. Matthews stepped out of his car and got a better look at the passenger, who turned out to be Ismael Tarango, he noticed that Mr. Tarango was holding a gun in his right hand, resting it on his thigh. Mr. Matthews would later describe it as a semiautomatic, Glock-style gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 As he headed into the store, Mr. Matthews called 911 to report what he had seen, providing the 911 operator with his name and telephone number. No recording or transcript of the 911 call is in the record, but a computer-aided dispatch (CAD) report offered by Mr. Tarango in support of a later motion to suppress included the following entries:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-14\"><strong>/142038</strong> <strong>(25)</strong> <strong>ENTRY</strong> <strong>MALE WITH A HANDGUN IS SITTING</strong> <strong>IN HIS VEHICLE BEHIND THE BARGAIN</strong> <strong>GIANT.</strong> <strong>/142140</strong> <strong>SUPP</strong> <strong>TXT: VEH BRN CHEVY TAHOE.

These entries were followed in the report by entries identifying the several officers who responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The first officer to respond saw a vehicle meeting Mr. Matthews's description parked on the east side of the store. He called in the license plate number and waited for backup to arrive. Before other officers could arrive, however, the Suburban left the parking area, traveling west.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Suburban was followed by an officer and once several other officers reached the vicinity, they conducted a felony stop. According to one of the officers, the driver, Lacey Hutchinson, claimed to be the vehicle's owner. When told why she had been pulled over, she denied having firearms in the vehicle and gave consent to search it. After officers obtained Mr. Tarango's identification, however, they realized he was under Department of Corrections (DOC) supervision and decided to call DOC officers to perform the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 In searching the area within reach of where Mr. Tarango had been seated, a DOC officer observed what appeared to be the grip of a firearm located behind the passenger seat, covered by a canvas bag. When the officer moved the bag to get a better view of the visible firearm-the visible firearm turned out to be a black semiautomatic-a second firearm, a revolver, fell out. Moving the bag also revealed a couple of boxes of ammunition. At that point, officers decided to terminate the search, seal the vehicle, and obtain a search warrant. A loaded Glock Model 22 and a Colt Frontier Scout revolver were recovered when the vehicle was later searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 While others contacted DOC and remained at the scene, one of the responding officers contacted Mr. Matthews to obtain a statement as to what he had observed. Mr. Matthews told the officer that after he made the 911 call, Mr. Tarango and the female driver entered the grocery store. He told the officer that as he stood in line waiting to pay for his groceries, Mr. Tarango looked at him and raised his finger to his lips, as if signaling to Mr. Matthews to \"keep quiet.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) (Dec. 5, 2016) at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State charged Mr. Tarango, who had prior felony convictions, with two counts of first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. Because Mr. Tarango had recently failed to report to his community custody officer as ordered, he was also charged with escape from community custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Before trial, Mr. Tarango moved to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop, arguing that police lacked reasonable\n   suspicion of criminal activity and that the search of a nonprobationer's vehicle exceeded the DOC's authority.

Mr. Tarango relied on the CAD report and several police reports. The State submitted additional police and DOC officer reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 After taking the matter under advisement, the trial court convened a hearing at which it announced its findings and denied the suppression motion. RP (Aug. 11, 2016) at 3-6. It distinguished\n   <em>\n    Cardenas-Muratalla\n   </em>\n   as involving an anonymous informant, whereas Mr. Matthews had identified himself. In finding reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, the court appeared to believe, in error, that one of Mr. Matthews's observations \"known to law enforcement through his 911 call\" was that while in the grocery store,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   the defendant allegedly made a gesture as if to admonish Mr. Matthews to be quiet, a shushing gesture if that's the appropriate verb or word. Matthews further described that the defendant has a weird and mean expression on his face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   RP (Aug. 11, 2016) at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Written findings and conclusions were later proposed and entered, which again reflect the court's mistaken belief that Mr. Matthews saw the \"shushing\" gesture before making the 911 call and reported it to the 911 operator. CP at 75. The court's findings 4 and 5 state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   4. Informant then sees [Mr. Tarango] in the store. [Mr. Tarango] gives informant the \"shushing gesture\", and had a mean look on his face.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   5. Informant then calls 911, and remains in the area to follow the vehicle and makes himself available to the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 At the jury trial presided over before a different judge, the State called as witnesses to the firearm possession charges Mr. Matthews and the police and DOC officers who participated in the stop and the related investigation. The defense called three witnesses: Ms. Hutchinson, who testified that Mr. Tarango did not have a handgun in his possession on the day they were stopped; Vera Kay Nickerson, a friend and neighbor of Ms. Hutchinson and Mr. Tarango, who testified she placed the two firearms behind the Suburban's passenger seat, unbeknownst to Ms. Hutchinson or Mr. Tarango; and Raymond Glen Beebe, who confirmed Ms. Nickerson's testimony that he was a friend of hers, owned the Glock, and had allowed her to borrow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 The jury found Mr. Tarango guilty as charged. He appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 Mr. Tarango assigns error to the trial court's denial of his suppression motion, making a related assignment of error to the court's fourth and fifth findings of fact. He also argues that insufficient evidence supports his conviction of illegal possession of the revolver recovered from the canvas bag. We address his challenges in that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   BECAUSE OFFICERS LACKED REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT MR. TARANGO HAD ENGAGED IN OR WAS ABOUT TO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, THE SUPPRESSION MOTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 We first address whether the trial court erred in denying Mr. Tarango's suppression motion. When reviewing the denial of a suppression motion, we determine whether substantial evidence supports challenged findings of fact and whether the findings support the conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    State v. Garvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001806\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/166/242/#p249\">\n    166 Wash.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20P.3d%201266\">\n    207 P.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). While Mr. Tarango challenges the trial court's fourth and fifth factual findings, there is no dispute on that score; the State concedes they are in error as to timing. It agrees that officers responding to the 911 call had not heard about Mr. Matthews's report of Mr. Tarango's intimidating conduct in the grocery store, which took place after\n   the 911 call was made. Because the only issue on appeal is whether the correct factual findings support the trial court's suppression decision, our review is de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 Warrantless searches and seizures are per se unreasonable unless one of the few jealously and carefully drawn exceptions to the warrant requirement applies.\n   <em>\n    State v.
