Lumford also challenges the Circuit Court's Order Granting Defendant Glenn Yoshio Ota's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Tara Aoyagi Lumford's First Amended Complaint, filed October 6, 2015 (\n   <strong>\n    Order Dismissing Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n   ). On cross-appeal, Ota challenges the Circuit Court's Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs, filed on March 8, 2016 (\n   <strong>\n    Attorneys' Fees Order\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In short, the Circuit Court concluded, as a matter of law, that no claim for unjust enrichment may be sustained by Lumford against Ota because Lumford did not allege that she (rather than a third party) bestowed a benefit upon Ota that he wrongfully retained. As set forth below, we hold that the Circuit Court erred and that, in limited circumstances, a claim for unjust enrichment may be stated by allegations that a third-party has conferred a benefit upon a defendant to which the plaintiff claims he or she has a superior legal or equitable right. The requirements for such a claim may be satisfied by proof of a clear legal entitlement. Other equitable circumstances might suffice, but in all cases, the plaintiff must identify a right in the disputed assets that is both recognized and accorded priority over the interest of the defendant. It is insufficient to allege that the defendant has received a windfall, that the claimant has been ill-treated, and that the third party's payment or other transfer to the defendant (or the defendant's retention of payment or transferred assets as against the claimant) violates rules of good faith, basic fairness, or common decency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Judgment is vacated, and this case is remanded to the Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 10, 2015, Lumford filed a complaint against Ota. An Amended Complaint was filed on October 6, 2015. In the Amended Complaint, Lumford alleged that in July of 2008, her aunt Cindy Aoyagi (\n   <strong>\n    Aoyagi\n   </strong>\n   ) owned a single-family residence in Waipahu, Hawai'i (\n   <strong>\n    Waipahu Property\n   </strong>\n   ). Aoyagi learned that she was suffering from cancer and decided to make provisions to dispose of her property in case of her death. Lumford alleged in the Amended Complaint that Aoyagi wanted to leave the Waipahu Property to Lumford, but Aoyagi believed Lumford was not yet mature enough to manage it by herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Amended Complaint further alleged that Aoyagi decided to convey the Waipahu Property to Ota in fee simple absolute, retaining a life estate for herself, in reliance on Ota's promise to hold the Waipahu Property for the use and benefit of Aoyagi during her lifetime and, thereafter, for the use and benefit of Lumford's parents during their lifetimes, and thereafter, for the use and benefit of Lumford until such time as Lumford attained the maturity to manage the Waipahu Property herself, whereupon Ota would convey the Waipahu Property to Lumford. In addition, Lumford alleged that a confidential relationship existed between Ota and Aoyagi at the time of the conveyance and that the conveyance was based on and arose out of that confidential relationship. The deed recording this conveyance was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Aoyagi died in May of 2009, and the following July, Ota conveyed the Waipahu Property to himself and his wife Janis as tenants by the entirety; the deed was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances. In December of 2013, Ota and Janis mortgaged the Waipahu Property in the amount of $100,000. Janis later died, and in September of 2014, Ota conveyed the Waipahu Property to a third-party for a payment of $540,000. In November of 2014, Ota was appointed as personal representative of Janis's estate. Lumford alleged that between May 31, 2009, and September 19, 2014, Ota and/or Janis received rental and other income from the Waipahu Property for which they have not accounted and which they have retained for their own use and benefit. Lumford's parents are also now deceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lumford's Amended Complaint asserted two counts, \"Count I: Breach of Fiduciary and Confidential Relationship\" and \"Count II: Alternative Claim for Breach of Fiduciary and Confidential Relationship.\" Both counts averred that Ota would be unjustly enriched unless equitable relief was granted to Lumford by the court. Accordingly, based on Ota's alleged unjust enrichment, Lumford sought to impose a constructive trust upon the rental and other income and proceeds from the mortgage and sale of the Waipahu Property and sought an accounting from Ota of any income he and/or Janis received from the Waipahu Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ota filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint on October 6, 2015 (\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n   ). Ota thereafter argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that Lumford does not have a cognizable unjust enrichment claim because such a claim requires that the plaintiff have directly conferred a benefit upon the defendant. Ota argued that because Lumford alleged that Aoyagi had conferred the benefit (the Waipahu Property) upon Ota, Lumford, as a third party to that conveyance, has no justifiable claim for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, Ota attached to a supplemental memorandum in support of the Motion to Dismiss,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the findings of fact and conclusions of law from\n   <em>\n    June T. Aoyagi v. Estate of Cindy Hatsue Aoyagi, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. 10-1-2560 (\n   <strong>\n    Roger's Civil Case\n   </strong>\n   ), an action purportedly prosecuted by Lumford's father, Roger Aoyagi, and the briefing from the appeal of the judgment in Roger's Civil Case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aoyagi v.

App. Jan. 20, 2017) (SDO).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lumford filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, which included a declaration of Lumford in which she averred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that she was told by Aoyagi's attorney that Aoyagi \"decided to leave [Ota] in charge of the property with the hopes that he would transfer the property to\n   [Lumford] once he felt [Lumford] was ready.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Circuit Court agreed with Ota's argument that an unjust enrichment claim requires that a plaintiff have directly conferred a benefit upon the defendant and that dismissal of Lumford's claims on this basis was required. The Circuit Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [M]y inclination is just based on a 12(b)(6) reading of the First Amended Complaint, and under [\n   <em>\n    Pavsek v.

The Circuit Court denied Ota's request for attorneys' fees because it concluded that Lumford sought only equitable relief, not money damages, and therefore, the action was not in the nature of assumpsit. The Circuit Court granted Ota's request for costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lumford timely filed a notice of appeal; Ota cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    POINTS OF ERROR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lumford contends that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ota based on a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Lumford also seeks a ruling on whether she is precluded from asserting a claim against Ota based on Roger's Civil Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On cross-appeal, Ota contends that the Circuit Court erred in denying his request for attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An order granting a motion to dismiss is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Hungate v.

Ota first argued that, in light of the findings and conclusions in Roger's Civil Case, entered after a jury-waived trial, Lumford could not re-litigate the contention that Aoyagi wanted the Waipahu Property to go to Lumford. In addition, Ota argued that the Amended Complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it did not allege that Lumford conferred a benefit upon Ota.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, Ota argued that he was seeking dismissal based on Lumford's failure to state a claim because there was no assertion that\n   she had conferred a benefit upon Ota, and that he was not seeking relief based on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because the appeal was (then) still pending in Roger's Civil Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the Circuit Court expressly ruled that \"there's no cognizable claim under [ HRCP Rule] 12(b)(6)\" for unjust enrichment the way that the claim was pleaded in the Amended Complaint. The Circuit Court further stated \"with regard to the standard of review, I'm disposing of this for failure to state a cognizable claim under 12(b)(6).\" However, it appears that the Circuit Court concluded that, because the court took judicial notice of the documents and orders in Roger's Civil Case, the matter was necessarily decided as a summary judgment motion pursuant to HRCP Rule 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Generally, \"[a] Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted shall be treated as a Rule 56, HRCP, motion for summary judgment when 'matters outside the pleading' are presented to and not excluded by the court\n   <em>\n    in making its decision on the motion\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Rosa v.

The Circuit Court expressly ruled that, based on HRCP Rule 12(b)(6), Lumford had failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment. Under these circumstances, the Circuit Court was not required to treat the Motion to Dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. However, the court did not expressly state that it was excluding matters outside the pleadings in making its decision on the Motion to Dismiss. Accordingly, the Circuit Court properly treated the Motion to Dismiss as a summary judgment motion and we consider the Circuit Court's ruling in this light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Circuit Court granted summary judgment and dismissed the Amended Complaint on the basis that Ota was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Lumford's claim for unjust enrichment because Ota did not directly receive a benefit from Lumford; rather, Ota received a benefit from a third-party to which Lumford claims an entitlement. The Circuit Court concluded, as a matter of law, that no claim for unjust enrichment may be sustained in a case where the plaintiff did not directly bestow the benefit upon the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Typically, a claim for unjust enrichment arises out of an allegation that the plaintiff has bestowed a benefit in money, property, or services upon the defendant, and the plaintiff then seeks some form of relief in equity to prevent the unjust enrichment of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Durette v.
