In this automatic and direct review of his convictions and sentence of death,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant primarily\n   raises arguments that are contrary to controlling precedent without offering persuasive reasons to depart from that precedent, or arguments that otherwise lack merit. However, some of defendant's assignments of error raise significant issues that this court has yet to expressly address, including: whether the state must expressly allege its theory for joining multiple offenses, whether the governor's moratorium on imposing the death penalty affects the jury's ability to constitutionally consider that punishment, and whether this court should presume that the undisclosed bias of an alternate juror impaired defendant's constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury. We write to address those assignments of error as well as several other significant challenges that defendant raises to the trial court's rulings. Ultimately, having fully considered all of defendant's arguments, we conclude that none of defendant's assignments of error identifies a basis for reversing the judgment, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. THE CRIMES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The crimes at issue in this appeal include the robbery of a Siuslaw Bank branch in Creswell, Oregon; the robbery of a Siuslaw Bank branch in Mapleton, Oregon, two months later; and the kidnapping and murder of a young man in order to steal his car to use in committing the Mapleton bank robbery. In addition to defendant, the participants in these crimes were Toni Baker (defendant's friend), Mercedes (Sadie) Crabtree (Baker's 18-year-old niece), A.J. Nelson (Crabtree's longtime friend), and Wretha Breckenridge (defendant's girlfriend). Both Breckenridge and Crabtree testified in detail about the crimes at\n   defendant's trial-Breckenridge after being given immunity and Crabtree as a condition of her agreement to plead guilty to several offenses, including murder. The facts described below are supported by the testimony of those two witnesses, as well as by other key evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The June 8 Creswell Bank Robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant and Breckenridge, who both lived in Eugene, decided to rob a Siuslaw Bank branch in Creswell, a small town in Lane County. Defendant enlisted Baker and Crabtree to help with the robbery, and the four met at defendant's home in Eugene to discuss the robbery plan. The plan involved defendant using a bicycle to ride up to and away from the bank while Crabtree waited nearby in a get-away vehicle. Defendant planned to use a bicycle that he had spray painted and stored in Breckenridge's garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the morning of June 8, according to the plan, Crabtree drove defendant and the bicycle to an alley near the bank. Crabtree drove a red Dodge Caravan registered to Breckenridge's mother and waited in the van while defendant rode the bicycle to the bank to commit the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant carried two guns into the bank-one a small, pink revolver that belonged to Breckenridge, and the other a larger \"western style\" .44 magnum revolver with a wood grip. He ordered bank employees and customers to get down on the ground. Several of the employees in the bank activated alarms, which triggered an audio recording, and surveillance video also recorded the robbery. Defendant pointed a gun at the bank employees and ordered them to give him the money from their tills. He also demanded their wallets and purses. Defendant ordered everyone in the bank to remain on the ground while he fled on the bicycle with the stolen money. When he reached the alley where Crabtree was waiting, defendant abandoned the bicycle and rode away with Crabtree in the van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lane County law enforcement officers identified a red Caravan as likely involved in the robbery, and they\n   publicized that information. They began coordinating with an FBI bank robbery task force, which eventually connected defendant to the Creswell bank robbery, to Breckenridge, to the red\n   Caravan registered to Breckenridge's mother, and to a silver Dodge Intrepid registered to Breckenridge. The task force used that information to obtain a warrant to place GPS tracking devices on both vehicles in late July, and the devices allowed officers to track the movements of those vehicles during the series of crimes that followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The August 3 Crimes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly after the Creswell robbery, defendant broke both of his heels and was incapacitated until late July. When defendant was finally able to walk without crutches, he and Breckenridge drove around in Breckenridge's Intrepid looking for another bank to rob. This time they settled on a Siuslaw Bank branch located in Mapleton, Oregon, another town in Lane County. But two challenges required defendant to form a different plan for this robbery. First, defendant's injuries left him unable to ride a bike and in need of assistance inside the bank. Second, defendant knew that law enforcement officers had publicized a red Caravan's link to the Creswell robbery, so defendant did not want to use the Caravan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Planning the Mapleton robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant again recruited Crabtree to help with the bank robbery and arranged for her to bring from Portland an older Toyota that he wanted to use for the robbery. Crabtree also brought her friend, Nelson, to assist defendant inside the bank. The plan for the Mapleton robbery was for defendant and Nelson to drive the Toyota to the bank and then abandon it after the robbery at a location where Crabtree would pick them up in the Intrepid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the day planned for the robbery, however, the Toyota broke down on the way to the bank, and defendant abandoned it. He then decided to steal a car and kill the owner so that the owner could not report the theft before defendant had the opportunity to use the car for the robbery. Defendant told Nelson and Crabtree to wait outside a bar\n   near his house and watch for a single man to emerge. He explained that Nelson should stage a fight with Crabtree and then drive away alone. Defendant directed Crabtree to then approach the man and ask for a ride home, to lure him to defendant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The kidnapping and murder\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As directed, Nelson and Crabtree waited outside of the bar to carry out defendant's plan. Around midnight, Gutierrez left the bar alone. Crabtree and Nelson staged their fight, Crabtree convinced Gutierrez to give her a ride, and she directed him to defendant's house. Gutierrez went inside the house to use the bathroom and, when he emerged, defendant and Nelson were waiting for him. Defendant was carrying an assault-type rifle and ordered Gutierrez to get to his knees. Defendant directed Nelson to bind Gutierrez's feet and arms and then directed him to stab and choke Gutierrez. Nelson did so, but Gutierrez remained conscious. Eventually, defendant used a chain to strangle Gutierrez until he died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Mapleton bank robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Several hours later, at about 7:00 a.m., defendant drove to Breckenridge's house and told her that they had killed someone and gotten a car, and that she should wait for him to return with the others. Defendant, Crabtree, and Nelson then carried out the Mapleton bank robbery according to their original plan but using Gutierrez's car in place of the abandoned Toyota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant and Nelson drove to the Mapleton bank in Gutierrez's car. When they entered the bank, defendant was carrying a long revolver with a wood grip-the .44 magnum-and Nelson was carrying the assault-type rifle. They yelled for the employees to get on the ground, threatened to kill anyone who did not comply, and demanded the employees' wallets. After taking money from the tills, they\n   ordered everyone in the bank to remain on the ground and fled. As would later prove significant, Nelson dropped a bullet,\n   which a teller noticed and collected for police, and some of the money that the tellers handed over included \"bait bills\"-bills that had been photocopied and had their serial numbers recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant and Nelson drove from the bank to a location at which Crabtree had arranged to meet them with the Intrepid. Defendant moved the robbery proceeds into the Intrepid and abandoned Gutierrez's car. The three then drove to Breckenridge's house in the Intrepid, where they divided the money, before returning to defendant's house to dispose of the murder evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Investigation Ties Defendant to the Crimes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Five days later, law enforcement officers arrested defendant on a warrant for an unrelated crime. At the time of his arrest, defendant was carrying the .44 magnum wood-grip revolver that he had used in both bank robberies. Because defendant had become a primary suspect in the Mapleton robbery and the murder by that time, he was questioned about those crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Shortly after defendant's arrest, a detective also questioned Breckenridge at her home. Breckenridge provided information about both bank robberies, as well as information about Gutierrez's murder. In a search of Breckenridge's home, officers found the pink handgun that defendant had used in the Creswell robbery. They also found a wallet with defendant's identification and an envelope containing three bundles of cash, including a $ 20 bill that was a \"bait bill\" from the Mapleton bank robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Searches of locations associated with Baker, Crabtree, and Nelson turned up the assault rifle that defendant had used during the murder and a backpack containing other weapons used during that crime. Forensic examination showed that the unfired bullet collected at the Mapleton robbery had been cycled through the assault rifle and that a filet knife had DNA traces consistent with Gutierrez's profile. In addition, Gutierrez's DNA was found at locations inside defendant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The state charged defendant in a single indictment with 10 counts relating to the Creswell bank robbery, seven counts relating to the kidnapping and death of Gutierrez, 12 counts relating to the Mapleton bank robbery, and two counts of felon in possession of a firearm-one for the date of the Creswell robbery and one for the date of the other crimes. The trial began with a guilt phase, during which the state presented evidence of the crimes described above to a panel of 12 jurors and several alternate jurors. The jury found defendant guilty of all the offenses charged, except that, on one of the four aggravated murder counts, the jury found defendant guilty of the lesser-included crime of intentional murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same jury heard evidence during the three days of the penalty phase. At the end of the penalty phase, the jury unanimously answered \"yes\" to the statutory questions that determine whether the trial court will impose a death sentence, and the trial court entered a judgment imposing that sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 163.150 (describing sentencing process for a defendant found to be guilty of aggravated murder). Among other evidence presented during the penalty phase, the jury learned that defendant had been convicted for abducting and murdering a woman in 1977 and then disposing of her corpse in a rural location; was incarcerated for those crimes until 2004; and then, in 2009, assaulted a woman, choked her, broke one of her ribs, and threatened to kill her. He had been convicted of fourth-degree assault and strangulation based on that incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the jury returned its verdicts on both the guilt and penalty questions, the court held a sentencing hearing and entered the judgment. That judgment is now before this court for automatic and direct review. ORS 138.052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On direct review to this court, defendant raises 131 assignments of error. We have reviewed each assignment of error and, as to each, conclude either that the court did not err or that the claimed error does not supply\n   a basis for reversing the judgment. We write to address assignments\n   of error that fall into four categories: (1) pretrial challenges to the indictment; (2) challenges to guilt-phase rulings of the trial; (3) constitutional challenges to penalty-phase rulings; and (4) a challenge to the trial court's post-judgment ruling denying a mistrial. We reject the remaining assignments of error without written discussion because the issues have already been decided adversely to defendant's position or otherwise lack merit and because further discussion of those issues will not benefit the public, the bench, or the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Pretrial Challenges to the Indictment\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Prior to trial, defendant raised several challenges to the indictment based on the limits that ORS 132.560(1) places on the state's ability to join more than one offense in a single charging instrument. That statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"(1) A charging instrument must charge but one offense, and in one form only, except that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"(a) Where the offense may be committed by the use of different means, the charging instrument may allege the means in the alternative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"(b) Two or more offenses may be charged in the same charging instrument in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged are alleged to have been committed by the same person or persons and are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"(A) Of the same or similar character;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"(B) Based on the same act or transaction; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"(C) Based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant contended that the indictment included multiple offenses that were not properly joined and demurred to the indictment on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, defendant moved to sever some of the counts, either on the basis of improper joinder or on the basis of substantial prejudice. The trial court refused to grant the demurrer or to sever any counts, and defendant assigns errors to those rulings. We conclude that neither ruling was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's challenge to proper joinder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant's first challenge to the indictment implicates the exception in section (1)(b) of ORS 132.560, which this court recently construed in\n   <em>\n    State v. Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    364 Or. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    430 P.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Defendant contends, as he did in the trial court, that the indictment improperly joined charges arising out of the June bank robbery incident with charges arising out of the August bank robbery, kidnapping and murder. As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   , there are two requirements for the state to charge multiple offenses in the same indictment: the state's basis for joining the offenses must be \"possible, given the offenses and facts alleged,\" and the state's basis for joining the offenses must\n   be alleged.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    364 Or. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    430 P.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that the indictment satisfied both requirements for proper joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the trial court, defendant argued that the various offenses were not related in a way that makes joinder possible. In response, the state argued that the charges could be joined under ORS 132.560(1)(b)(A) and (C), because the two bank robberies were \"of the same or similar character\" and because the offenses against Gutierrez were part of a \"common scheme or plan\" that involved committing the\n   robberies. The trial court agreed. As the court explained in its written order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"In the case at bar, the state's theory (supported by evidence offered at the hearing on the motion to suppress) is that the murder of Celestino Gutierrez was committed to get a vehicle to use to carry out a bank robbery and that the bank robbery was one of several committed by [defendant]. *** [T]he robberies and the murder are both logically relate[d] and have large areas of overlapping proof.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, we agree with the trial court that it was possible for the state to join all of the charged offenses. Indeed, on appeal, defendant does not seriously dispute that the offenses are related in ways that make joinder possible under ORS 132.560(1)(b)(A) and (C). The charges related to the Creswell bank robbery could be joined because those offenses were of \"similar character\"-if not the \"same character\" as the Mapleton bank robbery charges. Both were robberies of a Siuslaw Bank branch in Lane County and both were committed by defendant. Although there were some differences, in both robberies defendant demanded that the employees turn over wallets and purses in addition to the money in their tills; in both robberies he threatened the tellers with the gun that he was carrying at the time of his arrest; and in both robberies Crabtree served as the get-away driver, allowing defendant to abandon the transportation that he had used to approach the bank. The criminal acts against Gutierrez could be joined because they were part of a \"common scheme or plan\" to commit the Mapleton bank robbery-to steal a car to use to commit the robbery and to kill the owner so that the theft would not be discovered before the robbery. And finally, the charges of unlawful possession of a firearm could be joined because the firearms that defendant unlawfully possessed were the firearms that he used during each robbery, making his unlawful possession of the firearms part of the \"common scheme or plan\" to commit the robberies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We also conclude that the indictment sufficiently alleges the bases for joining the offenses-the second joinder requirement that we identified in\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    364 Or. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    430 P.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant emphasizes that the indictment does not\n   expressly allege that any of the offenses are \"[o]f the same or similar character,\" \"[b]ased on the same act or transaction,\" or \"parts of a common scheme or plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 132.560 (1)(b). The state responds, however, that the factual allegations of the indictment sufficiently identify the bases for joinder, and we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This court has held that it is \"sufficient for the state to allege the basis for joinder by using the language of the joinder statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    364 Or. at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    430 P.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Huennekens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2100055\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/245/150/#p154\">\n    245 Or. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2100055\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/245/150/#p154\">\n    420 P.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) ). But that does not mean that it is\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   for the state to use the language of the joinder statute. As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals has held that an indictment can allege the basis for joinder either \" 'in the language of the joinder statute or by alleging facts sufficient to establish compliance with the joinder statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    430 P.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

As we have emphasized, the purposes of requiring the state to allege the basis for joinder are to eliminate the need for a defendant \"to guess the state's basis for joinder\" and to make it possible for the trial court \"to determine, from the face of an indictment, whether the indictment complies with the\n   joinder statute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    364 Or. at 122, 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571390\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/1036/\">\n    430 P.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both purposes are served when the indictment alleges facts that allow the defendant to understand the state's basis for joining the offenses and allow the court to determine whether that joinder is proper.

First, the allegations of the indictment connect all of defendant's August crimes to each other as part of a common scheme or plan. The indictment alleges that \"on or about August 3\" defendant caused the death of Gutierrez \"in the course of and in the furtherance of,\" and \"in an effort to conceal the commission of or identity of a perpetrator of,\" the \"crimes of Kidnapping in the First Degree as alleged in Count 12 of this Indictment [kidnapping of Gutierrez] and Robbery in the First Degree as alleged in Count 13 of this Indictment [robbery of Gutierrez.]\" It also alleged that defendant caused the death of Gutierrez \"in an effort to conceal\" the identity of \"a perpetrator of the armed robbery of Siuslaw Bank in Mapleton Oregon on August 3, 2012[,] as alleged in Counts 19 through 30 [ ].\" The referenced Mapleton robbery counts-counts 19 through 30-allege all of the other robbery offenses that defendant is alleged to have committed in August. Finally, the indictment charges defendant with unlawfully possessing a firearm on the same day that it also alleges he used a firearm to commit the murder and the Mapleton bank robbery. Those allegations permitted both defendant and the trial court to determine that the state had joined the August 3 bank robbery, murder and kidnapping offenses on the basis that the acts were \"parts of a common scheme or plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In addition, the allegations of the indictment permitted both the defendant and the trial court to determine that the June 8 robbery offenses had been joined with the August 3 robbery offense on the basis of their \"similar character.\" As explained above, the indictment alleges numerous counts of robbery committed \"on or about August 3,\" all of which it identifies as allegations of \"the armed robbery of Siuslaw Bank in Mapleton Oregon on August 3.\" Those counts include allegations that defendant committed the crime of first-degree robbery in Lane County against five different victims,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"while in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft with the intent of compelling [the victim] or another person to deliver the property and engage in conduct which might aid in the commission of the theft and with the intent of preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking and being armed with a deadly weapon a firearm use[d] or threaten[ed] the immediate use of physical force.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The indictment also alleges that defendant committed the offense of second-degree robbery against each victim of the August 3 Lane County bank robbery by \"us[ing] or threaten[ing] the immediate use of physical force upon [the victim] and represent[ing] by word or conduct that defendant was armed with what purported to be a deadly weapon.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In nearly identical language, the indictment alleges that defendant also committed first-degree robbery and second-degree robbery against multiple victims on June 8 in Lane County. In other words, the indictment alleges that, on two different dates, defendant committed similar acts, in the same county, with the same intent, and under the same circumstance of, at a minimum, representing that he was armed with a firearm. Thus, the indictment, in effect, alleges that the June 8 and August 3 robbery offenses are \"of the same or similar character.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was not entitled to a demurrer on the ground that the state had failed to allege the basis for joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's challenge to joinder based on substantial prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant argued below that, if the charges were properly joined, the court should, nevertheless, sever the charges on the basis of substantial prejudice.

ORS 132.560(3). Defendant's theory of substantial prejudice is that the joint trial deprived him \"of the protection of\" OEC 404(3) (evidence of character not admissible to prove propensity). In other words, the \"substantial prejudice\" to which defendant points is the admission of evidence that, he contends, would not have been admitted had the charges been tried separately.

Defendant did not challenge any of the evidence about his actions or intent in committing the robberies. Rather, his theory of defense during the guilt phase-as counsel emphasized in opening statement and closing argument-consisted of challenging the evidence that he \"personally and intentionally\" caused Gutierrez's death because the jury could not rely on Crabtree or Breckenridge as a credible source of \"what went on inside that residence.\" Indeed, defense counsel told the jury in opening statement that defendant \"admitted\n   these bank robberies and at the end of the trial, you're going to convict him of the bank robberies.\" Defense counsel reiterated in closing argument that \"[defendant] committed the\n   bank robberies\" and also urged the jury to find defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of felony murder by finding that Gutierrez \"lost his life as a result of this robbery of his vehicle and the commission of the other robberies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The defense's narrow focus on the circumstances of the murder is not surprising, given the consequences for defendant if convicted of aggravated murder.

After the trial court entered judgment, it became apparent that one of the alternate jurors-contrary to her answers during jury selection-had seen court-file information about defendant's crimes and had formed an opinion that defendant \"needs to die.\" We agree with defendant that the individual harbored the kind of undisclosed bias that raises grave concerns about a defendant's right to a fair trial. In this case, however, we are persuaded that the alternate juror's bias had no effect on the jurors who actually determined defendant's guilt and penalty and, thus, conclude that defendant is not entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   There is no real dispute about the facts on which defendant bases his claim that he is entitled to a new trial. While the case was pending in this court on automatic and direct review, the trial court notified the parties that it had received a copy of an email message that one of the alternate jurors had written before jury selection, in which she had described inside knowledge about details of the crimes and an opinion that defendant \"needs to die.\" The individual, who was in a position to have extra-judicial knowledge of defendant's case, sent the email after learning that she had been summoned for jury service in defendant's murder trial. In it, she wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"He is the guy who (with the 2 younger black kids from Portland) killed a boy (and chopped him up in pieces and burned his body) and took his car to Florence to rob a bank. He was out of prison for a couple of years for murder in the 70's. He needs to die. There is no way I would get on that jury, and not sure I would want to hear the details after reading the search warrants. I will have to defer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Upon learning of the email, counsel for defendant asked this court to order a limited remand. This court granted the remand for the trial court to determine \"whether the alternate juror engaged in juror misconduct and, if she did,\n   whether her misconduct tainted the other jurors' consideration of the case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the trial court questioned all of the jurors and alternate jurors, except for Moser, the alternate whose conduct was at issue. The court asked each juror and alternate juror the same 10 questions about whether Moser disclosed specific pieces of information about the crimes and more generally, whether Moser said \"anything\" about defendant or the crimes beyond what the juror heard in court and whether Moser ever mentioned other crimes or acts of violence that defendant had allegedly committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   At the conclusion of the remand hearing, the trial court drafted an extensive report in which the court described the results of its remand investigation and made findings about the questions identified in this court's remand order. The court found that a number\n   of Moser's answers during jury selection had been \"inconsistent with the statements made in her email.\" Those answers primarily responded to questions that counsel had asked Moser during a\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   conducted outside the presence of the other prospective jurors. In response to questions about contact that she may have had with defendant's case, Moser had insisted that she had no knowledge about the case and had not \"formed any opinions about this case or what the outcome of the case should be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The court observed that, in answering the jury selection questions, \"it is clear that Ms. Moser did not accurately disclose the strength of her feelings about what punishment [defendant] deserved during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .\" The court also emphasized that, if Moser had \"been involved in the deliberations during either phase of this case, this lack of candor would give rise to significant concerns about the fairness of the trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The trial court explained, however, that Moser was seated as one of four alternate jurors in the case and that \"none of the alternate jurors participated in deliberations during either the guilt/innocence or sentencing phases of the case.\" The court also reported that \"[n]ot one of the jurors questioned by the court remembered Ms. Moser ever disclosing to them facts that were not in the record.\" Of the 12 jurors who participated in deliberations, seven \"affirmatively stated that Ms. Moser had never discussed with them any facts relating to the case or to Mr. Taylor.\" The court also described in detail the testimony of the remaining five jurors who participated in the deliberations. None remembered Moser disclosing any information or opinions about the case. Each answered \"no\" to most of the 10 questions asking about types of information Moser might have mentioned and, to the extent the juror simply could not remember if Moser mentioned a particular fact or an opinion about the case, the juror added that he or she probably would have remembered such a comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant argues that the answers of the questioned jurors left open the potential that Moser's bias deprived him of his constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury and require this court to grant a new trial. We conclude that, on this record, defendant is not entitled to a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendant first argues that Moser's email displays the kind of bias and extra-judicial knowledge that, if disclosed during jury selection, would have allowed him to exclude her from his jury. We agree that the information contained in Moser's email would be a reason to exclude her for cause from the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORCP 57 D(1)(g) (applying in criminal proceedings, ORS 136.210(1), and providing that a challenge for cause may be sustained if the juror \"has formed or expressed an opinion upon the merits of the cause from what the juror may have heard or read\" and if the court is satisfied \"that the juror cannot disregard such opinion\n   and try the issue impartially\"). Both Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provide a criminal defendant the right to a trial \"by an impartial jury.\" As this court has explained, the \"guarantee of trial by an 'impartial jury' means trial by a jury that is not biased in favor of or against either party, but is influenced in making its decision only by evidence produced at trial and legal standards provided by the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
