(collectively, \"PWB\") appeal from the superior court's entry of a preliminary injunction enjoining the sale of a home owned by the Castleton Revocable Trust (the \"Castleton Trust\"). Because a judgment creditor may not attach a judgment lien to homestead property, but instead may execute on its judgment only by way of a forced sale of the property under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 33-1105, we affirm the superior court's preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In 2002, Berislav and Djurdjica Sepic purchased a home in Mesa (the \"Home\") to use as their primary residence. In 2007, they borrowed $937,500 from Washington Mutual Bank, secured by a deed of trust on the Home. The deed of trust was later assigned to Chase Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In a separate transaction, the Sepics borrowed money to purchase an apartment complex in Phoenix. That loan was later assigned to PWB. After the Sepics stopped\n   paying on the apartment loan, PWB sued them for breach of contract and obtained a default judgment for $5.2 million (the \"Judgment\"). PWB recorded the Judgment in 2011, then timely renewed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 After losing their apartment complex to foreclosure, the Sepics defaulted on the loan secured by their Home. At their request, Chase approved a short sale of the Home. As part of the short sale process, the Sepics conveyed the Home to the Fairbrook Revocable Family Trust (\"Fairbrook Trust\"). A few weeks later, in February 2013, the Fairbrook Trust sold the Home to the Castleton Trust for $535,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meanwhile, the Judgment remained unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 More than three years after the sale, PWB sued the Castleton Trust, seeking declaratory relief and to quiet title, asserting that the Judgment remained an enforceable lien against the Home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   PWB obtained a writ of general execution, and the Maricopa County Sheriff noticed a sale of the Home. The Castleton Trust then moved to enjoin the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Following an evidentiary hearing, the superior court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and a preliminary injunction enjoining the sale. PWB timely appeals, and we have jurisdiction pursuant A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(5)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Because the grant of a preliminary injunction rests within the sound discretion of the superior court, we review its decision for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fin.

These provisions were added to the statutes after our\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   decision, but they do not change the outcome. As the bankruptcy court carefully explained in\n   <em>\n    Rand\n   </em>\n   , \"It remains the case that both the homestead statute and the judgment lien statute both conceive of the 'homestead' as being the real property, not the equity value of such real property.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3319089\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/400/749/\">\n    400 B.R. at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For these reasons, even though PBW's judgment lien did not attach to the Home, PBW could have tried to satisfy the debt under \u00a7 33-1103(A)(4) by conducting a judicial sale under \u00a7 33-1105, but only if it could sell the Home for more than \"the sum of the [Sepics'] homestead\n   <strong>\n    plus the amount of any consensual liens on the property having priority to the judgment\n   </strong>\n   .\" A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1105 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"737432\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/135/447/#p453\">\n    135 Ariz. at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"737432\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/135/447/#p453\">\n    661 P.2d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 The Castleton Trust argues, and the record suggests, that PWB chose not to pursue its remedy under \u00a7 33-1105 because the Home was not worth enough. A senior lien on the home secured $937,500. This senior lien, combined with the $150,000 homestead exemption, meant that PWB could sell the Home under \u00a7 33-1105 only at a price exceeding $1,087,500. Under the short-sale the Sepics ultimately negotiated, the Home sold for only $535,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Without explaining why it did not invoke \u00a7 33-1105 while the Sepics owned the Home, PWB argues that the Judgment attached as a lien to the Home at the time of\n   recording, and that the lien \"runs with the land.\" Under this principle, PWB contends it has authority to force a sale of the Home now owned by the Castleton Trust. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 As previously stated, \u00a7 33-964 establishes the general rule that a judgment lien does not attach to homestead property, and that homeowners hold their homestead property free and clear of judgment liens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-964(B). Although it is true that once a lien has attached, it \"runs with the land,\" this legal principle is not helpful to PWB because its judgment lien never attached to the Home in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Abandonment of the Homestead\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 PWB next argues that even if the homestead exemption prevented the Judgment Lien from attaching to the Home, the Sepics abandoned the protection of the homestead, and the superior court erred by finding otherwise. As relevant here, a homestead may be abandoned by \"[a] transfer of the homestead property by deed of conveyance or contract for conveyance\" or \"[a] permanent removal of the claimant from the residence.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1104(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 PWB argues the Sepics abandoned their homestead when they conveyed the Home to the Fairbrook Trust prior to the short-sale. But when a homestead exemption is abandoned by a conveyance of the property, the judgment lien does not re-attach to the property upon the sale. Many years ago, our supreme court held that a judgment lien does not \"revive\" upon the sale of homestead property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sec. Tr. &amp; Sav. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571040\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/29/325/#p332\">\n    29 Ariz. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571040\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/29/325/#p332\">\n    241 P. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1925). The same is true today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 PWB also argues the Sepics abandoned their homestead under \u00a7 33-1104(A)(3) by vacating the Home four days before they sold it. Although that provision states that abandonment results from \"[a] permanent removal of the claimant from the residence or the state,\" it also states that a homeowner \"may remove from the homestead for up to two years\" without abandoning the homestead exemption. A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1104(A)(3). Accordingly, the Sepics' departure from the Home shortly before its sale did not constitute an abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Because of the protection afforded by the homestead statutes, the Judgment never attached as a lien to the Home. Therefore, the Sepics conveyed the Home free and clear of the Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Attorneys' Fees on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 The Castleton Trust requests an award of attorneys' fees on appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103(B), which permits the successful party in a quiet title action to recover fees if, \"twenty days before bringing the action, he or she requests a quitclaim deed from the adverse party, tenders five dollars, and the adverse party refuses or neglects to comply.\"\n   <em>\n    McCleary v.

If the superior court awards the Castleton Trust attorneys' fees pursuant to \u00a7 12-1103(B) in further proceedings, it may also award the Castleton Trust its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the entry of an injunction enjoining a Sheriff's sale of the Home.
