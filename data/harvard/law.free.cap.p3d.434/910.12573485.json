Through a\n   confidential informant, the Task Force learned that Santos would be traveling out of state to obtain methamphetamine. On April 2, 2015, the Task Force applied for and received a search warrant to install a tracking device on Santos's vehicle. In the process of placing the tracking device, a detective with the Task Force observed Santos and Ellerbee occupying the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 On April 9, 2015, the tracking device alerted the Task Force that Santos's vehicle had left the Bozeman area. The vehicle stopped at a Wal-Mart in Butte, and then proceeded to Spokane, Washington. From Spokane, the vehicle traveled north to a residence in Elk, Washington, and then returned to Bozeman. Early on the morning of April 10, 2015, the Task Force requested that Montana Highway Patrol stop Santos's vehicle once it reentered Gallatin County. Trooper Erick Fetterhoff observed and followed Santos's vehicle and eventually stopped the vehicle for failing to use a turn signal and for having a cracked windshield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Once Fetterhoff approached the vehicle, he observed that Santos was driving, Ellerbee was asleep in the backseat, and Rebecca Phillips was in the front passenger seat. Fetterhoff noted that Santos and Phillips were both nervous and uncomfortable in dealing with him. Fetterhoff asked the pair where the three of them were going. Phillips responded that they were returning to Bozeman from Spokane after visiting a relative. After being removed from the vehicle to conduct a pat-down search, Santos told Fetterhoff they had visited a close friend near Spokane named \"Sandy.\" When Fetterhoff asked Phillips for the name of the relative she had visited, she initially could not provide a name before offering that it was \"Sandy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Phillips later clarified to officers assisting Fetterhoff that \"Sandy\" was Ellerbee's aunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Fetterhoff issued Santos a warning for the traffic offenses and cited Phillips for not having a valid insurance card in the vehicle. Fetterhoff told Santos and Phillips that they were free to leave, but that he did not believe their stories and that he suspected there were drugs in the car. Santos then admitted to having marijuana in his coat pocket, a methamphetamine pipe in the vehicle, and that Phillips had recently consumed methamphetamine. Fetterhoff seized the vehicle and obtained a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 After the vehicle was seized, Ellerbee woke up and confirmed his identity to officers assisting Fetterhoff. Ellerbee corrected Phillips that \"Sandy\" was not his aunt, but was instead just a friend. After running Ellerbee's name, officers assisting Fetterhoff arrested Ellerbee on outstanding warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 During the search of the vehicle, officers discovered twenty-seven\n   grams of methamphetamine stowed under the rear seat. Officers additionally found a receipt from the Butte Wal-Mart for a $ 900 MoneyGram from Santos to a \"Sandy Trower\" and drug paraphernalia used for ingesting methamphetamine. The Task Force also applied for and received a search warrant authorizing a search of Ellerbee's cell phone, which was seized during his arrest. On Ellerbee's phone, officers found text messages to a \"Sandy Trower.\" The sender, identifying as \"Jason,\" indicated that Ellerbee was going to travel to meet with \"Sandy\" about obtaining an ounce of an unidentified substance. There were also texts discussing a MoneyGram, the MoneyGram's confirmation number, and that the MoneyGram would be sent through a Wal-Mart. The MoneyGram confirmation number matched the receipt for the MoneyGram located inside the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 On September 14, 2015, the State charged Ellerbee with one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-9-103, MCA. On March 29-30, 2016, the case proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of the State's case, Ellerbee's counsel moved for a directed verdict based on insufficiency of the evidence. The District Court denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury. The jury was unable to reach a verdict and the District Court declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 On April 26, 2016, the State amended the Information to charge Ellerbee with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. On August 8-9, 2016, the District Court conducted a second jury trial on the amended charge. The State presented the same witnesses and admitted the same evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 During Ellerbee's second trial, Ellerbee's counsel objected on hearsay grounds to officer testimony repeating Santos's and Phillips's conflicting statements about \"Sandy\" during the traffic stop. The District Court overruled the objection, finding that the statements were offered to show inconsistent statements made by Santos and Phillips and not for the truth of the matter asserted. The District Court provided the jury with a cautionary instruction that the pair's statements were being admitted for this limited purpose. At the close of trial, Ellerbee also requested that a \"mere presence\" jury instruction be given, which the District Court refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 On August 9, 2016, the jury found Ellerbee guilty of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. The District Court designated Ellerbee a persistent felony offender and sentenced him to five years in the Montana State Prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 We review a district court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State also presented evidence showing Ellerbee, along with Santos and Phillips, drove from Bozeman to Elk, Washington to visit Sandy and stopped briefly before returning to Bozeman. Finally, the State presented incriminating text messages between Ellerbee and Sandy indicating a transaction was to take place through a MoneyGram from Walmart, presented the receipt that had been located in the vehicle from that transaction, and presented additional text messages that indicated Ellerbee was involved in drug transactions.
