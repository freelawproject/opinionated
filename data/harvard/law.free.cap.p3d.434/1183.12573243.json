He argues his consent was involuntary under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because, before he was asked if he would submit to the test, the police officer told him his driving privileges would be suspended if he refused. We disagree. Unlike the officer in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress the test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 A few weeks before the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   issued, De Anda was stopped by police while driving and arrested because he showed signs of impairment. At the scene of the arrest, a police officer read De Anda an \"admin per se form\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Arizona law states that a person who operates a motor vehicle at any time in this state gives consent to a test or tests of blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content. The law enforcement officer is authorized to request more than one test and may choose the types of tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If the test results are not available, or indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or above (0.04 or above in a commercial vehicle,) or indicate any drug defined in ARS 13-3401 or its metabolite without a valid prescription, then your Arizona driving privilege will be suspended for not less than 90 consecutive days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   If you refuse, do not expressly agree to submit to, or do not successfully complete the tests, your Arizona driving privilege will be suspended. The suspension will be requested for 12 months, or for two years if you've had a prior implied consent refusal within the last 84 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Will you submit to the tests?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the officer finished reading the form, De Anda agreed to submit to a test, and the officer performed a blood draw. A test of the blood revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.142. De Anda was charged with two counts each of aggravated driving under the influence (\"DUI\") and aggravated DUI with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 De Anda moved to suppress the blood test results. He argued that under A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1321 and\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   , his consent was involuntary because he was told his driving privileges would be suspended if he refused the test before he was asked if he would submit. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion, ruling that the blood draw was voluntary, \"[c]onsidering the circumstances surrounding the arrest, the language in the [admin per se form], and the question posed to the defendant regarding consent\" and the \"criteria set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, if it is not coercive for an officer to tell an arrestee that refusal will result in a license suspension after the arrestee initially refuses but before again requesting consent, it is difficult to understand why first identifying the consequences of refusal would imply that any subsequent assent is involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Although\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   recognized ways that police officers can invoke the implied consent law without violating the Fourth Amendment,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 308 \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we did not state that any departure from those procedures would alone show that consent was involuntary. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   expressly held that the voluntariness of consent given after an admonition turns on the totality of the circumstances, even when consent follows an officer's assertion of lawful authority to search.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 305-06 \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d at 633-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617\n   <em>\n    Medicine\n   </em>\n   does not avail De Anda, because it too embraces a totality of the circumstances approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867749\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/492/\">\n    865 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   500 \u00b6 17. There, the South Dakota Supreme Court declined to hold that the language in the advisement card \"necessarily precludes voluntary consent,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867749\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/492/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and instead concluded, consistent with the trial court's ruling, that the defendant's consent was involuntary under the circumstances, including the language of the advisement, the custodial arrest, and the arrestee's lack of knowledge of his right to refuse consent. There, unlike in this\n   case, consent came only after the suspect was arrested, handcuffed, and placed in a police vehicle and an officer twice asserted authority to perform the test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867749\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/492/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 499 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Here, the admin per se form read to De Anda did not in itself establish that his consent was voluntary-a fact recognized by the trial court in considering the totality of the circumstances in denying the motion to suppress-but it also did not alone render any resulting consent involuntary. Combined with other circumstances, the form's use, like the form used in\n   <em>\n    Medicine\n   </em>\n   , might lead a trial court to reasonably find that consent was not freely and fairly given. To help avoid this prospect, the state would be well advised to use the more recently revised version of the implied consent form, as amended after\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   , to follow the procedure set forth in \u00a7 28-1321(B) or otherwise provide \"the arrestee a clear choice whether to submit to testing or refuse consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   308 \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that De Anda voluntarily consented to the blood draw and denying the motion to suppress.
