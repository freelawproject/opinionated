At issue on review is plaintiff's 42 USC section 1983 claim against defendant Lawhead, former superintendent of the OYA facility where the abuse had occurred. Plaintiff alleged that defendant had violated his federal constitutional rights through deliberate indifference to the risk that the OYA employee would sexually abuse youths housed at the facility. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's section 1983 claim on the basis that the claim accrued at the time of the abuse in 1998 and,\n   consequently, was untimely commenced.

Applying federal law, we hold that an action under section 1983 accrues when a plaintiff knows or reasonably should know of the injury and the defendant's role in causing the injury. Therefore, the trial court erred by dismissing plaintiff's claim in reliance on the principle that a section 1983 claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury alone, which, in this case, it determined was necessarily when the abuse occurred. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand the case to the trial court to reconsider its summary judgment decision under the correct accrual standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

We therefore recite the following facts-which defendant also accepts as true for purposes of summary judgment-in the light most favorable to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1998, plaintiff was 15 years old and housed at an OYA facility where defendant was the superintendent. An OYA employee at the facility named Milligan, who served as a \"group life coordinator\" or \"corrections officer\" to plaintiff and other male youths at the facility, sexually abused plaintiff multiple times. The abuse occurred in the laundry room of the tent cottage to which plaintiff was assigned, an area unmonitored by security cameras. Milligan told plaintiff that no one would believe him if he reported the abuse. Milligan threatened to cut plaintiff's visitation time with family if he tried to report. Milligan also threatened to break plaintiff's neck if he screamed. Plaintiff did not report the abuse to anyone at OYA, and he was released back to his family in 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Initially, plaintiff repressed thoughts and memories of the abuse. But in June 2012, media coverage of the sexual abuse scandal at Penn State University caused plaintiff to recall his own abuse by Milligan. Plaintiff disclosed the abuse to his wife and others for the first time and began searching the internet for information about Milligan. Plaintiff learned that, while still employed by OYA, Milligan had been arrested in 1999 for sexually abusing a boy and then soon after was arrested and charged with kidnapping, sexually abusing, and attempting to murder another boy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both later in 2012 and thereafter, plaintiff learned\n   information indicating to him that defendant had played a role in enabling Milligan's abuse of him at the OYA facility. In May 2014, plaintiff brought a section 1983 claim against defendant for failing to address the known threat of sexual abuse posed by Milligan, alleging violations of his liberty interests in bodily integrity and to be free from sexual abuse under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and of his right to be free from cruel and\n   unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that plaintiff's claim was time-barred by Oregon's two-year statute of limitations generally applicable to tort claims, ORS 12.110(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asserted that the federal accrual rule as articulated by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals controls when the statute of limitations begins to run on a section 1983 claim. Under the Ninth Circuit rule, defendant argued, the claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury that is the basis of the action. Plaintiff countered that the issue is controlled by the \"discovery accrual rule\" that this court had articulated in\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   , which provides that the statute of limitations does not run as to a defendant until the plaintiff discovers both the injury\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the defendant's causal role in the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court concluded that it was bound by federal precedent and that plaintiff's claim was untimely under the accrual rule as articulated by the Ninth Circuit; therefore, it granted defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff appealed, assigning error to the trial court's rejection of this court's precedent in favor of Ninth Circuit case law. Defendant did not dispute that Oregon trial courts are bound by this court's precedents; instead, defendant argued that the trial court did not err in light of the decision in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   . According to defendant,\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   mandates an occurrence-based accrual rule that is \"facially inconsistent\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   with the discovery accrual rule that this court discussed in\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   and necessarily controls as a United States Supreme Court decision. Consequently, defendant urged, the trial court correctly concluded that plaintiff's claim accrued when he suffered the abuse in 1998, well outside the applicable limitations period. While acknowledging that\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   controls, the Court of Appeals determined that \"\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   does not preclude a discovery rule in all section 1983 cases,\" and it reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    J. M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Or.%20App.%20642\">\n    288 Or.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On review, defendant contends that the Court of Appeals' reading of\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   . Defendant advances two alternate articulations of the post-\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   accrual rule. First, defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   announced a standard accrual rule focused on the occurrence of the injury: The limitations period for a section 1983 claim begins when the injury occurs, and the rule excepts only certain special types of torts, and plaintiff's claim does not fall within one of those exceptions. Alternatively, defendant argues that, even if the standard accrual rule incorporates a discovery requirement, that requirement extends to discovery of only the injury, not discovery of a particular defendant's causal role as well, as\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   holds. Defendant asks us to overrule\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   -or to clarify and limit its holding-in light of\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   and to affirm the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's section 1983 claim. As discussed below, we reject both of defendant's proposed accrual rules and reaffirm\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   's holding that a section 1983 claim accrues when a plaintiff knows or reasonably should know of the injury and the defendant's role in causing the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    United States Supreme Court Case Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because federal law governs accrual for section 1983 claims, we begin our analysis by reviewing the two United States Supreme Court cases on the issue:\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Manuel v. City of Joliet\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Those cases advise that the accrual rule conforms in general to common-law tort principles, but they do not clarify whether that rule contains a discovery\n   component. We understand the Court's cases to require a functional, and flexible, approach to the accrual rule that accounts for the nature of the alleged constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff sued the city and multiple police officers under section 1983 for false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, is the principal Supreme Court decision on the issue of when a section 1983 cause of action accrues. The Court clarified that the \"accrual date of a \u00a7 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law that is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   resolved by reference to state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n    549 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). In turn, the Court stated, federal law is based on common-law tort principles: \"Aspects of \u00a7 1983 which are not governed by reference to state law are governed by federal rules conforming in general to common-law tort principles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court explained, \"Under those principles, it is the standard rule that accrual occurs when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action, that is, when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). That \"standard rule\" of accrual suggested a functional approach. By expressing a standard rule based on when a plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief, the Court implied that accrual depends on when the plaintiff has sufficient information for it to be feasible to file a complaint and seek remedies from those responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, the Court stated that a \"refinement\" to that standard rule may be proper if the claim at issue is analogous to a tort that receives \"distinctive treatment\" under the common law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, for accrual purposes, the Court analogized the\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's false arrest claim to the common-law tort of false imprisonment. The Court held that the limitations period for a section 1983 claim premised on \"a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n    at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No party argues that a distinctive accrual rule applies to the tort in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   More recently, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of accrual for a section 1983 action in\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   . There, the\n   Court first considered whether a plaintiff may challenge pretrial detention in a section 1983 action on Fourth Amendment grounds. After answering that question in the affirmative, the Court turned to the remaining question of when the cause of action accrued. The Court offered the following \"brief comments\" before remanding that issue to the Seventh Circuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"In defining the contours and prerequisites of a \u00a7 1983 claim, including its rule of accrual, courts are to look first to the common law of torts. Sometimes, that review of common law will lead a court to adopt wholesale the rules that would apply in a suit involving the most analogous tort. But not always. Common-law principles are meant to guide rather than to control the definition of \u00a7 1983 claims, serving more as a source of inspired examples than of prefabricated components. In applying, selecting among, or adjusting common-law approaches, courts must closely attend to the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 920-21 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court re-emphasized that the rule of accrual is primarily based on the common law of torts, and it placed new emphasis on \"the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.\" The comments also indicated that the Court's approach to accrual of section 1983 claims is flexible, with common-law principles serving to \"guide\" rather than \"control\" the analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant posits that three additional Supreme Court cases weigh on our analysis and compel his first proposed reading of\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   -that accrual occurs at the time of the injury unless an exception for a special tort applies. As explained below, however, we are unpersuaded that those cases carry the weight that defendant assigns them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, relying on\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.

Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   derived its \"standard rule\" from\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Laundry\n   </em>\n   , a case concerning the timeliness of a claim under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980. In that case, the Court had distinguished between two paragraphs of the applicable statute of limitations. One provided a six-year limitations period that commenced on \"the date on which the cause of action arose\"; the other contained an express \"discovery\" rule providing a three-year limitations period that commenced \"after the earliest date on which the plaintiff acquired or should have acquired actual knowledge of the existence of such cause of action[.]\" 29 USC section 1451(f)(1), (2). But the Court's observation that the statutory discovery rule differed from the \"standard\" accrual rule does not lead to defendant's conclusion that accrual of a claim occurs regardless of whether a plaintiff has, or should have, the information needed to bring an action. Rather, the Court went on to explain that the six-year limitations period incorporated \"the standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,\" meaning that the cause of action \"does not become 'complete and present' for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Laundry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471205\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/192/\">\n    522 U.S. at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471205\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/192/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

In stating the foregoing, the court also recognized that \"various exceptions to, and glosses on, the rule\" exist, including the discovery rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537578,3662835\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Connors v. Hallmark &amp; Son Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536619,5681197\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/336/\">\n    935 F.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5681197\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us-app-dc/290/170/\">\n    290 U.S. App. DC 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DC Cir. 1991) ). In\n   <em>\n    Connors\n   </em>\n   , the court had surveyed federal appellate case law and noted with approval that \"[a]t least eight federal courts of appeals have *** agreed *** that the discovery rule is the general accrual rule in federal courts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536619,5681197\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/336/\">\n    935 F.2d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the DC Circuit appears to apply a discovery accrual rule to section 1983 claims, albeit one that is less specific than\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Then there is the Second Circuit, which generally states that \"an action accrues when the wrongful act or omission results in damages, and once the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action[.]\"\n   <em>\n    McDonough v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517957\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/259/\">\n    898 F.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018),\n   <em>\n    cert. granted\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----, ----, --- S.Ct. ----, --- L.Ed.2d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20166879\">\n    2019 WL 166879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (2019) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). But that court is unique in focusing its accrual inquiry on whether all the elements of a claim were present and known or discoverable. In\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that a section 1983 claim based on\n   fabrication-of-evidence allegations accrued when (1) the plaintiff learned of the fabrication and it was used against him and (2) his liberty had consequently been deprived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052956\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/93/\">\n    782 F.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015) (concluding that the section 1983 cause of action accrued when all the elements of the First Amendment retaliation claim were satisfied). The Second Circuit's focus on the presence of the tortious elements aligns with common-law tort principles,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dobbs, 1\n   <em>\n    The Law of Torts, Practitioner Treatise Series\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 243 at 878, and appears to represent an understanding of\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   as providing only basic guidance on the issue of accrual, rather than a rigid mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Lastly, the Tenth Circuit has stated that, \"[i]n general, [accrual] occurs when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Jamerson v. Heimgartner\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-3101, --- Fed.Appx. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204523109\">\n    2018 WL 4523109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (10th Cir. Sept. 21, 2018). However, that court has based its accrual analysis on the type of claims at issue. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Varnell v. Dora Consol. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899728\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1208/\">\n    756 F.3d 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2014), the court considered when a section 1983 claim asserting sexual abuse accrued against the school district that employed the teacher who had committed the abuse. It first analogized the plaintiff's claim to the tort of battery, then consulted the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts\n   </em>\n   for when the tort of battery is complete, and finally determined that the plaintiff's claim accrued at the time of the last physical contact or sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899728\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899728\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1208/\">\n    at 1215-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of particular note is that the court did not preclude application of a discovery rule to the issue of accrual. The\n   <em>\n    Varnell\n   </em>\n   plaintiff had argued that the discovery rule, \"which delays accrual of a claim until the plaintiff knew or should have known the facts necessary to establish her cause of action,\" applied to her case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899728\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899728\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1208/\">\n    at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without deciding whether the discovery rule does apply to section 1983 claims, the Tenth Circuit stated that, even if the rule does, the plaintiff's claim would still be untimely.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899728\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the court did not reject the discovery rule as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Consistently with its approach of tailoring the accrual inquiry to the claim at issue, when confronted with section 1983 claims alleging violation of the plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights, the Tenth Circuit stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"those claims accrued when [the plaintiff] knew or had reason to know, separately for each of these [d]efendants *** to be liable, that they had acted with deliberate indifference to a known risk to [the plaintiff's] medical needs, and that his or her deliberate indifference resulted in a delay in treatment that caused [the plaintiff] substantial harm.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515921\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1270/#p1276\">\n    882 F.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (10th Cir. 2018) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The Tenth Circuit's claim-by-claim approach to the accrual issue reflects the functionality and flexibility that the Supreme Court emphasized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based on our reading of\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Manuel\n   </em>\n   , we consider a more expansive discovery rule, such as the one followed in\n   <em>\n    T. R.\n   </em>\n   and by courts in the Fifth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, to comport with the practical realities for plaintiffs who are seeking to vindicate constitutional rights through claims under section 1983. Our conclusion is supported by federal appellate case law, which, despite lacking any conclusive uniformity, demonstrates definitively that defendant's first proposed accrual rule is unworkable. No federal circuit court has derived from\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   the strict occurrence-based rule that defendant proposes. And although defendant's alternative articulation of the\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   accrual rule-that discovery of an injury alone is enough to start the limitations period running-does find some support in federal appellate case law, we find that reading unpersuasive. In our view, a rule that requires a plaintiff to bring a claim without any regard for the plaintiff's knowledge of whom to sue is neither functional nor flexible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We hold that an action under section 1983 accrues when a plaintiff knows or reasonably should know of the injury and the defendant's role in causing the injury. Thus, the trial court erred by applying an incorrect rule of law in considering when plaintiff's section 1983 claim accrued for purposes of defendant's motion for summary judgment. On review, the parties have not fully argued whether defendant is entitled to summary judgment under the correct accrual rule, and the trial court did not reach other arguments that defendant had asserted in his summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment dismissing plaintiff's section 1983 claim against defendant and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. The judgment of the circuit court dismissing plaintiff's section 1983 claim against defendant is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Although OYA and defendant jointly petitioned for review, the only issue before us is the grant of summary judgment on plaintiff's claim against defendant. Our references to defendant's arguments are shorthand for their joint arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Because we resolve this case on another ground, we do not address plaintiff's and\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    's argument for recognizing the discovery rule as a tolling provision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The summary judgment record also includes a copy of case information from the Oregon Judicial Case Information Network pertaining to 2013 criminal charges brought against Milligan. The case information shows that Milligan was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of sexual penetration with a foreign object, resulting in a lengthy prison sentence. Plaintiff represented to the trial court that he was the abuse victim in that case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The statute of limitations for section 1983 claims \"is that which the [forum] [s]tate provides for personal-injury torts.\"\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     549 U.S. at 387\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1091\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    No party disputes that the injury in this case was Milligan's sexual abuse of plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     Manuel\n    </em>\n    left unresolved whether a claim for unlawful pretrial detention is more analogous to a claim of false arrest (which accrues at the onset of legal process) or to a claim of malicious prosecution (which accrues only upon dismissal of the charges).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    We note that the Supreme Court also consulted Dobbs'\n    <em>\n     Law of Torts\n    </em>\n    -albeit a different version-to inform its analysis of when the section 1983 claim in\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n    accrued.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     549 U.S. at 388-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p388\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1091\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In some jurisdictions, the claim does not accrue until the plaintiff also discovers or should have discovered that \"the defendant may have been negligent or otherwise legally responsible.\" Dobbs, 1\n    <em>\n     The Law of Torts, Practitioner Treatise Series\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 243 at 878-79.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
