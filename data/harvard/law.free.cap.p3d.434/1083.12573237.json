Further, once the records for that conviction are sealed, the conviction is treated as if it never occurred. Therefore, under RCW 13.50.260(4)(a), P.M.P.'s conviction of indecent liberties by forcible compulsion would not preclude the court from sealing his records for first degree child molestation, a class A offense. Under the plain language of RCW 13.50.260(4)(a), the superior court must grant a motion to seal his records for first degree child molestation if the specified statutory conditions are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 For these reasons, the superior court erred when it denied P.M.P.'s motion to seal his juvenile record.

In his plea statement, P.M.P. stated in his own words what he did that resulted in being charged with the offenses. P.M.P.'s written statement was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about April 30, 1991, I had sexual contact with [G.C.] who I am not married to, then being 3 y[ea]rs younger than me in Pierce County, W[ashington].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about April, 1990, I had sexual contact with [D.C.], a person I am not married to, by forcible compulsion, in Pierce County, W[ashington].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 As part of P.M.P.'s juvenile sexual offender dispositional order, the court ordered community supervision with a variety of conditions including, for example, registration as a sex offender. The superior court relieved P.M.P. from his obligation to register as a sex offender on December 7, 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 On October 27, 2016, P.M.P. filed a motion to seal his juvenile record based on RCW 13.50.260, with a declaration in support. P.M.P.'s motion erroneously listed indecent liberties as a class A felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 7, the State filed a response, arguing that the by \"forcible compulsion\" language included in the plea statement precluded P.M.P. from sealing the indecent liberties count under RCW 13.50.260(4)(a)(v), because the offense was committed with actual forcible compulsion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 On November 21, after hearing argument from the parties, the superior court commissioner denied P.M.P.'s motion to seal. The court commissioner's order found, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. The respondent's juvenile adjudication is Rape in the First Degree, Rape in the Second Degree, or Indecent Liberties with Forcible Compulsion that was actually committed with forcible compulsion.

However, he withdrew his appeal after recognizing an error in the original motion that he had filed with the superior court-namely, that indecent liberties by forcible compulsion was not a class A felony, but was a class B felony in 1993 and remained a class B felony under\n   <em>\n    Rivard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007614\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/775/#p781\">\n    168 Wash.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20186\">\n    231 P.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10 P.M.P. filed another motion to seal with the superior court and, this time, he properly listed the indecent liberties charge as a class B felony. The State agreed that the indecent liberties by forcible compulsion was a class B felony at the time P.M.P. was convicted, although the crime was later elevated to a class A felony in 2001. Still, the State argued that the reclassification did not change the analysis or result as to whether P.M.P.'s record could be sealed. The superior court agreed with the State, and its order essentially mirrored the superior court commissioner's order originally entered on November 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 P.M.P. appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I.

The State argues that this provision focuses on the elements of indecent liberties committed by forcible compulsion, not its offense classification.

The State contends that nothing in the record suggests any legislative intent to distinguish consideration of pre-2011 indecent liberties with forcible compulsion cases from post-2011 indecent liberties cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 24 What this argument ignores, though, is that the 2011 amendments to RCW 13.50.260(4)(a)(v) applied only to class A offenses and, as shown above,\n   <em>\n    Rivard\n   </em>\n   and the savings clause require us to treat P.M.P.'s indecent liberties conviction as a class B offense. For these reasons, P.M.P.'s conviction of indecent liberties by forcible compulsion remains a class B felony for the purposes of our analysis in accord with RCW 10.01.040 and\n   <em>\n    Rivard\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 25 The State also argues that even though RCW 13.50.260(4)(b) requires the sealing of class B felonies if the specified statutory conditions are met, sealing P.M.P.'s conviction for indecent liberties by forcible compulsion under former RCW 9A.44.100(1)(a) would defeat the legislative intent expressed in RCW 13.50.260(4)(a)(v) for class A offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 26 As noted, RCW 13.50.260(4)(a)(v) provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The court\n   <em>\n    shall grant\n   </em>\n   any motion to seal records for class A offenses ... if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (v) The person has\n   <em>\n    not been convicted of\n   </em>\n   rape in the first degree, rape in the second degree, or\n   <em>\n    indecent liberties that was actually committed with forcible compulsion\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The State argues that if P.M.P.'s indecent liberties conviction is sealed because it was a class B felony under former RCW 9A.44.100(1)(a), then that conviction must be treated as if it never occurred. In that case, the State argues, P.M.P.'s conviction for first degree child molestation must then also be sealed, as RCW 13.50.260(4)(a)(v) would no longer preclude him from sealing that conviction. Thus, the State claims that allowing P.M.P. to seal his class B felony produces a conflict that defeats the legislature's intent to preclude a person convicted of \"indecent liberties that was actually committed with forcible compulsion\" from sealing records for class A offenses. Br. of Resp't at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 27 In 1997, RCW 13.50.050 categorically prohibited juveniles with a class A felony or sex offenses from sealing records. LAWS OF 1997, ch. 338, \u00a7 40. In 2011, the legislature amended this statute to allow juveniles with class A felony offenses to seal those records, so long as \"[t]he person has not been convicted of rape in the first degree, rape in the second degree, or indecent liberties that was actually committed with forcible compulsion.\" LAWS OF 2011, ch. 338, \u00a7 4. In 2014, the legislature recodified the sealing statute in a new section, RCW 13.50.260. LAWS OF 2014, ch. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 3-4. Both parties appear to agree that we should apply the current sealing statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 28 Thus, on the one hand, we apply the felony classification scheme in place at the time P.M.P. was convicted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007614\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/775/#p781\">\n    168 Wash.2d at 781-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20186\">\n    231 P.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, we agree with both parties that we apply the current sealing statute. With that, we turn to the plain language of the relevant statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 29 The juvenile record sealing statute provides that after a convicted person meets certain conditions, that person can petition the court to \"order the sealing of the official juvenile court record, the social file, and records of the court and of any other agency in the case.\" RCW 13.50.260(3). Once that person receives a court order sealing their juvenile court records,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [t]hereafter, the proceedings in the case shall be\n   <em>\n    treated as if they never occurred\n   </em>\n   , and the subject of the records may reply accordingly to any inquiry about the events, records of which are sealed.
