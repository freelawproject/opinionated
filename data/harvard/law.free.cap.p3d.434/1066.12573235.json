Alston claims that application of the statute to his sentence violates the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. Because the law operates retroactively and increases the quantum of punishment from the level to which Alston was subject on the date of the crime, we agree and grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The facts are not in dispute. In 2008, a jury convicted Kenneth Alston of assault in the first degree while armed with a firearm for an offense he committed on September 30, 2007. In accordance with the law in effect at the time of the crime, the court sentenced him to 153 months of confinement, to be followed by a variable term of community custody of 24 to 48 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   former RCW 9.94A.715(1) (2006) (requiring sentencing court to impose variable terms of community custody); former RCW 9.94A.850(5) (2005) (Sentencing Guidelines Commission empowered to recommend ranges); former RCW 9.94A.030(41) (2006) (classifying assault in the first degree as a serious violent offense); former WAC 437-20-010 (2007) (designating community custody range of 24 to 48 months for serious violent offenses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Alston was serving his term of incarceration in 2009 when the Washington State Legislature amended the law with regard to community custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The new law replaced variable terms with fixed terms of 12, 18, or 36 months, depending on the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 2009, ch. 375, \u00a7 5; former RCW 9.94A.701(1) - (3) (2009). Under the new law, the community custody term for the crime of assault in the first degree is 36 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 9.94A.701(1)(b) ; RCW 9.94A.030(46)(a)(v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The legislature indicated its intent that the amendment should apply retroactively to individuals, such as Alston, who were sentenced before 2009 and still incarcerated or serving terms of community custody at the time the new law was enacted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This act applies retroactively and prospectively regardless of whether the offender is currently on community custody or probation with the department, currently incarcerated with a term of community custody or probation with the department, or sentenced after the effective date of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   LAWS OF 2009, ch. 375, \u00a7 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 2008, ch. 231, \u00a7 6. The legislature also specifically charged the Department of Corrections (Department) with recalculating terms of community custody for individuals in the Department's custody to bring the sentences into compliance with the current law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 2009, ch. 375, \u00a7 9 (The \"department of corrections shall recalculate the term of community custody and reset the date that community custody will end ... for a crime specified in RCW 9.94A.701.\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, in July 2009, the Department recalculated the length of Alston's community custody, replacing his variable term with a fixed term of 36 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 In June 2017, Alston filed a \"Petition For Contempt Of Court Pursuant To RCW 7.21 et seq. For Remedial Sanctions\" in King County Superior Court. That court transferred the matter to this court for consideration as a personal restraint petition.

He seeks reimposition of the variable term of community custody, as provided for in his judgment and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 To prevail on a personal restraint petition, a petitioner must show that he or she is under restraint as defined by RAP 16.4(b) and that the restraint is unlawful under RAP 16.4(c).\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.
