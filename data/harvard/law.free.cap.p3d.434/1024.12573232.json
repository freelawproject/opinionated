This classification determines the eligibility of the initiative for vote by the people of Spokane. The appeal raises other issues, including the mootness of the suit after the city council amended a city ordinance referenced in the initiative, the standing of challengers to obtain an injunction removing the initiative from the ballot, the imposition of a statute of limitations to a suit challenging a proposed initiative, the application of laches to preclude a suit challenging an initiative, the legality of the initiative in light of state and federal law, and the implication of the initiative backers' First Amendment rights. Because the proposed initiative arises from an administrative framework, because the initiative entails directions to city employees, because the initiative meddles in the administration of the city's police force and may interfere in effective law enforcement, and because the initiative runs contrary to state, if not, federal law, we declare the initiative administrative in nature. We affirm the trial court's grant of an order enjoining placement of the initiative on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 This appeal concerns the validity of \"Proposition 1,\" a proposed City of Spokane initiative originally scheduled for placement on the November 2017 ballot. The gist of the initiative would allow Spokane city employees, including law enforcement officers, to question without any restriction individuals about their immigration status and citizenship status, permit employees to assemble information on residents' immigration status, and share the information with others. The background to the lawsuit precedes the filing of the initiative and begins with state law and continues with Spokane Police Department internal policy and Spokane ordinances adopted by the Spokane City Council. We\n   review, but heavily redact for purposes of shortening an already lengthy opinion, state law, police department policy, and city ordinances before identifying the history and content of Proposition 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 We begin with some background to the challengers of Proposition 1, which challengers initiated this declaratory suit to declare Proposition 1 invalid. Plaintiff Global Neighborhood, a nonprofit organization, operates under the mission statement to \" 'provide former refugees with opportunities for holistic development.' \" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 7. Global Neighborhood serves former refugees living in the city of Spokane by engaging in activities aimed at improving quality of life, such as providing employment at a thrift shop it owns and operates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Plaintiff Refugee Connections of Spokane, also a nonprofit organization, develops projects, programs, and resources that benefit refugees and immigrants and their communities in Spokane. In support of the suit, Amina Abdul-Fields, Chair of the Board of Directors of Refugee Connections, submitted a declaration. Abdul-Fields averred that Refugee Connections' many services to refugees and immigrants include the Harvest Project, Patient Passports, and Interpreter Training. The organization promotes civic engagement through police potlucks, law and justice workshops, and the World Refugee Day Celebration. Refugee Connections understands that many immigrants arrive from nations wherein authority symbolizes a threat. The law and justice workshop seeks to foster a positive view of the United States legal system, explain how the American criminal justice system functions, identify key civil liberties, and provide written information on where to seek assistance in protecting those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Amina Abdul-Fields declared that members of the immigrant and refugee community served by Refugee Connections will become targeted and injured by changes to law enforcement profiling resulting from the passage of Proposition 1. The immigrant community will be subjected to additional stops by Spokane police officers solely on the basis of the person's appearance, accent, or mannerisms. Increased contact with law enforcement based solely on immigration status will increase fear and reluctance on the part of refugees to contact police or seek protections from the legal system. Abdul-Fields concluded that adoption of Proposition 1 will challenge Refugee Connections' ability to serve the immigrant and refugee community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Spokane Chinese Association, a nonprofit association, was formed by people of Chinese cultural heritage residing in the Spokane area. The organization strives to advance communication and friendship among its members and to enrich their lives and local culture by organizing activities related to Chinese culture or common interests. The plaintiff Asian Pacific Islander Coalition-Spokane promotes equitable access to culturally competent and linguistically accessible health and human services, economic development for small businesses, civil and human rights, and equal access to education for Asian Pacific Americans, including immigrants, refugees, and citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Each plaintiff organization contends it serves members of the community that will be adversely targeted by changes to law enforcement profiling resulting from the passage of Proposition 1. We refer to the plaintiffs collectively as \"Global Neighborhood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The parties agree that this appeal poses no direct question as to whether city employees' seeking and sharing of the immigration status of individual constitutes racial profiling. Nevertheless, this appeal in part embodies the relationship between racial profiling and enforcing immigration law. Global Neighborhood claims that Proposition 1 promotes racial profiling. RCW 43.101.410, enacted in 2002, directs local law enforcement agencies to address racial profiling. The statute declares, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Local law enforcement agencies shall comply with the recommendations of the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs regarding racial profiling, as set forth under (a) through (f) of this subsection. Local law enforcement agencies shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (a) Adopt a written policy designed to condemn and prevent racial profiling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b) Review and audit their existing procedures, practices, and training to ensure\n   that they do not enable or foster the practice of racial profiling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (c) Continue training to address the issues related to racial profiling. Officers should be trained in how to better interact with persons they stop so that legitimate police actions are not misperceived as racial profiling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (d) Ensure that they have in place a citizen complaint review process that can adequately address instances of racial profiling. The process must be accessible to citizens and must be fair. Officers found to be engaged in racial profiling must be held accountable through the appropriate disciplinary procedures within each department;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (e) Work with the minority groups in their community to appropriately address the issue of racial profiling; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (f) Within fiscal constraints, collect demographic data on traffic stops and analyze that data to ensure that racial profiling is not occurring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In explaining the 2002 law, the legislature declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [R]acial profiling is the illegal use of race\n   <em>\n    or ethnicity\n   </em>\n   as a factor in deciding to stop and question, take enforcement action, arrest, or search a person or vehicle with or without a legal basis under the United States Constitution or Washington [S]tate Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   LAWS OF 2002 ch. 14, \u00a7 1(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The legislature recognizes that the president of the United States has issued an executive order stating that stopping or searching individuals on the basis of race is not an effective law enforcement policy, that it is inconsistent with democratic ideals, especially the commitment to equal protection under the law for all persons, and that it is neither legitimate nor defensible as a strategy for public protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   LAWS OF 2002 ch. 14, \u00a7 1(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 9 We move to policies and ordinances of the city of Spokane, Washington State's second city with a 2017 estimated population of 217,300. The Spokane City Council delegated the authority to adopt police department policy to the city police department and its chief. Spokane Municipal Code (SMC) 3.10.010(B)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The chief of police administers the Spokane police department and the police reserve force and has the authority to make rules and issue orders for the proper functioning of the division, consistent with law, council policy, and the rules of civil service commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 10 Presumably to comply with RCW 43.101.410, the Spokane Police Department adopted policies 402 and 428.

The ordinances codified the department policies respectively into former SMC \u00a7\u00a7 3.10.040, .050 (2014). Until 2017 amendments, the two code sections read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3.10.040 Biased Free Policing\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   B.

The proposed initiative would amend former SMC 3.10.040 to eliminate citizenship status from the list of prohibited factors for city police to consider during investigations, would repeal former SMC 3.10.050, and would add a new code section that would prohibit the city from limiting any city employee from collecting immigration status information and sharing the information with federal authorities. SMC 3.10.060 would read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Respect for Law: The City of Spokane shall not limit the ability of any city employee from collecting immigration status information, communicating immigration status information and cooperating with federal law enforcement authorities unless such regulation is approved by a majority vote of the City Council and a majority vote of the people at an election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   CP at 172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 14 On December 8, 2015, Jackie Murray sent two separate e-mails that declared she formally withdrew her sponsorship of the initiative petition. The Spokane County auditor\n   continued with the initiative process anyway and certified that Murray submitted the requisite number of signatures for a vote. On February 22, 2016, the Spokane City Council placed the initiative on the November 7, 2017 ballot as Proposition 1. The\n   <em>\n    Spokesman Review\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Spokane Journal of Business\n   </em>\n   thereafter penned editorials lamenting the filing of an anti-immigrant initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 15 On March 27, 2017, after placement of Proposition 1 on the November 2017 ballot, the Spokane City Council passed Spokane Ordinance C35485, which repealed former SMC 3.10.040 and .050, the two code sections that Proposition 1 sought to amend or repeal. The city council adopted the ordinance ostensibly because it wished to consolidate various sections and chapters of the city code into a new Title 18 that addressed human rights. Before the creation of Title 18, the municipal code scattered human rights provisions throughout various code sections. Spokane Ordinance C35485 recodified similar, but not identical, language from the repealed sections into the new Title 18.

Defendants include Spokane County Auditor Vicky Dalton, the City of Spokane, and Respect Washington. The county auditor takes no position on the merits of the suit. Respect Washington actively opposes the suit. The City of Spokane takes no position on the merits of the lawsuit, but asks that, if Proposition 1 is invalid, we enjoin its placement on the ballot. In its answer to the complaint, Spokane noted that it will pay for the cost of the Proposition 1 election, and the\n   city did not wish to pay for an election for an invalid measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 18 On July 28, 2017, Global Neighborhood moved the trial court for a declaratory judgment prohibiting Proposition 1 from being placed on the November 2017 ballot. Global Neighborhood raised at least three arguments in support of its motion for relief. Global Neighborhood claimed that Proposition 1 was invalid due to two procedural violations of the SMC. First, Proposition 1 lacked a sponsor in contravention of the Spokane Municipal Code, since Jackie Murray withdrew her sponsorship before the validation of signatures. Second, the petition for the initiative contained inflammatory and prejudicial language contrary to SMC 2.02.060(D)(5). In fact, the city clerk informed Respect Washington that language in the petition conflicted with the requirements of the municipal code, and the clerk directed the group to remove the language. Respect Washington did not comply with the request. On the merits, Global Neighborhood argued that the subject matter of Proposition 1 was administrative in nature and thus not a proper subject for an initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 19 The trial court granted Global Neighborhood's request for declaratory judgment. In doing so, the trial court declared that a justiciable controversy existed, that plaintiffs held organizational standing and standing through their respective members, and that laches did not bar the suit. The superior court ruled Proposition 1 invalid because the measure seeks to repeal portions of the Spokane Municipal Code previously rescinded. The superior court also declared Proposition 1 invalid because the measure is administrative in nature and thereby exceeds the local initiative power. The trial court entered an injunction directing the removal of Proposition 1 from the November 2017 ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 20 The primary issue on appeal and on which our decision rests is whether Proposition 1 is administrative or legislative in nature. Nevertheless, Respect Washington raises defenses and other hurdles to Global Neighborhood obtaining relief, which defenses and arguments include laches, the statute of limitations, lack of harm for purposes of an injunction, and violation of Respect Washington's and its members First Amendment rights by reason of the legal attack on Proposition 1. In turn, Global Neighborhood asks that this court decline to address the merits of Respect Washington's appeal because of the moot nature of the case. Global Neighborhood does not seek to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the initiative's sponsor withdrew her sponsorship before certification for the ballot. Since we would not need to address the merits of the appeal if some event rendered the appeal moot, we address mootness first. We also review, before entertaining the merits of the appeal, defenses asserted by Respect Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Mootness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 21 After the certification of Proposition 1 for the November 2017 ballot, the Spokane City Council, through Spokane Ordinance C35485, repealed former SMC 3.10.040 and .050, code sections that Proposition 1 sought to amend or repeal. Proposition 1 specifically identified the two code sections as the initiative's target. With Spokane Ordinance C35485, former SMC 3.10.040 and .050 no longer exist. According to Global Neighborhood, the repeal of former SMC 3.10.040 and .050 in Spokane Ordinance C35485 renders Proposition 1 moot, because revoking or amending nonexistent code sections serves no purpose. Global Neighborhood does not contend that the passing of the November 2017 election leaves the initiative moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 22 Global Neighborhood's contention ignores the existence of the substantive provisions, previously found in former SMC 3.10.040 and .050, within Title 18 SMC. One could read Proposition 1 as now targeting SMC 18.01.010 and .030(D), (U), and (V), SMC 18.01.040, SMC 18.07.010 and .020, which sections continue to define prohibited \"profiling\" as including acting on another's perceived or actual citizenship status. The new sections, like the former sections, also generally prohibit a law enforcement officer from asking a person about his or her citizenship status. Global Neighborhood's contention also ignores Proposition 1's attempt to add a new section, SMC 3.10.060, to the\n   Spokane code. The passing of Spokane Ordinance C35485 does not render irrelevant the addition of this new section to the code by an initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 23 As a general rule, this court will not review a moot question.\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Financially Responsible Government v.

We review each decision to discern whether we should declare the validity of some or portions of Proposition 1 moot because of Spokane Ordinance C35485.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 26 In\n   <em>\n    City of Yakima v. Huza\n   </em>\n   , chapter 5.50 City of Yakima Municipal Code imposed a tax on the gross receipts of electricity, telephone, water, sewer, and garbage utilities in the city of Yakima. In November and December 1961, the city respectively enacted Ordinances 300 and 308. The ordinances increased the permanent tax rate for the telephone utility receipts, enacted a temporary surtax for the calendar year 1962 on electricity and telephone utilities' receipts, and enacted a tax on the gross receipts for the calendar year 1962 received by the natural gas company. In April 1962, Stephen Huza filed an initiative petition with the city clerk. The proposed initiative would repeal the increased tax rates on the gross receipts of the electricity and telephone utilities, repeal the tax on the gross receipts of the natural gas company, allow tax credits on future taxes equal to all increased taxes collected under Ordinances 300 and 308 before their revocation, and reduce taxes for water, sewer, and garbage services. The initiative proposed to accomplish its purposes by expressly repealing Ordinances 300 and 308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 27 On July 3, 1962, the city of Yakima commenced legal action to challenge Stephen Huza's initiative petition on the ground that only the city council held authority to amend tax measures. On October 29, 1962, before any trial, the Yakima City Council passed Ordinance 390 that essentially adopted the same measures as Ordinances 300 and 308, but for the calendar year 1963. Ordinance 390 never mentioned Ordinances 300 or 308. Ordinance 390 instead directly referenced chapter 5.50, City of Yakima Municipal Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 28 On appeal, the City of Yakima argued that newly enacted Ordinance 390 rendered moot the right to vote on Stephen Huza's proposed initiative since Ordinance 390 repealed Ordinances 300 and 308, the two ordinances the initiative sought to repeal. The Supreme Court agreed. The Court reasoned that the proposed initiative would repeal the tax measures implanted in Ordinances 300 and 308, but those same taxes would continue based on Ordinance 390 despite the repeal of the earlier ordinances. The proposed initiative could have sought to directly repeal provisions of chapter 5.50 of the municipal code, but failed to expressly mention the code chapter. Although the initiative sought to repeal the tax increases, the court deemed the initiative worthless because the initiative did not mention the recently enacted ordinance number or the code sections that then referenced the taxes. In effect, a city could renumber the ordinance or code section sought to be repealed by an initiative in order to escape the initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 29 Three dissenters, in\n   <em>\n    City of Yakima v. Huza\n   </em>\n   , characterized the City of Yakima's\n   action as legislative shenanigans, a frustration of the initiative process, and a flagrant abuse of the judicial process. We agree with the dissenters that a city should not be allowed to enact later ordinances that readopt the same substantive measures but under different numbering or coding, in order to obstruct a proposed initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 30 In\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Financially Responsible Government v. City of Spokane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1145881\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/99/339/#p350\">\n    99 Wash.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=662%20P.2d%20845\">\n    662 P.2d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), citizens filed a referendum with the city of Spokane city clerk, which referendum would repeal Ordinance C25792, an ordinance imposing a business and occupation tax. One month later, the Spokane City Council passed Ordinance C25832, which amended Ordinance C25792. We do not know the nature of the amendments. The clerk refused to accept the referendum based on the city attorney's advice that only the city council held authority to adopt or repeal a tax measure and the measure was administrative rather than legislative in nature. The citizens sought a writ of mandamus to compel the filing and processing of the referendum. The superior court granted the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 31 On appeal to the Supreme Court, the City of Spokane, while relying on\n   <em>\n    City of Yakima v. Huza\n   </em>\n   , argued that the proposed initiative became moot with the adoption of Ordinance C25832, which amended Ordinance C25792, the subject of the initiative. The\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   on the basis that the later adopted Yakima ordinance was complete in itself and never referenced the two ordinances sought to be repealed by the initiative. The later adopted Spokane ordinance merely amended the earlier ordinance sought to be revoked. The later adopted Spokane ordinance did not stand alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 32 Despite distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   court wrote that it agreed with the\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   dissenters that a repealing or reenacting ordinance should not be allowed to frustrate the initiative process. Accordingly, the Supreme Court will frown on the deliberate efforts by a legislative body to circumvent the initiative rights of the electorate. The\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   court, however, declined to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   because of the differences in the effect of the respective Yakima and Spokane later adopted ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 33 We do not know if the Spokane City Council deliberately adopted Spokane Ordinance C35485 for the purpose of evading Proposition 1. But we need not rest our decision on any deliberate evasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 34 We doubt the validity of\n   <em>\n    City of Yakima v. Huza\n   </em>\n   after\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Financially Responsible Government v. City of Spokane\n   </em>\n   , but deem this appeal more aligned with the facts of\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   court wrote that\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   must be limited to its unique facts, a comment that may politely overrule\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   . Like the Yakima amending ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Huza\n   </em>\n   , Spokane's Ordinance C35485 is complete in itself. Nevertheless, unlike the Yakima ordinance and similar to the Spokane amending ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   , Ordinance C35485 refers to the previously enacted code sections, which are the objects of Respect Washington's initiative. Although Proposition 1 does not identify the current code sections that prohibit profiling based on and questioning about one's citizenship status, a court or a city official could deem Proposition 1 to now target code sections found in Title 18 SMC. Since a new ordinance should not frustrate the initiative process, we hold that the validity of Proposition 1 is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 35 Spokane Ordinance C35485 added refugee and immigration status to citizenship status as forbidden subjects of questioning and profiling by law enforcement officers. These additions raise the problem of whether Proposition 1, if passed, would allow questioning detainees about citizenship status, but not about refugee or immigration status, despite the three statuses being interrelated. Because we rest our decision on other grounds, we need not resolve this anomaly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 36 Despite the Supreme Court directing us to address mootness first because mootness impacts the jurisdiction of the courts, mootness does not necessarily preclude court review.

If any lawsuit will remedy the flaw in the initiative's name, the lawsuit should be brought in advance of the election and in time for the Secretary of State or local government official to place a proper title on the ballot.

Global Neighborhood first contends that the record does not show that it had any knowledge of the existence of Proposition 1 until it filed suit. We reject this contention since actual knowledge is not necessary. The first element of laches extends to a reasonable opportunity to discover on the part of a plaintiff a potential cause of action. The record shows that the Spokane City Council publicly addressed the placement of Proposition 1 on the ballot. The record further shows Proposition 1 to be well publicized in the Spokane environs. The record includes editorials by the\n   <em>\n    Spokesman Review\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Spokane Journal of Business\n   </em>\n   ruing the anti-immigrant initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 48 Global Neighborhood waited until May 1, 2017, to file suit despite the Spokane City Council, on February 22, 2016, placing Proposition 1 on the November 2017 ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Global Neighborhood comments that it filed suit one month after the Spokane City Council recodified the Spokane Municipal Code's racial profiling prohibitions into other sections in the code. But Global Neighborhood does not suggest that it delayed filing suit in order to determine if the city council would recodify the provisions. Global Neighborhood also lacks an explanation for delaying its challenge for more than one month after passage of Spokane Ordinance C35485. Therefore, we cannot assess the reasonableness of the delay and, for purposes of this appeal, we assume unreasonableness. Nevertheless, we find no harm to Respect Washington by reason of a delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 49 Respect Washington relies on\n   <em>\n    Lopp v.

The challenger contended that the school district failed to give proper notice of a board meeting during which the board amended the title to a bond measure submitted to the voters. Nevertheless, the court found the public to have been harmed by the delay in challenging the vote approving the bond measure. The school district had received a favorable bid on the bonds, and, if the district could not accept the bid, it would need to commence the entire bond offering procedure again. The district would also lose three months of interest income, and construction plans would be delayed. The delay in construction would further exacerbate the already congested condition of classroom facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 50 Respect Washington complains that the delay in filing suit harmed it because the delay ensured that the organization could not receive appellate review of a decision prior to the November 2017 election, and, in turn, Respect Washington could not benefit by the initiative being on the 2017 ballot. Respect Washington observes that the superior court's decision was issued on August 29, 2017, one week before the September 5, 2017 deadline for the ballots to be printed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 51 Although we recognize Respect Washington's right to appellate review, Respect Washington cites no case that a delay in appellate review constitutes harm for purposes of laches. Also, Respect Washington's claim of harm assumes that this court would reverse the superior court's decision and allow Proposition 1 to be submitted for a vote. The claim of harm also assumes that it had the right to a vote on an initiative that exceeded the initiative power. If anything, the Spokane public is prejudiced by the expense incurred by the City of Spokane in conducting a special election for an initiative beyond the scope of the initiative power, such that this court should not dismiss the suit on laches. The claim of harm also assumes that this court lacks authority to direct placement of Proposition 1 on a later ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 52 Respect Washington's contention also fails to recognize the possibility of accelerated review by this court. Respect Washington never sought accelerated review.

In so arguing, Respect Washington does not challenge the plaintiffs' standing to bring this suit. Respect Washington challenges whether the organizations suffered sufficient harm to gain standing for the issuance of an injunction. We are unaware of any decision that delicately slices a party's standing in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b6 54 Respect Washington challenges the trial court's ruling that the plaintiffs suffered \"organizational harm.\" Respect Washington downplays any harm suffered by the organizations in diverting resources to assist members in the event Proposition 1 passed.

Respect Washington apparently contends that, since an initiative always impacts someone, no one deserves standing to challenge the validity of the initiative. Respect Washington fails to consider that someone impacted by the initiative always has standing. The doctrine of standing generally permits someone injured or impacted by an enactment to challenge the enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6 56 One who seeks relief by temporary or permanent injunction must show: (1) that he or she possesses a clear legal or equitable right, (2) that he or she has a well-grounded fear of immediate invasion of that right, and (3) that the acts complained of are either resulting in or will result in actual and substantial injury to him.\n   <em>\n    Washington Federation of State Employees v.

Thus, the City of Spokane asks this court, as it did the superior court, to enjoin Proposition 1 from the ballot, assuming the initiative to be outside the scope of the local initiative power.

Mike Wallin sponsored a local initiative proposing restrictions on the use of traffic safety cameras. The superior court granted the city's declaratory judgment request to withhold the initiative from the ballot because the initiative exceeded the scope of the local initiative power. On appeal, Wallin argued the trial court's ruling violated his First Amendment rights, and he similarly relied on the sentence from\n   <em>\n    Coppernoll v. Reed\n   </em>\n   for support. This court deemed Wallin's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Coppernoll\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive, particularly because the initiative in\n   <em>\n    Coppernoll\n   </em>\n   was a statewide initiative, whereas the initiative sponsored by Wallin was a local initiative. The local initiative power does not derive from our state constitution; rather, a statute\n   authorizes this power. The constitutional preeminence of the right of initiative discussed in\n   <em>\n    Coppernoll\n   </em>\n   does not enjoy the same vigilant protection with respect to municipal initiatives. This court also limited Wallin's First Amendment right to free speech to the gathering of signatures on his initiative petition.

The latest revision of the McQuillin treatise, from 2013, reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Actions relating to subjects of a permanent and general character are usually regarded as legislative, and those providing for subjects of a temporary and special character are regarded as administrative. In this connection an ordinance which shows an intent to form a permanent rule of government until repealed is one of\n   permanent operation. Obviously, details which are essentially of a fluctuating sort, due to economic or other conditions, cannot be set up in and by an ordinance to be submitted to the vote of the people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   The test of what is a legislative and what is an administrative proposition, with respect to the initiative or referendum, has further been said to be whether the proposition is one to make new law or to execute law already in existence. The power to be exercised is legislative in its nature if it prescribes a new policy or plan; whereas, it is administrative in its nature if it merely pursues a plan already adopted by the legislative body itself, or some power superior to it. Similarly, an act or resolution constituting a declaration of public purpose and making provision for ways and means of its accomplishment is generally legislative as distinguished from an act or resolution which merely carries out the policy or purpose already declared by the legislative body. In applying the \"legislative\" versus \"administrative\" test distinguishing on the basis of \"new policy or plan\" versus \"pursuit of plan already adopted,\" the court will apply a liberal rule of construction so that, for example, a resolution approving an annexation has been construed as municipal legislation in that it was characterized as a new law to which referendum powers apply. The distinction between \"legislative\" and \"administrative\" matters is the distinction between making laws of general applicability and permanent nature, on the one hand, as opposed to decisions implementing such general rules, on the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   Whether a particular municipal activity is administrative or is legislation often depends not on the nature of the action but the nature of the legal framework in which the action occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   5 EUGENE MCQUILLIN , THE LAW OF MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS \u00a7 16.53 (3d ed. 2013) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \u00b6 77 This excerpt from \u00a7 16.53 begs several questions, some of which loom important in our analysis of the validity of Proposition 1. What if the subject of the initiative is permanent but limited, not general, in character? Where lies the dividing line between an action general in nature and specific in character? Is an act general in nature because it applies throughout the entire geographic boundaries of the municipality and limited when only applying to certain neighborhoods? Or is the act general in nature if it applies to all persons despite a limited geographical reach and limited if it applies only to a subset of persons? Is the act administrative in nature if it applies only to the conduct of municipal employees? If the initiative proposes to reverse recent law does it create new law? If the initiative proposes to reverse a recent ordinance does it create new law even if the initial ordinance was administrative in nature? What if the initiative has some characteristics of an administrative action and some attributes of a legislative act?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \u00b6 78 Some principles announced in Washington cases partially answer these questions.

In doing so, we consider Proposition 1 as repealing or modifying the earlier sections of the Spokane Municipal Code, former SMC 3.10.040, .050, which addressed the same subject matter, the questioning by police of an individual's immigration and citizenship status. We recognize that current Spokane policy allows a law enforcement officer to question a suspect about his or her immigration status, but limits the circumstances under which a police officer may question an individual as to the individual's immigration status, citizenship status, or refugee status. The officer may question about status if the officer holds reasonable suspicion that the person was previously deported from the United States and is committing or has committed a felony. Current Spokane law and policy limits the circumstances under which a police officer should forward immigration status information to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Proposition 1 removes any restrictions on any officer or other employee of Spokane to question one about his or her immigration status or to forward immigration status information to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b6 83 We recognize at least one characteristic of Proposition 1 in common with legislative acts. Proposition 1 adopts a rule of government permanent in nature. An initiative showing an intent to form a standing rule of government, until it is repealed, is one of permanent operation.\n   <em>\n    McAlister v. City of Fairway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675463\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/289/391/\">\n    212 P.3d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b6 84 Respect Washington argues that Proposition 1 is legislative in nature because of the additional feature that the initiative seeks to reverse or change city policy. Respect Washington also contends that, although the subject matter at issue originated\n   as Spokane Police Department policy, the adoption of the policy by the Spokane City Council transformed the policy from administrative in nature to legislative in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \u00b6 85 Respect Washington analogizes to\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Financially Responsible Government v. City of Spokane\n   </em>\n   , 99 Wash.2d at 347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=662%20P.2d%20845\">\n    662 P.2d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), in which citizens wished to repeal a business tax after the city council enacted the tax. When conducting the administrative versus legislative analysis, the Washington Supreme Court analyzed whether the original ordinance, rather than the citizens' referendum, was administrative. The court concluded that the city ordinance was legislative in nature and subject to referendum. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the city ordinance could not be viewed as an execution of policy already in existence. Rather, the tax ordinance set a new policy. The Supreme Court did not expressly avow that an initiative that revokes an ordinance legislative in nature also renders the initiative legislative in nature, the court ruling implies such. Thus, we agree with Respect Washington that Proposition 1, assuming the underlying former SMC 3.10.040 and .050 to be legislative, maintains some legislative character in that the initiative modifies, if not reverses in part, legislative policy established by the city council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b6 86 Other characteristics of Proposition 1 share features in common with administrative acts. SMC 3.10.010(B)(1) delegates to the Spokane Police Department police chief authority to issue rules for the proper functioning of the police department. The Spokane City Council did not adopt former SMC 3.10.040 and .050 in a vacuum. The Spokane Police Department had already adopted standing policies with regard to questioning individuals about immigration and citizenship status. The Spokane City Council, when adopting former SMC 3.10.040 and .050, merely codified existing police department policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b6 87 We recognize the argument that, if the city council adopts a department's administrative policy, the policy transforms into a legislative policy. Nevertheless, no case law supports that contention. If other actions by the city legislative body constitute administrative action, the adoption of a city department's administrative regulations can remain administrative in character. When analyzing the legislative or administrative nature of a municipal act, courts consider the framework of the action. Proposition 1 challenges a Spokane policy, whose framework's base consists of administrative building blocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b6 88 Proposition 1 interferes with Spokane Police Department policy to limit the circumstances under which law enforcement officers inquire about immigration and citizenship status.

Nevertheless, the city of Bellingham measure did not directly impact how to administer services provided by the police department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   \u00b6 90 We are unaware of any decision that expressly holds that directions to employees constitute administrative, not legislative, policy.

Since a declaration of policy generally functions as a formality, we deem this factor of limited assistance. Still, the lack of a declaration of policy in our operative ordinances and Proposition 1 bolsters our conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   \u00b6 92 In addition to relying on Proposition 1 countering a Spokane Police Department policy, we emphasize the need for expertise on the challenging and charged question of whether local government agents should question individuals about immigration or citizenship status. United States legislative policy dictates the removal of those illegally in the United States, and the federal government operates an agency and a separate court system to fulfill this dictate. If and when a local law enforcement agency seeks to question an individual as to his or her legal status inside the nation's borders involves a different query. Case law and literature recognizes the need to weigh conflicting goals before establishing a policy of asking or withholding questioning regarding one's citizenship status. Local law enforcement agencies must also navigate constitutional protections afforded residents before asking for information on one's status. These factors implicate the success of law enforcement efforts and thus questioning should be reserved to the expertise of law enforcement administrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6 93 We discern from its name that Respect Washington seeks respect for all law, including immigration laws and laws demanding deportation of those unlawfully within the United States, including within the city of Spokane. Respect for all law is a noble standard and deporting those unlawfully in the nation a legitimate end to this principle. But a law enforcement agency that allows officers free reign in questioning anyone as to his or her citizenship status, such as proposed in Proposition 1, can encounter negative side effects from such a policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \u00b6 94 Proposition 1 allows city of Spokane employees to collect information on immigration status. The collection of data assumes the right to question individuals of their status. Proposition 1 provides no limits on when a law enforcement officer, or for that matter any employee of the city of Spokane, can question others about citizenship status. Spokane Police Department policy and Spokane city ordinances already allow police officers to question those reasonably suspected to be committing a crime by returning to the United States unlawfully after being deported. If law enforcement officers can already question those for whom probable cause of this federal felony exists, one wonders under what circumstances city employees will seek information from other city residents about their status when no probable cause exists. We do not expect law officers to ask everyone encountered as to his or her status. Our extensive reading of literature and case law teaches, however, that, without any guidelines, some officers will inevitably target those persons who look foreign or speak a different language, regardless of citizenship, for questioning. The practice of questioning some and not others leads to racial profiling. During oral argument, Respect Washington agreed that asking one his or her immigration status or citizenship status can be racial profiling under some circumstances. Wash.

The court deemed the first test of legislative versus administrative helped little since a street name change is of a permanent\n   character and not general in character. Also, the change could be deemed as \" 'special' \" but not \" 'temporary.' \" The second test helped, however. The name change ordinance merely amended Seattle's comprehensive street names ordinance. Therefore, the ordinance should be characterized as administrative, since it was enacted pursuant to a plan already adopted by the legislative body itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6 117 In\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Financially Responsible Government v.

Through a referendum, city citizens sought repeal of the tax. When conducting the administrative versus legislative analysis, the court analyzed whether the original ordinance enacting the tax was administrative. The court did not analyze, as most other case law does, whether the citizens' referendum was administrative in nature. The court ultimately concluded that the city ordinance was legislative in nature and subject to referendum. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted the city ordinance could not be viewed as an execution of policy already in existence. Rather, the court viewed the ordinance as setting a new policy. The ordinance never referenced a policy already in existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \u00b6 118 In\n   <em>\n    Ballasiotes v.

The ordinance affirmed a previous decision made by the executive power of the county to change to a punch card system. Nevertheless, the county council ordinance declared it to be the policy of the county to implement the punch card system. Citizens sought a referendum to return the county to the lever machine system. The Supreme Court held the measure to implement a punch card voting system to be \"legislative\" in character and referendable. Affirming an executive decision did not render the decision administrative. The court also held that the act of funding the new punch card system was legislative in character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   \u00b6 119 In\n   <em>\n    Seattle Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v.

A state statute declared the interstate highway a state route. The State held title to the highway and assumed full jurisdiction, responsibility, and control of the roadway. A city held power over a state highway only to the extent authorized by the state legislature. Thus, any such powers constituted administrative powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   \u00b6 120 In\n   <em>\n    Leonard v.

The Supreme Court held that the ordinance was administrative in nature and not subject to referendum election. The municipality acts in a legislative capacity when adopting a zoning code and a comprehensive plan, but in an administrative capacity when enacting amendments to the zoning code or rezones and amendments to the comprehensive plan because the municipality then implements the earlier plans. Also, a rezone is quasi-judicial in character and thus not subject to a referendum. Finally, under statute the legislature granted to the city council, not the municipality as a whole, the power to adopt and implement zoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   \u00b6 121 In\n   <em>\n    Ruano v.

Citizens filed an initiative to repeal the resolution authorizing the project, to revoke the bonds to finance it, and to prohibit spending funds for further development. The Supreme Court noted that, while the original decision to build the stadium was legislative, all that remained was for the county and its agents to execute an already adopted legislative determination. Under these facts, the court held only administrative decisions remained in connection with the stadium project, decisions not subject to the initiative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6 122 In\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Citizens then sought a referendum to overturn the ordinance, but the city clerk refused to validate the petitions for the referendum. The Supreme Court denied a writ of mandamus directing the city to submit the referendum to a vote. The court held that an ordinance providing for additions, betterments, and extensions to a municipally owned waterworks, financed by revenue bonds, was not subject to a referendum vote. A statute delegated to the governing body of the city the authority to construct and finance a sewer and water works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b6 123 In\n   <em>\n    Durocher v.

Thereafter, the council decided to submit the issuance of the permit to the voters in a referendum. The Supreme Court held the issuance of a use permit to be administrative primarily because the Washington Constitution and King County Charter delegated the power to issue the permits to the county council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \u00b6 124 In\n   <em>\n    Paget v.

The court emphasized that a statute declared the acts of locating, financing, constructing, and operating public stadium facilities to be for public purposes and another statute conferred the power of eminent domain on the county to accomplish the public purpose. Significant and inherently legislative problems revolving about streets, traffic, parking, public transportation, utilities, and service facilities become necessarily entwined and interrelated with the choice of any given site. Challengers to the initiative argued that rendering the stadium site selection a legislative rather than an administrative function would frustrate the efficiency of government and promote endless debate and indecision with respect to finalizing any chosen site. The court qualified its ruling by noting that, at some point in time, a proposed stadium project might progress to a point when only administrative decisions will remain to complete the project such that any initiative measures concerning site selection would be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   \u00b6 125 In\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
