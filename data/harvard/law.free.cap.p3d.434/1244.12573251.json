Moore (\n   <strong>\n    Moore\n   </strong>\n   ) appeals from the Judgment entered on May 22, 2017, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (\n   <strong>\n    Circuit Court\n   </strong>\n   ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee HSBC Bank USA, N.A., as Trustee for Deutsche, Alt-A Securities, Inc. Mortgage Loans Trust, Series 2005-2 (HSBC Bank), and against all defendants. Moore\n   also challenges the Circuit Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, also entered on May 22, 2017 (\n   <strong>\n    Foreclosure Decree\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 3, 2013, HSBC Bank filed a Verified Complaint for Foreclosure (\n   <strong>\n    Complaint\n   </strong>\n   ). In the Complaint, HSBC Bank alleged that on December 17, 2004, Moore executed a promissory note in favor of National City Mortgage Co. dba Accubanc Mortgage in the amount of $ 420,000.00 (\n   <strong>\n    Note\n   </strong>\n   ), secured by a mortgage on real property recorded on December 23, 2004 in the Bureau of Conveyances (\n   <strong>\n    Mortgage\n   </strong>\n   ). HSBC Bank alleged that National City Mortgage Co. merged with National City Bank effective October 1, 2008, and National City Bank then merged with PNC Bank, N.A., (\n   <strong>\n    PNC Bank\n   </strong>\n   ) effective November 6, 2009. HSBC Bank alleged that it was the owner of the Mortgage by virtue of an Assignment of Mortgage recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on November 7, 2012 (\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Mortgage\n   </strong>\n   ), that it was \"entitled to enforce the Note\" and Mortgage, and that Moore was in default. The Complaint does not specifically allege that HSBC Bank possessed the Note or reference any indorsements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, the Complaint was supported by an attached \"Verification of Complaint for Foreclosure\" executed on May 22, 2013, by Rodney Carpenter (\n   <strong>\n    Carpenter\n   </strong>\n   ), an employee and \"Authorized Signer\" of PNC Bank, the loan servicing agent for HSBC Bank (\n   <strong>\n    Carpenter's Declaration\n   </strong>\n   ), in which Carpenter attested, in relevant part, that \"[HSBC Bank] is in possession of the Note. As evidenced by the recorded Mortgage and applicable assignment, [HSBC Bank] is also the mortgagee of record. As such, [HSBC Bank] is the proper plaintiff in this matter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carpenter also attested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that \"[a] true and correct copy of the Indorsed Note\" was attached as Exhibit A. Notably, there are no indorsement stamps directly on the Note\n   that was attached as Exhibit A. Instead, attached to this copy of the Note is an undated allonge, apparently executed by a representative of PNC Bank, specifically indorsing the Note to HSBC Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carpenter's Declaration also purported to authenticate other loan documents which were also attached thereto, including a recorded copy of the Mortgage, a recorded copy of the Assignment of Mortgage, payment records for Moore's loan account, and an October 4, 2011 notice of default and of intent to accelerate the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 16, 2013, Moore filed an answer denying all allegations in the Complaint. Moore also separately filed her affirmative defenses, asserting among other things that HSBC Bank lacked standing because HSBC Bank had not shown that it owned the Note and was authorized to bring the foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 18, 2015, HSBC Bank filed a Motion for Summary Judgment Against all Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure (\n   <strong>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n   ). The Motion for Summary Judgment was supported by: (1) a declaration by Jeffrey Moler (\n   <strong>\n    Moler\n   </strong>\n   ), an employee and \"Authorized Signer\" of PNC Bank, (\n   <strong>\n    First Moler Declaration\n   </strong>\n   ) which indicated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that he was the custodian of the exhibits attached to the Carpenter Declaration and Complaint which \"remain true and accurate,\" and (2) a declaration executed by Andrew R. Tellio (\n   <strong>\n    Tellio\n   </strong>\n   ), former counsel for HSBC Bank in this case, which purported to authenticate various documents related to the Mortgage and the mergers of National City Mortgage Co., National City Bank, and PNC Bank. Neither the Note nor any allonges were attached to the Motion for Summary Judgment or these declarations. Also on March 18, 2015, HSBC Bank filed an Affirmation of Attorney pursuant to HRS \u00a7 667-17 wherein Tellio affirmed that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , none of HSBC Bank's filings \"contain any false statements of fact or law\" and that \"[HSBC Bank] has legal standing to bring this foreclosure action\" (\n   <strong>\n    Attorney Affirmation\n   </strong>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 26, 2015, Moore filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether \"Carpenter is competent to authenticate Plaintiff's business records, and with respect to whether Plaintiff is the holder of the subject promissory note[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 21, 2016, HSBC Bank filed a supplemental memorandum in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment. In support of its argument that HSBC Bank possessed\n   the Note, HSBC Bank attached a declaration of HSBC Bank's counsel, David B. Rosen dated July 20, 2016 (\n   <strong>\n    Rosen Declaration\n   </strong>\n   ), and a supplemental declaration by Moler dated June 20, 2016 (\n   <strong>\n    Second Moler Declaration\n   </strong>\n   ). The Rosen Declaration provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. I have personally reviewed the original \"wet-ink\" note dated December 17, 2004 (\"Note\"), executed by Defendant FELICITAS B. MOORE (\"MOORE\").

The Note contains an indorsement in blank on page 3.

An outdated copy of the Note, which included a specially indorsed Allonge in favor of Plaintiff, was attached to the Verified Complaint.... As mentioned above, the original Note contains a blank indorsement on page 3. As a result, the Allonge to the Note has been removed from the Note.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Unlike the Note that was attached to Carpenter's Declaration, the copy of the Note attached as an exhibit to these declarations contains a blank indorsement stamp on the third and final page as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Pay to the order of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   without recourse in any event\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   NATIONAL CITY MORTGAGE CO.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   DBA ACCUBANC MORTGAGE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   BY [signature Elaine C. Gilmer]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Elaine C. Gilmer, Allocations Coordinator\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Motion for Summary Judgment was heard on February 8, 2017. After brief oral arguments, the Circuit Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    [P]laintiff has shown it is the holder of the note, it's been endorsed in blank. As Mr. Rosen has represented, which I accent, he's produced the original note for review and inspection by both the defendant and her counsel.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   And so at that point, the burden was upon the defendant to come in with admissible facts demonstrating that the falsity, or at least the alleged falsity of the statements set forth in the declaration, that has not been done. And plaintiff is the assignee of the mortgage. All the successor documents have been put into the record and have been\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   acknowledged and verified in an admissible format.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The appropriate affidavit under HRS 667 has been filed. The record shows there are no material questions of fact in dispute.

In its Foreclosure Decree, the Circuit Court found,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that HSBC Bank was the holder of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On June 20, 2017, Moore timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    POINT OF ERROR ON APPEAL\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moore raises a single point of error, arguing that the Circuit Court erred by granting HSBC Bank's March 18, 2015 Motion for Summary Judgment because HSBC Bank's\n   declaring witness was not qualified to authenticate its business records and failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that it was the holder of the subject note at the time the complaint was filed, as required by the Hawai'i Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A. v.

It also makes no assertions as to Lewis's familiarity with the record-keeping systems of Funding Group or Option One, which first created the Note and allonges.

But, as with the declaration in\n   <em>\n    Mattos\n   </em>\n   , the Lewis Declaration did not attempt to admit the allonges under the business records exception.

This is to say that the documents purporting to allow Wells Fargo to enforce the Note were not admissible under the business record exception. Since the documents were not admissible as asserted, Wells Fargo did not meet its burden of establishing facts necessary for a grant of summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313988\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/26/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313988\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/26/\">\n    at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566322\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/414/89/\">\n    414 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   98 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mattos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313988\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/26/\">\n    140 Hawai'i at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313988\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/26/\">\n    398 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   621-22 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Yamashita\n   </em>\n   , this court reviewed the sufficiency of a declaration attached to the foreclosing-bank's ( HSBC Bank's) motion for summary judgment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206048908\">\n    2017 WL 6048908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3-4.
