Deputy Holzer was outside of the prisoner transport bay door at the north end of the courthouse, when he noticed a person hiding in the bushes across the street from the courthouse. According to Deputy Holzer, the person hiding in the bushes, later identified as Stevens, was \"bobbing up and down.\" Concerned by Stevens' behavior, Deputy Holzer delayed the prisoner transport and called for backup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Trooper Trewick arrived to assist Deputy Holzer. The officers approached Stevens on foot with their weapons drawn at their sides. Deputy Holzer ordered Stevens to stand up and show his hands-Stevens cooperated. Deputy Holzer then asked Stevens to turn around, Stevens complied, and Deputy Holzer placed Stevens in handcuffs. Deputy Holzer testified that Stevens appeared \"very nervous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Deputy Holzer asked Stevens what he was doing in the bushes, to which Stevens responded that he had an open container of alcohol and was attempting to conceal it from Deputy Holzer. Deputy Holzer asked\n   Stevens if he had any weapons on him. Stevens answered that he did not have any weapons, but he was in possession of methamphetamine. Deputy Holzer proceeded to search Stevens and found a container of a white powdery substance, a Fentanyl patch, and a clear plastic container holding a white crystal rock. A field test of the powder and the rock revealed the presence of methamphetamine. Deputy Holzer then placed Stevens under arrest for criminal possession of dangerous drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Stevens was charged by information with one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation \u00a7 45-9-102(4), MCA (2015), and one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation \u00a7 45-9-102(6), MCA (2015). Stevens filed a motion to suppress his statements and the drugs on the basis that he was initially detained without reasonable suspicion and arrested without probable cause in violation of the United States and Montana Constitutions. Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to suppress. Stevens entered into a plea agreement with the State, in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and the State agreed to dismiss the other count. On February 27, 2017, Stevens pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102(6), MCA (2015). On April 10, 2017, Stevens was committed to the Department of Corrections for five years, with two years suspended. Stevens appeals the District Court's denial of his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 In reviewing a district court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence or statements, we determine whether the court's underlying factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the governing law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Relevant considerations include the quantity, substance, quality, and degree of reliability of information known to the officer.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28.

The issues raised by Stevens are whether the officers' initial investigation was supported by particularized suspicion and whether the use of handcuffs elevated the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop into an unconstitutional arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 Stevens argues that his \"mere presence\" on the street adjacent to the courthouse did not give Deputy Holzer particularized\n   suspicion to initiate a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop. Stevens' argument, however, misconstrues several key facts. Specifically, he minimizes the fact that \"bobbing up and down\" in the bushes across from a courthouse at six a.m. may be construed as strange, even suspicious, behavior. Further, Deputy Holzer's concern that Stevens might be attempting to interfere with the prisoner transport was reasonable considering Stevens was trying to conceal himself from Deputy Holzer. At the evidentiary hearing, Deputy Holzer testified that he considered the prisoner transport bay door a \"high risk area\" and that interference with a prisoner transport \"is a factor at all times.\" Stevens argues that it was unreasonable for Deputy Holzer to suspect Stevens of attempting to interfere with the transport considering Deputy Holzer had never personally encountered such an interference. This argument is not compelling. An officer does not have to personally experience a situation before he or she can appreciate the potential risk involved when such a situation presents itself. \"[D]ue weight must be given ... to the specific reasonable inferences [an officer] is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his\n   [or her] experience.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p19\">\n    392 U.S. at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 S.Ct. at 1883.

We agree with the State. Deputy Holzer testified that he placed Stevens in handcuffs before questioning him, \"[j]ust for officer safety. Just the fact that he is at [six] a.m. ... hiding in the bushes.\" Under the circumstances, Stevens' unusual behavior gave the officers reason to suspect that Stevens may\n   pose a threat to their safety. The use of handcuffs provided the officers an opportunity to neutralize any potential threat so they could safely gather more information. Moreover, after handcuffing Stevens, Deputy Holzer asked Stevens why he was hiding in the bushes and whether Stevens was in possession of any weapons. These routine, unobtrusive questions demonstrate that Deputy Holzer's intent was not to arrest Stevens, but instead to conduct an investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 46-5-401(2)(b), MCA, explicitly provides that during an investigative stop an officer may, \"frisk the person and take\n   <em>\n    other reasonably necessary steps for protection\n   </em>\n   if the officer has reasonable cause to suspect that the person is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or another person present\" (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court has observed that in conducting an investigative stop, a law enforcement officer \"should not be denied the opportunity to protect himself from attack by a hostile suspect.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

[W]e cannot blind ourselves to the need for law enforcement officers to protect themselves and other prospective victims of violence in situations where they may lack probable cause for an arrest. When an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to\n   be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p19\">\n    392 U.S. at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 S.Ct. at 1881.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The totality of the circumstances confirms that sufficient objective data was available to Deputy Holzer to draw the inference that Stevens posed a safety threat or planned to disrupt the prisoner transport. Deputy Holzer had the requisite particularized suspicion to execute the initial\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop and the use of handcuffs did not elevate the investigatory stop into an arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621\n   <em>\n    3.

We disagree. During the investigatory stop, while the officers were questioning Stevens, Stevens spontaneously confessed that he was in possession of methamphetamine. At this point, the officers' particularized suspicion ripened into probable cause to arrest. Deputy Holzer lawfully arrested Stevens and conducted a search incident to arrest pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-102, MCA.
