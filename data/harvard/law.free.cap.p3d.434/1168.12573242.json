The issue here is whether this surcharge violates the dormant Commerce Clause implied by Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution or the anti-diversion provision, article 9, section 14 of the Arizona Constitution. We hold that it does not violate either provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b62 The legislature created the Arizona Tourism and Sports Authority (the \"AzSTA\") in 2000 to build and operate a sports stadium, build Major League Baseball spring training facilities, build youth and amateur sports and recreation facilities, and promote tourism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5-801(4), -802(A), -807 to -809, -815. AzSTA's authority is restricted to counties with populations greater than two million people, meaning it has only ever operated in Maricopa County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-802(A). AzSTA's construction projects are funded solely by taxes and surcharges approved by Maricopa County voters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-802(C). One such voter-approved surcharge is at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b63 Soon after the creation of AzSTA, Maricopa County voters passed an initiative that levied a surcharge on car rental companies based on their income derived from leasing vehicles for less than one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839(A)-(C) (authorizing voters to levy the surcharge and providing its terms). (The initiative also imposed a tax on hotels. The hotel tax is not at issue here.) The surcharge is the greater of $2.50 per rental or 3.25% of the company's gross proceeds or gross income. \u00a7 5-839(B)(1). If the rental is a \"temporary replacement\" for a damaged or lost vehicle, however, the surcharge is a flat $2.50. \u00a7 5-839(B)(2). The state treasurer distributes $2.50 per rental transaction to the Maricopa County Stadium District, which has collected a surcharge in this amount since 1991.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-839(G)(1) ; Act of June 25, 1991, ch. 285, \u00a7 10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20Ariz.%20Sess.%20Laws%201444\">\n    1991 Ariz. Sess. Laws 1444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1451-53 (1st Reg. Sess.) (codified at A.R.S. \u00a7 48-4234 ). The remaining amount, the difference between $2.50 per rental transaction and 3.25% of the company's gross income or proceeds, is distributed to AzSTA. \u00a7 5-839(G)(2). Although the surcharge is imposed on car rental companies, they can and do pass its cost on to their customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b64 Plaintiff Saban Rent-a-Car (\"Saban\") rents vehicles in Maricopa County and has paid the car rental surcharge. Its customers are primarily local residents. In 2009, after unsuccessfully seeking a refund from the Arizona Department of Revenue (\"ADOR\"), Saban\n   sued ADOR in the tax court and sought refunds and injunctive relief for all similarly situated car rental companies. The tax court certified a class of all individuals or entities that paid the surcharge from September 2005 through March 2008 and allowed AzSTA to intervene as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 As it does here, Saban argued to the tax court that the surcharge violates both the dormant Commerce Clause and the anti-diversion provision. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court agreed with ADOR and AzSTA that the surcharge does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. It agreed with Saban, however, that the surcharge violates the anti-diversion provision. Consequently, the court granted summary judgment for Saban and ordered ADOR to refund the surcharge payments to class members. The court also authorized ADOR to recoup the refund amounts from AzSTA pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5029(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 Like the tax court, the court of appeals ruled that the surcharge does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    Saban Rent-A-Car LLC v.

Rather, the surcharge is calculated at $2.50 per vehicle rather than the greater of $2.50 per\n   rental or 3.25% of the company's gross proceeds or gross income, as the surcharge is calculated for other rentals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-839(B)(1)-(2). Second, nothing suggests car rental agencies pass through more than $2.50 per rental to ordinary renters, thereby suggesting that those renting temporary replacement vehicles are treated more favorably. Indeed, according to its owner, Saban, like other car rental agencies, charges the same surcharge rate to all its customers. Third, the temporary replacement vehicle calculation applies whether the renter is a resident or a non-resident. And because numerous non-residents temporarily relocate to Arizona during the year, it is likely that many nonresidents rent temporary replacement vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 In sum, the voters did not enact the car rental surcharge with a discriminatory intent because they did not intend to treat in-state and out-of-state economic interests differently.

They urge the court of appeals' narrower view that \"relating to ... the ... use[ ] or operation of vehicles\" refers to \"a tax or fee that is a prerequisite to, or triggered by, the legal operation or use of a vehicle on a public thoroughfare.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saban\n   </em>\n   , 244 Ariz. at 302 \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567426\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1066/#p1069\">\n    418 P.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the court of appeals' interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b628 First, the provision's text supports a narrower interpretation of the disputed phrase than one meaning \"connected to\" or benefitting from road usage. The provision applies to two categories of taxes: (a) those \"relating to\" the \"registration, operation, or use of vehicles,\" and (b) those imposed on fuels and other energy sources used to propel vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 9, \u00a7 14. Registration fees and fuel taxes are \"connected to\" the use or operation of vehicles. Owners register vehicles to use the roads. And fuel sellers indisputably benefit from their customers' use and operation of vehicles. The explicit mention of registration fees and fuel taxes therefore suggests that tax revenues \"relating to ... the ... operation, or use of vehicles\" encompass a more finite tax class than revenues derived from those with a \"connection to\" road usage or who benefit from it. Otherwise, as the court of appeals noted, the references to registration fees and fuel taxes would be superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saban\n   </em>\n   , 244 Ariz. at 298 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567426\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1066/#p1069\">\n    418 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1071 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

Interpreting \"relating to\" as the court of appeals did gives meaning to all terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b629 We are unpersuaded by Saban's assertion that the legislature explicitly mentioned registration fees and fuel taxes in the Better Roads Amendment referendum simply to remove any doubt they were covered. We presume the legislature avoids redundancy in favor of concision and see no reason to conclude otherwise here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Phx. v. Glenayre Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310089\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/139/\">\n    242 Ariz. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310089\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/139/\">\n    393 P.3d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 927 (2017). We also disagree with Saban that the legislature demonstrated a penchant for redundancy by referring to revenues from both the \"operation\" and \"use\" of vehicles. They are different. The former refers to fees imposed on\n   <em>\n    drivers\n   </em>\n   while the latter refers to taxes and fees assessed on\n   <em>\n    vehicles\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-3002(A) (setting fees for driver licenses), -5471(A) (setting vehicle registration fees).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b630 Second, the anti-diversion provision's history supports the court of appeals' interpretation. The Pamphlet identified non-fuel-related revenues dedicated to roads as \"registration fees, unladen weight fees on common and contract motor carriers, and motor carrier taxes based on gross receipts\" that are all \"derived from road users.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pamphlet,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 3. All these taxes and fees are prerequisites for or triggered by the legal use of vehicles on our roads. None are imposed on businesses, like car rental agencies, that merely benefit from the existence of roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 Notably, the Pamphlet also stated that adopting the referendum would maintain the status quo as Arizona was then using all road-user taxes for road uses. Pamphlet,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5 (\"Arizona is in a particularly favorable position to adopt [the anti-diversion provision] this year, because it is not now diverting its road user taxes ... [and passage] will entail no change in the source or expenditure of highway revenues.\"). Yet Arizona had imposed transaction privilege taxes on car rental agencies since 1935 and used those revenues for general purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saban\n   </em>\n   , 244 Ariz. at 299 \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567426\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1066/#p1069\">\n    418 P.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relating history of transaction privilege tax on car rental agencies). This history suggests that neither the referendum drafter (the legislature) nor voters considered existing taxes on car rental agencies to be \"road user taxes\" or intended to include such taxes within the provision's ambit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Saban agrees that 1952 voters did not intend that the anti-diversion provision apply to transaction privilege taxes on car rental agencies. It nevertheless argues that the car rental surcharge is distinguishable, likening it to the license tax Arizona imposed on common and contract motor carriers of property and passengers in 1952, which the Pamphlet described as a road-user tax that would\n   be subject to the provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of Mar. 18, 1933, ch. 100, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 17, 1933 Sess. Laws 472, 473-74, 481-82 (codified at Ariz. Ann. Code \u00a7\u00a7 66-502, -518 (1939)); Pamphlet,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 3, 5. Specifically, Saban asserts that, like the motor carrier license tax, the surcharge is a \"special tax\" not imposed generally on all businesses but aimed at \"motor vehicle owners and operators of all kinds\" who benefit from using Arizona roads. According to Saban, and echoing the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment's vernacular, it would be \"unfair and unjust\" to impose the surcharge on car rental drivers but divert those revenues from road-related purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b633 We disagree that the car rental surcharge is more like the motor carrier license tax imposed in 1952 than the 1935 transaction privilege tax imposed on car rental agencies. Payment of the motor carrier license tax was required to legally use vehicles on our roads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2, 17, 1933 Sess. Laws at 473-74, 481-82. In contrast, the surcharge, like the transaction privilege tax, is imposed on the business of renting vehicles and is not required to be paid before a rental vehicle can be legally operated on roads. Instead, car rental agencies pay licensing fees, like everyone else, to authorize a vehicle's road usage whether the operator is an employee or a customer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-2153(A), -2157 (requiring vehicle registration and payment of registration fees). And car rental drivers pay licensing fees to their home states/countries as a condition for driving on Arizona roads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 28-3151, -3158(B) (requiring driver's license and payment of fee). Additionally, the surcharge is no more aimed at car rental customers than was the 1935 transaction privilege tax. Like the surcharge, the transaction privilege tax could be passed on to car rental customers, yet the tax was not considered a road-user tax and did not fall within the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 That the surcharge is a \"special tax\" not levied generally on all businesses also fails to distinguish it from the 1935 transaction privilege tax. When enacted, that tax applied to a limited number of businesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5080274\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/46/48/#p54\">\n    46 Ariz. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54-55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5080274\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/46/48/#p54\">\n    46 P.2d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1935) (describing 1935 transaction privilege tax and noting \"the Legislature thought best not to impose it on ... all lines of endeavor but only on ... certain occupations and businesses\"),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute as stated in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

Car rental agencies fell within a class of public entertainment and tourist-related businesses, which were taxed at the highest rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5080274\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/46/48/#p54\">\n    46 P.2d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regardless of this \"special\" treatment, the legislature and voters in 1952 did not consider the tax a road-user tax. Similarly, the anti-diversion provision does not apply to the surcharge, which is part of a taxing plan that imposes a special tax on hotels, simply because it applies only to car rental agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 The court of appeals' interpretation also aligns with the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment, which at least partially drove the Better Roads Amendment. The Hayden-Cartwright Amendment conditioned full federal aid on a state continuing to direct revenues from road-user taxes and fees to road uses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. As explained, revenues from the 1935 transaction privilege tax on car rental agencies were never dedicated solely for road purposes. Likewise, directing surcharge revenues, which also derive from taxes imposed on the business of renting vehicles, to non-road purposes does not offend the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 Finally, we agree with ADOR and AzSTA that Saban's \"benefits theory\" provides no limitation to the term \"relating to.\" If the anti-diversion provision applies to the surcharge, no principled reason exists not to apply it to fees and taxes levied against car sale dealers, automotive repair shops, and the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b637 Justice Bolick's partial dissent accuses us of embarking on a \"circuitous journey\" that \"rewrite[s] constitutional text\" to \"create[ ] a loophole\" for publicly financed sports stadiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 59. Strong words. But they are not backed by rejoinders to our analysis rejecting Saban's \"special tax\" argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-35, despite the fact the dissent adopts Saban's view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-51 (stating that \"a tax is 'relating to' if it is specially directed at the operation or use of vehicles on public highways,\" and concluding that a surcharge imposed on car rental agencies is such a tax).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b638 The dissent's effort to ascertain the voters' intent in enacting the anti-diversion provision by parsing language from the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-49. Neither the provision nor the Pamphlet recited (or even mentioned) the language seized on by the dissent, meaning that language almost certainly had no bearing on voters' intent. Also, the provision was not enacted to comply with the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment and obtain federal funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (\"Arizona voters implemented the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment through the anti-diversion clause.\"). Arizona had already been receiving federal funding for roads at the time the provision was adopted in 1952.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pamphlet,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5. Necessarily, therefore, the state had already complied with the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment by devoting road-user taxes-which did not include the \"special\" transaction privilege tax placed on car rental agencies-to road uses. Proponents of the provision were driven by the desire to ensure that Arizona continued to devote these tax revenues to road uses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pamphlet,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5 (\"Public policy in Arizona has consistently opposed diversion [of road user taxes to non-road purposes], although there have been constant threats to highway funds in bills introduced from time to time in the legislature.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b639 In sum, \"fees, excises, or license taxes relating to ... the ... operation, or use of vehicles\" are ones imposed as a prerequisite to, or triggered by, the legal operation or use of a vehicle on a public road. The surcharge falls outside this definition and therefore does not violate the anti-diversion provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appeals' opinion.

Then the voters approved article 9, section 14 of the Arizona Constitution to effectuate that command.

Thus, the Amendment directs states wishing to retain federal highway funding to restrict to highway use revenues derived from\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [s]tate motor vehicle registration fees, licenses, gasoline taxes, and\n   <em>\n    other special taxes on motor-vehicle owners and operators of all kinds\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20993\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The italicized words are illuminating, as they contain language that is both limiting and broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b647 First, the term \"other special taxes\" connotes taxes-like registration fees, licenses, and gasoline taxes-that are directed specifically to the use of motor vehicles. The\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   canon supports this reading: where a general term, such as \"other special taxes,\" follows a list of specific terms, the general term should be construed narrowly to \"persons or things of the same general nature or class\" as the more specific terms.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Braden ex rel.

Consequently, \"other special taxes\" should be interpreted narrowly to mean relating to the use of motor vehicles as the terms that precede it are of this nature. Thus, the term \"special taxes\" would not encompass\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   taxes that included the use of motor vehicles but were not specially directed toward them. The \"special taxes\" phrasing also shows that the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment only implicates taxes that are directed specifically to a particular project rather than general taxes that go to the general fund.\n   <em>\n    Tax\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining special tax as \"[a] tax levied for a unique purpose\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b648 Second, the term \"motor-vehicle owners and operators of all kinds\" is very broad, and thus is meant to be inclusive, not exclusive.

In that way, the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment provides definition for the subsequent state constitutional provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b651 Therefore, viewed in this proper context, a tax is \"relating to\" if it is specially directed at the operation or use of vehicles on public highways. Similarly, the broad terms \"use\" and \"operation\" are directed toward the ultimate activity. Again, the text evinces no intent to elevate form over substance-if the vehicles are used or operated on public highways, then any fee or tax specially directed toward that use implicates the anti-diversion clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b652 That leaves the question of whether the car rental surcharge is such a fee or tax. Once again, we do not need to travel beyond the statutory language itself, for it furnishes the plain answer.

The italicized language essentially parallels the wording of the anti-diversion clause. The surcharge's plain language illustrates that it only applies when someone rents a \"motor vehicle[ ] ... without a driver, ... designed to operate on the streets and highways of this state\"; as such, the taxable event is that the renter of the motor vehicle will be driving it on the public roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b653 A straight line can be drawn from the Hayden-Cartwright Amendment to the anti-diversion clause to the statute before us. The \"limiting principle\" that the majority searches for at great length is supplied by the relevant text of these provisions. The surcharge is a special tax directed toward the use or operation of vehicles on public roads, and the revenues it generates must be allocated to public roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b654 When the relevant constitutional and statutory language resolves the dispute, as it does here, it is with great hazard that we stray beyond it.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
