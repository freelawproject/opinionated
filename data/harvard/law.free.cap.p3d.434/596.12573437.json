Because Elizabeth F. failed to appeal from the dismissal order, and because we conclude Holly, as a respondent in the dependency proceeding, has not been legally \"aggrieved\" by the dismissal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-235(A) ; Ariz. R. P. Juv. Ct. 103(A), we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Like his father, Brian S., G.C. is an enrolled member of the Tohono O'odham Nation (\"the Nation\"). Before Elizabeth filed her dependency petition, Holly and Brian were involved in a custody proceeding in the Nation's tribal court. In October 2017, pursuant to a stipulation by both parents, that court entered a \"final, appealable order\" awarding Brian sole decision-making authority and primary parenting time. Based on the same stipulation, the court scheduled a review hearing for December 2017 to determine whether \"criminal charges pending against [Holly]\" had been resolved and \"to see if [she] should be awarded supervised parenting time given the concerns over her mental state and ability to parent [G.C.].\" On February 20, 2018, the Arizona Department of Economic Security (ADES) acknowledged Brian's physical custody of G.C. and filed a motion to terminate his previously ordered child support obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On March 16, 2018, before the trial court granted ADES's motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elizabeth filed a dependency petition in Pima County Juvenile Court in which she alleged Brian had a history of violent behavior and was\n   neglecting G.C. In a supporting affidavit, she also alleged that Holly \"has a history of mental health issues that make it difficult for her [to] parent right now\" and, also, \"is on probation for a felony offense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In temporary orders entered pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 8-841(F), the juvenile court ordered the Department of Child Safety (DCS) to conduct an investigation, including \"a safety check of the child(ren)'s home,\" but it declined Elizabeth's request that she be awarded temporary custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At the initial dependency hearing in April 2018, DCS told the juvenile court, \"Our report documents that we do not believe that a dependency exists at this time,\" and, after confirming that there were no objections, the court granted DCS's request to be excused from further proceedings. At the same hearing, Brian entered a special appearance for the purpose of challenging jurisdiction and service and filed a motion to dismiss the dependency on those grounds. In it, he argued the Nation had \"continuing, exclusive jurisdiction\" over G.C.'s custody pursuant to both the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1963, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 25-1001 to 25-1067. The Nation also appeared and informed the court it had not yet been properly served with the dependency petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The juvenile court scheduled briefing on Brian's motion to dismiss and continued the hearing until May 15, 2018. On that day, after conferring with the tribal court judge who was presiding over the Nation's custody proceeding and entertaining argument by the parties, the juvenile court granted Brian's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 29, 2018, Holly filed a timely notice of appeal from the court's signed minute entry, which was filed on May 18, 2018. Elizabeth did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. P. Juv.

R. P. Juv. Ct., provides that \"any party to the proceeding from which the appeal arises ... may file ... and serve ... a notice stating that the party ... does not intend to participate actively in the appeal and instead adopts and agrees in advance to be bound by the appellate positions, filings, representations, actions, and omissions\" of another \"specifically identified\" party, that provision does not apply here.
