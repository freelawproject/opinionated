It began with a traffic stop for speeding in Douglas County. Trooper\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mark Ward stopped the vehicle being driven by Mr. Nelson for speeding across the U.S. Highway 2 bridge from Chelan County to Douglas County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Noticing an odor of alcohol, the trooper inquired about Mr. Nelson's use of alcohol. Admitting that he had consumed two 16-ounce cans of beer while golfing, Mr. Nelson agreed to perform physical sobriety tests. After performing the tests, the trooper arrested Mr. Nelson for DUI. He was\n   transported to the jail and given the implied consent warnings. Mr. Nelson consented to provide breath samples. They measured .078 and .079.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 Charges were filed in the Douglas County District Court. Mr. Nelson moved to suppress the breath test results on several grounds, including an argument that it was a warrantless search prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. McNeely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    569 U.S. 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The district court denied the motion, determining that the breath test was not the product of an unlawful search. Ultimately, a jury convicted Mr. Nelson of DUI and first degree negligent driving. On appeal, the superior court affirmed the conviction. A commissioner of this court granted discretionary review to consider Mr. Nelson's argument that the breath test constituted an improper warrantless search in violation of art. I, \u00a7 7 of the Washington Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 A panel of this court heard oral argument of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Nelson contends that the warrantless search of his breath was prohibited by art. I, \u00a7 7 of our state's constitution. His position, which necessarily would invalidate large sections of our implied consent law, is inconsistent with our search incident to arrest jurisprudence, and is inconsistent with the result in\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   . We discuss, in order, our implied consent law and the recent federal cases involving implied consent statutes, Washington's treatment of the search incident to arrest doctrine, and\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   , before applying those discussions to Mr. Nelson's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Implied Consent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Washington's implied consent law, codified at RCW 46.20.308, was adopted by the people of this state when they approved Initiative 242 during the 1968 election.\n   <em>\n    State v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1070580\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/79/51/#p52\">\n    79 Wash.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=483%20P.2d%20630\">\n    483 P.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). The acknowledged purpose of implied consent legislation is to address the long-standing problem of drunk driving.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=483%20P.2d%20630\">\n    483 P.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the statute has been modified several times over the last half century, the essence of the provision at the heart of this case reflects the trade-off approved by the voters in 1968. That trade-off is related in the opening sentence of the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any person who operates a motor vehicle within this state is deemed to have given consent, ... to a test or tests of his or her breath for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration in his or her breath if arrested for any offense where, ... the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person had been driving ... while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   RCW 46.20.308(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The implied consent recognized in this statute is not final. Prior to obtaining a breath sample, the officer must advise the driver that he or she still has the right to refuse to consent to the test, but that a license revocation and use of that refusal at trial are among the consequences that follow if the driver declines the test. RCW 46.20.308(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The constitutionality of this statute was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   . Our court concluded that the statute did not violate either the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protection against self-incrimination or the protection of art. I, \u00a7 9 from being compelled to give evidence against oneself.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1070580\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/79/51/#p52\">\n    79 Wash.2d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=483%20P.2d%20630\">\n    483 P.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court unanimously\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ruled that while the blood draw was a search under both the Fourth Amendment and art.

He also argues that cases from other states should be considered in determining whether to follow\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   . Although cases from other states construing constitutional provisions similar to ours could be informative, the mere fact that some other states disagree with\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   is not \"pre-existing law\" under\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   that provides much aid to construing the scope of the Washington Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 34 We believe that Mr. Nelson's focus on this factor is inaccurate. At issue is the search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement. Our case law in this area does not favor Mr. Nelson's position. As detailed previously, the search incident to arrest doctrine under art. I, \u00a7 7 not only serves the same purposes (evidence preservation, officer safety)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the Fourth Amendment, but our analysis\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   of a search incident to arrest has been the same, particularly in the area of impaired drivers arrested and tested under the implied consent statute. Thus, both\n   <em>\n    Judge\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Curran\n   </em>\n   recognized warrantless blood draws as lawful searches under art. I, \u00a7 7 prior to the United States Supreme Court revising its view of the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 35 After the United States Supreme Court reconsidered its Fourth Amendment treatment of state implied consent laws in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , it reaffirmed that breath testing did not implicate the federal constitution despite\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   . When confronted with the\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   issue in\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   , a majority of our court determined that warrantless breath testing of suspected impaired drivers was valid under art. I, \u00a7 7. Regardless of what Mr. Nelson may think of the adequacy of\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   's analysis, the result is clearly the most relevant example of pre-existing state law on his issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 36 None of the most relevant case authority supports Mr. Nelson. He relies principally on the fact that Washington cases do not permit a search of a locked\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   container found in the course of an arrest, citing to\n   <em>\n    State v.

That case, in addition to being unique, is clearly distinguishable, even if we assume that a backpack in one's possession at the time of arrest is the same as an item on the person. Borrowing from our case law on inventory searches, the\n   <em>\n    VanNess\n   </em>\n   court ruled that locked containers found near an arrestee could not be searched without a warrant, relying on two automobile search cases involving locked containers that had\n   been analyzed under the\n   <em>\n    Chimel\n   </em>\n   area analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 160-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=344%20P.3d%20713\">\n    344 P.3d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We do not believe that police can do indirectly what they cannot do directly. Locked containers are not searchable in the course of an inventory search, and that fact should not change just because the container was found in close proximity to an arrestee.\n   <em>\n    VanNess\n   </em>\n   is only marginally helpful to an analysis of the fourth\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   factor in this context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 37 Even if we consider searches incident to arrest outside of the impaired driver context, as appellant does, pre-existing law is not particularly helpful to Mr. Nelson.

I, \u00a7 7, undoubtedly other case examples could be discussed. However, we believe we have identified, and discussed, the most relevant authorities. In this context, the fourth\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   factor does not favor finding a greater privacy right in breath alcohol testing. If anything, our history strongly suggests that arrestees have a diminished expectation of privacy in their breath alcohol levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 39 The sixth\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   factor is whether the issue is of particular state interest or local concern.\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195512\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/106/54/\">\n    106 Wash.2d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20P.2d%20808\">\n    720 P.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . How one views this factor depends in large part on how the issue is framed. If the question is defined at a high level of generality, such as one of personal privacy or enforcement of state law, the factor will always favor an independent interpretation. However, our court does not consider this a fixed, static factor, so we believe that the true question is focused on the specific privacy right claimed-whether a driver arrested on the public highways has a privacy interest in his breath alcohol. Although there is strong national interest in the problem of impaired driving, and the national highway system represents a significant portion of the public roadways, we still consider the issue to primarily be one of local concern. Thus, this\n   <em>\n    Gunwall\n   </em>\n   factor somewhat favors Mr. Nelson's argument for greater privacy than that afforded by the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 40 Nonetheless, in light of the long history of both our implied consent statute and of our case law rejecting arguments for giving art. I, \u00a7 7 an expanded interpretation in this context, we decline Mr. Nelson's argument to ignore\n   <em>\n    Baird\n   </em>\n   and reach a different result than that court did. Washington does not have a history of recognizing expanded privacy protection for an arrested driver's blood or breath alcohol level. We therefore conclude that the implied consent law provides authority of law to conduct a warrantless breath test\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a search incident to\n   arrest and, thus, Mr. Nelson's consent to provide breath samples was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 41 We are not unmindful of the consequences of accepting Mr. Nelson's argument for rejecting application of the search incident to arrest doctrine in this context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requiring a warrant for each breath test would render the current implied consent warnings of RCW 46.20.308(2) inaccurate, leading to the suppression of test results in all pending cases.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Whitman County Dist. Court,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1199193\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/105/278/#p286\">\n    105 Wash.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286-87,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=714%20P.2d%201183\">\n    714 P.2d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Very little of the implied consent law would remain valid-and even less of it would be useful-and it is difficult to conceive of how a revised law could be crafted if there is indeed a state constitutional right to refuse the search. It also is questionable how well a search warrant could compel a valid breath sample if there were no valid consequences for refusing to comply. As a practical matter, blood would probably be drawn in every instance where a search warrant was obtained. These concerns do not factor into our analysis, but they do provide a further caution against a radical reversal of 50 years of precedent and practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 42 The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Ward joined the Wenatchee Police Department the following year and was a member of that department during the trial of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \"No person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Justice Utter, joined by Justice Smith, concluded that art.

These concerns are overstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 49 First, the implied consent warnings can be withdrawn and substituted by a warning that if the person does not consent to provide a breath sample, the officer will request a telephonic warrant from a judge. As noted in Justice Sotomayor's dissent, requiring warrants for most breath tests would not overly task the judiciary: \"[A] significant majority of drivers voluntarily consent to breath tests, even in states without criminal penalties for refusal.\"\n   <em>\n    Birchfield,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 50 Second, law enforcement might start warning persons now, that if they refuse to consent to a breath test, law enforcement will request a telephonic warrant from a judge. This warning will prompt actual consent to a breath test in the vast majority of cases. For those few who do not consent, a telephonic warrant can be requested. If after obtaining a telephonic warrant a person persists in refusing to provide a sample, law enforcement can give the additional implied consent warnings. Adjusting to this practice now will prevent the harsh result, possible in the future, that warrantless breath tests will be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <em>\n     Chimel v.
