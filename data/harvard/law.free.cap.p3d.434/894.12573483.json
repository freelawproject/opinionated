After Mother timely responded and litigation ensued for over a year, the parties eventually stipulated to a final parenting plan. On December 6, 2016, the District Court approved and imposed the stipulated plan as a final parenting plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plan provided that, from March through November of each year, the child would reside in Father's custody and care from Thursday evening to Friday evening, and alternating weekends. From November through March, the child would reside in Father's custody and care from Wednesday evening to Friday afternoon, and on alternating weekends. The child would be in Mother's custody and care at all other times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 On June 12, 2017, Mother filed a motion to amend the final parenting plan supported by affidavit and a proposed amended parenting plan. Based on an incident of domestic violence at Father's home in the presence of the child, Father subsequently applied for and obtained a temporary order of protection\n   against Mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 8th, the District Court denied Mother's motion for an amended final parenting plan and set all remaining issues for bench trial. On September 8th, 2017, Mother filed a motion for appointment of a limited-scope guardian ad litem (GAL) to assess the parenting dispute and make recommendations to the court regarding what contact Mother should ultimately have with the child in light of recent developments. On September 15th, the court granted Mother's motion and appointed Christina Larsen, Esq., as a limited-scope GAL for L.G.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 On November 29, 2017, the parties participated in a twelve-hour settlement conference encompassing a wide-range of parenting plan, temporary protective order, and marital estate distribution issues still outstanding. As a result, the parties entered into stipulated parenting\n   plan and marital estate distribution agreements. On December 1, 2017, the District Court adopted and imposed the parties' now-second stipulated parenting plan as their amended final parenting plan. The plan essentially placed L.G.B. in the primary custody and care of Father subject to a three-phase graduated transition schedule designed to incrementally increase Mother's parenting time upon demonstration of stable and appropriate parenting conduct. Under Phase 1, for two weeks, Mother would have specified day visitation on Saturdays or Sundays and after-school visits on Wednesdays. Under Phase 2, for three weeks, Mother would have the child overnight from Saturday at 8:00 AM to Sunday at 6:00 PM. Under Phase 3, for four weeks, Mother would have specified parenting time on alternating weekends. Upon the completion of the phased transitional schedule, the parties would have equal parenting time on a specified alternating schedule. The stipulated plan provided that the previously appointed GAL (Larsen) would oversee the transitional phases of the plan and monitor the child's adjustment to Mother through the first month of the plan. The parenting plan further superseded the prior temporary protective order as to the child and provided that parenting exchanges would be an exception to the continuing protective order between Father and Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 On December 13, 2017, only two weeks into the phased transition schedule, an incident occurred at the parking lot of Pick's Bowling Alley in Bigfork, Montana, where Mother and Father had arranged to meet to exchange the child. According to Father, he drove to the Bowling Alley, accompanied by his girlfriend, and waited for Mother to arrive with the child. Upon arriving with the child and seeing Father's girlfriend, Mother rapidly accelerated toward Father's car, stopping abruptly approximately two feet short of where Father was standing next to the car. Mother then angrily got out and repeatedly screamed \"you shouldn't bring that bitch here.\" The child then became upset, yelling at Mother to \"stop fighting.\" According to Mother's version of the events, she merely \"parked very close\" to Father's car \"because it was icy and snowy and [she] didn't want [the child] to have to walk across the lot and slip on the ice.\" Mother acknowledged that her \"reaction could have been better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 On December 15, 2017, Father filed a motion \"for\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   interim relief\" and a subsequent show cause hearing. The motion requested immediate suspension of the parties' then-governing amended parenting plan to bar Mother from having unsupervised contact with the child. The motion further requested that the court reauthorize the court-appointed GAL to investigate and make further recommendation\n   as to what contact Mother should have with the child. Father characterized the relief sought as \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   interim relief\" but did not expressly seek modification of the parties' then-governing final parenting plan. The District Court issued Father's proposed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order and set a show cause hearing for January 3, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 At the show cause hearing, the court heard testimony from various witnesses regarding the circumstances of the bowling alley incident and the damaging effect on the child of Mother's continued belligerent behavior\n   toward Father. Testifying on behalf of the child and based on consultation with the child's therapist, Mother's therapist, and interviews of the child and Father, the GAL testified that the child continued to be traumatized and scared by Mother's uncontrolled anger and rage toward Father. The GAL testified that Mother's behavior had not improved under the amended parenting plan to date and thus recommended that the court order her to complete anger management counseling to help control her emotions. The GAL further recommended that, in the interim, the court should limit Mother's contact with the child to supervised visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Mother acknowledged that her behavior could have been better but asserted that there had been no change of circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of the parties' prior parenting plan. On the purported basis of eliminating the continuing cost of the GAL, Mother further requested that the court relieve the GAL and refer the matter to the Eleventh Judicial District Family Court Services program for further monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Finding it necessary in the best interests of the child, the District Court orally ordered: (1) continued suspension of the prior parenting plan; (2) that Mother complete 40 hours of anger management counseling; (3) that Mother have only supervised visitation pending reinstatement of the parenting plan; and (4) that, upon approval from the GAL, the child's counselor, and the anger management counselor, the prior parenting plan would be reinstated and restarted under its phased transition schedule.\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the District Court explained that, \"rather than a change in circumstances,\" the bowling alley incident \"was just a continuation of what had been going on before ... it's the same old stuff ... so I'm going to suspend the parenting plan\" with the \"hop[e] that within ... a year from now it will be going full tilt 50/50.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 On the stated ground that any such referral \"probably should have been done a year or two ago [a]nd I ... hate to reinvent the wheel at this stage,\" the court orally denied Mother's motion to refer the matter to Family Court Services in lieu of further involvement of the GAL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The Court subsequently issued written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment formalizing its oral ruling at hearing. With reference to the parties' previously imposed parenting plan, the District Court's written judgment stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [1] Pursuant to M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(ii), the [c]ourt has the authority to grant a temporary order providing for living arrangements for the child\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   as an emergency situation has arisen in the child's present environment that endangers the child's physical, mental, and emotional health and an immediate change is necessary to protect the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [2] The [prior amended parenting plan] was [previously] approved as an Order of the Court....

In\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , against the backdrop of a previously imposed final parenting plan, a mother filed a motion for a temporary\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order suspending the father's visitation rights under the prior parenting plan based on the alleged negative impact on the child of the father's belligerent behavior toward the mother.\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Finding good cause thereon, the district court issued an interim order temporarily suspending the father's parenting plan rights pending a hearing.\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. Upon hearing, based on express findings that the father's hostile behavior was harmful to the child and that the best interests of the child required continued suspension of father's contact\n   with the child, the court issued an order \"supend[ing] all physical contact between\" the father and child and limited the father's contact with the child \"to phone calls, e-mail, and mail.\"\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20.

Though the district court did not make an express finding of a \"change in circumstances,\" we reviewed the court's judgment under \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, and ultimately held that the findings made by the court were sufficient to support and clearly imply the requisite finding of a change in circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30.\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   thus does not support the proposition that \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA, authorizes district courts to temporarily suspend or deviate from a prior parenting plan absent the change of circumstances required by \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA. By its terms in context of \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-213, -219(1), and -220(1), MCA, \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA, does not provide district courts authority to grant emergency relief temporarily overriding a prior parenting plan independent of and without an associated request for amendment under \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b621 Here, Mother correctly points out that the District Court characterized its order on hearing as a mere temporary \"suspension\" of the prior parenting plan subject to specified conditions for reinstatement. This characterization notwithstanding, the relief granted upon hearing, within the limited application of \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-220(1) - (2), MCA, in regard to a previously imposed parenting plan, was in substantive effect an amendment or modification of a prior parenting plan subject to \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. In that context, we agree with Mother that, in addition to not making a specific finding of a change in circumstances under \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, the District Court further made a seemingly contrary statement from the bench-rather than \"a change in circumstances,\" Mother's conduct was \"a continuation of\" the \"same old stuff\" that \"had been going on before.\" However, we must view the court's oral statement in context of the hearing record and in light of the actual findings of fact and conclusions of law entered pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 The court's written findings of fact did not similarly state or manifestly imply that it found that no change in circumstances that had arisen since imposition of the prior parenting plan. Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , the court's written findings clearly manifest a change in circumstances that would have supported an express finding under \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. Under the terms of the prior parenting plan, Mother would either have had limited visitation as provided by the\n   transition schedule or, upon satisfaction of the specified conditions precedent, shared custody with Father on a specified 50/50 basis. In either event, the prior parenting plan clearly contemplated that its structure and provisions would be sufficient to adequately protect the child under the then-contemplated circumstances. The terms of the parenting plan did not contemplate or provide for the nature and occurrence of Mother's subsequent behavior\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the resulting need for additional protection of the child\n   <em>\n    not provided under the prior parenting plan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Moreover, despite its seemingly contrary comment from the bench, the District Court's written conclusions of law clearly manifest the court's awareness and understanding that, as a matter of law, emergency relief under \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA, is available only in conjunction with a request for modification of a prior parenting plan pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-219(1) and -220(1), MCA. Even in the isolated context of the hearing record, the court's comment cannot be fairly viewed as an oral finding of fact. It occurred in the narrow context of the court compassionately explaining to Mother the necessity of the temporary modification and the built-in pathway for reinstatement of the prior plan. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   , the court's written findings of fact and conclusions of law manifestly imply a sufficient finding of a requisite change in circumstances under \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. We hold that the District Court did not erroneously modify the parties' prior parenting plan without a sufficient finding of changed circumstances as required by \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624\n   <em>\n    2.

Subject to \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, as applicable, a district court \"shall determine [a] parenting plan in accordance with the best interest of the child.\" Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. In determining the best interest of the child, the court must \"consider all relevant parenting factors\" including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child's parent or parents,\" \"mental and physical health of all individuals involved,\" and \"physical abuse or threat of physical abuse by one parent against the other parent or the child.\" Section 40-4-212(1)(c), (e)-(f), (2), MCA. Absent an agreement of the parties, a court \"may order supervised visitation by the noncustodial parent,\" upon a finding that failure to do so would endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair the child's emotional development. Section 40-4-218(2), MCA.\n   \u00b626 We strongly recommend and caution that district courts should make specific findings on all relevant statutory criteria in making parenting plan determinations under Title 40, chapter 4, part 2, MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Woerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236219\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/375/153/\">\n    2014 MT 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236219\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/375/153/\">\n    375 Mont. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236219\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/375/153/\">\n    325 P.3d 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, under the doctrine of implied findings, we will not reverse a parenting plan determination for failure to make a specific finding if the express findings made were not clearly erroneous and were themselves sufficient, alone or in conjunction with other record evidence, to support and manifestly imply a more specific finding on the requisite statutory criteria.\n   <em>\n    In re D.L.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456423\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/387/323/\">\n    2017 MT 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456423\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/387/323/\">\n    387 Mont. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456423\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/387/323/\">\n    394 P.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the District Court did not make a specific finding of fact on the criteria specified in \u00a7 40-4-218(2), MCA. However, regardless of other conflicting evidence, substantial record evidence supports the findings of fact made by the court. In context of its conclusions of law, the written findings made by the court were further manifestly sufficient to support and imply a finding that the failure to temporarily limit Mother to supervised visitation would likely significantly impair the child's emotional development under the circumstances-a circumstance and need not contemplated or provided for in the prior parenting plan. Apart from the court's failure to make a specific finding of fact under \u00a7 40-4-218(2), MCA, Mother has failed to demonstrate either that the findings made were clearly erroneous or that the court otherwise abused its discretion. We hold that the District Court did not erroneously limit Mother to supervised visitation without making a sufficient finding under \u00a7 40-4-218(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627\n   <em>\n    3.

However, contrary to Mother's characterization, this is not a case where a court simply disregarded its own local rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b630 In September 2017, in the ongoing course of pre-judgment litigation prior to the initial parenting plan determination, the District Court granted Mother's uncontested motion for appointment of a limited-scope GAL to assess the parenting dispute and make recommendations regarding what contact Mother should ultimately have with the child. At that time, the parties stipulated to splitting the costs of the GAL's services. As an integral component, the stipulated and ultimately imposed parenting plan mandated that the previously appointed GAL would monitor Mother's progress and the child's welfare throughout the specified transition schedule. Mother did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b631 This chapter of the ongoing custody dispute arose after imposition of the parties' \"final\" parenting plan and prior to expiration of the\n   <em>\n    stipulated\n   </em>\n   period of court-ordered monitoring by the GAL. Under these unique circumstances, Mother waived her option of compelling referral to FCS pursuant to the since-superseded Local Rule 22(D)(2).

Mother essentially asserts that Father's failure to object to the hearsay testimony subsequently\n   <em>\n    elicited by Mother\n   </em>\n   was a tacit, after-the-fact waiver of his prior successful objection.
