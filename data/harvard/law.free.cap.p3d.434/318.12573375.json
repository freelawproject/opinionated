The trial court sentenced Appellant accordingly, ordered the sentences to run consecutively and granted Appellant credit for time served. It is from these judgments and sentences that Appellant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Appellant shot and killed Blaine Wells shortly after sunrise on February 21, 2016. The two men did not know one another. They had not interacted with each other prior to Wells' death. Instead, the shooting appeared to be an instance of mistaken identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Jimmy Turpin, Kayla Stites, Blaine Wells and their friend Trey had spent the night of February 20th gambling at the Osage Casino. Early the next morning the group left the casino in Stites' car. They took Trey home and returned to Stites' home in the Hampton Hills Apartments in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, they did not remain there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Turpin gathered some additional money he had left at the apartment and along with the remaining members of the group decided to continue gambling at the River Spirit Casino on South Riverside Drive. The trio took Stites' car. Turpin drove while Stites rode in the passenger seat. Wells was seated in the rear seat behind Turpin. As they reached the front of the apartment complex they encountered an oncoming sedan. The car was a dirty white color and had damage to the nose of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Turpin mistakenly believed that the oncoming vehicle contained their mutual friend, \"Matt,\" and attempted to get a look at the driver. As Turpin navigated Stites' car out of the complex, the white car turned and followed the trio. Turpin continued to attempt to ascertain who was in the other car. He\n   was so focused on looking at the driver in the rear view mirror that he missed the entrance ramp to Interstate 44. Turpin was forced to drive near the local Ford dealership to circle back to the ramp. The white sedan continued to follow Stites' vehicle. When Turpin came up to the stop sign at 51st and Indian Avenue, Turpin rolled his window down. The driver of the white car stopped his vehicle behind the trio's car and exited the sedan. He took three or four steps towards their direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Turpin and Stites easily observed the driver with the aid of the lights from the nearby dealership and the dawn of the sun. The driver had on a green t-shirt, he had facial hair, and was stocky. The driver's shoulder length hair was parted down the middle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Turpin and the driver of the white car attempted to make out each other's identity, however, neither man recognized the other. Stites observed a handgun in the other man's hand and screamed for Turpin to drive away. Turpin took his foot off of the brake and started to let the car roll forward. Turpin declared: \"Hey man, you got us confused with somebody else.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Turpin pressed down on the accelerator, the other man fired one shot through the back window of Stites' car and into Well's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Turpin sped away from the intersection but stopped at a nearby QuickTrip store when Stites observed that Wells had been shot. Once Turpin stopped at the store, Stites ran inside and had the employees call 911. Although emergency workers quickly arrived, Wells succumbed to his injury at the scene. The Medical Examiner's office determined that Wells died from a single gunshot wound to his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The Tulsa Police Department investigated Wells' death. Detectives Joe Campbell and Matt Frazier recovered a credit card and a spent .40 Smith &amp; Wesson casing from the intersection at 51st and Indian Avenue. When the officers cleared the owner of the credit card they learned of a feud between members of the Irish Mob and Kevin Pilon, a member of the United Aryan Brotherhood (\"UAB\"). After speaking with Pilon and his known female associate, \"Malibu,\" they began investigating whether Appellant had been involved in Wells' death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The detectives discovered that members of the Irish Mob hung out and sold drugs out of Lynsi Mayfield's apartment. Mayfield lived with two other women in the Rivera West complex which was adjacent to Stites' apartment complex. Appellant was known to frequent Mayfield's apartment. He drove a white Nissan Altima that matched Turpin's and Stites' descriptions of the suspect's vehicle. Frazier secured a search warrant for Appellant's cell phone records and discovered that Appellant's cell phone was in the vicinity of 51st and Indian Avenue at the time of the shooting. He had placed and received phone calls from Lynsi Mayfield's number prior to the shooting of Wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The detectives conducted surveillance on Mayfield's apartment. On March 3, 2016, Detective Justin Ritter saw Appellant enter a car and drive off. Patrol Officer Cole Butler moved to take Appellant into custody on outstanding warrants. Butler maneuvered his marked patrol unit behind Appellant's vehicle but did not engage the lights or the siren. Appellant drove into a nearby parking lot, stopped and opened his door. After Butler stopped his unit, Appellant took off in the car. Butler engaged his lights and siren but Appellant refused to stop. Traveling at excessive speeds through neighborhood areas, Appellant lost Butler. The officers saturated the area. Detective Frazier located Appellant walking in a nearby neighborhood talking on his cell phone. Appellant fled from the officers into the backyard of a residence but was taken into custody with his phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Frazier secured a search warrant for Appellant's phone. Detective Nate Schilling performed a forensic examination of the device. He found numerous photographs depicting Appellant. Several of the photos documented Appellant undergoing a haircut in a green t-shirt the night before the shooting. The photos also showed that Appellant had shoulder length hair parted in the middle and facial hair after the haircut. Other photographs\n   showed Appellant holding firearms including a handgun. Some of the photographs depicted Appellant displaying gang signs, posing with other individuals, and exhibiting cash, firearms, and articles of green clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 The officers also found several different screen shots saved to Appellant's phone. One screen shot contained the link to the News On 6 story about the shooting of Blaine Wells. Another screen shot depicted Pilon's Facebook Profile photographs. A third screen shot contained Pilon's mug shot from the county jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 The phone also contained several text messages to Mayfield about Pilon. Early in the morning on February 21st, Appellant had exchanged texts with Mayfield about Pilon's location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 Detective Frazier prepared photographic lineups for both Turpin's and Stites' review. Both identified Appellant as the individual who had shot Blaine Wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 Detective Ritter executed a search warrant on Mayfield's apartment. Ritter found a green t-shirt matching the shirt that Appellant was wearing in the haircut photos discovered on his cell phone. Ritter also found Kendra Fisher staying at Mayfield's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Both Stites and Turpin identified Appellant at trial as the individual who shot Wells. Fisher also testified against Appellant and indicated that she had met Appellant through the Irish Mob. Fisher had spent the weekend of February 20th in a hotel room which Appellant had secured for her. Appellant spent the night with Fisher on the 19th. He left her alone on the 20th while he went to a gun range. Appellant woke Fisher very early in the morning on the 21st and demanded that she come with him. Before they left, Appellant received a phone call and stepped into the bathroom to speak with the caller. Afterwards, Appellant declared \"I got shit to do. I'm leaving.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant left and did not return to the hotel. Fisher called Appellant on his cell phone later that morning. Appellant stated that he needed to figure out something to do with his car. When Fisher asked Appellant what was wrong with the car, he advised her he would call her back. Appellant then sent Fisher a text message containing a link to the News On 6 article relating that Blaine Wells had been shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Fisher met up with Appellant a few days later and travelled with him to Oklahoma City. During this trip, Appellant confessed to his involvement in the shooting. He related that he drove his car around the car lot as their car was pulling out of the apartments. Appellant advised Fisher that when the car stopped at a stop sign he got out of his car with the gun. He walked up to the back of the car, shot through the back window, got back in his car and drove off. Appellant explained to Fisher that some of the UAB members had gone to Mayfield's apartment and ran in on them and that he was trying to defend the girls in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 In his first proposition of error, Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it admitted bad character evidence. He asserts that the evidence concerning his affiliation with the Irish Mob denied him due process and a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 Prior to trial the State filed a notice of its intent to introduce the challenged evidence as required by\n   <em>\n    Burks v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1979%20OK%20CR%2010\">\n    1979 OK CR 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10451255\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/594/771/#p774\">\n    594 P.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774, overruled on other grounds\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The State alleged that the evidence was part of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   of the offense or, in the alternative, the evidence constituted other crimes evidence admissible for the limited purpose of proving motive, intent, and identity pursuant to 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2404(B). Appellant objected to the admission of the evidence. The trial court held a hearing and found that the evidence was admissible as both part of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   and pursuant to \u00a7 2404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Appellant did not object to the admission of the challenged evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   He concedes that he waived appellate review of this claim for all but plain error when he failed to renew his pretrial challenge to the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheatham v.

Appellant's affiliation with the Irish Mob was so closely connected to the charged offenses as to form part of the entire transaction and was central to the chain of events. The evidence was also necessary to give the jury a complete understanding of the crime,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , what happened and why it happened. The evidence at trial showed that Appellant's sole purpose for being in the area near the apartment complexes that morning was to protect Lynsi Mayfield and the other women affiliated with the Irish Mob from members of the United Aryan Brotherhood. Appellant gave this explanation when he later confessed to Kendra Fisher. The evidence recovered from Appellant's cell phone showed that he was focused on known UAB member, Kevin Pilon, and had texted Mayfield concerning Pilon's location the morning of the shooting. Wholly intending to spend time with Fisher, Appellant left her side upon receipt of a phone call from Mayfield. As he left he declared \"I got shit to do.\" Appellant, dressed in the green color affiliated with the Irish Mob, followed Turpin, Stites, and Wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 The photographs of Appellant holding firearms including a handgun were clearly part of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   of Count 2. (State's Exhibit Numbers 74 &amp; 76). Although the record does not establish whether the depicted handgun was a .40 S &amp; W caliber, the photographs tended to establish that Appellant possessed a firearm after former conviction of a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 We note that the challenged evidence also tended to establish Appellant's motive, intent, and identity. It is apparent from the record that Appellant mistook Turpin's actions and shot Wells under the misapprehension that they were members of the rival United Aryan Brotherhood. Therefore, the evidence was also admissible under the other crimes and bad acts exception found within 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2404(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

We are not persuaded by this argument. The very evidence that Appellant challenges within this proposition tends to establish this circumstance. Kendra Fisher testified that she met Appellant through the Irish Mob and frequented Mayfield's apartment. She related Appellant's confession to shooting Wells and his explanation that he was trying to protect the girls at the apartment from UAB members. The photographs of Appellant displaying gang signs, posing with other individuals, and exhibiting cash, firearms, and articles of green clothing tended to establish Appellant's involvement in the Irish Mob and corroborated Fisher's testimony concerning Appellant's confession. (State's Exhibit Numbers 74-78).

State's Exhibit Number 76 depicted Appellant and four other individuals wearing green articles of clothing, exhibiting gang signs and brandishing firearms. State's Exhibit Numbers 77 and 78 depict staged photographs of the guns exhibited in State's Exhibit Number 76 on a bed. The guns are surrounded by green articles of clothing, knives, brass knuckles, money, and, presumably, bags of drugs. These photographs were probative of issues in the case. All of the photographs were recovered from Appellant's phone. As discussed in Proposition One, State's Exhibit Numbers 74-78 tended to establish Appellant's involvement with the Irish Mob, corroborated Fisher's testimony concerning Appellant's confession, and established Appellant's identity, motive, and intent in the shooting of Wells.
