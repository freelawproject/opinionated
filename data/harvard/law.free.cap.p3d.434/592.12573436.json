The Industrial Commission of Arizona (\"ICA\") found the injury was non-compensable because the driver was an independent contractor of the cab company rather than an employee for workers' compensation purposes. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 AAA Cab Services (\"AAA\") is a transportation business and one of three taxicab companies licensed to operate at Sky Harbor International Airport (the \"Airport\") by the City of Phoenix. AAA leases taxicabs to its airport drivers under a standard one-year lease agreement that automatically renews unless terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 Before leasing a taxicab, AAA requires all drivers to complete a written application, provide their driver's license, undergo a background check and attend an eight-hour defensive driving course. The lease agreement permits AAA drivers to work for other taxicab companies; designates them as independent contractors who are responsible for paying their own taxes; cautions that AAA provides no workers' compensation insurance to drivers; and authorizes drivers to terminate the relationship without cause upon 45 days of notice. AAA can terminate the agreement only for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 AAA imposes no minimum hour requirement on airport drivers and conducts no performance reviews of them. Airport drivers set their own work schedule, arrange for replacement drivers when unavailable and purchase their own gasoline. Airport drivers receive no salary or wages from AAA. The drivers instead retain all passenger fares as compensation, while AAA receives fixed, regular lease payments from the drivers for their taxis. Cash transactions are not reported to AAA, but AAA processes all vouchers and credit card payments to airport drivers and deducts a bank service charge. AAA annually issues IRS 1099 forms to airport drivers to report their income. AAA registers, licenses, insures and performs all necessary maintenance and upkeep on the leased taxicabs. AAA maintains its own company rules to ensure safety and facilitate a positive customer experience; for instance, AAA requires drivers to wear seatbelts, observe all traffic laws and clean the vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Most significant here, the Airport wields extensive control and oversight over the general and minute-to-minute operations of all airport taxicab drivers. The Airport requires a separate application, an independent test, a Department of Transportation physical and a federal background check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The Airport sets passenger fares. It also imposes and enforces its own detailed set of rules for drivers. For instance, it requires the drivers to use E85 fuel, dress professionally, clean their cabs, be courteous to passengers and refrain from eating, drinking, or smoking in the vehicle. The Airport also leads when disciplinary action is required, not the cab companies. The Airport imposes 95 percent of all disciplinary actions against airport drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The Airport restricts the movement and customers of airport drivers. Airport drivers wait in a designated airport parking lot until an airport dispatcher instructs them to retrieve passengers at a particular terminal. The drivers then retrieve the passengers and transport them to their destination before returning to the designated airport lot and waiting for the airport dispatcher's next call. The Airport provides a breakroom for drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Kardakh Danial drives a AAA taxicab and operates exclusively from the Airport. He signed AAA's standard lease agreement in 2002, which has since been annually renewed. He was injured in May 2016 while driving airport passengers in a AAA leased taxicab and requested workers' compensation\n   benefits from AAA's insurer, which were denied. He filed a timely protest with the ICA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 An administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") conducted a two-day hearing. She heard testimony from Danial and his brother, who also leases a AAA cab, along with AAA's present and former fleet managers. The ALJ entered an award for a non-compensable claim. Though characterizing it as a \"close call,\" the ALJ found that Danial was an independent contractor because the AAA \"exercised very little direction or control over the details of [Danial's] work.\" Danial requested administrative review, but the ALJ summarily affirmed the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Danial timely challenged the ruling. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-120.21(A)(2) and \u00a7 23-951(A), as well as Arizona Rule of Procedure for Special Actions 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 The sole issue is whether Danial is an independent contractor or AAA employee under A.R.S. \u00a7 23-902. Danial maintains he is an employee. The ALJ found he was an independent contractor. Whether Danial is an independent contractor or employee is a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Vance Int'l v. Indus.

A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1021. A factual predicate for recovery, however, is the existence of an employer-employee relationship. An independent contractor is not an employee for purposes of workers' compensation law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munoz v. Indus. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323965\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/145/#p149\">\n    234 Ariz. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149, \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323965\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/145/#p149\">\n    318 P.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2014).

For the purposes of this subsection, \"part or process in the trade or business of the employer\" means a particular work activity that in the context of an ongoing and integral business process is regular, ordinary or routine in the operation of the business or is routinely done through the business' own employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A person engaged in work for a business, and who while so engaged is independent of that business in the execution of the work and not subject to the rule or control of the business for which the work is done, but is engaged only in the performance of a definite job or piece of work, and is subordinate to that business only in effecting a result in accordance with that business design, is an\n   <em>\n    independent contractor\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 23-902(B)-(C) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Arizona courts have adopted the control test to distinguish between employees and independent contractors in workers' compensation cases.

AAA does not possess or exercise the degree or quality of control over its airport drivers to recognize an employee-employer relationship for workers' compensation purposes. Danial receives his general and minute-to-minute direction from the Airport and its dispatchers, not AAA. The Airport fixes his compensation in the form of passenger rates and fares. AAA earns no income from his passenger fares, only from his lease payments. The Airport also imposes fuel and additional hiring requirements on drivers. And while AAA has company rules, the Airport imposes almost all disciplinary action against AAA's airport drivers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Second, Danial retains significant flexibility under the AAA lease agreement. He can simultaneously work for AAA and its competitors and terminate the lease without cause upon 45 days' notice, while AAA needs cause to terminate. He controls his own hours and driving schedule, keeps his fares and tips, and pays his own taxes. He is not subjected to regular AAA performance reviews and does not have personalized AAA business cards. If unable or unwilling to work, he can secure a AAA-approved relief driver to operate his cab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 We note the stark contrast in this regard with AAA's medical transport drivers, who drive patients to medical providers in non-emergency settings. AAA hires the medical drivers as AAA employees. The medical drivers receive biweekly AAA payroll checks with tax withholding. AAA fixes their work hours and pays for their gasoline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 Third, Danial's lease agreement expressly identifies him as an independent contractor and specifies that AAA will not procure workers' compensation insurance. It further directs that Danial is responsible for his federal and state income taxes. Danial also \"agree[d] to accept full responsibility for any and all injuries\" and \"to make no claim for workmen's compensation or unemployment.\" Though not controlling, the terms of Danial's signed lease agreement only reinforce the ALJ's finding.\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"722448\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/141/566/#p568\">\n    141 Ariz. at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"722448\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/141/566/#p568\">\n    688 P.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We agree that neither the absence nor the presence of a written contract controls the resolution of the question of whether petitioner was an employee or an independent contractor.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Danial argues that\n   <em>\n    Central Management Company v.

An ALJ found the claimant taxicab driver\n   was an employee of the cab company under A.R.S. \u00a7 23-902, not an independent contractor, and this court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But the facts and circumstances here and there are meaningfully different on the dispositive issue of control. The cab company in\n   <em>\n    Central Management\n   </em>\n   withheld and exerted far greater control over its drivers than does AAA over its airport drivers.\n   <em>\n    State Comp. Fund v.
