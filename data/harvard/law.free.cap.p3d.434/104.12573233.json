Thomas, obtained a $30-million loan from MetLife Insurance (MLIC), with the Little Jennie Ranch in Sublette County as collateral. Mr. Thomas signed for the loan and mortgage on behalf of himself and on behalf of FQP. When they could no longer make the payments, MLIC obtained a judgment against FQP and Mr. Thomas for the outstanding balance, plus interest (the \"Wyoming Judgment\"). On the eve of the foreclosure sale, however, FQP filed for bankruptcy protection in Georgia. In the bankruptcy case, FQP agreed to repay MLIC a reduced amount for the outstanding Wyoming Judgment, and MLIC agreed to allow FQP more time to sell the ranch. When FQP was unable to sell the ranch, MLIC proceeded with the foreclosure sale and ultimately purchased the ranch at the sale. MLIC then sold its rights to the ranch and the remaining balance on the Wyoming Judgment to JLC, the appellee in this case. In the district court, JLC obtained a deficiency judgment against Mr. Thomas for the unpaid amount of the Wyoming Judgment, approximately $10-million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue on appeal is whether Mr. Thomas, who was not a party to FQP's bankruptcy case, was entitled to the reduced amount FQP negotiated with MLIC in the bankruptcy case. We conclude that he was not. However, we also conclude that the district court failed to properly credit Mr. Thomas for prior payments he and FQP made against the Wyoming Judgment and, thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b62] We rephrase the issues as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Did the bankruptcy court's Consent and Confirmation Orders in the FQP bankruptcy alter Mr. Thomas's liability for the Wyoming Judgment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2.

On November 15, 2013, the district court granted MLIC summary judgment for a total of $31,948,180.15 against Mr. Thomas and FQP \"jointly and severally,\" which was to accrue interest at $9,144.17 per day until they paid the judgment in full. MLIC vacated the foreclosure sale set for February 14, 2014, and instead entered into another agreement with Mr. Thomas and FQP that required them to make three payments of $3-million on or before January 15, 2015, and monthly payments of $237,230.77. Mr. Thomas and FQP made two of these $3-million payments, including one in February 2014. MLIC filed a Notice of Partial Satisfaction of Judgment that reflected the February 2014 payment. When Mr. Thomas and FQP failed to meet their remaining obligations under the new agreement, however, MLIC scheduled another foreclosure sale for January 23, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] On January 22, 2015, FQP filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Georgia, and the automatic stay requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   prevented the foreclosure sale. In response, MLIC filed a claim in bankruptcy court for $27,925,194.25 as the outstanding balance on the Wyoming Judgment. This amount credited Mr. Thomas and FQP with only one of the two $3-million payments they had made. FQP argued that based on its calculations, it only owed $24,232,222.67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] Eventually, MLIC and FQP agreed to allow MLIC a secured claim of $26,817,815.96. On December 2, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered a Consent Order reflecting this amount and gave FQP until October 31, 2016, to sell the Little Jennie Ranch, after which the automatic stay would expire. The only provision of the Consent Order that mentioned Mr. Thomas was Paragraph 22, which required that he and FQP vacate the property on October 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] On March 15, 2016, at the conclusion of the bankruptcy process, the bankruptcy court entered a Confirmation Order confirming FQP's Plan of Reorganization, with some modifications based on MLIC's objections to FQP's proposed plan. In the Confirmation Order, MLIC reserved its rights against Mr. Thomas under the Wyoming Judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2.3 Treatment of Claims in Class 2\n   </strong>\n   .

[MLIC] shall, with respect to Guarantor or Affiliate, make any demand ... commence or continue any ... judicial ... foreclosure ... of any real or personal property of Guarantor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b69] The basis for this Channeling Injunction was the bankruptcy court's finding that FQP and Mr. Thomas \"share an identity of interest, such that a suit against [Mr. Thomas] ... is, in essence, a suit against [FQP] and would impair their ability to fund operating shortfalls, thereby jeopardizing consummation.\" In essence, it prevented MLIC from attempting to satisfy its Wyoming Judgment against Mr. Thomas until \"further order of the Bankruptcy Court,\" because such an attempt could interfere with FQP's ability to satisfy its obligations under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b610] FQP and Mr. Thomas were unable to sell the ranch before October 31, 2016. In November 2016, the bankruptcy court lifted the stay and, on January 6, 2017, the ranch was sold at a foreclosure auction, and MLIC was the highest bidder with its $26,857,929.42 judgment bid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 18, 2017, the district court entered an order confirming the foreclosure sale and MLIC's winning bid. In March 2017, MLIC assigned its rights to the ranch and the Wyoming Judgment to JLC, the appellee in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b611] On October 12, 2017, JLC filed a motion for a deficiency judgment against Mr. Thomas for the outstanding balance on the Wyoming Judgment, plus interest. As of August 31, 2017, this amount was $10,111,714.21. JLC filed an affidavit from its financial advisor that listed the Wyoming Judgment amount, added costs and attorney fees the district court awarded in its summary judgment order, and then credited Mr. Thomas with only one $3-million payment and other payments Mr. Thomas and FQP had made against the Wyoming Judgment since 2013. It also credited Mr. Thomas with MLIC's $26,857,929.42 credit bid for the ranch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b612] Mr. Thomas argued that the bankruptcy court's Consent and Confirmation Orders constituted a novation of the original loan agreement and that he only owed the reduced amount in FQP's bankruptcy court Consent Order-which MLIC used as its credit bid. Thus, he maintained that the outstanding balance was only $993,810.26, which was the accumulated interest from October 31, 2016. He also asserted that res judicata precluded JLC's deficiency judgment for much the same reason. The following table illustrates the difference between the parties' calculations following the Wyoming Judgment and FQP's bankruptcy case:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-30\"><em>MLIC/JLC</em> <em>Mr. Thomas</em> <em>Explanation</em> <em>1/22/2015</em>: Balance $31,377,481.94 $26,817,515.96 MLIC/JLC used when FQP filed for amount from bankruptcy Wyoming Judgment Mr. Thomas used amount FQP obtained in Consent Order Interest from $6,538,081.55 $2,622,973.48 MLIC/JLC used 1/22/15 (date of 11% rate from bankruptcy filing) Wyoming Judgment through 1/6/2017 (date of foreclosure Mr. Thomas used sale) 5% rate from Consent Order Interest from date $674,080.14 $31,250.24 MLIC/JLC used of foreclosure sale 11% rate from through August 31, Wyoming Judgment 2017 (date JLC used in its motion for the deficiency Mr. Thomas used judgment) 5% rate from Consent Order Interest Payments $1,620,000 $1,620,000 Same Foreclosure Bid $26,857,929.42 $26,857,929.42 Same Balance $10,111,714.21 $993,810.26</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b613] The district court agreed with JLC and entered a deficiency judgment against Mr. Thomas for $10,111,714.21, with interest accruing at 11%-the default rate under the original note. It concluded that the Consent and Confirmation Orders did not \"affect [Mr.] Thomas' liability,\" and that res judicata did not apply because Mr. Thomas was not a party to FQP's bankruptcy case. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b614] Mr. Thomas argues that he is entitled to the reduced balance on the Wyoming Judgment that FQP obtained in its bankruptcy. He contends that he was an intended beneficiary of the Consent and Confirmation Orders due to his intimate involvement in FQP's bankruptcy case and certain provisions in those orders. He also asserts that the Consent and Confirmation Orders novated the original note and, in the alternative, res judicata barred JLC's motion for a deficiency judgment. Finally, he maintains that, even if we disagree with his other arguments, the district court erred when it did not properly credit him with the $3-million February 2014 payment MLIC received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b615] Mr. Thomas appeals the district court's order granting JLC's motion for a deficiency judgment against him. We have never addressed the appropriate standard of review for a deficiency judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. McAnnany\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380118\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/802/876/\">\n    802 P.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 1990) (considering\n   the appeal of a deficiency judgment without stating a standard of review). We have applied our normal standard for reviewing summary judgment orders in cases where a party filed a complaint for a deficiency judgment and then filed a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kilmer v. Citicorp Mortg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050408\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/860/1165/#p1166\">\n    860 P.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1166 (Wyo. 1993) ;\n   <em>\n    Hess v.

In this case, however, JLC filed its motion for a deficiency judgment within the same foreclosure case MLIC started in 2013 and did not file a subsequent summary judgment motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b616] The district court ordered on summary judgment that MLIC was entitled to a deficiency judgment for the difference between the proceeds of the sale of the ranch and MLIC's judgment. The foreclosure statutes require that a mortgagor (Mr. Thomas) \"is liable for any deficiency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2034-4-113\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34-4-113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (LexisNexis 2017). MLIC used the amount it negotiated with FQP in the bankruptcy case as its credit bid at the foreclosure sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Thomas's argument, below and on appeal, is that there was no deficiency because he was entitled to the same amount FQP negotiated through the bankruptcy process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b617] Mr. Thomas asserts that we should apply our summary judgment standards to the issues in this case. Both parties agree that this involves the interpretation of the Consent and Confirmation Orders, which are interpreted like a contract. We review issues of contract interpretation de novo.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pope v. Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836156\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/361/824/\">\n    2015 WY 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836156\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/361/824/\">\n    361 P.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830-31 (Wyo. 2015) (citation omitted). Either approach results in de novo review, and we agree that is the applicable standard under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In addition to establishing the amount FQP owed on the Wyoming Judgment as $26,817,815.96, the contract gave FQP until October 31, 2016, to either pay off the outstanding balance or sell the Little Jennie Ranch to satisfy the debt. Mr. Thomas did not sign the contract. Generally, only those who are a party to a contract can obtain the benefits of it.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

The only mention of Mr. Thomas is in Paragraph 22, which required that he vacate the property \"[u]pon termination of the automatic stay,\" which was set at October 31, 2016. This provision was necessary, not because Mr. Thomas was a party to the Consent Order, but because he was the sole member of FQP. The requirement that he vacate once the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay does not make him a party to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b623] As a result of the bankruptcy case, FQP had more time to try to market and sell the Little Jennie Ranch. As it concerned Mr. Thomas, this additional time may have been a benefit to him. That does not, however, make him a party to the bankruptcy case because the bankruptcy court had no authority to reduce or alter Mr. Thomas's personal liability under the Wyoming Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Western Real Estate Fund, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6125202,10543691\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/922/592/\">\n    922 F.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"Neither the confirmation of a plan nor the creditor's recovery (\n   <strong>\n    of partial satisfaction\n   </strong>\n   ) thereunder bars litigation against third parties for the remainder of the discharged debt.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Jet Florida Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500201,10534627\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/970/\">\n    883 F.2d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972-73 (11th Cir. 1989) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Sandy Ridge Dev.

He also argues that\n   <em>\n    Nauman\n   </em>\n   dealt with a discharge while FQP was a Chapter 11 liquidation of assets. We do not find either argument persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b629] First, in\n   <em>\n    Nauman\n   </em>\n   , we expressly recognized that whether a creditor voluntarily accepts a plan is irrelevant as it concerns a non-debtor's liability on a debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nauman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375395\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/816/883/#p885\">\n    816 P.2d at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The underlying rationale for the holding in\n   <em>\n    Nauman\n   </em>\n   , in addition to the plain language of the bankruptcy code, is that a bankruptcy court does not have the authority to alter a nondebtor's obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nauman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375395\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/816/883/#p885\">\n    816 P.2d at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Thomas does not offer any authority to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b630] Nevertheless, Mr. Thomas makes several arguments why he must receive the reduced amount FQP secured through the bankruptcy process. Mr. Thomas argues that he is entitled to the reduced amount because he was \"personally involved in the negotiations\" that led to the Consent Order. He relies on Paragraph 22 of the Consent Order, which required that he vacate the property at the expiration of the automatic stay, to support his contention that, because this \"bound\" him, he is entitled to all of its benefits. However, this does not alter the fact that Mr. Thomas was not a party to the Consent Order. The requirement that he vacate the property once the automatic stay was lifted was only a recognition that he was the only member of FQP, an entity which did not occupy and could not vacate the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b631] He also relies on the Confirmation Order and FQP's Plan of Reorganization to support his argument. He points to Section 8.4 of the Confirmation Order which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    8.4 Terms Binding/Novation\n   </strong>\n   .... [T]his Plan[ ] shall be binding upon [FQP] ... the Guarantor [Mr. Thomas], and all other Persons that are affected in any manner by this Plan, and\n   <strong>\n    this Plan shall novate and replace all Pre-petition agreements between the Debtor and such parties, ex[cept] as otherwise provided in this Plan ... or as provided in that certain consent order\n   </strong>\n   ... between [FQP] and [MLIC].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b632] Mr. Thomas argues that Section 8.4 novated, or replaced, the original contract that he signed in 2006. A novation is a new contract that replaces an existing contract when all parties to the original contract agree to the terms of the new contract.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Platt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10357486\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/837/91/#p92\">\n    837 P.2d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92 (Wyo. 1992). Section 8.4 did not affect Mr. Thomas's obligations under the original note or the Wyoming Judgment. For one thing, the Consent Order, which is the document that reduced the amount FQP owed under the Wyoming Judgment, is expressly exempted from Section 8.4's novation language: \"this Plan shall novate and replace ... ex[cept] as otherwise provided ... in that certain consent order ... between [FQP] and [MLIC].\" For another, as noted above, Mr. Thomas was not a party to the Consent Order, and the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to alter his obligation under the note. Finally, under Section 3.2.3 of the Confirmation Order, MLIC expressly preserved its rights against Mr. Thomas under the Wyoming Judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2.3 Treatment of Claims in Class 2.\n   </strong>\n   ...

Thus, the injunction was necessary to prevent MLIC's collection efforts against Mr. Thomas individually that could negatively affect FQP's ability to fulfill its obligations under the Plan, \"until further order of the Bankruptcy Court.\" That is what Section 4.2.9 did in this case. Contrary to Mr. Thomas's argument, the injunction did not affect MLIC's ability to seek a deficiency judgment against Mr. Thomas. In fact, the injunction specifically provides that the \"Plan preserves the post-judgment remedies of Holders of Allowed Guarantor Claims\" (i.e., MLIC).

In\n   <em>\n    Grynberg\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Grynberg fully litigated the issue whether he owed money to L &amp; R. Ms. Grynberg \"stepped into\" Mr. Grynberg's shoes when she became his assignee and, thus, could not relitigate those same issues. In this case, however, Mr. Thomas has not stepped into FQP's shoes. Mr. Thomas is a stranger to the Consent Order, and he is \"jointly and severally\" liable under the Wyoming Judgment. In addition, MLIC expressly reserved its rights under the Wyoming Judgment against Mr. Thomas in Section 3.2.3 of the Confirmation Order. Under these circumstances, res judicata does not bar JLC's motion for a deficiency judgment against Mr. Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

We agree. The omitted payment is reflected in the record by MLIC's Notice of Partial Satisfaction of Judgment. In its motion for a\n   deficiency judgment, JLC did not include this payment in its calculations. In Mr. Thomas's response, he specifically listed the $3-million February 2014 payment, although he did not attach the Notice of Partial Satisfaction of Judgment to his response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b642] On appeal, JLC argues that Mr. Thomas did not present this argument to the district court in response to JLC's motion for a deficiency judgment and, thus, waived it on appeal. JLC does not dispute that Mr. Thomas made the payment. Because Mr. Thomas cited the payment in his response to JLC's deficiency motion, the record clearly reflects the payment, and JLC does not dispute that Mr. Thomas/FQP made the payment, we reverse that aspect of the district court's order and remand for it to properly credit Mr. Thomas with the $3-million February 2014 payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b643] The district court did not err when it concluded that the Consent and Confirmation Orders did not alter Mr. Thomas's obligations under the Wyoming Judgment, and that res judicata does not bar JLC's motion for a deficiency judgment. However, the district court did not credit Mr. Thomas with all payments. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this case to the district court to enter an amended order that properly credits Mr. Thomas with the $3-million February 2014 payment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    MetLife assigned its rights under the note to its affiliates: MLIC Asset Holdings, LLC and MLIC CB Holdings, LLC.
