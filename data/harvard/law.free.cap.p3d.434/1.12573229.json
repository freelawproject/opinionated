The State further alleged that Appellant had committed these offenses After Two or More Felony Convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 On June 5, 2017, Petitioner entered a blind plea of no contest to the charges with the assistance and advice of his appointed counsel. The Honorable Michael Norman, District Judge, accepted Petitioner's plea and set the matter for sentencing pending receipt of the pre-sentence investigation report. On September 8, 2017, the District Court sentenced Petitioner to imprisonment for life in Counts 1 and 2, twenty (20) years in Count 3, ten (10) years in Count 4, and five (5) years in Count 5. The District Court imposed various fines, fees, and costs and further ordered the sentences to run consecutively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b63 On September 15, 2017, Petitioner filed his Motion to Withdraw Plea. On October 8, 2017, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Petitioner's request. Petitioner had been transported to the Department of Corrections and was not present at the hearing. The District Court denied Petitioner's motion. Petitioner timely filed his Notice of Intent to Appeal seeking to appeal the denial of his application to withdraw plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b64 Petitioner raises the following propositions of error in support of his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

These issues focus on the defendant's knowledge and volition. Often, it is the defendant who offers crucial testimony on these matters. Thus, his or her absence from the evidentiary hearing held on the motion to withdraw plea would tend to thwart a fair and just determination of these issues. Even when the defendant does not testify, his or her familiarity with the circumstances would greatly benefit defense counsel and, therefore, his or her presence is likely critical to the fairness of the proceedings. Accordingly, we find that a defendant has a due process right to be present at the evidentiary hearing held on his or her motion to withdraw plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 Turning to the present case, we find that Petitioner was denied the right to be present at the hearing held on his motion. When the matter came on for hearing, the District Court announced on the record that Petitioner did not appear because he had already been transported to the Department of Corrections. The District Court inquired and defense counsel affirmed that he had spoken with Petitioner and \"fe[lt] comfortable proceeding without him.\" Counsel then renounced Petitioner's request to withdraw his plea and, instead, reargued for the merger of three of the counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b611 The right of a defendant to be present is not an absolute right; it may be waived.\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

Petitioner entered a no contest blind plea on the morning of his jury trial. Petitioner's Motion to Withdraw Plea alleged all of the counts should have merged pursuant to 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 11 and that the plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. Petitioner did not withdraw either claim prior to the evidentiary hearing. Because Petitioner was the only person who could fully explain why the plea was not knowingly or voluntarily entered, his testimony was essential to the outcome of the hearing. As Petitioner was not present at the hearing, he was unavailable to provide testimony in support of this claim and defense counsel withdrew that portion of the motion challenging the validity of the plea. On appeal, Petitioner could not properly raise this issue because there was no evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Trial counsel appeared at the hearing and informed the court\n   that he and the Petitioner had discussed the motion, and that counsel was prepared to proceed on Petitioner's behalf.

Petitioner has not rebutted this presumption, and thus has not shown that his presence was \"denied\" in any meaningful sense. Counsel was not simply stating his \"feelings\" about Petitioner being present. A fair reading of counsel's comments was that Petitioner's presence was unnecessary to a fair presentation of his\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   claims. Indeed, if the record before us is \"silent\" in some important respect, it is deafeningly so as to any facts that would draw into question the Petitioner's waiver of his right to a jury trial, and his consent to being found guilty and sentenced by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b64 We have never held that a personal waiver of the right to be present on the record is necessary for every important hearing in a criminal prosecution, especially when counsel is present to protect the defendant's interests. Such a rule would effectively demand the defendant's presence at all times, if only to consent not to be present. Nor does the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee this right \" 'when presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Petitioner pled no contest, knowing that he would be found guilty and sentenced by the court within the statutory ranges, which he was. He was understandably disappointed with those sentences, but he has offered no credible, factual reason, either in the trial court or in this appeal, to doubt the knowing and voluntary nature of his pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b66 There are cases where the denial of a Petitioner's right to be present at the hearing on a motion to withdraw plea \"would tend to thwart a fair and just determination of the issues,\" and violate due process of law.
