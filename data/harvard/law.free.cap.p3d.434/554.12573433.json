Cedar West asserts the nonjudicial foreclosure on a deed of trust that secures an installment payment promissory note is barred by the six-year statute of limitations. We reject the argument that the first missed payment on an installment promissory note triggers the six-year statute of limitations to foreclose on the deed of trust. We adhere to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Edmundson v. Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451679\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/194/920/\">\n    194 Wash.

We also hold that when a nonjudicial foreclosure action tolls the statute of limitations involves a factual inquiry. In this case, the undisputed record establishes the notice of trustee's sale tolled the statute of limitations and Nationstar Mortgage is entitled to foreclose on the installment payments due on and after November 1, 2010. We affirm dismissal of the quiet title lawsuit against Nationstar Mortgage and the order allowing the trustee to schedule a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The material facts are not in dispute. In June 2008, Countrywide Bank FSB loaned Judith Allen $158,847 to purchase a condominium unit located at 1910 West Casino Road, Apartment 111, in Everett. Allen agreed to a 30-year mortgage and monthly payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 On June 16, 2008, Allen signed a promissory note for the loan amount. The promissory note requires Allen to make monthly payments until July 1, 2038. Allen executed a \"Deed of Trust\" on the condominium unit to secure the promissory note. The Deed of Trust states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Borrower owes Lender the principal sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN and 00/100 Dollars (U.S. $158,847.00). This debt is evidenced by Borrower's note dated the same date as this Security Instrument (\"Note\"), which provides for monthly payments, with the full debt, if not paid earlier, due and payable on JULY 01, 2038. This Security Instrument secures to Lender: (a) the repayment of the debt evidenced by the Note, with interest, and all renewals, extensions and modifications of the Note; (b) the payment of all other sums, with interest, advanced under paragraph 7 to protect the security of this Security Instrument; and (c) the performance of Borrower's covenants and agreements under this Security Instrument and the Note. For this purpose, Borrower irrevocably grants and conveys to the Trustee, in trust, with power of sale, the following described property located [at] ... 1910 W CASINO RD APT 111, EVERETT Washington 98204-2114 (\"Property Address\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 If Allen defaults on the monthly payments, the Deed of Trust gives the lender the discretion to accelerate the debt and gives the borrower the right to reinstate.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Grounds for Acceleration of Debt.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Default.\n   </strong>\n   Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary, in the case of payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (i) Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this Security Instrument\n   prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (ii) Borrower defaults by failing, for a period of thirty days, to perform any other obligations contained in this Security Instrument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    10. Reinstatement.\n   </strong>\n   Borrower has a right to be reinstated if Lender has required immediate payment in full because of Borrower's failure to pay an amount due under the Note or this Security Instrument. This right applies even after foreclosure proceedings are instituted. To reinstate the Security Instrument, Borrower shall tender in a lump sum all amounts required to bring Borrower's account current including, to the extent they are obligations of Borrower under this Security Instrument, foreclosure costs and reasonable and customary attorneys' fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure proceeding. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and the obligations that it secures shall remain in effect as if Lender had not required immediate payment in full. However, Lender is not required to permit reinstatement if: (i) Lender has accepted reinstatement after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately preceding the commencement of a current foreclosure proceeding, (ii) reinstatement will preclude foreclosure on different grounds in the future, or (iii) reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of the lien created by this Security Instrument.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Deed of Trust designates LS Title of Washington as the \"Trustee\" and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc. as the beneficiary \"solely as nominee for Lender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Deed of Trust incorporates a \"Condominium Rider.\" Allen executed the Condominium Rider on June 16, 2008 and agreed to \"pay all dues and assessments imposed pursuant to the legal instruments creating and governing\" Cedar West Condominiums. The Deed of Trust and Condominium Rider were recorded on July 10, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6 Allen made monthly payments on the promissory note through May 2010. Allen did not make the June 1, 2010 payment or any of the following monthly payments. Allen also stopped paying condominium dues and assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 7 Cedar West Owners Association (Cedar West) foreclosed its lien for unpaid dues and assessments Allen owed in the amount of $17,371.34. Cedar West bid the amount owed at the foreclosure. As the highest bidder, Cedar West acquired title to the condominium unit. Cedar West recorded a \"Trustee's Deed\" on April 24, 2015. Cedar West rents the condominium unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8 In September 2015, the lender appointed Quality Loan Service Corporation of Washington (Quality Loan) as the successor Trustee under the Deed of Trust. On October 7, 2015, Quality Loan sent a notice of default to Allen. The notice of default states Allen is in default on the obligation secured by the promissory note and Deed of Trust. The notice states Allen is in arrears and had not paid principal and interest from June 1, 2010 through October 15, 2015 in the amount of $71,460.38; advances and late charges of $567.90; and \"other charges, costs and fees\" of $960.64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 The notice of default states the failure to either reinstate or cure the default within 30 days by paying $72,988.92 \"may lead to recordation, transmittal and publication of a Notice of Sale\" and sale of the condominium unit \"at public auction.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     REINSTATEMENT: IMPORTANT!

Cedar West claimed the six-year statute of limitations is triggered when Allen did not make the first missed installment payment on June 1, 2010.

Here, the record shows the lender transmitted the notice of default to the borrower on October 7, 2015. The notice states the amount in arrears is $72,988.92. On October 18, 2016, the Trustee recorded the Notice of Trustee's Sale. The Notice of Trustee's Sale states the amount in arrears is $97,163.75. Nationstar concedes nothing in the record shows Nationstar took any steps to pursue nonjudicial foreclosure for over a year after the notice of default was transmitted to the borrower. Because of this unexplained delay and consistent with the statutory right to notice of the amount in default and the right to reinstate and cure, under the circumstances of this case, we conclude the Notice of Trustee's Sale and not the notice of default tolled the statute of limitations. Because the statute of limitations begins to run on each installment\n   payment from the date it is due, Nationstar is entitled to foreclosure on installment payments due on and after November 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 39 We affirm dismissal of the quiet title action and the order allowing the Trustee to schedule the nonjudicial foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Leach, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Boldface in original.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Emphasis in original; boldface in original.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Emphasis in original; boldface in original.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Internal quotation marks omitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Footnote omitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Contrary to the assertion of Cedar West,\n    <em>\n     Herzog\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Edmundson\n    </em>\n    did not adopt an exception to the six-year statute of limitations for nonjudicial foreclosure on a deed of trust.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    We recognize the legislative prerogative to establish a deadline.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Emphasis added.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
