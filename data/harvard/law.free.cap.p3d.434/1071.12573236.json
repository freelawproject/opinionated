Because, on its face, the CBA between\n   the Washington State Nurses' Association (WSNA) and Evergreen Hospital (Evergreen) does not waive union members' abilities to enforce their statutory rights in a judicial forum, the trial court correctly denied Evergreen's motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Even if Evergreen had the right to compel arbitration under the CBA, it waived any right to do so by its conduct. A litigant waives its right to invoke arbitration where it knows of its right to arbitrate and engages in conduct inconsistent with seeking arbitration, such as actively litigating and passing an obvious opportunity to assert that right. Evergreen noted its right to arbitrate in its answer to Jeoung Lee's initial complaint. Evergreen actively litigated the dispute for nine months and then opposed Lee's motion to continue the impending trial date, declaring it was ready to litigate as scheduled. Three weeks later, Evergreen filed its motion to compel arbitration. Because Evergreen knew of any right to compel arbitration, litigated vigorously, and passed an obvious opportunity to assert its right to compel arbitration, Evergreen waived its right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Lee was an emergency room nurse at Evergreen from February 2010 until August 2016. The terms of her employment were governed by a CBA between Evergreen and WSNA. To resolve nurses' work-related grievances, the CBA provided a set of informal procedures culminating with the option of arbitration. The CBA also contained a provision about nurses' meal and rest breaks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Lee filed a putative class action in November 2016 with herself as the sole representative plaintiff alleging that Evergreen denied emergency room nurses their statutorily guaranteed rest and meal breaks. Evergreen filed an answer in December denying that class certification was appropriate and raising an affirmative defense alleging that Lee \"failed to exhaust the grievance and arbitration process under the applicable collective bargaining agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 17, 2017, Lee filed a first amended complaint making identical rest and meal break allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Over the next six months, the parties engaged in discovery, conducted depositions, disagreed about trial dates, and disputed class certification. Lee also sent out class notices to over 500 nurses after the court certified the proposed class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 On July 26, Evergreen deposed class member Sherri McFarland. Soon after, Lee moved to continue the trial date from November of 2017 to March of 2018 and to amend her complaint by adding McFarland as a representative plaintiff. Evergreen opposed Lee's motion to continue and argued trial should go forward as scheduled. The court granted Lee's motion to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 On August 15, the court also granted Lee's motion to file her second amended complaint, which is the operative complaint. Two weeks later, Evergreen filed its motion to compel arbitration and alleged \"Plaintiffs' second amended complaint, recent discovery requests, and deposition testimony of class representatives now make clear that the claims arise under the [CBA].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court denied Evergreen's motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Evergreen appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 We review de novo denial of a motion to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also review\n   de novo whether a party waived the right to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Whether The CBA Requires Arbitration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Evergreen contends the CBA compels binding arbitration of all class claims because Lee's alleged violations arise from section 7.7 of the CBA, not from any statute or regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   generally applies to CBAs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We apply federal substantive law to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   When reviewing a motion to compel arbitration, we consider \" 'whether the arbitration agreement is valid' \" and \" 'whether the agreement encompasses the claims asserted.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   If both criteria are met, then Washington courts order arbitration in most instances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties do not dispute the validity of the CBA. The critical question is whether Lee's claims are statutory or contractual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Evergreen relies on RCW 49.12.187 to argue Lee's claims are contractual because the statute gives public employers and public employee unions the ability to negotiate CBAs \"that specifically vary from or supersede, in part or in total, rules adopted under this chapter regarding appropriate rest and meal periods.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But section 7.7 does not vary from or supersede WAC 296-126-092. And this CBA's grievance process does not encompass statutory claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Article 16 in the CBA provides a four-step grievance process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CBA defines a grievance as \"an alleged breach of the\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   terms and conditions\" of the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The terms of this CBA do not allow an alleged statutory breach to be grieved under this narrow definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Chapter 49.12 RCW authorizes the creation of regulations about meal and rest periods for employees, which are defined in WAC 296-126-092 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Employees shall be allowed a meal period of at least thirty minutes which commences no less than two hours nor more than five hours from the beginning of the shift. Meal periods shall be on the employer's time when the employee is required by the employer to remain on duty\n   on the premises or at a prescribed work site in the interest of the employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) No employee shall be required to work more than five consecutive hours without a meal period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) Employees working three or more hours longer than a normal work day shall be allowed at least one thirty-minute meal period prior to or during the overtime period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) Employees shall be allowed a rest period of not less than ten minutes, on the employer's time, for each four hours of working time. Rest periods shall be scheduled as near as possible to the midpoint of the work period.

Nurses shall be allowed an unpaid meal period of one-half (1/2) hour. Nurses required by the Employer to remain on duty during their meal period shall be compensated for such time at the appropriate rate of pay. All nurses shall be allowed a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes on the Employer's time, for each four (4) hours of working time.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 Contrary to Evergreen's contentions, section 7.7 in the CBA merely comports with WAC 296-126-092. Section 7.7 states meal and rest breaks \"shall be administered in accordance with\" WAC 296-126-092.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, the regulation is more extensive than section 7.7 and addresses matters on which the CBA is silent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, section 7.7 does not provide guidance on when nurses can take rest breaks. WAC 296-126-092(4) requires that rest periods be scheduled as near as possible to the midpoint of an employee's work period. Also, section 7.7 does not explain when employees can take meal breaks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   But WAC 296-126-092(2) requires that \"[n]o employee shall be required to work more than five consecutive hours without a meal period.\" As section 7.7 states, administration of the CBA necessarily relies on compliance with the regulation rather than the CBA varying from or superseding the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Evergreen makes much of the fact that section 7.7 provides for a 15-minute rest period, whereas WAC 296-126-092(4) provides for a rest period of \"no less than ten minutes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   But 15 minutes is \"no less than ten minutes.\" The 15-minute rest period merely reflects compliance with rather than variance from the regulation. Also, Lee's claim is for missed rest breaks. The potential duration of a rest break is irrelevant if the break never begins or was less than 10 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 Evergreen also relies on deposition testimony from McFarland and other class members to argue Lee's claims are contractual rather than statutory. But arguable differences between class claims pled in the complaint and snippets of plaintiffs' testimony do not recast Lee's claims as Evergreen\n   wants them to be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Evergreen contends that McFarland's testimony about missed breaks shows her claims arise under the CBA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the rest and meal breaks provided by the CBA accord with state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Lee's complaint alleges Evergreen failed to provide any rest breaks regardless of each break's duration. Neither the CBA nor plaintiffs' testimony converts this statutory claim into a contractual one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 Evergreen contends that all disputes between parties to a CBA are presumptively subject to arbitration unless specifically excluded. This argument is not persuasive because it fails to recognize the source of the rights Lee asserts in her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 The \"Steelworkers Trilogy,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   which sets out the principles governing arbitration of public employee labor disputes governed by a CBA, strongly favors arbitration of contractual disputes within the scope of an arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   But a public or private employee's statutory rights are distinct from her contractual rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even where a CBA contains a provision that is coextensive with a statutory right, the ultimate question is what the law requires; \"and that is not a question which should be\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   to be included within the arbitration requirement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 Moreover, arbitration clauses in CBAs differ from arbitration clauses in bilateral employment contracts, particularly when it comes to statutory rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, an employee retains the ability to enforce her statutory rights in court unless the employees clearly and expressly agreed in the CBA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   to arbitrate their statutory claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CBA must \"explicitly state[ ]\" in \"clear and unmistakable language\" that employees waive their ability to enforce statutory rights in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 In\n   <em>\n    Vega v. New Forest Home Cemetery, LLC\n   </em>\n   , a union employee working under a CBA sued his former employer to collect unpaid wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employee brought claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Illinois state wage law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CBA addressed the employee's wages, set out a mandatory four-step grievance process to resolve disputes, and explicitly defined grievances to include disputes over pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court held the employee could sue in court to enforce his statutory wage rights under the FLSA because nothing in the CBA referenced the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the CBA did not explicitly reference the FLSA, there was nothing clear and unmistakable in the CBA compelling the employee to assert his statutory rights through the grievance process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Similarly, this court recently held in\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Kroger Co.\n   </em>\n   that an arbitration provision in a union employee's CBA did not waive his ability to bring statutory wage and hour claims in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employee brought a class action against his former employer to collect wages allegedly denied in violation of state wage laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because neither the CBA's wage nor grievance provisions identified or even referenced any wage statutes covered by the agreement, the CBA did not \"clearly and unmistakably\" waive his ability to enforce his statutory rights in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the employer's motion to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 By contrast, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett\n   </em>\n   that a union employees' CBA waived their ability to enforce statutory rights in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employees alleged discrimination in violation of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the employees' CBA explicitly provided that all employment discrimination claims, including those brought under the ADEA, would be subject to the contract's grievance provision requiring binding arbitration \"as the sole and exclusive remedy for violations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reasoned the CBA \"clearly and unmistakably\" required arbitration because the discrimination section explicitly stated ADEA claims were arbitrable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   , article 16 makes no reference of any kind to any statute or to statutory rights. In addition, article 16 narrowly defines a grievance as an \"alleged breach of the express terms\n   and conditions of the [CBA],\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   which WAC 296-126-092 is not. And unlike\n   <em>\n    14 Penn Plaza\n   </em>\n   , no part of the CBA explicitly waives Lee's ability to enforce her statutory rights in court. Lee's complaint alleges that she and her fellow class members \"did not receive meal and rest breaks violat[ing] RCW 49.12 and WAC 296-126-092.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint does not reference breach of any contractual term, and the face of the CBA shows it does not supersede or vary from WAC 296-126-092.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 Article 16 provides the option of submitting unresolved grievances to binding arbitration, rather than mandating arbitration in all instances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as in\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   , the CBA's grievance provisions make no mention of any statutory rights and apply only to a breach of the agreement's express terms. Lee's complaint does not implicate the CBA and, moreover, the CBA does not clearly and unmistakably waive Lee's ability to bring individual statutory claims in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Evergreen contends, though,\n   <em>\n    14 Penn Plaza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   are inapposite because those employees were privately employed whereas Lee was a public employee with a CBA subject to Washington's Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Evergreen, PECBA presumes that an employee's disputes with her public employer are subject to arbitration absent \"a clear and unmistakable carve-out\" because PECBA \"provides an express waiver of a judicial forum for employee statutory claims on matters covered in the CBA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 First, PECBA does not presume or mandate arbitration of employees' statutory claims. PECBA merely allows that a CBA \"may ... [p]rovide for binding arbitration of a labor dispute\" arising from \"matters contained in\" the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties to a CBA are free to collectively bargain for particular dispute resolution procedures. PECBA mandates neither arbitration nor litigation. And, as discussed, Lee's statutory claims do not arise from \"matters contained in\" the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 Second, our Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Peninsula School District No. 401 v. Public School Employees of Peninsula\n   </em>\n   that PECBA is not implicated where only \"statutorily created private rights\" are allegedly harmed by an employer's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Peninsula\n   </em>\n   , a school district declined to recognize a grievance filed jointly by a union and its member because the district argued the matter grieved fell outside the bounds of the CBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court had to address whether the matter could be and was collectively bargained for.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Peninsula\n   </em>\n   court distinguished that case from\n   <em>\n    Shoreline Community College District No. 7 v.

Soon after McFarland's deposition, Lee moved to continue trial from November 2017 to March 2018.
