We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Shumway presents the following issues for review, which we restate as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Did sufficient evidence support Shumway's convictions of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On September 24, 2016, City of Missoula Police Officer Nathan Mattix (Mattix) responded to a call at a Missoula Walmart where employees held two individuals they suspected of shoplifting, one of which was Shumway. Mattix eliminated Shumway as a shoplifting suspect but arrested her after he discovered she had outstanding warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During the arrest, Shumway told Mattix that she had two glass \"marijuana pipes\" in her purse but that she had a Montana Marijuana Act (MMA) registry identification card (Registry Card). However, Shumway did not provide Mattix with a Registry Card, and Mattix did not uncover any evidence Shumway in fact possessed one. Mattix cited Shumway with two counts of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia under \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At trial, the City introduced the two glass pipes into evidence, and Mattix confirmed they were the same pipes he seized from Shumway. He confirmed that based on his inspection of the glass pipes, he determined they contained burned marijuana residue. From his observations, he inferred each pipe had been previously used to consume marijuana. Shumway did not testify or otherwise present evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Section 45-10-103, MCA, provides an exception from arrest and prosecution for criminal possession of marijuana-related drug paraphernalia for individuals who possess a valid Registry Card and are in compliance with the MMA (MMA Exception). The Municipal Court held Shumway needed to show proof she had a valid Registry Card before the statute's MMA Exception could apply to her. Shumway did not offer any such proof. Therefore, based on Mattix's testimony, the glass pipes with burned marijuana residue, and Shumway's failure to provide proof that she possessed a valid Registry Card, the Municipal Court found Shumway guilty of both counts of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Shumway appealed to the District Court. The District Court affirmed her convictions and held Shumway bore the burden of proving\n   the MMA Exception applied to her. She appeals now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 \"District courts serve as intermediate appellate courts for cases tried in municipal courts.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Helena v.

Did Shumway bear the burden of proving she fit under a statutory exception for criminal possession of drug paraphernalia for individuals in compliance with the Medical Marijuana Act?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Shumway argues that the City bore the burden of proving she was not in compliance with the MMA, which would have exempted her from prosecution under \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA. Pointing to the record's lack of proof about whether she did or did not possess a valid Registry Card, Shumway argues the City failed to meet that burden. The City argues Shumway bore the burden of proving the MMA Exception applied to her because the exception is not an element of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Section 45-10-103, MCA, which criminalizes possession of drug paraphernalia, states, \"Except as provided in [the MMA], it is unlawful for a person ... to possess with intent to use drug paraphernalia to ... inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body a dangerous drug.\" Section 45-10-103, MCA. Section 50-32-222(4)(x), MCA, defines marijuana as a dangerous drug. Through the MMA, however, the Legislature created an exception from arrest and prosecution for marijuana-related crimes for individuals who comply with the MMA's\n   regulatory system.\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 50-46-301 to -345, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Pursuant to the MMA, the Department of Public Health and Human Services issues Registry Cards to qualifying individuals and maintains a confidential list of the individuals who possess them. Sections 50-46-303(9), -307, MCA. An individual who obtains a valid Registry Card is generally exempt from prosecution for marijuana-related crimes so long as she obtained the Registry Card before arrest; a valid Registry Card entitles her to a rebuttable presumption that she is using or possessing marijuana in compliance with the MMA. Section 50-46-319(2), (7), (8), MCA. However, a registered cardholder must keep her Registry Card in her immediate possession at all times and must display it to law enforcement upon demand. Section 50-46-317, MCA. Registry Cards also have expiration dates-the MMA does not protect an individual with an expired Registry Card from prosecution for marijuana-related crimes.

Likewise, nothing in the plain language of the MMA requires the State to prove a defendant does not have a valid Registry Card in order to prosecute her for marijuana-related crimes. Noncompliance with the MMA only exposes an individual-even one whose compliance may have otherwise qualified her for an exemption-to prosecution for marijuana-related crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 The statement \"[e]xcept as provided in [the MMA]\" is a separate and distinct clause from the statutory elements of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA. The MMA Exception is not an element of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, and it does not influence or alter the statutory elements of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528340\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/783/#p788\">\n    31 F.3d at 788-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the MMA Exception narrowly exempts a certain class of persons from arrest and prosecution-those in compliance with the MMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Therefore, to avail herself of the MMA Exception under \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA, Shumway bore the burden of establishing and showing she came within the exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guzman-Mata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053302\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1065/#p1073\">\n    579 F.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, at trial, Shumway presented no evidence of whether she had a valid Registry Card and whether she was in compliance with the MMA. She thus failed to establish or show she came within the MMA Exception to \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Shumway argues our holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753295\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/365/56/\">\n    2012 MT 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753295\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/365/56/\">\n    365 Mont. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753295\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/365/56/\">\n    277 P.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is dispositive because we stated that to support Johnson's particular conviction for marijuana possession,\n   \"the State had to show that Johnson was not shielded from prosecution by the MMA, and that she possessed a dangerous drug.\" However,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Johnson possessed a valid Registry Card and presented it to law enforcement, which established she was entitled to the MMA Exception to \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. The MMA Exception, however, did not entirely preclude her eventual conviction for criminally possessing marijuana; rather, it only entitled her to a rebuttable presumption that she possessed marijuana in compliance with the MMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 50-46-319(8), MCA. Because Johnson possessed a valid Registry Card, we held that to convict her, the State had to rebut the presumption that her marijuana possession complied with the requirements of the MMA. The State successfully did so: it provided evidence that Johnson's possession of marijuana was noncompliant with the MMA because \"she did not obtain the marijuana in her possession from her registered caregiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 Unlike Johnson, Shumway never provided any evidence she had a valid Registry Card. Therefore, she was not entitled to a rebuttable presumption that she possessed marijuana-related drug paraphernalia in compliance with the MMA, and the City had\n   no presumption to rebut. Consequently, to convict Shumway, the City only needed to prove that she purposely or knowingly possessed with intent to use drug paraphernalia to inhale a dangerous drug. Section 45-10-103, MCA. The Municipal Court correctly held Shumway bore the burden of establishing and showing she came within the MMA Exception. The District Court did not err by affirming the Municipal Court's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620\n   <em>\n    2. Did sufficient evidence support Shumway's convictions of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Shumway further argues the City failed to provide sufficient evidence that she intended to use the drug paraphernalia to inhale a dangerous drug. We disagree. When reviewing whether sufficient evidence exists to support a trial court's verdict, \"we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10. We review the verdict only to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support it, not whether the evidence could have supported a different result.\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 Sufficient evidence supports Shumway's convictions. Through Mattix's testimony, the City established: (1) Shumway told Mattix she had two \"marijuana pipes\" in her purse; (2) Mattix confiscated the pipes; and (3) Mattix observed the pipes contained burned marijuana\n   residue. The City further admitted the marijuana pipes into evidence after Mattix testified they were the same pipes he confiscated from Shumway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the City, we conclude a rational trier of fact (here, the Municipal Court) could have found all the essential elements of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia beyond a reasonable doubt. A rational trier of fact could have inferred Shumway's intent to use the pipes to inhale marijuana based on Shumway's admission to Mattix that she had \"marijuana pipes\" in her purse and Mattix's observation of the marijuana residue within them. Thus, a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Shumway possessed the glass pipes with intent to use them to inhale marijuana. The District Court did not err in concluding sufficient evidence supported Shumway's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 Because Shumway relied upon the MMA Exception-an exception to \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA, made by a distinct clause-she bore the burden of establishing and showing she came within the exception. Shumway failed to show she possessed a Registry Card and was in compliance with the MMA. Therefore, she was not entitled to a protection from prosecution through the MMA Exception under \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA. Moreover, sufficient evidence supports her convictions of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. The District Court correctly affirmed Shumway's Municipal Court convictions.
