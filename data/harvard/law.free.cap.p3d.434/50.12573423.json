Although we now typically use experts to determine the cause of an unnatural death, historically we relied on the verdict of a coroner's inquest jury. The parties before us ask how a coroner today may invoke the statutory authority that accompanies an inquest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case arose after Thomas B. Clark, MD, the Pierce County medical examiner\n   (ME),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   attempted to subpoena a video held by BNSF Railway Company of a fatal train-pedestrian collision. The parties dispute both whether Dr. Clark properly began a coroner's inquest and the extent of the subpoena power granted by the applicable statute. We are asked to determine whether Dr. Clark exceeded his authority in issuing the subpoena. We hold that because Dr. Clark never began an inquest, he did not have authority to issue the subpoena. We affirm the issuance of a writ of prohibition by the trial court. We also provide guidance as to the scope of the subpoena power, as this issue is likely to recur.\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On February 5, 2017, a BNSF train was traveling through Puyallup, Washington, during heavy snow. R.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was standing on the tracks. According to witnesses at the scene, the train blew its whistle, but R.S. was struck and killed. Witnesses disagree about whether R.S. intentionally stayed on the tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 The train was equipped with a video camera that recorded the incident. The video was secured by the BNSF evidence preservation team and remains in the possession of BNSF today. After the death, Puyallup Police Department officers reviewed the video at the BNSF offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Dr. Clark then contacted BNSF to request a copy of the video to conduct a death investigation. Dr. Clark believes that if he views the video, he must maintain a copy of the video to comply with his obligations under the public record laws. MEs are obligated to keep death investigation records confidential. RCW 68.50.105(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 BNSF informed Dr. Clark that it will retain the video for 40 years but will not release physical copies of the video because of concerns about the video being leaked. Instead, BNSF offered to show the video to Dr. Clark at any time, as many times as he would like to view it, and brought the video to the ME's office. No one at the ME's office viewed the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 On March 14, 2017, Dr. Clark sent a memorandum to the Pierce County Superior Court administrator. The memorandum read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to RCW 36.24.020, please be advised that I am opening an inquest concerning the February 5, 2017 death of [R.S.] in Puyallup, Washington.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Until further notice, however, Superior Court is not requested to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest, nor to schedule\n   a courtroom or related services, because my office is still gathering evidence concerning this matter. You will be advised when the status changes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 143. Dr. Clark has stated that it is now and always has been his intention to hold an inquest in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Dr. Clark then issued an inquest subpoena to BNSF, demanding the production of \"[a]ll photographs, film or video\" depicting the \"events 5 minutes before, during and 5 minutes after\" the collision. CP at 145. The subpoena bore cause number 2017-0326 and ordered BNSF to produce the evidence to the ME on or before March 31, 2017. BNSF was unable to find a case with this number on the Pierce County Superior Court's website and refused to comply with the subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 BNSF sought a writ of mandamus to command Dr. Clark to withdraw the subpoena and a writ of prohibition to prevent him from enforcing the subpoena. BNSF argued that the memorandum to the court administrator was insufficient to convene an inquest and that, even if it was sufficient, the subpoena power granted by the statute allows subpoenas\n   only for testimony and not for documents. The Pierce County Superior Court denied the writ of mandamus but entered a writ of prohibition requiring Dr. Clark to withdraw or not enforce the subpoena. Dr. Clark petitioned for direct review, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Coroners' inquests are governed by chapter 36.24 RCW. RCW 36.24.020 states that if a coroner decides to conduct an inquest, he or she \"shall notify the superior court to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest.\" We hold that this statute requires a coroner to request a jury before an inquest can begin. We also hold that a coroner has the power to issue a subpoena only once he or she has requested a jury. Because Dr. Clark did not request a jury\n   from superior court, he never convened an inquest and did not have authority to issue a subpoena. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by issuing a writ of prohibition, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Dr. Clark has made it clear that he intends to call an inquest jury and issue a new subpoena in this matter if this court affirms. In the interests of judicial economy, we explain that RCW 36.24.050 grants the power to subpoena this video but that the subpoena is returnable only to the inquest jury, not the coroner's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

Under RCW 36.24.020, a coroner may generally hold an inquest if a death appears to be unnatural. The statute is clear as to how a coroner may invoke the inquest authority: \"[t]he coroner in the county where an inquest is to be convened pursuant to this chapter shall notify the superior court to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest to hear all the evidence concerning the death and to inquire into and render a true verdict on the cause of death.\" RCW 36.24.020.

Chapter 36.24 RCW \"dates back virtually unchanged to the 1854 territorial laws of Washington.\"\n   <em>\n    Carrick,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437100\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/129/#p133\">\n    125 Wash.2d at 137-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20P.2d%20173\">\n    882 P.2d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When it was originally adopted by the first legislative assembly of the Territory of Washington, it stated that when the coroner learns of an unnatural death, \"he shall go to the place where the body is, and forthwith summon six good and lawful persons, qualified by law to serve as jurors, to appear before him forthwith, at the place where the body of the deceased is, to inquire into the cause of the death.\" LAWS OF 1854, \u00a7 3,\n   at 436. In 1953, the chapter was amended to make inquests permissive rather than mandatory. At that time, this statute was changed to read, \"The coroner shall summon six good and lawful persons to serve as jurors and to hear all the evidence concerning the death and to inquire into and render a true verdict on the cause of death.\" LAWS OF 1953, ch. 188, \u00a7 3. In 1988, the legislature amended the statute again to create uniformity in the way all kinds of jurors are selected, summoned, and compensated. LAWS OF 1988, ch. 188, \u00a7 1. The legislature amended the statute by replacing the \"summon six good and lawful persons\" language with the current \"notify the superior court to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20P.2d%20173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18. The original language was clear that the coroner holding the inquest must summon the jury immediately. The 1953 amendment removed the word \"forthwith\" but maintained the mandatory \"shall summon\" language for a coroner's inquest. These amendments make the inquest process optional but do not authorize the coroner to start the inquest without requesting or summoning a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 This reading also comports with the understanding in prior cases. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Inquest into Death of Boston,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719336\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/112/114/#p117\">\n    112 Wash.

None of these cases contemplated an inquest beginning without a jury being summoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 In this case, Dr. Clark wrote a memorandum to the Pierce County Superior Court administrator stating that he was \"opening an inquest,\" but that the \"Superior Court is\n   not requested to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest\" at this time. CP at 143. Contrary to the statute, Dr. Clark did not \"notify the superior court to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest.\" RCW 36.24.020. In fact, Dr. Clark specifically told the superior court\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to provide persons to serve as a jury of inquest.

As mentioned above, \"RCW 36.24 dates back virtually unchanged to the 1854 territorial laws of Washington.\"\n   <em>\n    Carrick,\n   </em>\n   125 Wash.2d at 137-38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20P.2d%20173\">\n    882 P.2d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the same\n   legislative session that adopted this statute, the legislature passed a law discussing subpoenas in civil practice. This statute explains that a \"subpoena may require not only the personal attendance of the person to whom it is directed, at a particular time and place to testify as a witness, but may also require him to bring with him any books, documents, or things under this control.\" LAWS OF 1854, ch. 32, \u00a7 296. In 1854, therefore, a \"subpoena\" included both the power to bring a witness in to testify and the power to require that witness to bring physical items with him or her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 Notably, another section of the original laws of this state did reference both \"subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, as in ordinary cases at law,\" LAWS OF 1854, ch. 1, \u00a7 40 (emphasis omitted) (regarding elections). However, later, in chapter 32, \u00a7 296, the legislature explained that in ordinary cases at law, a \"subpoena\" alone can require a witness to testify and to bring documents. The legislature did not suggest that the word \"subpoena\" in the coroner's inquest statute had a narrower meaning than the definition adopted elsewhere in the same legislative session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 The way the 1854 legislature defined \"subpoena\" is in line with the definition of \"subpoena\" at the time. A legal dictionary from the mid-1800s defined a \"subpoena\" as a \"writ by which persons are commanded to appear at a certain place, at a certain time, under a penalty.\" HENRY JAMES HOLTHOUSE,\n   A NEW LAW DICTIONARY, CONTAINING EXPLANATIONS OF SUCH TECHNICAL TERMS AND PHRASES AS OCCUR IN THE WORKS OF LEGAL AUTHORS, IN THE PRACTICE OF THE COURTS, AND IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS OF THE HOUSES OF LORDS AND COMMONS 390 (2d ed. 1846) (emphasis omitted). The dictionary explains that there are several different kinds of subpoenas, including subpoenas ad testificandum and subpoenas duces tecum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20P.2d%20173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both kinds of subpoenas involve compelling witnesses to attend in court. The subpoena\n   duces tecum additionally requires the witnesses \"to bring with them books or documents which may be in their possession, and which may tend to elucidate the subject-matter of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20P.2d%20173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). Because both forms of subpoenas can thus be fairly described as \"subpoenas for witnesses,\" the phrasing of RCW 36.24.050 does not limit subpoenas to only subpoenas ad testificandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 This is also a more logical reading of the statute. If the coroner lacked the power to require witnesses to bring physical evidence with them, then the inquest jury would not be able to see and evaluate one of the most crucial pieces of evidence in this case, an actual video of the death. The jury would have to make a determination based only on what other people told them that the video showed. Given the statute's requirement that the jury \"hear all the evidence concerning the death,\" RCW 36.24.020, allowing the coroner to subpoena the video in this case would further legislative intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Timberline Air Serv., Inc. v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Bell Helicopter-Textron, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437165\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/305/#p312\">\n    125 Wash.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20P.2d%20920\">\n    884 P.2d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"The purpose of statutory construction is to effectuate legislative intent.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 This court has also previously assumed that subpoena power includes the power to demand physical items.

This language is unchanged from the original 1854 law. Under the original law, whenever a suspicious death occurred, the coroner was to \"go to the place where the body is, and forthwith summon six good and lawful persons, qualified by law to serve as\n   jurors, to appear before him forthwith, at the place where the body of the deceased is, to inquire into the cause of the death.\" LAWS OF 1854, \u00a7 3, at 436. The statute at that time clearly did not contemplate the coroner reviewing the evidence prior to summoning the jury. The legislature intended to allow subpoenas requiring the witness or evidence to appear before the jury immediately or to appear before the jury at a later place and time. This section does not allow a coroner to demand to see the subpoenaed evidence prior to the inquest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 32 This reading of the statute aligns it with how some other subpoenas operate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Wadlington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11180402\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/1067/#p1075\">\n    233 F.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (8th Cir. 2000) (explaining that a subpoena that required a witness to come to the prosecutor's office the day before the grand jury proceeding indicated \"improper use of grand jury subpoenas\" because the language allowing a subpoena to command a witness to \" 'attend and give testimony at the time and place specified therein' \" applied only to \"formal proceedings\" and \"does not authorize the Government to use grand jury subpoenas to compel prospective grand jury witnesses to attend private interviews with government agents\");\n   <em>\n    United States v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    LaFuente,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517671\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/1406/#p1411\">\n    991 F.2d 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1411 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"The government may not use trial subpoenas to compel prospective trial witnesses to attend pretrial interviews with government attorneys.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Keen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"141184\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/509/1273/#p1275\">\n    509 F.2d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1275,1274 (6th Cir. 1975) (a subpoena may \"be issued only for the purpose of compelling the attendance of witnesses or the production of evidence at a formal proceeding,\" and it was \"highly improper\" to use a subpoena to attend a pretrial interview with the government).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 33 Moreover, RCW 36.24.020 does not allow preinquest inspection of the evidence, and for good reason.
