Anthony Lee Birkholz and Dr. Hayse were among a group of six people gathered at Dr. Hayse's home in the early morning hours of January 17, 2017. While at Dr. Hayse's house, Mr. Birkholz suffered a medical event and 911 was called. An ambulance transported him to St. John's Medical Center in Jackson, Wyoming. He was subsequently transferred to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Mr. Birkholz died January 18, 2017. Kenneth Krell, M.D., an Idaho physician who cared for him in the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, signed his death certificate, which stated that the cause of death was brain death due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b64] Nearly four months later, the Teton County Coroner, Brent Blue, M.D., conducted a coroner's inquest. Dr. Blue empaneled a jury, called witnesses, and presided over the inquest. The proceedings were transcribed. Dr. Blue questioned witnesses, and at times, gratuitously construed witness testimony for the jury. He spoke with individuals who were not called as witnesses and reported these conversations to the inquest jury. Dr. Blue presented Mr. Birkholz's toxicology results to the inquest jury. No court order authorized the release of these reports and no notice of the public release was given to Mr. Birkholz's father, Paul Cassidy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] The proceeding resulted in a Coroner's Inquest Verdict of \"Death due to Aspiration Secondary to Alcohol and 5-methoxy-DMT Ingestion.\" The verdict listed contributing factors as failure to timely call 911 and failure to protect his head and airway when dragging Mr. Birkholz down the stairs. The Coroner's Inquest Verdict was filed in the District Court of Teton County, Ninth Judicial District Agency No. 1701P-2322. Paul Cassidy and Dr. Hayse filed a W.R.C.P. Rule 60 motion to set aside the inquest verdict. The district court clerk opened a new civil action (Civil Action No. 17667) and filed the motion in that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] The Teton County Coroner entered an order denying the motion to set aside the inquest verdict. The order was captioned in the coroner's inquest matter (Agency No. 1701P-2322) but was filed in the Civil Action 17667. The Teton County Coroner also filed a Motion to Dismiss the W.R.C.P. Rule 60 motion to set aside the inquest verdict in the civil action. The motion to dismiss alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction (pursuant to W.R.C.P. Rule 12(b)(1) ), and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (pursuant to W.R.C.P. Rule 12(b)(6) ). The district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and granted the motion to dismiss. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b67] \"Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\"\n   <em>\n    Christiansen v.
