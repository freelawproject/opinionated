We hold that issue preclusion may apply in a criminal proceeding when an issue of fact was previously adjudicated in a dependency proceeding and the other elements of preclusion are met.

C.C. became fussy and later had a seizure and appeared dazed and went limp. Crosby called 911. C.C. was taken to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with subdural hematoma, bilateral retinal hemorrhaging, and retinoschisis. She did not have a skull fracture or trauma to her neck or upper body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 Days later, the State, through the Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\"), took temporary custody of C.C., and on July 13, 2016, DCS filed a dependency petition alleging that C.C. was dependent as to Crosby because he abusively shook her to the point of causing bleeding in her brain and eyes. DCS also alleged C.C. was dependent as to Mother because she was unable to protect C.C. from Crosby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 On November 10, 2016, the dependency trial began and lasted for eleven nonconsecutive days, with the juvenile court taking the matter under advisement on February 16, 2017. While the dependency hearing was ongoing, a grand jury on December 15, 2016, returned an indictment against Crosby alleging child abuse under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-3623(A) and 13-3601. Specifically, the State charged Crosby with one count of child abuse alleging that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   on or about the 5th day of July, 2016, NIKOLAS CROSBY-GARBOTZ committed child abuse by intentionally or knowingly causing physical injury to C.C., a child less than fifteen years of age, under circumstances likely to produce death or serious physical injury, to wit: BY CAUSING BRAIN DAMAGE AND RETINAL BLEEDING AND RETINOSCHISIS, in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3623(A)(1), 13-3601.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 From July 2016 through March 2017, C.C. was not in Crosby's or Mother's care due to the pending dependency petition. On March 8, 2017, the juvenile court issued its ruling, dismissed the dependency petition as to both parents, and returned C.C. to Mother and Crosby's care. The judge ruled that DCS had not met its burden of proof in establishing a dependency, expressly finding that \"the Department has not met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Crosby inflicted physical injury, impairment of bodily function, or disfigurement to [C.C.]\" and \"the Court has found that it is more likely than not that [Crosby] did not injure [C.C.].\" The State did not appeal the dependency judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 In May 2017, Crosby moved to remand for a redetermination of probable cause in the criminal proceeding, which the trial court denied. Crosby then moved to dismiss, arguing that issue preclusion prevented the State from relitigating whether he had abused C.C. on July 5, 2016. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge denied the motion. Crosby sought special action relief from the court of appeals, which accepted jurisdiction but denied relief.\n   <em>\n    Crosby-Garbotz v.

Relying on cases from other jurisdictions, the court held in blanket fashion that preclusion should not apply in these circumstances because the state might forego dependency proceedings if it were precluded from relitigating issues in a later criminal proceeding, or it might instead present its criminal case in the dependency proceeding which \"could unnecessarily complicate and delay the adjudication, placing an undue burden on the juvenile court system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567434\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1112/#p1113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 347 \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567434\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1112/#p1113\">\n    418 P.3d at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Issue preclusion may not apply, for instance, if a subsequent prosecution is based upon additional, material evidence of abuse that was not considered in the dependency proceeding, or if the State were unable to secure an expert witness in the dependency proceeding.

Moreover, the Restatement illustration cited by the dissent, \u00b6 31, is inapposite, as it reflects the rule that one court's determination of an issue will not bar relitigation before another court having \"special competency\" to decide the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 28, cmt. d. The juvenile and criminal divisions of the superior court are each competent to determine if a child was abused. Applying preclusion also does not contradict the legislature's intent; indeed the dissent does not identify any statement of legislative intent but instead imputes intent based on its belief that preclusion should not apply. Nor do we obstruct the executive's authority to initiate prosecutions. Our opinion\n   does not prevent the state from pursuing parallel or successive proceedings; it only prevents the state from relitigating a factual issue that it had a full and fair opportunity to litigate, which it could not prove by a preponderance of evidence, and where the related judgment has become final, i.e. any appeals have been exhausted. This no more infringes on executive prerogatives than does a judge dismissing a criminal case when the prosecution fails to present sufficient evidence on an element of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

At oral argument, the State conceded that there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue at hand before the juvenile court, the issue was essential to that court's judgment, the issue was actually litigated, and the judgment was final and valid. These concessions are supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 The State argues that because DCS and the County Attorney are not the same party, there is no mutuality of parties, and issue preclusion cannot apply. The court of appeals did not address this argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crosby-Garbotz\n   </em>\n   , 244 Ariz. at 345 \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567434\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/1112/#p1113\">\n    418 P.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that there was mutuality of parties. The State, acting through DCS and the County Attorney, has brought its power to bear on Crosby through both the dependency and criminal proceedings. That different legal offices handle different cases does not mean that the State is not a party in both actions.

The precise issue here is whether Crosby abused C.C. on July 5, 2016, by shaking her, causing bleeding in C.C.'s brain and eyes. This factual issue was adjudicated in the dependency proceeding against the State. The same factual issue is the basis for the criminal charge.

Here, the State failed to prove in the superior court, at a lower burden of proof, that Crosby abused C.C. and thereby caused specific injuries on July 5, 2016. This issue was essential to the dependency allegations and was fully and fairly adjudicated during an eleven-day trial with testimony from several expert witnesses (including two experts the State called). The State then chose not to appeal, making the juvenile court's judgment final for purposes of preclusion. In these circumstances, the State cannot force Crosby to again litigate the same issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 We vacate the court of appeals' opinion and remand this case to the superior court to dismiss the criminal charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   TIMMER, J., joined by GOULD, J. and LOPEZ, J., dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 Arizona law empowers the state to address alleged parental child abuse in concurrent ways. The Department of Child Services (\"DCS\") may initiate dependency or termination-of-parental-rights proceedings in juvenile court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-533 and 8-841 to 8-847, and a prosecutorial agency may criminally prosecute the parent in superior court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. 13-3623. The proceedings serve different interests, and the legislature intended they proceed separately. Applying issue preclusion in the pending criminal case against Crosby for the common factual issue adjudicated in the dependency proceeding concerning C.C. interferes with this legislative structure and the executive's authority to simultaneously protect children through dependency proceedings and vindicate society's insistence that everyone obey our laws. The application also undermines the public's interest and role in criminal justice. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 The doctrine of issue preclusion has several exceptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28 (Am. Law Inst. 1982). Two exceptions apply here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A new determination of the issue is warranted by differences in the quality or extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts or by factors relating to the allocation of jurisdiction between them....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   There is a clear and convincing need for a new determination of the issue ... because of the potential adverse impact of the determination on the public interest or the interests of persons not themselves parties in the initial action....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Restatement \u00a7 28(3),(5);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hullett v.

Although the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction over dependency proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. 8-202(B), it has no authority to adjudicate pending criminal charges concerning events underlying the dependency allegations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-202(C)(1) (\"[T]he juvenile court shall not consolidate ... [a] criminal proceeding that is filed in another division of superior court and that involves a child who is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\"). Only the superior court adjudicating the criminal charges has that authority. Thus, the juvenile court here had no authority to adjudicate Crosby's criminal liability, and its determination that DCS failed to prove Crosby abused C.C. should not serve to effectively adjudicate the pending criminal charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 28 cmt. d (stating a compelling reason not to apply issue preclusion exists if \"the legislative allocation of jurisdiction among the courts of the state may have been designed to insure that when an action is brought to determine a particular issue directly, it may only be maintained in a court having special competence to deal with it\" and thus \"after a court has incidently [sic] determined an issue that it lacks jurisdiction to determine directly, the determination should not be binding when a second action is brought in a court having such jurisdiction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631 Issue preclusion should not apply here even though the juvenile court's determination was necessary to the dependency adjudication. An illustration in Restatement \u00a7 28 supports this conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   H brings an action for forcible entry and detainer against W before a justice of the peace. W defends on the ground that the parties are legally married and that under the law of the State such an action cannot be maintained between spouses. The justice of the peace rejects the defense, ruling that the parties are not legally married. A subsequent action for divorce is brought between W and H in the domestic relations court, which has exclusive jurisdiction over divorce actions. The determination in the prior action that the parties are not legally married is not conclusive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Restatement \u00a7 28, cmt. d, illus. 9. Like the child abuse issue here, whether H and W were legally married was properly decided by both courts. And just as the domestic relations court had exclusive authority over divorce actions and thus could not be bound by the justice court's determination of a common issue, the superior court here has exclusive jurisdiction in the pending criminal proceedings and cannot be bound by the juvenile court's determination that DCS failed to prove that Crosby abused C.C. Although the juvenile court is part of the superior court and not a different court, as in the illustration, the illustration is apt. The majority disagrees, asserting \"[t]he juvenile and criminal divisions of the superior court are each competent to determine if a child was abused.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. I do not quibble the point, but the legislature has decreed otherwise. By precluding the juvenile court from adjudicating a related, pending criminal case, the superior court is required to resolve the charges against Crosby through the criminal trial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 28, cmt. d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Second, a clear and convincing need exists to permit a new determination in the pending criminal proceedings because otherwise the public interest would be adversely affected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 28(5). Section 8-202(C)(1) reflects a public policy that the superior court is the exclusive forum to adjudicate criminal charges when the state concurrently files a related dependency action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quiroz v.

A grand jury indicted Crosby under \u00a7 13-3623(A)(1) while the dependency proceedings were pending. The State, representing the public's interest, has a right for a jury selected from the public to determine whether Crosby committed child abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3983 (requiring both parties' consent to waive a jury trial);\n   <em>\n    Phx.

That right does not exist in dependency proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 6 (\"Proceedings as set forth in these rules ... shall proceed in a manner similar to the trial of a civil action before the court sitting without a jury....\"). The public also has a right to observe the criminal proceedings against Crosby and examine the record, which was not the case in the dependency proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-208(F) (providing that, with exception, dependency proceeding records \"shall not be open to public inspection\"), -525(B) (authorizing the juvenile court to close proceedings to the public); Ariz.
