Some affirmative action is required by the holder of the note that makes it clear and unequivocal to the payor that the holder\n   has, in fact, declared the entire debt due. In this case, in the absence of such an affirmative act, the superior court deemed the payments due on a note to have been accelerated. Because this acceleration took place more than six years before suit was filed, the superior court ruled, the applicable statutory limitation period barred the action. In accordance with these rulings, the superior court then quieted title to certain real property in the debtor. We hold that the payments due on the note were never accelerated and that the statutory limitation period never expired. Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Sandra Merceri owned a home in Bothell, Washington. In November 2006, she obtained a loan documented by a promissory note in the amount of $468,000. The adjustable rate note was payable in monthly installments, the first of which was due on January 1, 2007. The remaining installments were due on the first of each month thereafter, with the last payment due on December 1, 2046. A deed of trust secured the promissory note with a lien on Merceri's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Merceri defaulted on the loan in early 2010. Based on her failure to make monthly payments due under the note and deed of trust, a notice of default and intent to accelerate, dated February 16, 2010, was sent to Merceri. It stated, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If the default is not cured on or before March 18, 2010, the mortgage payments\n   <strong>\n    will be accelerated\n   </strong>\n   with the full amount remaining accelerated and becoming due and payable in full, and foreclosure proceedings will be initiated at that time. As such, the failure to cure the default may result in the foreclosure and sale of your property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the months thereafter, Merceri was sent letters presenting options to her, such as loan modification, repayment arrangements, short sale, and full reinstatement. On\n   June 3, 2011, defendant Bank of New York Mellon (the Bank) was assigned the deed of trust as trustee for a securitized trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Between 2013 and 2016, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS), the servicer of the loan, sent Merceri mortgage statements showing the amount due on her loan as the sum of past due monthly payments plus charges and fees. A January 2, 2013 notice of default listed the amount due to cure the default as $76,175.02 (much less than the entire loan amount) and stated, \"SPS may accelerate all payments owing and sums secured by the Security Instrument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On June 1, 2016, the successor trustee issued a notice of trustee sale, which stated, \"The sum owing on the obligation secured by the Deed of Trust is: The principal sum of $509,802.40, together with interest as provided in the Note from 2/1/2010 on, and such other costs and fees as are provided by statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Merceri initiated a suit against the Bank on October 14, 2016, seeking to quiet title to the property. She argued that the Bank's attempt to foreclose was barred because the six-year statutory limitation period had expired. This, she argued, was because the February 16, 2010 letter accelerated the payments due on the loan, making them all due upon her failure to cure her default by March 18, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted Merceri's motion for summary judgment, and entered a declaratory judgment quieting title and reconveying the deed of trust. The Bank appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Bank contends that the trial court erred by granting Merceri's motion for summary judgment and entering the judgment quieting title. This is so, the Bank asserts, because the applicable statutory limitation period regarding the Bank's ability to enforce payment of the loan obligation had never expired.

Its maturity date is in 2046. Thus, the statutory limitation period commenced for each installment from the time it became due and was not paid. But the final six-year period to take an action related to the debt does not begin to run until it fully matures in 2046. Accordingly, unless the note ceased to be an installment note, the Bank's 2016 notice of trustee sale is timely because the statutory limitation period applicable to the entire loan obligation has not yet started to run and the action was brought within six years of missed monthly installment payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Bank argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the payment obligation on Merceri's loan was accelerated by the 2010 notice, causing the six-year statutory limitation period to commence.

In addition, mortgage statements sent to Merceri after the February 2010 notice show the amount due as merely the sum of unpaid past due installments, not the full principal. The statements do not show an accelerated amount due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 Merceri makes several arguments in support of acceleration. She argues that her deed of trust is evidence of\n   acceleration. It states that \"failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured.\" Merceri contends that the February 2010 notice went a step further by stating that her loan \"will be accelerated.\" This argument is not persuasive. A loan is accelerated by clear and unequivocal action by the lender. Regardless of how the February 2010 notice compares to the deed of trust, it still does not amount to notice of acceleration. Merceri also argues that mortgage statements show acceleration because, after default, the Bank ceased to capitalize unpaid interest and charge late fees. But again, this falls far short of a clear and unequivocal statement of acceleration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 At oral argument, Merceri again claimed that language in the deed of trust compelled the conclusion that the debt was accelerated in 2010. But the language cited in paragraph 22 of the document upon which this contention relies, includes the following: \"If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender\n   <em>\n    at its option,\n   </em>\n   may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and/or any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law.\" (Emphasis added.) There is no evidence in the record that this lender exercised its option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 Also at oral argument, Merceri pointed to the 2016 notice of trustee sale, which states that the principal sum owed was \"$509,802.40,\" as evidence of acceleration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, even if this was so, a 2016 acceleration\n   would not serve to bar a claim asserted in a 2016 lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 Finally, in both a supplemental statement of authority and at oral argument, Merceri pointed to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Washington Federal, National Association v.

It is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 In\n   <em>\n    Washington Federal\n   </em>\n   , the court described the key document as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, the April 2007 Notice of Default lists the various defaults and states the \"Total Amount Due\" as $6,116,545.07. This number includes the \"Accelerated balance due under Promissory Note\" of $5,656,151.29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   195 Wash. App. at 663,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%2020\">\n    382 P.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation to record omitted). No such action of the lender took place herein. Here, to the contrary, the lender offered the debtor numerous alternatives to paying the entire amount of the loan and repeatedly informed the lender that the amount due was the sum of missed monthly payments-not the entire principal amount. Merceri never received a notice of default setting forth an \"Accelerated balance due.\" In these important respects, the\n   <em>\n    WashingtonFederal\n   </em>\n   decision bears little resemblance to this dispute and does not militate in favor of Merceri's arguments on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court erred by accepting Merceri's contention that the payments on the debt were accelerated in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 The trial court erred by ruling that the debt had been accelerated in 2010, that the statutory limitation period had expired, and that quieting title in Merceri was warranted. These rulings, and the judgment entered thereon, are reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 On remand, the trial court should grant the Bank's motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitation issue. It should then conduct proceedings consistent with the entry of that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26 Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mann, A.C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Merceri argues briefly that the nonjudicial foreclosure attempt was not an \"action\" and that only a judicial foreclosure can toll the statute of limitations under RCW 4.16.170. This argument is unavailing.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Edmundson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451679\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/194/920/#p927\">\n     194 Wash.

We will not further discuss this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Bank answers that this figure proves no such thing and that, rather, the sum was included as required by law because it delineates the Bank's maximum interest in the proceeds of any forced sale.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
