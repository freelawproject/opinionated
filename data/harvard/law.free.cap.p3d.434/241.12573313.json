Plaintiffs also sought related injunctive relief enjoining the Secretary from giving any effect to the petition. Following an evidentiary hearing that took place in three installments over a two-month period, the District Court issued detailed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment invalidating the Secretary's Green Party certification and enjoining him from giving any effect to the petition. The Secretary timely appealed. Upon consideration and due to the imminent approach of the 2018 general election and related preceding statutory deadlines for\n   preparation and distribution of statewide ballots, we issued a summary decision affirming the District Court's judgment, with a formal decision to follow in the ordinary course. In follow-up to our summary decision, we find the following restated issues dispositive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1.

In the case of a political party that did not have a candidate in either of the last two general elections who received 5% or more of the total votes cast for the last-elected governor, a party may qualify to nominate candidates for public offices by timely submitting a qualified petition to the appropriate county election administrators \"signed by a number of registered voters equal to 5% or more of the total votes cast\" for the last-elected governor, or 5,000 registered voters, whichever is less. Section 13-10-601(2)(a)-(c), MCA. The number must include signatures of registered voters in more than one-third of Montana's legislative districts with the number for each of those districts equal to the lesser of 150 electors or at least 5% of the total votes cast in that district for the last-elected governor. Section 13-10-601(2)(b), MCA. The petition must be\n   timely submitted with accompanying petition circulation affidavits to the appropriate county election administrators no later than 92 days before the date of the primary election. Section 13-10-601(2)(c), (d), MCA (\"1 week before the [85-day] deadline\" for forwarding to secretary of state). Upon receipt of the required signature sheets and accompanying affidavits, local\n   county election administrators must \"verif[y]\" the submitted signatures as provided by \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-303 to -306, MCA. Section 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA. The county administrators must then timely forward the \"verified petition\" sheets and attached circulation affidavits to the secretary of state with certification of the number of \"valid\" signatures, corresponding to referenced legislative districts, included on the attached petition sheets. Sections 13-10-601(2)(d), 13-27-306, -307, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon receipt of the forwarded petition sheets, affidavits, and county certifications, the secretary of state must \"consider and tabulate\" the verified petition signatures and then, upon determining that the petition includes the requisite numbers of verified signatures, certify the subject political party as eligible to nominate candidates for public office on the upcoming primary election ballot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(d), 13-27-306, -307, MCA. Based on the current number of Montana legislative districts (100), political party qualification petitions must include the requisite numbers of signatures from at least 34 districts. Section 13-10-601(2)(b), MCA. For the 2018 primary and general elections, the petition submittal deadline was March 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), (d), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 In 2017, two Montana Green Party leaders (Danielle and Thomas Breck) began gathering signatures to qualify the Green Party for the 2018 elections. As of the March 2018 deadline, the Brecks had only gathered and submitted approximately 700 signatures, far short of the number required to qualify the Green Party to nominate candidates for election in 2018. However, to their surprise, in the final three weeks before the March 5th deadline, Advanced Micro Targeting, a Nevada political consulting firm operating through 13 paid signature gatherers, many from out of state, independently collected an additional 9,461 signatures from four counties (Cascade, Lewis and Clark, Missoula, and Yellowstone) in support of the Green Party petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Advanced Micro Targeting signature gatherers timely submitted their signature sheets and accompanying certification\n   affidavits to the respective county election administrators just before expiration of the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 Upon examination of the 10,160 signatures submitted, local county election administrators timely certified 7,386 signatures, including signatures from 38 legislative districts, to the Secretary as verified pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c) and 13-27-303 to -306, MCA. On March 12, 2018, based on 7,386 signatures certified from 38 legislative districts, the Secretary certified the Green Party as qualified to nominate candidates for public office pursuant to \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. As certified by the Secretary, the Green Party qualified by a narrow four-district margin with eight districts meeting the minimum threshold by 11 signatures or less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 On April 2, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a district court complaint against the Secretary and the Green Party\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking declaratory judgment that the Secretary's Green Party certification was invalid due to the lack of a sufficient number of valid signatures in at least 34 legislative districts as required by \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. Plaintiffs' first amended complaint alleged that 210 signatures from nine districts were invalid based on various alleged defects including signatures: (1) submitted under a signature gatherer affidavit falsely attesting to personal collection; (2) not signed in substantially the same manner as the corresponding voter registration form signatures; (3) with incorrect or improperly altered signature dates; (4) not accompanied\n   by a printed name; and (5) not matched to a registered voter in the corresponding county. With the statewide ballot printing deadline and primary election fast approaching, the District Court set an expedited evidentiary hearing (show cause hearing) for April 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Prior to the hearing, Plaintiffs petitioned the District Court pursuant to Rule VI(C) of the Rules for Admission to the Bar of Montana, for admission of Kevin J. Hamilton of Perkins Coie LLP in Seattle, Washington, to assist in their representation\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs asserted that he had specialized experience in ballot qualification and election law compliance litigation not commonly available in Montana. The Secretary objected, contrarily asserting that Plaintiffs already had highly competent and experienced Montana counsel and that out-of-state counsel was unnecessary because this litigation merely involved relatively non-complex issues of Montana election law. Summarily finding \"good cause\" shown, the District Court granted Plaintiffs' motion without elaboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Prior to the scheduled evidentiary hearing, the Secretary filed a brief in opposition to Plaintiffs' claim. In substance, the brief was essentially a motion to dismiss pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b) on the asserted grounds that Plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a cognizable private claim for relief and that the claim was non-justiciable in any event due to Plaintiffs' lack of legal standing and because it involved a political question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 On April 23, 2018, the Green Party first appeared in the litigation by notice of appearance filed the day before the scheduled evidentiary hearing. When the hearing convened the next day, the District Court denied the Green Party's motion to vacate the hearing and proceeded. Upon expiration of the allotted time, the Court set the hearing to continue on April 30th.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 On April 25, 2018, the Montana Republican Legislative Campaign Committee (MRLCC) moved for leave to intervene in the case pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24. Identifying itself as a \"duly-formed Montana political party committee dedicated to the recruitment, training, and election of Republicans to the Montana Legislature,\" the MRLCC asserted that it had a \"direct, substantial, [and] legally protectable interest\" in this matter based on the asserted fact that, if qualified for nomination, anticipated Green Party candidates in at least three Montana legislative races would likely \"attract Montana voters away from [the] Democratic Party,\" thereby \"increas[ing] the likelihood that the Republican Party candidate[s] ... will win the general election.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later that day, the Green Party filed a motion to continue the scheduled April 30th hearing. The District Court summarily denied the motion. On April 27th, three days before the scheduled hearing, the Green Party filed a notice of removal in the United States District Court, thereby stripping the state court of jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   based on an asserted federal court action. In a further attempt to delay, the Green Party filed a state court motion on the morning of April 30th for peremptory substitution of the presiding district judge pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA. Later that same day, the United States District Court dismissed the Green Party's federal court action on Plaintiffs' motion due to lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 After a new district judge assumed jurisdiction, Plaintiffs filed\n   their own peremptory substitution motion on May 1, 2018, thereby bumping the second assigned judge off the case. The next day, the third and final assigned judge reset the evidentiary hearing to continue on May 17, 2018. When the hearing reconvened, the District Court denied MRLCC's previously filed motion to intervene and then proceeded until expiration of the allotted time. Two days before the hearing reconvened on May 24th, MRLCC moved for a stay to allow it to appeal the court's prior denial of its motion to intervene. MRLCC followed up by filing a notice of appeal that day. When the hearing reconvened on May 24th, the District Court denied MRLCC's motion for a stay, disregarded its\n   notice of appeal as procedurally premature, and then proceeded with the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Over the course of the evidentiary hearing, the District Court admitted 22 evidentiary exhibits offered by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs also presented the testimony of two registered voters, Thai Nguyen and Dana Toole, who signed the Green Party qualification petition at the Helena Public Library on February 24, 2018. The court also heard testimony from various other witnesses presented by the parties. The Secretary offered no documentary evidence and the District Court excluded the three exhibits offered by the Green Party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 On July 9, 2018, the District Court issued detailed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and declaratory judgment invalidating the Secretary's certification of the Green Party's ballot eligibility due to noncompliance with the requirements of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. The court adjudicated a total of 87 signatures from eight legislative districts invalid based on various cited legal defects. The court further enjoined the Secretary from implementing, enforcing, or otherwise giving effect to his prior Green Party certification. The court also affirmatively enjoined the Secretary to remove the Green Party from Montana's 2018 election ballot. The District Court essentially ruled that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) 36 signatures from six legislative districts did not comply with \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c) and 13-27-302, MCA, because the purported signature gatherer (Skye Robert Berns) submitted false affidavits attesting that he personally gathered petition signatures;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) an additional 31 signatures from eight legislative districts\n   were not substantially similar to the signatures on the purported signatories' voter registration forms as required by the signature sheet form and \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), (c) and 13-27-303(1), MCA ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) an additional six signatures from three legislative districts did not match the names of registered voters in those districts as required by \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(b), (c) and 13-27-303(1), MCA ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (4) an additional nine signatures from four legislative districts were not associated with correct or correctly altered signing dates as required by \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (5) an additional five signatures from four legislative districts did not include a printed name as required by \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The signatures invalidated by the court broke down as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-34\"><strong>House</strong> <strong>Berns/False</strong> <strong>Dissimilar</strong> <strong>Voter</strong> <strong>Date</strong> <strong>No Printed</strong> <strong><em>Invalidated</em></strong> <strong><em>District</em></strong> <strong><em>Affidavit</em></strong> <strong><em>Signature</em></strong> <strong><em>Mismatch</em></strong> <strong><em>Discrepancy</em></strong> <strong><em>Name</em></strong> <strong><em>Per-District</em></strong> <strong>20</strong> 7 <strong>7</strong> <strong>21</strong> 9 3 1 <strong>13</strong> <strong>43</strong> 1 1 1 1 <strong>4</strong> <strong>54</strong> 10 3 1 <strong>14</strong> <strong>56</strong> 2 4 2 <strong>8</strong> <strong>80</strong> 8 1 3 1 <strong>13</strong> <strong>83</strong> 9 3 4 1 <strong>17</strong> <strong>84</strong> 6 3 2 <strong>11</strong> <strong>Subtotals</strong> <strong>36</strong> <strong>31</strong> <strong>6</strong> <strong>9</strong> <strong>5</strong> <strong>87</strong> <strong>Invalidated</strong> <strong>Total Invalidated By District Court</strong> <strong>87</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b614 The District Court thus found and concluded that the numbers of valid signature counts in eight legislative districts fell below the requisite number in each of those districts, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-36\"><strong>House</strong> <strong>Needed Per</strong> <strong>Certified</strong> <strong>Original</strong> <strong>Invalidated</strong> <strong>Per-District</strong> <strong><em>District</em></strong> <strong><em>\u00a7 13-10-601</em></strong> <strong><em>By Sec'y</em></strong> <strong><em>+ Margin</em></strong> <strong><em>By Court</em></strong> <strong><em>Shortfall</em></strong> <strong>20</strong> 140 145 5 7 (2) <strong>21</strong> 135 141 6 13 (7) <strong>43</strong> 105 107 2 4 (2) <strong>54</strong> 130 141 11 14 (3) <strong>56</strong> 101 103 2 8 (6) <strong>80</strong> 132 138 6 13 (7) <strong>83</strong> 150 161 11 17 (6) <strong>84</strong> 150 151 1 11 (10) <strong>Total Invalidated By District Court</strong> <strong>87</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The adjudicated shortfalls dropped the number of districts with the requisite number of valid signatures from the 38 qualifying districts originally certified by the Secretary to only 30, well below the 34-district minimum required by \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b615 The Secretary timely appealed.

Section \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, imposes specific administrative duties on county election administrators (signature verification, county tabulation, and certification) and the secretary of state (review of county certifications, statewide tabulation, and petition certification). Aside from the specified duties of the county administrators and the secretary of state, the only means of enforcement expressly provided by statute are the per-county voter challenge procedure and the option for county administrators to refer suspected \"fraudulent signatures or duplicate signatures\" to the county attorney for criminal investigation. The per-county voter challenge procedure merely provides a process for a registered voter in a county to compel a county administrator to verify a broader scope of petition signatures submitted in that county. Section 13-27-306, MCA. The criminal referral option merely\n   authorizes a county administrator\n   <em>\n    to request\n   </em>\n   that the county attorney initiate a criminal investigation. Section 13-27-303(3), MCA. County election administrators\n   have no authority to compel a criminal investigation or prosecution.

The Legislature clearly enacted \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, to aid in the preservation of the fairness and integrity of elections in this state. Compliance with Montana's clear and unambiguous election laws is essential to the\n   fairness and integrity of our elections and the exercise of the reserved power of the people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 Though serving significant purposes, the per-county voter challenge procedure and county administrator criminal investigation referral option are inadequate or incomplete means to enforce compliance with all essential requirements of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. Neither provides a means for correcting or redressing an error by government officials in the administration of the statutory process. The per-county voter challenge procedure allows a voter registered in a county to compel a county administrator to verify a broader scope of petition signatures submitted in that county but applies only on a limited per-county basis. Section 13-27-306, MCA. Referral for criminal investigation and potential criminal prosecution presumably has an important deterrent effect but, at most, can only result in criminal sanction of\n   <em>\n    individuals\n   </em>\n   involved in the perpetration of \"fraudulent signatures\" or knowingly false circulation affidavits. Investigation and potential prosecution of signature gatherers or signatories cannot preserve the fairness and integrity of an election by preventing otherwise legally unqualified political parties from obtaining ballot access as a result of criminal conduct or other statutory noncompliance. The remedial effectiveness of the county administrator option for criminal referral is further diminished by the fact that it necessarily depends on the third-party prosecutorial discretion of the county attorney and, even then, only applies to purposeful, knowing, or negligent misconduct for which there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 26-1-403(2), 45-2-103(1), MCA (criminal standard of proof and requisite criminal mental states). In contrast, as manifest in this\n   case, the remedy of declaratory judgment and derivative injunctive relief provides a complete remedy to ensure compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, prior to allowing a previously unqualified political party to place candidates for public office on the ballot. Until the Legislature may otherwise provide, a private action for declaratory judgment and associated injunctive relief is thus not only consistent with the per-county voter challenge and criminal referral option processes, but essential to meaningful enforcement of the requirements of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Further belying the fallacy of the Secretary's narrow construction of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, and contrarily manifesting the Legislature's contemplation of a private enforcement remedy, \u00a7 13-35-108, MCA, expressly provides that \"[i]n\n   <em>\n    any action brought under the election laws of this state\n   </em>\n   , the appropriate district court may enjoin any person to prevent the doing of any prohibited act or to compel the performance of any act required by the election laws.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 13-35-108, MCA, is a broadly applicable remedy expressly provided by the Legislature for enforcement of the provisions of Title 13, MCA. Section \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, including other incorporated statutory provisions, is unquestionably an \"election law[ ] of this state\" that imposes duties, restrictions, and requirements on petition signers, signature gatherers, and administrative officials alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b633 From the time it enacted \u00a7 13-10-601, MCA, to date, the Legislature was well aware of the previously enacted Montana Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (MUDJA). Section 27-8-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , MCA. The MUDJA provides a legal vehicle to obtain judgments declaring relative \"rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-8-201, MCA.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-8-102, MCA (stating remedial purpose of the Act \"to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity\" regarding \"rights, status, and other legal relations\" and commanding that Act shall \"be liberally construed and administered\"). Any party whose rights or status \"\n   <em>\n    are affected\n   </em>\n   by a statute ... may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\" Section 27-8-202, MCA (emphasis added). The Legislature was similarly aware that injunctive relief is a supplemental remedy available to further or effect a declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. Independent of other cognizable statutory and common law claims for relief, declaratory judgment is available for claims substantively described by \u00a7 27-8-201, MCA,\n   and which are otherwise\n   justiciable under \u00a7 27-8-202, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 Nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2) or 13-35-108, MCA, or the MUDJA evinces any legislative intent to except or otherwise insulate political party ballot qualification petitions-or the officials charged with administering them-from declaratory judgment actions challenging the compliance of those petitions and certifications with the requirements of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. Declaratory judgment is a predicate legal basis,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , upon which a court may grant injunctive relief in accordance with applicable principles of equity. The broad language and application of \u00a7 13-35-108, MCA, and the MUDJA contrarily indicate that the Legislature indeed implicitly contemplated a private right of action for enforcing \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, by declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 As to the third\n   <em>\n    Klaudt\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   factor, an implied private right of action for enforcement of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, does not create potential for unreasonable or absurd results.

Our observations in\n   <em>\n    Clarke\n   </em>\n   over a hundred years ago are no less applicable and cogent today. The Secretary has asserted no scenario under which an implied private right of action would or could produce an unreasonable or absurd result as a matter of law. To the contrary, except as the Legislature may otherwise hereafter provide, it would be unreasonable and absurd to narrowly construe \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, as asserted by the Secretary, to deny voters and other interested parties the right to challenge the legal sufficiency of political party ballot qualification petitions under statutory requirements imposed to preserve the fundamental fairness and integrity of our elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b636 As to the last\n   <em>\n    Klaudt\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   consideration, the Secretary has made no showing that his office has ever previously administratively adopted and implemented the narrow construction of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, advanced in this case. Moreover, though agency constructions may have some persuasive value in the construction of a vague or ambiguous statute under which the Legislature has delegated an agency substantial administrative authority, an agency construction of a statute simply cannot in any event alter the express or manifestly discernable essence of a legislative enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b637 We find no indication of legislative intent, express or implied,\n   to preclude a private right of action to enforce the requirements of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, via declaratory judgment and associated injunctive relief. An implied private right of action is consistent with the purpose and language of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. The Legislature has authority to preclude declaratory judgment as a private right of action for enforcement of compliance with \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA -it simply has not done so.

Unrebutted, this showing evinces a direct\n   causal connection in fact between the alleged illegality and definite, specific, and substantial resulting harm to the Democratic Party itself. The alleged harm was clearly of a type effectively diminished, curable, or preventable by the available and requested declaratory and injunctive relief. On the record in this case, we hold that the Montana Democratic Party had legal standing to challenge the validity of the Green Party ballot eligibility petition and the Secretary's resulting certification thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b648\n   <em>\n    4. Whether the District Court erroneously invalidated 87 signatures due to noncompliance with \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b649 The essential purpose of \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, is to ensure that previously unqualified political parties qualify for ballot access only upon the knowing request of the requisite numbers of confirmed registered voters in the requisite number of Montana counties. To that end, \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, expressly and by direct and indirect incorporation, specifies precise procedures and standards for compliance by signature gatherers and the citizen petitioners (i.e., petition signatories). Section \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, similarly imposes precise procedures and standards for administration of the overall process by local county administrators and the secretary of state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b650 Contrary to the Secretary's assertion that the District Court arbitrarily applied standards having no basis in law, the court merely and quite simply applied the precise legal standards prescribed by the Legislature and, in turn, by the secretary of state's conforming petition form pursuant to the Legislature's command. Section 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA, clearly and unequivocally provides that political parties may qualify for ballot eligibility by \"presenting a petition,\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    a form prescribed by the secretary of state\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) Here, the Secretary's prescribed petition form clearly and unequivocally requires each signatory to provide four basic items of simple information-a printed last name (with first and middle initials), a personal signature, the signature date, and either a telephone number or a residential or post office address. The form expressly directed and warned that signatories must \"sign the person's name and list the person's address\n   or telephone number\n   <em>\n    in substantially the same manner as on the person's voter registration card or the signature will not be counted\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b651 The Legislature did not charge the secretary of state to prescribe an appropriate petition form in a vacuum. By manifest implication, the Legislature intended that the prescribed form correspond to the statutory qualifications specified and incorporated by reference in \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. Not surprisingly, the information requested by the secretary-prescribed form at issue directly corresponds with the statutory standards and requirements referenced in \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2) and 13-27-302 to -306, MCA. The signature field on the form corresponds with the signature requirement of \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(b), MCA. The form requirement and warning that signatories must sign in substantially the same manner as on the signer's voter registration form corresponds with the genuineness standard specified by \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-303(1) and 13-27-103, MCA, as respectively expressly and indirectly incorporated by reference in \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA. The form requirement for a printed name and address or phone number corresponds with and crucially aids in the county voter list verification required by \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c) and 13-27-303(1), MCA. The petition form signature date requirement corresponds with the affidavit requirement of \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c) and 13-27-302, MCA. To the extent conforming to \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2), 13-27-302 to -306, and -103, MCA, the prescribed petition form has the effect of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), 13-1-201, 13-1-202(1)(a), (2), (3), MCA (requiring compliance with prescribed petition form, delegation of form prescription authority to secretary of state, and binding effect of secretary directives and forms on county election administrators). The Secretary does not challenge on appeal the conformance of his prescribed petition form to corresponding statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b652 As an added safeguard to the integrity of the process, \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c) and 13-27-302, MCA, require each signature gatherer to attest that he or she personally \"gathered the signatures\" on the attached petition sheet \"on the stated dates.\" Section 13-27-302, MCA further requires each signature gatherer to also attest that he or she believes in good faith that: (1) the gathered signatures \"are genuine\"; (2) the signatures are the \"signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be\"; (3) the signatures \"are the signatures of Montana electors who are registered at the address or have the telephone number following the person's signature\"; and (4) \"that the signers knew the contents of the petition before signing the petition.\" The required circulation affidavits aid in assuring signature authenticity,\n   protecting against fraudulent or duplicate signatures, and protecting against fraudulent signature gathering practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), 13-27-302, 13-27-303(1), 13-27-303(3), MCA. These statutory requirements are far more than mere technicalities or formalities-they are simple, narrowly-tailored requirements manifestly deemed by the Legislature to be essential to the integrity of the political party ballot eligibility process and, by extension, to the integrity of elections in Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b653 Here, the District Court invalidated 36 signatures from six legislative districts due to noncompliance with \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c) and 13-27-302, MCA, based on the adjudicated fact that the purported signature gatherer (Skye Robert Berns) submitted circulation affidavits falsely attesting that he personally gathered those signatures. The supporting evidence included 15 petition signature sheets submitted under circulation affidavits executed by Berns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part, the Berns signature sheets\n   included the subject 36 signatures from six Montana legislative districts-District 43 (one signature), District 54 (ten signatures), District 56 (two signatures), District 80 (eight signatures), District 83 (nine signatures), and District 84 (six signatures). In the attached circulation affidavits, Berns attested that he personally gathered the signatures submitted on those sheets. One of the Berns signature sheets included the separate signatures of Thai Nguyen and Dana Toole. Nguyen and Toole separately testified that they each signed the petition at the Helena Public Library on February 24, 2018, upon the request of a female signature gatherer. Nguyen testified that the female signature gatherer identified herself as Hannah Rose Kuntz. Nguyen and Toole testified further that Kuntz was the only person collecting signatures at that location at the time and that she was unaccompanied. Nguyen further testified that he observed Kuntz in possession of multiple petition signature sheets bearing signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b654 Hannah Rose Kuntz was not an affiant, or otherwise referenced, on any circulation affidavit submitted in support of the Green Party petition. Neither Berns nor Kuntz testified before the District Court. Neither the Secretary nor the Green Party presented any evidence rebutting the testimony of Nguyen or Toole. Nor did either of them present any other evidence corroborating Berns's affidavit assertions\n   that he personally gathered the subject signatures as attested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Substantial record evidence thus supports the District Court's finding that Berns falsely attested that he gathered the signatures included on the signature sheet signed by Nguyen and Toole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b655 The Secretary nonetheless asserts that the fact that Berns falsely attested to gathering the signatures on the sheet signed by Nguyen and Toole is insufficient alone to prove that he similarly falsely attested to gathering the signatures on the other sheets submitted under his name. We agree, but additional evidence supported the District Court's finding. It is unrebutted on the hearing record that, at the time Nguyen signed the petition at the request of Hannah Rose Kuntz, Kuntz was in possession of multiple petition signature sheets bearing signatures-not just the sheet signed by Nguyen and Toole. In the manifest absence of any contrary evidence presented by the Secretary or the Green Party, the unrebutted evidence that Berns falsely attested that he gathered the signatures included on the signature sheet signed by Nguyen and Toole and the similarly unrebutted evidence that Kuntz was then in possession of multiple petition signature sheets bearing signatures were together minimally sufficient to support a reasonable inference by the finder of fact that Berns similarly did not personally gather any of the signatures submitted under his circulation affidavits. The fact that such inference was not necessary or the only inference that the record would have supported does not render the inference unsupported by substantial evidence. The Secretary has further not shown that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence of record. Nor are we left, upon our review of the record, with a firm conviction that the District Court was otherwise mistaken. On the limited evidentiary record in this case, we hold that the District Court's finding that Berns falsely attested to personally gathering the subject signatures was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b656 The District Court invalidated an additional 31 signatures from eight legislative districts on the ground that they were not substantially similar to the signatures on the purported signatories' voter registration forms as required by the secretary of state's signature sheet form and \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), (c), and\n   13-27-303(1), MCA. As described by the District Court, the supporting evidence included unrebutted evidence that the signatures certified as valid by the Secretary included 31 signature entries that had a similarly printed name in both the \"printed name\" and \"signature\" columns on the signature sheets. It is further unrebutted on the hearing record that, in each case, the printed\n   name in the petition sheet \"signature\" field was substantially different from the \"cursive\" or \"distinctive, stylized script\" signature used on the purported signatory's official voter registration form. As asserted by the Secretary, Montana law does not presently prohibit a registered voter from using a printed name, rather than a cursive or distinctive stylized script, for his or her personal signature for voter registration or other legal purposes. The Secretary further correctly points out that, contrary to the reference in the District Court's order, \u00a7 13-10-502(1), MCA (required signature sheet format for petitions to nominate independent candidates) has no application to political party ballot eligibility petitions under \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. However, the Secretary's peculiar assertion that the District Court erroneously \"elevated\" the Secretary's own \"petition form ... above statutory requirements\" disregards that \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA, expressly requires that political party ballot eligibility petitions be submitted on the form prescribed by the secretary of state. Even more significantly, the Secretary's assertion further disregards the underlying requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-103 and -303(1), MCA, as respectively directly and indirectly incorporated into \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA, clearly requiring petition signatories to sign \"in substantially the same manner as on th[eir] voter registration form.\" We hold that \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), (c), and 13-27-303(1), MCA, require petition signatories to sign \"in substantially the same manner as on th[eir] voter registration form\" and that the District Court's finding that 31 signatures from eight legislative districts did not comply with that requirement was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b657 The District Court invalidated an additional six signatures from three legislative districts on the ground that the petition sheet signature entries did not match the names of registered voters in those districts as required by \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(b), (c), and 13-27-303(1), MCA. The Secretary does not dispute on appeal that \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(b), (c), and 13-27-303(1), MCA, require that the name of the purported signatory on each signature sheet match the name of a registered voter on the official registered voters list for the corresponding county. The question of whether the name of a purported petition signatory matches the name of a registered voter on the official registered voter\n   list for the corresponding county is a question of fact. Finding of fact number 25 sets forth six names as they appeared on petition signature sheets and states on what basis they did not match names on the registered voter list for the county corresponding to the referenced legislative districts. The District Court's finding is supported by the subject petition sheets and registered voter lists for the counties corresponding to the referenced legislative districts. We hold that the District Court did not erroneously invalidate six signature entries on the ground that the listed names did not match the names of registered voters in the subject districts as required by \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(b), (c), and 13-27-303(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b658 The District Court invalidated an additional nine signatures from four legislative districts on the ground that they did not bear correct or correctly altered signing dates as required by \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA. Without mention of the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), (c), and 13-27-302, MCA, the Secretary again asserts that the District Court \"elevate[d] form over substance\" where \"the Political Party Qualification statute contains no such requirement.\" However, \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA, expressly requires submission of political party qualification petitions on the petition form prescribed by the secretary of state. The prescribed form expressly requires specification of the signature date for each signature. The signature date requirement on the form corresponds to and implements the express requirement of \u00a7 13-27-302, MCA, as incorporated by express reference into \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA, for sworn attestation that the signature gatherer personally \"gathered the signatures on\" each submitted signature sheet \"on the stated dates.\" The District Court found that nine petition entries certified as valid by the Secretary either included no signature date, \"a date that postdate[d] the notarization date of the signature gather affidavit, or a date altered without the signer's initials.\" Whether the subject petition sheets contained the signature date for each\n   signature as required by the prescribed petition form and circulation affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a) and (c), MCA, was a question of fact. It is unrebutted on the evidentiary record that the nine referenced petition entries either included no signature date, \"a date that postdate[d] the notarization date of the signature gatherer affidavit, or a date altered without the signer's initials.\" We hold that the District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, requires a correct signature date for each petition signature and that the District Court's finding of fact that nine of the subject petition signatures lacked correct signature dates was not clearly erroneous.\n   \u00b659 The District Court finally invalidated an additional five signatures from four legislative districts on the ground that they did not include a printed name as required by \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA. Section 13-10-601(2)(a), MCA, expressly requires submission of political party qualification petitions on a petition form prescribed by the secretary of state. The prescribed form expressly requires a printed name for each signature. The printed name requirement corresponds with and crucially aids in the county voter list verification required by \u00a7 13-27-303(1), MCA, as incorporated by reference in \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA. The District Court found that five petition entries certified as valid by the Secretary included no printed name. The Secretary did not challenge that finding on appeal. We hold that the District Court correctly concluded \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, requires a printed name on each petition sheet corresponding to each signature and that the District Court's finding of fact that five of the subject petition signatures lacked a corresponding printed name was not clearly erroneous. In sum, we hold that the District Court did not erroneously invalidate 87 signatures gathered from eight separate legislative districts as invalid due to noncompliance with \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b660\n   <em>\n    5. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Kevin J. Hamilton to represent Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   pro hac vice?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b661 The Secretary asserts that Plaintiffs failed to show good cause for admission of an out-of-state lawyer to serve as their co-counsel in this matter. A non-resident lawyer not licensed to practice law in Montana but licensed and in good standing to practice in the highest court of another state may appear and practice law in a Montana court or administrative proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   upon: (1) written application and fee to the State Bar of Montana; (2) certification of qualification by the State Bar; and (3) leave of the presiding court or agency. Rule VI, Rules for Admission to the Bar of Montana. However, absent a showing of good cause, an attorney or firm may not appear\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   in more than two Montana actions or proceedings. Rule VI(C), Rules for Admission to the Bar of Montana. As a non-exclusive example, \"good cause\" includes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a showing that the attorney or firm seeking to appear\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   possesses experience or expertise not commonly available\" in the membership of the State Bar of Montana or \"where the attorney or firm is acting as counsel in a multistate class action.\" Rule VI(C), Rules for Admission to the Bar of Montana. Montana courts have broad discretion to grant or deny\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   motions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Konitz v.

Hamilton was subject to the good cause requirement of Rule VI(C), Rules for Admission to the Bar of Montana. Moreover, the Secretary validly objected that Plaintiffs already had highly competent and experienced Montana counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that out-of-state counsel was not\n   essential because this litigation exclusively involved relatively non-complex issues of Montana election law. On appeal, the Secretary further validly asserts and objects that Plaintiffs failed to show, and the District Court failed to find, any rationale indicating on what basis good cause existed to allow Hamilton to make his eighth appearance in Montana proceedings under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b663 Admission\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   does not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   require a showing in every case that the subject matter at issue either involves expertise of a type otherwise unavailable or not commonly available among the membership of the State Bar of Montana, or even beyond that of a party's existing Montana counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule VI(C), Rules for Admission to the Bar of Montana. However, Rule VI(C) nonetheless expressly requires some affirmative showing-and implicitly a court or agency finding-of good cause for the requested\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hac vice\n   </em>\n   admission. Here, the District Court summarily granted Plaintiffs' contested\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   motion without any finding, rationale, or elaboration whatsoever. Moreover, based on our review of the record and the subject matter at issue, we can conceive of no manifest rationale upon which the District Court likely overruled the Secretary's objection and granted the motion. In this void, it appears that the District Court routinely granted the motion contrary to Rule VI(C). Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in summarily granting Plaintiffs' motion to admit Kevin J. Hamilton\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b664 The Secretary has nonetheless failed to show how the erroneous admission of Hamilton prejudiced the merits or presentation of the Secretary's case or opposition to the Plaintiffs' case. Nor is any such prejudice manifest on our review of the record. At the end of the day, the applicable law was the law, the evidentiary facts presented were the evidentiary facts presented, and all parties were represented by able counsel. We have no basis upon which to conclude that the error prejudiced the Secretary or resulted in any fundamental unfairness in the proceeding. Under the circumstances in this case, we hold that the erroneous admission of Hamilton\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   was not reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b665 We hold that Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the legal sufficiency of the Green Party petition, and the Secretary's resulting certification thereof, stated a cognizable claim for relief. We hold that Plaintiffs' claim did not involve a non-justiciable political question. We hold further that the Montana Democratic Party had legal standing to challenge the validity of the Green Party ballot eligibility petition and the Secretary's resulting certification thereof. We hold that the District Court did not erroneously invalidate 87 signatures gathered from eight separate legislative districts as invalid due to noncompliance with \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA. Finally, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in summarily granting Plaintiffs' motion to admit Kevin J.

There exists neither an express nor an implied private right of action to challenge the county election administrator's\n   verification of signatures on minor political party primary election qualification petitions (Primary Election Petitions). Further, the Court's decision disenfranchises over 1,500 qualified electors who voted for Green Party candidates in the June 5, 2018 primary election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Montana Secretary of State,\n   <em>\n    2018 Statewide Primary Election Canvass\n   </em>\n   , https://perma.cc/ABP8-4BW7. I would have found the District Court in error and reversed its decision that removed the Green Party from the election ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b668 The major political parties in Montana automatically qualify to hold a primary election. Section 13-10-601(1), MCA. If a minor political party-such as the Green Party-wishes to hold a primary election, it must follow a specific statutory procedure that consists of gathering registered voter signatures on Primary Election Petitions. Section 13-10-601(2), MCA. Similarly, signatures may be gathered in support of various ballot issues, such as initiatives, referendums, or constitutional amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-1-101(6)(a), MCA ; \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-101, -301, MCA. While both processes require signature gathering, primary elections are governed by Title 13, chapter 10, MCA (Chapter 10), whereas ballot issues are governed by Title 13, chapter 27, MCA (Chapter 27). That distinction is crucial here because Chapter 27 grants a qualified elector the right to challenge ballot issue signatures while Chapter 10 does not contain a similar private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b669 Preliminary, it is important to distinguish between a ballot issue and a minor political party's request to hold a primary election. A ballot issue is \"a proposal submitted to the people at an election for their approval or rejection, including but not limited to an initiative, referendum, proposed constitutional amendment, recall question, school levy question, bond issue question, or ballot question.\" Section 13-1-101(6)(a), MCA. A minor political party's request to hold a primary election is not an \"issue\" or a \"proposal submitted to the people at an election for their approval or rejection\"-it is a minor political party's request to present its candidates as a choice to the electorate in the primary election. Thus, it is not a \"ballot issue\" subject to the general provisions of Chapter 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b670 Chapter 10 does, however, implicate specific statutes in Chapter 27 regarding the signature verification process. Section 13-10-601(2)(b), MCA, requires a minor political party to collect a certain number of registered voter signatures on Primary Election Petitions. Once complete, the minor political party must submit the Primary Election Petitions to the county election administrator. Section 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA. The county election administrator then verifies the Primary Election Petitions and accompanying affidavits of circulation pursuant\n   to the procedure outlined in Chapter 27, \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-303 to -306, MCA. Section 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b671 Section 13-27-303, MCA, sets forth an extensive signature verification process. When an election administrator receives the Primary Election Petitions, he must check the names of all signers to verify that they are registered electors of the county. Section 13-27-303(1), MCA. Furthermore, he must randomly select signatures from each sheet or section and compare them with the signatures of the electors as they appear in the registration records. Section 13-27-303(1), MCA. If the randomly selected signatures appear genuine, the election administrator may certify all signatures on the sheet or section to the secretary of state. Section 13-27-303(1), MCA. However, if any of the randomly selected signatures do not appear genuine, the election administrator must compare all signatures on the sheet or section. Section 13-27-303(1), MCA. If the election administrator discovers fraudulent or duplicate signatures, he may submit the name of the elector or the signature gatherer, or both, to the county attorney for investigation. Section 13-27-303(3), MCA. Once the election administrator verifies the signatures, he forwards\n   the petitions to the secretary of state. Section 13-27-304, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b672 While county election administrators verify signatures on Primary Election Petitions in the same manner as they verify signatures on ballot issue petitions, \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, only expressly references five Chapter 27 statutes: \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-302 to -306, MCA. Section 13-10-601(2), MCA, expressly references \u00a7 13-27-306, MCA, which provides a registered elector with the right to request the county election administrator compare signatures he did not previously compare. If any of those signatures are not genuine, the election administrator must compare all of the signatures on that sheet or section. Section 13-27-306, MCA. Section 13-27-306, MCA, does not, however, provide an elector with the ability to challenge signatures the election administrator already compared and approved. And that makes practical sense-time is of the essence before primary elections, and at some point ballot access must be cut off to ensure the state has enough time to prepare the primary election ballots. This statutorily-specified administrative review process provides ballot access to minor political parties while still enabling the state to regulate elections to the extent necessary to effectuate timely primary elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b673 As far as ballot issues are concerned, \u00a7 13-27-317(1), MCA, provides a qualified elector with the right to \"file an action in the district court ... contesting the certification of a ballot issue for illegal\n   petition signatures or an erroneous or fraudulent count or canvass of petition signatures.\" If the district court \"finds that illegal petition signatures or an erroneous or fraudulent count or canvass of petition signatures affected the outcome of the petition process and certification, the secretary of state shall decertify the contested ballot issue.\" Section 13-27-317(2), MCA. Section 13-27-317(1), MCA, provides a\n   <em>\n    qualified\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    elector\n   </em>\n   -not just anyone and certainly not a major political party such as the Montana Democratic Party-with the opportunity to challenge the signatures and petitions in support of a\n   <em>\n    ballot issue\n   </em>\n   in district court. Chapter 10 does not similarly provide a qualified elector with the right to challenge Primary Election Petitions, nor does it expressly incorporate \u00a7 13-27-317, MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-601 to -604, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b674 The fact that the Legislature provided qualified electors with the right to challenge ballot issue signatures and petitions, \u00a7 13-27-317, MCA, but not Primary Election Petition signatures and petitions, highlights the fact that it could have, but chose not to. A registered elector may request that the county election administrator examine Primary Election Petition signatures not previously reviewed, \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA (expressly incorporating \u00a7 13-27-306, MCA ), but the Legislature did not expressly provide any other challenge to Primary Election Petition signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b675 Because there is no express private right of action to support Plaintiffs' claim, I next ask whether there is an implied private right of action. In determining whether a statutory scheme implies a private right of action, this Court frequently asks four questions: (1) Is the interpretation consistent with the statute as a whole?; (2) Does the interpretation reflect the intent of the Legislature considering the plain language of the statute?; (3) Is the interpretation reasonable so as to avoid absurd results?; and (4) Has the agency charged with the administration of the statute placed a construction on the statute?\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ibsen,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49 ;\n   <em>\n    Wombold\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b676 Applying the four factors to this case leads me to the conclusion that Chapter 10 does not imply a private right of action. First, interpreting \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, as implying a private right of action is inconsistent with the statute as a whole. Section 13-10-601(2), MCA, expressly incorporates \u00a7 13-27-303, MCA, which provides that the county election administrator may submit the names of suspected wrongdoers to the county attorney for investigation. The county attorney may then pursue any violations under the state's election laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-27-303(3), MCA (citing \u00a7 13-27-106, MCA (unsworn falsification or tampering with public records or information);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00a7 13-35-207, MCA (deceptive election practices) ). Because the statutes provide the county attorney with the exclusive right to investigate and pursue suspected wrongdoing, an implied private cause of\n   action is inconsistent with the statutory scheme as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibsen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b677 Second, considering the statute's plain language, interpreting \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, to imply a private cause of action does not reflect the Legislature's intent. As discussed above, \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, only references five select statutes in Chapter 27, and Primary Election Petitions are not \"ballot issues\" subject to Chapter 27 generally. The Legislature clearly intended to limit the extent Chapter 10 incorporated Chapter 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b678 Third, Plaintiffs' contention and the Court's conclusion that the county election administrators' verification of signatures on Primary Election Petitions may be challenged in district court is unreasonable because it effectuates absurd results. The statutes must be closely followed considering the short time period-85 days-between when the county election administrators must certify Primary Election Petitions to the secretary of state and the date of the primary election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(d), MCA. At some point, the State must print primary election ballots and electors must be able to rely upon the legitimacy of the options presented to them on the ballot. The District Court's entertainment of Plaintiffs' claims and subsequent post-election invalidation of the Green Party's Primary Election Petitions is unreasonable and leads to an absurd result considering it nullified, post-election, over 1,500 qualified electors' votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b679 Fourth, \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, and the five Chapter 27 statutes to which it references, \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-302 to -306, MCA, vest county election administrators with full discretion to review, compare, and verify Primary Election Petition signatures. The record in this case demonstrates that county election administrators take this task seriously and diligently compare signatures, invalidating them when necessary. For example, Cascade County election administrators rejected 580 of 1,783 submitted signatures; Lewis &amp; Clark County election administrators rejected 428 of 1,526 submitted signatures; and Yellowstone County election administrators rejected 751 of 2,798 submitted signatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b680 Review of the four factors leads me to the conclusion that no implied private right of action exists for a qualified elector, or any other entity, to challenge the county election administrator's verification of Primary Election Petition signatures. The Court's holding otherwise is inconsistent with Montana's statutory scheme, and it is especially concerning because it disenfranchises over 1,500\n   qualified electors who voted for Green Party candidates in the June 5, 2018 primary election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b681 Qualified electors possess a \"constitutional right to vote and to have their votes counted.\"\n   <em>\n    Wesberry v.

The Green Party's supporters complied with \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA, and demonstrated a \"modicum of voter support\" backing up its request to have a ballot in the primary election. The District Court erred by invalidating the petitions and election results-there exists no way for a qualified elector or other entity to challenge the county election administrators' signature verification of the Green Party's\n   Primary Election Petitions through a declaratory action in the courts. The Legislature, by\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   including \u00a7 13-27-317, MCA, as a method of challenging Primary Election Petition signatures, limited a qualified elector's challenge to requesting the county election administrator compare previously un-compared signatures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA (expressly incorporating \u00a7 13-27-306, MCA ). If the county election administrator discovers fraudulent or duplicate signatures, he may, in turn, submit the name of the elector, the signature gatherer, or both, to the county attorney for investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-10-601(2)(c), MCA (expressly incorporating \u00a7 13-27-303(3), MCA ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b683 Montana's Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act gives a party whose rights are affected by a statute the right to seek a court's determination of any question of the statute's construction or validity\n   and obtain a declaration of rights thereunder. Section 27-8-202, MCA. Plaintiffs filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief asking the District Court to review the county election administrators' verification of certain signatures on the Green Party's Primary Election Petitions and declare the petitions invalid. Based on my conclusion that Chapter 10 confers neither an express nor implied private right of action in the courts, which is dispositive in this case, I would conclude the District Court should have denied Plaintiffs' request for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b684 The Court views \u00a7 13-35-108, MCA, which provides that a district court may order an injunction \"[i]n any action brought under the election laws of this state,\" as \"a broadly applicable remedy expressly provided by the Legislature for enforcement of the provisions of Title 13, MCA.\" Opinion, \u00b6 32. The Court overstates the statute's applicability, however, because there must first be an \"action brought under the election laws of this state\" before \u00a7 13-35-108, MCA, applies and provides a district court with injunctive power. Because Plaintiffs have not pled a cognizable right of action under Montana's election laws, \u00a7 13-35-108, MCA, is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b685 The Legislature provided clear instruction regarding permissible challenges to Primary Election Petition signatures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-10-601(2), MCA (expressly incorporating \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-302 to -306, MCA ). The Legislature's review process is reasonable given that the responsibility of ensuring the authenticity of a particular signature is best left with the county election administrator in possession of the electors' signature cards; the election administrator may request a county attorney investigate suspected fraudulent signatures; and the review process must be practical given the expedited time requirements for securing ballot access in primary elections. The review process necessarily focuses on the signatures' authenticity, which is at the heart of the issue, and not the signature gathering process itself. Most importantly, however, the review provided by the Legislature in Chapter 10 protects against a post-election disenfranchisement of qualified electors' constitutional right to vote. In contrast to the extensive and exhaustive review process that the Court allows, the Legislature's localized review ensures the signatures are authentic and also protects against a post-election disenfranchisement of the constitutional right to vote. The Court's decision unnecessarily and unconstitutionally denies over 1,500 qualified electors their right to vote and supplants a statutory scheme that protects against disenfranchisement while preserving the fairness and integrity of the electoral process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b686 The Court overreaches by permitting judicial review of county election administrators' verification of Primary Election Petition signatures when the Legislature has specifically provided for a method of review that does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include judicial oversight. It is of utmost importance, particularly when it comes to contests such as the one at issue here, that this Court carefully follow the relevant statutes to avoid judicial overreach into matters the Legislature deemed best suited for an administrative review process. Significantly, the parties did not challenge the minor political party qualification statutes or the method of review provided therein. Those statutes do not allow a challenge to the process of gathering signatures on Primary Election Petitions, but rather are designed\n   to ensure signatures' authenticity by instructing county election administrators to compare signatures with filed registration cards. The District Court's decision declaring the Green Party's Primary Election Petitions invalid and removing the Green Party from the ballot should have been reversed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
