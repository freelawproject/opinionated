J.\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The primary question in this case is whether defendant is judicially estopped from setting aside a default judgment that, he contends, resulted from improper service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found that, even if service were improper, defendant knew about the default judgment shortly after it was entered and used it to his benefit in two judicial proceedings. The trial court ruled that, in those circumstances, defendant waited too long to set it aside. The Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion. It reasoned that the default judgment was void; as a result, neither the passage of time nor other circumstances barred defendant from seeking to set the judgment aside.\n   <em>\n    Shriners Hospitals for Children v. Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186441\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/280/127/\">\n    280 Or.App. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186441\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/280/127/\">\n    380 P.3d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). We allowed Shriners' petition for review to consider that question. Because we conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, defendant was judicially estopped from setting the default judgment aside, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand this case to the Court of Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shriners brought this action against defendant to collect on a note and obtained a default judgment against him. Shriners' argument that defendant is judicially estopped from moving to set aside the default judgment is based on Shriners' claim that defendant used the default judgment to his advantage in two other judicial proceedings: a dissolution action between defendant and his wife and a malpractice action that defendant brought against one of his lawyers in the dissolution proceeding. In setting out the facts, we first describe the note that defendant signed and the initial phase of the dissolution proceeding. We then describe Shriners' action to collect the note and the default judgment, which occurred midway through the dissolution proceeding. We turn next to defendant's use of the default\n   judgment in the dissolution proceeding and the later malpractice action. Finally, we describe Shriners' efforts to garnish the proceeds of the malpractice action and defendant's\n   motion to set aside the default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During defendant's marriage, his wife borrowed $ 137,000 from her aunt and used the money to improve property that she and defendant had purchased. On December 7, 2001, defendant signed a note to repay the loan, which was unsecured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2002, defendant and his wife filed an action to dissolve their marriage. That action resulted in a dissolution judgment in 2004, a successful appeal by defendant, and a remand for a new trial in 2006.\n   <em>\n    Woods and Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451447\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/207/452/\">\n    207 Or.App. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451447\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/207/452/\">\n    142 P.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

Also, by November 2007, defendant's note had been assigned to Shriners, the note was approximately five years overdue, and Shriners filed this action to collect the principal and interest due under the note. Shriners filed an affidavit of service in the collection action. In the affidavit, the process server stated under penalty of perjury that he had personally served a copy of the summons and complaint on defendant on November 28, 2007. Defendant did not appear in the collection action, and the trial court entered a default judgment against defendant on January 3, 2008. The default judgment established the amount that defendant owed on the note and the rate of interest and awarded Shriners court costs and attorney fees. Additionally, interest began\n   accruing on the attorney fees and court costs at a higher rate than on the amount owed under the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 3, 2008, the day that the default judgment was entered, defendant's attorney (Renshaw) called Shriners' attorney (Grant), who was not able to take Renshaw's call. Grant returned Renshaw's call on Monday, January 7, 2008, but was not able to reach him. Later that day, Grant received a voice mail message personally from defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 10, 2008, a week after the default judgment was entered, Grant mailed a demand for payment of the judgment with interrogatories to defendant, return receipt requested, and copied Renshaw with those documents. On January 11, defendant personally signed the return receipt showing that he had received the demand to pay the judgment and the interrogatories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 14, 2008, Grant and Renshaw discussed \"the payment of the judgment as well as the inability of the defendant Mack Woods to set aside the Default Order and Judgment for lack of a meritorious defense.\" Later that month, Renshaw asked Grant to postpone enforcing the judgment until the remand hearing on the dissolution proceeding had concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the remand hearing, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment in the dissolution proceeding. The supplemental judgment divided the proceeds of the sale of the marital property equally between defendant and his wife. The supplemental judgment also treated the debt represented by defendant's note and reduced to a judgment in Shriners' collection action as a marital debt. Specifically, the supplemental judgment divided the debt, \"all accrued pre- and post-judgment interest and the award of attorney fees and costs in the money award\" equally between defendant and his wife. The supplemental judgment provided that each party's obligation under the default judgment would be reduced by the proceeds from the sale of another parcel of land that they owned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was unhappy with the first attorney (Hill) who had represented him in the dissolution proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant retained a third and later a fourth attorney, who pursued a malpractice action against Hill for, among other things, failing to file a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   during the dissolution proceeding. Defendant took the position in the malpractice action that, if Hill had filed a notice of\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   , defendant's wife would not have been able to sell the marital home without the proceeds of the sale being used to pay off defendant's note to the aunt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woods v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217413\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/248/514/#p518\">\n    248 Or.App. at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217413\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/248/514/#p518\">\n    273 P.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A jury found that Hill had committed malpractice, and defendant used the default judgment, plus accrued interest, to establish his damages. Specifically, defendant's attorney told the jury that \"our calculation on the Shriner's judgment was damages of $ 221,000-$ 221,106.97,\" and he argued that the jury should hold Hill responsible for those and other damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury agreed. It found that defendant's damages were $ 274,000, which were reduced to $ 180,840 as a result of defendant's comparative negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2013, Shriners sought to garnish the proceeds from the malpractice action to satisfy its default judgment against defendant. In response, defendant moved to set aside the default judgment under ORCP 71 B(1). In support of his motion, defendant submitted a sworn declaration in which he stated that he had been out of town on November 28, 2007, and, as a result, had not been personally served with a copy of the summons and complaint on that date. His declaration then stated: \"At the time I believed that Mr. Renshaw [his attorney in the dissolution proceeding] was handling the Shriners' situation and would take care of the matter for me. I did not find out that he had done nothing on the case until much later discovering that a default judgment had been entered against me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Given those facts, defendant argued that the default judgment was void and unenforceable. Alternatively, he\n   argued that, if the court did not set aside the default judgment, equity required that the judgment be modified to correspond with the dissolution judgment, which had divided the obligations established by the default judgment equally between defendant and his former wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In considering defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment, the trial court did not resolve whether defendant had, in fact, been personally served with the summons and complaint on November 28, 2007. It did find, however, that defendant \"was personally aware of this case in January, 2008.\" Specifically, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Defendant Woods' ORCP 71 B motions do not depend on whether he was personally served with the Summons and Complaint on November 28, 2007. He was personally aware of this case in January, 2008. It was an issue in both his divorce case and his malpractice case. Woods' motion now is not reasonably timely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Having denied defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment, the trial court ordered that the proceeds from the malpractice action be used to satisfy the default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On defendant's appeal, the Court of Appeals vacated the trial court's order and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, if defendant had not been personally served, the default judgment was \"void.\" The court noted that, although ORCP 71(B)(1) provides that motions to set aside some judgments must be made within a \"reasonable time,\" \" 'there is no timeliness requirement for moving to set aside a void judgment.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Shriners Hospitals for Children\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186441\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/280/127/\">\n    280 Or.App. at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186441\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/280/127/\">\n    380 P.3d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Estate of Selmar A.

It remanded the case for the\n   trial court to resolve whether defendant had, in fact, been personally served on November 28, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On review, Shriners does not argue that defendant failed to move to set the default judgment aside within a reasonable time, and we do not consider that issue. Rather, the primary issue, as the parties frame it, is whether defendant can be judicially estopped from moving to set aside a default judgment entered without proper service. As we understand defendant's argument on that issue, it rests on the following syllogism. This court has held that a judgment entered by a court that lacks subject matter jurisdiction is \"void\" and that a party to the judgment cannot be judicially estopped from setting it aside. Defendant notes that a judgment entered as a result of improper service also has been described as \"void.\" It follows, defendant concludes, that a party to a judgment entered as a result of improper service cannot be judicially estopped from setting aside that judgment either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In our view, defendant places too much significance on the generic label \"void\" without asking whether the reasons for attaching that label to a judgment matter. As explained below, the reasons for holding a judgment entered without subject matter jurisdiction void lead to the conclusion that a party will not be judicially estopped from later seeking to set it aside. However, as courts and commentators have recognized, a different conclusion follows when a judgment is void because service was improper. In those circumstances, they have recognized that a party may be estopped. We first explain why the various reasons that a judgment may be labeled as void will affect whether a party may be estopped from setting it aside. We then explain why we conclude that, in light of the trial court's factual findings, defendant was estopped from setting aside the default judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"**\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Garrett, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Woods, the defendant in this case, died after the Court of Appeals issued its decision.

We note, as an initial matter, that defendant's attorney (Renshaw) expressly accepted the validity of the default judgment in his discussions with Shriners' attorney (Grant). The trial court reasonably could have found on this record that, when Renshaw spoke with Grant on January 14, 2008, Renshaw acknowledged \"the inability of the defendant Mack Woods to set aside the Default Order and Judgment for lack of a meritorious defense.\" Renshaw was defendant's agent and, as such, had authority to bind defendant in discussing matters within his authority-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , in discussing Shriners' claims against defendant.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Beyond that, defendant affirmatively treated the default judgment as valid when he used it to establish the damages that, he argued, flowed from his former lawyer's malpractice. Defendant did not merely acknowledge the default judgment's existence; he implicitly acknowledged its\n    validity when he asked the jury to rely on it to determine the extent to which his former attorney's failure to file a notice of\n    <em>\n     lis pendens\n    </em>\n    had damaged him. Defendant cannot assert that the judgment is an accurate measure of some or all of the damages that he sustained as a result of a third party's actions without implicitly acknowledging its validity. Nor can it be said that the default judgment was merely a proxy for defendant's obligations under the note. Not only did the default judgment conclusively establish those obligations (and remove the possibility of any defenses to the enforcement of the note), but it imposed additional obligations that were only inchoate in the note. The judgment included attorney fees, court costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest. To put the point simply, defendant's obligations under the note were repayment of $ 137,000 plus accrued interest; by defendant's own calculation in the malpractice action, his obligation under the judgment exceeded $ 221,000.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Defendant's use of the default judgment in the malpractice action is difficult to distinguish from the first illustration in section 66 of the\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    . That illustration states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    \"A brings an action against B for settlement of accounts and division of property jointly owned by them. Inadequate notice is given to B. Judgment by default is entered, of which B becomes aware. In a subsequent negotiation with C, B describes his interest in the property by reference to the terms of the judgment. This may be regarded as a sufficient manifestation by B of an intention to treat the division of property by the judgment as binding on him.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 66 illustration 1. Using the default judgment to establish some or all the damages that a third party owes him was a stronger manifestation of defendant's intention to treat the judgment as binding on him than B's description of his property in the illustration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We also conclude that granting defendant relief in this case \"would impair another person's substantial interest of reliance on the judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 66(2). As noted above, the parties have framed the issue in this case as one of judicial estoppel. Specifically, Shriners has argued, and we agree, that (1) defendant received a benefit in his\n    malpractice claim (he recovered damages that he measured by reference to the default judgment); (2) this proceeding is a different proceeding from the malpractice action; and (3) defendant has taken inconsistent positions in the two proceedings.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hampton Tree Farms, Inc. v.

It is the court's reliance that the doctrine protects. In this case, the trial court and the jury in the malpractice action (to say nothing of Hill and Hill's insurer) relied on defendant's implicit assertion that the default judgment was a valid measure of the damages that flowed from Hill's malpractice. Defendant can hardly rely on the default judgment in the malpractice action to establish that he owes Shriners the principal amount of the loan, pre- and post-judgment interest, and the attorney fees that Shriners incurred in suing on the note and then seek to have the default judgment set aside to avoid paying Shriners the very funds that he told the court, the jury, and Hill he owed Shriners.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    We summarize our conclusions briefly. Other courts have recognized that judicial estoppel can prevent a party from setting aside a default judgment entered without proper service. We agree with those decisions. We also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, judicial estoppel prevents defendant from seeking to set aside the default judgment. We accordingly reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand the case to the Court of Appeals so that it can consider the issues that it did not decide initially.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
