In the companion criminal case, the prosecution asserted that a gap in the chain of custody of Mr. Casiano's blood samples rendered blood alcohol content (BAC) test results inadmissible. The municipal court dismissed the criminal charges without prejudice and without reference to the chain of custody issue. The question presented here is whether collateral estoppel bars the OAH from considering Mr. Casiano's BAC test results in the license suspension proceeding. We conclude that collateral estoppel does not apply and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Mr. Casiano asserts one issue which we rephrase:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Does the prosecutor's assertion in the criminal driving while under the influence (DWUI) case, that Mr. Casiano's BAC test results were inadmissible, collaterally estop the OAH from considering those same test results in the license suspension proceeding?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] The facts in this case are undisputed. On September 29, 2016, Cheyenne Police Officer Hall arrested Mr. Casiano for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Officer Hall obtained a search warrant for a blood draw pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-6-102\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-6-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (LexisNexis 2017). Shortly after midnight, blood was drawn, but it was not delivered to the public health testing lab until eighteen days later on October 17, 2016. Subsequent\n   testing indicated Mr. Casiano's BAC was 0.10%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Criminal charges were filed in municipal court for DWUI in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-5-233\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-5-233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (LexisNexis 2017). On January 4, 2017, the city prosecutor moved to dismiss the criminal case. The prosecutor contended \"there is insufficient evidence to establish a proper chain of custody for the time the blood samples were drawn on September 30th, 2016, to the time the blood samples were hand delivered to the Wyoming Department of Health's Chemical Testing Program (WCTP), on October 17th, 2016.\" According to the prosecutor, \"[t]he [e]ighteen (18) day gap in the chain of custody of the Defendant's blood draw is unacceptable and renders the blood draw results inadmissible evidence ....\" The municipal court dismissed the DWUI charge without prejudice and without reference to the chain of custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] Following the municipal court's dismissal, the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT or Department) held an administrative license suspension proceeding mandated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-6-102\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-6-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). WYDOT suspended Mr. Casiano's driver's license for 90 days. Mr. Casiano sought administrative review. Mr. Casiano relied on the prosecutor's pleading in municipal court. He maintained that collateral estoppel barred use of the BAC test results in the WYDOT suspension proceeding and that those results were inadmissible because the break in the chain of custody violated the Department of Health's testing standards. The OAH upheld the suspension, reasoning that there \"is no privity between the Cheyenne Municipal prosecutor and the Department\" and that \"no evidence was provided to establish the 18-day gap [in delivery of the blood sample to the Department of Health] resulted in a chain of custody issue.\" Mr. Casiano appealed the ruling to the district court. The district court affirmed the suspension.

In cases where governmental entities are parties in successive actions, if a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   second action involves an agency or official whose functions and responsibilities are so distinct from those of the agency or official in the first action that applying [issue] preclusion would interfere with the proper allocation of authority between them, the earlier judgment should not be given preclusive effect in the second action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 36, cmt. f, Westlaw (database updated October 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b617] Administrative and criminal proceedings have distinct purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The purpose of [ ] administrative proceedings ... is to police licensing requirements within the state, while the state's attorney's interest in the criminal proceeding is in having guilt or innocence determined under the applicable criminal law and in seeing that proper punishment is meted out in the event that the criminal law has been violated.

The Minnesota Supreme Court considered this distinction.

In that case, we considered whether an OAH finding that there was no probable cause to arrest a defendant for DWUI collaterally estopped the State from prosecuting him for DWUI in circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988796\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/501/\">\n    247 P.3d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that collateral estoppel did not apply, in part, because \"[n]o privity exists between WYDOT and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the county and district attorneys\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988796\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/501/\">\n    247 P.3d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Our holding in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   could have been more clearly worded. County and district attorneys are not parties to litigation in criminal prosecutions.

The question, actually resolved in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   , was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether the county or district attorney had privity with WYDOT, but whether the State had privity with WYDOT.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-1-804\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-1-804\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988796\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/501/\">\n    247 P.3d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The answer reached in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   is that no privity exists.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b619] Here, the question is whether there is privity between the City of Cheyenne and WYDOT. In Cheyenne, city attorneys have the authority to prosecute violations of city ordinances. Cheyenne, Wyo., Municipal Code ch. 2.08.040 (2018). Cheyenne has incorporated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-5-233\">\n    Wyo. Stat.

Accordingly, the city attorney in this case acted on behalf of his client and the party to this prosecution, the City of Cheyenne. For the same reasons articulated in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lemmer\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the roles of WYDOT (which has the authority to suspend licenses in administrative proceedings) and the City (which has the authority to prosecute violations of its ordinances) are distinct. Privity does not exist between the City of Cheyenne and WYDOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b620] Mr. Casiano also argues that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990825\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/245/827/\">\n    245 P.3d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires the conclusion that privity exists, and collateral estoppel applies here. In\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the defendant was collaterally estopped from relitigating the admissibility of breath test results in his administrative license suspension hearing when the circuit court had decided the issue in the companion criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990825\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/245/827/\">\n    245 P.3d at 830-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Privity existed in\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   because the party against whom collateral estoppel was applied, the defendant, was identical in both proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . By contrast, here, as in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   , there is no privity between the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted (WYDOT), and the party to the previous litigation (the City). The third element of collateral estoppel has not been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b621] The final requirement for the application of collateral estoppel is that the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted must have had a \"full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Kroenlein Trust\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847722\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/357/1118/\">\n    357 P.3d at 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we recognized above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b613, the issue of the validity of the BAC test results\n   was not litigated in the prior proceeding. WYDOT was not a party and did not have privity with the City in the prior proceeding. WYDOT had no opportunity to litigate the admissibility of the BAC test results in the criminal matter and the fourth requirement of collateral estoppel is also unsatisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b622] Collateral estoppel does not bar the OAH from considering the BAC test in the administrative license revocation proceeding. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Collateral estoppel is also referred to as \"issue preclusion.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Restatement (Second) of Judgments ch. 1, Relation Between Law of Res Judicata and Law of Procedure, Westlaw (database updated October 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
