Kalua (Kalua) was concurrently cited for speeding and excessive speeding offenses while driving through two separate speed zones. This case addresses the issue whether the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) erred in holding that the entry of judgment on Kalua's noncriminal speeding infraction failed to bar the Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai'i (State) from prosecuting him for the crime of excessive speeding. Kalua contends that his prosecution for excessive speeding is barred by Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 701-109(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2007) and by the double jeopardy clauses\n   of the United States and Hawai'i Constitutions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold that double jeopardy is inapplicable to the civil offense of speeding under its current statutory framework. We also hold Kalua is subject to prosecution for both excessive speeding and speeding; however, if on remand the District Court of the Third Circuit (district court) finds at trial that the excessive speeding charge arises from the same conduct as the speeding infraction, the \"lesser included offense\" provision of HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)(a) will preclude his conviction for excessive speeding. We thus affirm the ICA's judgment vacating the district court's dismissal of the excessive speeding offense, but for the reasons stated herein, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Stipulated Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 14, 2011, Kalua was cited for speeding, in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-102,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for excessive speeding, in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-105.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 28, 2011, Kalua paid the $137 fine for the speeding infraction after a default judgment was entered against him in the district court. On January 5, 2012, in the district court, Kalua pled not guilty to the charge of excessive speeding. Kalua subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the excessive speeding charge pursuant to HRS \u00a7 701-109(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the April 19, 2012 hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the motion to dismiss the excessive speeding charge, the parties agreed to stipulate to the following relevant facts: (1) the citing police officer, Thomas Koyanagi, used radar to measure Kalua's speed at a \"steady speed of 73 miles per hour while entering a 45 miles per hour zone\"; (2) Officer Koyanagi observed Kalua pass two 40 miles per hour signs; and (3) Officer Koyanagi subsequently stopped Kalua and cited him for driving 71 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour zone in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-102(a)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for driving 73 miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-105(a)(1). Additionally, the parties agreed that \"at no time was there a break in the occurrence from the time that ... Officer Koyanagi saw [Kalua] to the time [Kalua] stopped and was cited. And he was issued both tickets upon that stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted Kalua's motion to dismiss the excessive speeding charge. The court determined that the speeding infraction was a lesser included offense of excessive speeding. Because Kalua had paid the fine for the speeding infraction, the court reasoned that prosecuting him for the excessive speeding charge would violate HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)(a), which prohibits the State from convicting a defendant \"of more than one offense\" if one offense \"is included in the other.\" The court thus found that HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)(a) barred the State from prosecuting Kalua on the excessive speeding charge. The court further found that the double jeopardy clause barred the State from\n   prosecuting Kalua on the excessive speeding charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court's order granting Kalua's motion to dismiss the excessive speeding charge was filed on May 21, 2012, and later amended on September 26, 2012. In the amended order, the district court cited HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) in concluding that the State was barred from prosecuting Kalua on the excessive speeding charge. The district court explained that Kalua's conduct consisted of \"the operation of his vehicle at a speed in excess of the applicable speed limit,\" and concluded that his conduct \"constituted a single episode.\" The court therefore concluded that prosecution of the excessive speeding offense was barred because HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) bars separate trials for offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ICA Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its opinion, the ICA vacated the district court's order granting Kalua's motion to dismiss and remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the ICA's view, HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) (2007) \"eliminates any bar to criminal prosecution that could otherwise arise from the separate adjudication of non-criminal traffic infractions[,]\" and \"permit[s] prosecution of a criminal offense where the adjudicated traffic infraction is a lesser included traffic infraction of the charged crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311019\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/181/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311019\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/181/#p189\">\n    at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311019\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/181/#p189\">\n    358 P.3d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Kalua raises a single issue: does the prior adjudication of his civil traffic offense of speeding bar the State from subsequently prosecuting Kalua for the criminal traffic offense of excessive speeding?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 291C-102 (penalizing speeding); HRS \u00a7 291C-105 (penalizing excessive speeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kalua contends the prior adjudication under HRS \u00a7 291C-102 prevents subsequent prosecution for excessive speeding under HRS \u00a7 291C-105, and advances three arguments in support of his contention. First, he\n   argues that the State cannot prosecute him on the excessive speeding charge because HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)(a) bars convicting a defendant of multiple offenses where one offense is included in the other. Having been convicted of the lesser offense of speeding, he argues, he cannot later be prosecuted for the greater offense of excessive speeding as well, given that both were committed in the same course of conduct. Second, Kalua argues that HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) imposes a compulsory joinder requirement barring successive trials for multiple offenses arising from the same conduct. In other words, he argues the State was required to prosecute both offenses together. Under this analysis, Kalua contends that because the speeding charge had already been adjudicated, the State was barred under HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) from prosecuting him in a later trial on the excessive speeding charge. Third, Kalua argues that the double jeopardy doctrine bars the State from prosecuting him for both speeding and excessive speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State contends that it may prosecute Kalua for excessive speeding even though the speeding infraction he committed during the same course of conduct has been adjudicated. According to the State, HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) expressly prevents HRS \u00a7 701-109 from barring subsequent prosecution of a criminal traffic offense, such as excessive speeding, when a prior civil traffic offense committed during the same course of conduct has already been adjudicated. Second, as to the compulsory joinder requirement of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2), the State argues that the statute applies only if both offenses are known to the prosecuting officer at the time the first trial begins, and that was not the case here. Finally, the State stresses, double jeopardy applies only to successive criminal trials, not to a civil adjudication followed by a criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin by examining the double jeopardy doctrine and conclude it is not applicable. We then consider the State's arguments that HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) precludes traffic offenses from the prohibitions contained in HRS \u00a7 701-109 regarding separate prosecutions and multiple convictions. We hold that HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) precludes the compulsory joinder requirement contained in HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) in the context of traffic infractions. Accordingly, Kalua can be prosecuted separately for speeding and excessive speeding. However, we also conclude that HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) does not preclude applicability of HRS \u00a7 701-109 regarding lesser included offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Kalua cannot be convicted of speeding and excessive speeding if both offenses involve the same conduct pursuant to HRS \u00a7 701-109(1), as speeding is a lesser included offense of excessive speeding pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 701-109(1)(a) and 701-109(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Double Jeopardy Clause Does Not Bar Kalua's Prosecution for Excessive Speeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Double jeopardy protects individuals against: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Kalua argues that the double jeopardy clauses of the U.S. and Hawai'i Constitutions bar the State from prosecuting the excessive speeding charge. The ICA rejected Kalua's argument by concluding that because the double jeopardy clause only bars successive\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   prosecutions and multiple\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   punishments, the prior adjudication of Kalua's noncriminal speeding infraction did not act as a bar to the State's subsequent prosecution for excessive speeding.\n   <em>\n    Kalua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311019\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/181/#p189\">\n    136 Hawai'i at 186-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311019\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/181/#p189\">\n    358 P.3d at 755-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Taken together, these factors clearly support the conclusion that the sanctions imposed for speeding are a civil\n   remedy rather than a criminal punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258475\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/113/1/#p31\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258475\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/113/1/#p31\">\n    at 31-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258475\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/113/1/#p31\">\n    147 P.3d at 815-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With respect to (1), whether the legislature intended the penalty to be civil or criminal, here, the punishment for speeding is purely monetary: maximum fines of up to $200 for a first violation, $300 for a second violation within one year, and $500 for a third violation within one year, or community service in lieu of a monetary assessment at the court's discretion based on inability to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291D-9 (2007), 291D-10 (2007), and 291C-161 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2008).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the sanctions imposed for Kalua's speeding violation did not constitute a criminal punishment. Accordingly, criminal prosecution for Kalua's excessive speeding charge is not barred under the double jeopardy clause by the default judgment entered on his noncriminal speeding offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) Precludes Applicability of the Compulsory Joinder Provision of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) in the Context of Traffic Offenses, but Does Not Provide an Exception to the Provision in HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because we have concluded that Kalua's potential prosecution for excessive speeding is not barred by the double jeopardy clauses of the U.S. or Hawai'i Constitutions, we turn to the statutory provisions relevant to whether he can be prosecuted and convicted for excessive speeding as well as speeding. Kalua argues that the State cannot prosecute him on the excessive speeding charge because HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)(a) bars convicting a defendant of multiple offenses where one offense is included in the other. Having been convicted of the lesser offense of speeding, he argues, he cannot later be prosecuted for the greater offense of excessive speeding as well, given that both were committed in the same course of conduct. Second, he argues that HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) imposes a compulsory joinder requirement barring successive trials for multiple offenses arising from a continuing course of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The State contends that it may prosecute Kalua for excessive speeding even if the speeding infraction he committed is a lesser included offense committed during the same course of conduct. According to the State, HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) expressly prevents HRS \u00a7 701-109 from barring subsequent prosecution of a criminal traffic offense, such as excessive speeding, when a prior civil traffic offense committed during the same course of conduct has already been adjudicated. Thus, while HRS \u00a7 701-109(1)(a) forbids convicting a defendant of both a lesser included offense and the greater offense, the State argues HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) creates an exception to that rule. Second, the State rejects Kalua's argument that prosecuting him for excessive speeding would violate the compulsory joinder requirement of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) ; the State contends that HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) precludes the operation of all provisions in HRS \u00a7 701-109 in the traffic offense context, including the compulsory joinder requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plainly, the arguments advanced by both the State and Kalua turn on the meanings of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 701-109 and 291D-3(d) and how they interrelate. We turn to the State's argument that HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   -precluding the compulsory joinder provision of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) -also precludes application of HRS \u00a7 701-109\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   barring multiple convictions\n   \"[w]hen the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of more than one offense[.]\" HRS \u00a7 701-109(1).

Manaiakalani N.K. Kalua's non-criminal speeding infraction does not bar prosecution of Kalua's excessive speeding charge under Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 701-109(1). This analysis is consistent with the legislature's intention in providing for the expeditious resolution of decriminalized traffic infractions in HRS Chapter 291D, while leaving intact the existing system for adjudicating criminal offenses such as excessive speeding. Simply put, HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   In no event shall section 701-109 preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a traffic infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated pursuant to [HRS Chapter 291D].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because Kalua's speeding infraction was adjudicated pursuant to HRS Chapter 291D, HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) does not bar prosecution of his criminal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Majority asserts that speeding is an \"offense\" subject to the Penal Code provisions relating to offenses in HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) and (4), even though speeding is a non-criminal violation. This conclusion, however, is directly contrary to the statutory framework of HRS Chapter 291D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   HRS \u00a7 291D-3(a) explicitly states that \"[n]o traffic infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense.\" Moreover, subsection (b) provides that \"[w]here a defendant is\n   charged with a traffic infraction and the infraction is committed in the same course of conduct as a criminal offense for which the offender is arrested or charged, the traffic infraction\n   <em>\n    shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The legislature, in creating HRS Chapter 291D in 1993, recounted the history of decriminalizing certain traffic offenses. HRS \u00a7 291D-1. First, in 1978, Act 222 decriminalized \"certain traffic offenses, not of a serious nature, to the status of violations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20P.2d%20731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then, in 1993, the legislature \"further decriminaliz[ed]\" certain traffic offenses by making them \"infractions.\" HRS \u00a7 291D-1. The legislature specifically found that \"further decriminalization of certain traffic offenses and streamlining of the handling of those traffic cases [would] achieve a more expeditious system for the judicial processing of traffic infractions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20P.2d%20731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The 1993 amendment is significant because it established a new category of traffic liability: an \"infraction,\" which is distinct from the traffic \"violations\" that were created by the 1978 legislation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respectfully, the Majority's analysis obscures this distinction in concluding that a speeding infraction constitutes an \"offense\" that is subject to the Penal Code. It is true, as the Majority suggests, that the Penal Code recognizes that an \"offense\" under the Code can be either a crime (which the Code defines as a felony, misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor) or a violation. HRS \u00a7 701-102.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also true, as the Majority notes, that the 1978 legislation provided that it is a \"violation\" to \"violate\" a number of provisions of the Statewide Traffic Code. HRS \u00a7 291C-161(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   However, it does not follow, as the Majority suggests, that \"infractions\" are therefore necessarily \"offenses\" because they are not \"crimes,\" which are punished by criminal penalties. The reason is simple: in 1993, the legislature decided to \"further decriminaliz[e]\" traffic liability. HRS \u00a7 291D-1. One key element of that effort was to establish a new category of liability called traffic \"infractions\" and to explicitly provide that \"no traffic infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense.\" HRS \u00a7 291D-3. Contrary to the suggestion of the Majority, the legislature did not create an \"offense\" subject to the Penal Code called a \"non-criminal violation.\" Rather, it established a new category of liability that was outside of the scope of the Penal Code altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Majority also cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, the plain language of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291D-2 and 291D-3 allows for prosecution of a related criminal offense, even if the criminal offense arises out of the same course of conduct as the non-criminal violation adjudicated pursuant to HRS Chapter 291D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, the purpose of HRS \u00a7 291D-3 is to clarify that the adjudication of non-criminal infractions pursuant to HRS Chapter 291D's streamlined, expeditious system will not adversely affect the State's ability to prosecute related criminal offenses that arise from the same conduct as the non-criminal traffic infractions. HRS \u00a7 291D-3 's plain language and the legislature's intent in creating Chapter 291D demonstrate that a speeding infraction is not an \"offense\" of any kind, and thus HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) is not applicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Majority asserts that HRS \u00a7 291D-3(d) negates only the prosecution-related provisions of HRS \u00a7 701-109, not its conviction-related provisions. However, because a non-criminal traffic infraction is not an offense, it falls outside the scope of HRS \u00a7 701-109. Thus, HRS \u00a7 291D-3 need not be read in concert with HRS \u00a7 701-109, and the meaning of \"prosecution\" under HRS \u00a7 701-109 should not be imported into HRS \u00a7 291D-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) protects a defendant from being \"\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   of more than one offense\" under certain circumstances. HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) (emphasis added). Kalua's non-criminal speeding infraction resulted in a civil judgment, not a conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 291D-3(c)(1) (distinguishing \"a civil judgment as to [a] traffic infraction\" from \"a judgment of conviction or acquittal as to [a] ... criminal offense\"). Because Kalua could only be \"convicted\" of one offense under these circumstances, HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the Majority's interpretation of HRS \u00a7 291D-3, and I would affirm the ICA's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an element.

HRS \u00a7 291D-2 (2007) (authorizing a \"[c]oncurrent trial ... in which the defendant is tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged traffic infraction and in a criminal case for any related criminal offense, with trials to be held in one court on the same date and at the same time\").\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 291D-13(d) (2007).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The dissent contends that because the 1993 amendment to the Traffic Code described speeding as a non-criminal \"infraction,\" speeding is no longer an \"offense\": \"One key element of that effort [the 1993 legislation establishing the two-track system] was to establish a new category of liability called traffic 'infractions' and to explicitly provide that 'no traffic infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense.' \" Dissent at 114 Hawai'i at 18, 434 P.3d at 1213. Under this analysis, speeding infractions cannot be subject to HRS \u00a7 701-109 because \u00a7 701-109 only pertains to \"offenses.\" With respect, this contention is mistaken. Though speeding is an \"infraction,\" it remains a \"decriminalized traffic offense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    In referring to non-criminal traffic offenses as \"infractions,\" the legislature in 1993 only created a category within the already existing class of \"violations,\" which themselves are a class of \"offenses,\" namely, non-criminal offenses. HRS \u00a7 291D-2 (\" 'Traffic infraction' means all violations of statutes, ordinances, or rules relating to traffic movement and control ... for which the prescribed penalties do not include imprisonment and that are not otherwise specifically excluded from coverage of this chapter.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    An \"infraction\" not only \"means all violations of statutes, ordinances, or rules relating to traffic movement and control[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Under HRS \u00a7 701-107 -titled \"Grades and classes of offenses\"-speeding is included within a class of non-criminal \"offenses,\" termed \"a violation.\" A \"violation\" is defined by the Code in two ways. A violation is either any offense specifically designated as a violation by the Penal Code (or any other Hawai'i statute, such as the Traffic Code) or any offense punishable only by \"a fine, or fine and forfeiture or other\n    <em>\n     civil\n    </em>\n    penalty[.]\" HRS \u00a7 701-107(5) (emphasis added) (\"A violation does not constitute a crime[.]\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 701-107 cmt. (\"Subsection (5) creates\n    <em>\n     a class of non-criminal offenses\n    </em>\n    , called violations.\" (emphasis added) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Here, ordinary speeding satisfies both prongs of the Penal Code's definition of a \"violation,\" and a \"non-criminal offense[ ].\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7 701-107(5). First, the ordinary speeding statute provides for no other sentence than a fine. HRS \u00a7 291C-102(a)(1) ; HRS \u00a7 291D-9(a) -(b). Second, speeding is expressly defined as a violation by \"another statute of this State,\" namely, the Traffic Code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291C-102, 291C-161(a) (\"It is a\n    <em>\n     violation\n    </em>\n    for any person to violate any of the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise specified in subsections (c) and (d) and unless the violation is by other law of this State declared to be a felony, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor.\" (emphasis added) ). Thus speeding is an infraction that constitutes both a violation and a non-criminal offense. As a noncriminal \"offense,\" it is subject to the provisions of HRS \u00a7 701-109 other than HRS \u00a7 701-109(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    \"Accordingly, we remand for entry of a judgment that [the defendant] violated HRS 291C-102(a)(1), in accordance with the applicable statutes governing non-criminal traffic infractions.\"\n    <em>\n     Fitzwater\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313496\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/354/#p357\">\n     122 Hawai'i at 378\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313496\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/354/#p357\">\n     227 P.3d at 544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Fitzwater\n    </em>\n    , HRS \u00a7 701-109(1) did not apply because the defendant was charged with only one offense: the offense of excessive speeding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The system of processing traffic infractions established by Chapter 291D was designed to:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    (1) Eliminate the long and tedious arraignment proceeding for a majority of traffic matters;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    (2) Facilitate and encourage the resolution of many traffic infractions through the payment of a monetary assessment;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n    (3) Speed the disposition of contested cases through a hearing, similar to small claims proceedings, in which the rules of evidence will not apply and the court will consider as evidence the notice of traffic infraction, applicable police reports, or other written statements by the police officer who issued the notice, any other relevant written material, and any evidence or statements by the person contesting the notice of traffic infraction;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n    (4) Dispense in most cases with the need for witnesses, including law enforcement officers, to be present and for the participation of the prosecuting attorney;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n    (5) Allow judicial, prosecutorial, and law enforcement resources to be used more efficiently and effectively; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n    (6) Save the taxpayers money and reduce their frustration with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic court process.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    HRS \u00a7 291D-2 provides the definition of \"traffic infraction\" to mean \"all violations of statutes, ordinances, or rules relating to traffic movement and control, including parking, standing, equipment, and pedestrian offenses, for which the prescribed penalties do not include imprisonment and that are not otherwise specifically excluded from coverage of this chapter.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Consistent with that provision, section 701-107(5) explicitly provides that a violation does not constitute a crime.
