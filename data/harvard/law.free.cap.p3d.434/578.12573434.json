We hold that the good-faith exception applies because application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances would not meaningfully deter police misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   did not \"unsettle\" the law, and it is unreasonable to require police to predict a change in the law when our trial and appellate courts failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In February 2015, an Oro Valley police officer arrested Courtney Weakland for DUI. The officer handcuffed her, put her in the back seat of his patrol car, and read her an \"admin per se\" form pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1321. The form provided that Arizona law \"require[d]\" her to complete certain tests to determine her blood-alcohol concentration (\"BAC\"). She submitted to a blood draw, which revealed a BAC of .218, nearly three times the legal limit. Weakland was indicted on one count of aggravated DUI while impaired to the slightest degree and one count of aggravated DUI with a BAC of .08 or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Before trial, Weakland moved to suppress all evidence obtained through the warrantless search and seizure of her blood sample, arguing that the \"requirement\" language in the admin per se admonition coerced her consent. The trial court summarily denied her motion. Weakland was convicted on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 On appeal, Weakland argued that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   , her blood was obtained\n   without a warrant and without valid consent, and that the good-faith exception recognized in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   did not apply. The State implicitly conceded on appeal that Weakland's consent to the blood draw was involuntary and, thus, invalid pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   , but argued that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule obviated the need to suppress the blood evidence. In a divided opinion, the court of appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Weakland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%2079\">\n    244 Ariz. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567515\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/446/\">\n    418 P.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2017). The majority reasoned that, because Arizona courts had not held that the admin per se admonition was \"coercive, ineffective, or otherwise [affirmatively] negated consent\" until\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   , police acted in good faith when they read it to Weakland after her arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567515\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/446/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 83 \u00b6 19, 85 \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567515\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/446/\">\n    418 P.3d at 450, 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The dissent argued that although existing precedent may have justified applying the good-faith exception to the defendant's 2012 arrest in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   , this Court's 2013\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   decision placed police on notice before Weakland's 2015 arrest that use of the admin per se admonition was constitutionally suspect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567515\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/446/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 85 \u00b6\u00b6 27-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567515\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/446/\">\n    418 P.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Eckerstrom, C.J., dissenting).

Thus, I agree with the majority on that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. In a world with evolving technology and limited judicial resources, the validity of police officers' conduct should not hinge on appellate courts previously having specifically authorized every particular practice that officers might engage in or bear the risk that evidence will be suppressed if a practice is subsequently declared unconstitutional. This, of course, is especially true when a police officer can reasonably interpret those appellate decisions that do exist as authorizing related or similar practices based upon the rationales, principles, and reasoning that those decisions set forth. Under those circumstances, it is hard to understand what the deterrent value is in suppressing evidence when a future court later determines that a practice is unconstitutional.

Under either approach to the good-faith exception,\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   sufficiently unsettled the aggregate of relevant Arizona case law relating to police officers' use of this \"admin per se\" form to preclude application of the exception in this case.

The rationale, principles, and reasoning underlying this Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   undermine the State's claim that the aggregate of relevant Arizona case law at the time of Weakland's arrest could reasonably be understood as authorizing the practice of obtaining constitutionally adequate consent to blood testing by reading an \"admin per se\" form to an arrestee that instructs the arrestee that he or she is \"require[d]\" to submit to testing.

Rather, we stated that the implied consent law directs an officer \"to\n   <em>\n    ask\n   </em>\n   the arrestee to submit to the test, and the arrestee\n   <em>\n    may then refuse\n   </em>\n   by declining to expressly agree to take the test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). \"\n   <em>\n    If the arrestee refuses\n   </em>\n   , the statute specifies that\n   <em>\n    a warrant is required\n   </em>\n   to administer the test and the arrestee shall have his license suspended.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052843\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/463/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Far from authorizing the practice of reading that form to an arrestee and\n   then assuming or implying based on that fact alone that the arrestee's subsequent submission to testing constituted voluntary consent, this Court included that precise fact as a reason for upholding the trial court's finding that the suspect's consent was\n   <em>\n    involuntary\n   </em>\n   . Our including that fact as a reason for finding an arrestee's consent involuntary for Fourth Amendment purposes cannot reasonably be understood in good faith as authorizing an officer to obtain constitutionally adequate consent to blood testing by reading an \"admin per se\" form to an arrestee that instructs the arrestee that he or she is \"require[d]\" to submit to testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b634 The majority contends, however, that \"\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   did not 'unsettle' the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.

At the same time, excluding the evidence here would incentivize law enforcement officials to more carefully monitor and apply the law, to err on the side of obtaining a warrant, and therefore to avoid the need for a court to exclude evidence in future cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b654 The majority's opinion significantly expands the good-faith exception. Instead of requiring binding appellate precedent that expressly authorizes the practice, it finds good faith where there is a smidgeon of authority and an abundance of doubt. As Justice Pelander aptly characterizes it, instead of erring on the side of constitutional behavior, the police \"proceeded in the face of 'unsettled' law.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. For those reasons, with great respect to my colleagues, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly debated the purported costs and benefits of the judicially created exclusionary rule in its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Utah v.

But this case involves only the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, not the underlying purposes, policies, or continued viability of the rule itself, which the Supreme Court still recognizes. And, as the majority acknowledges, the State \"bears the burden of establishing that the good-faith exception applies.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Indeed, given this Court's ruling in\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    , I warned that \"the safest course of action for law enforcement might simply be to obtain search warrants, when reasonably feasible, for obtaining blood samples in DUI investigations.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n     232 Ariz. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    92 \u00b6 37,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n     302 P.3d at 617\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Pelander, J., concurring).
