The writ was directed to \u201c any constable of Marion county,\u201d but instead of being delivered to a constable, it was handed by the Justice to Charles G, Cou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Ion, who appears in the subsequent proceedings under the name of a special constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Coulon arrested Schaw, and brought him before the Justice. Soon after he was brought into the office of the Justice, the latter went to his dinner, Charles G. Coulon leaving at the same time. The Justice, and Coulon left the plaintiff in charge of Blume, who was a clerk in Dietrich\u2019s office. While they were absent the plaintiff started out of the office. Blume undertook to restrain him from going, and called for help, whereupon Charles Coulon, who was prosecuting the \u201c provoke\u201d, case, came out of his own into the Justice\u2019s office, and ordered plaintiff to sit down, and behave himself until Esquire Dietrichs should return. Thereupon the plaintiff resumed his seat, and awaited the coming of the Justice. The weight of evidence is that Schaw was drunk when brought before the Justice, and on his return the latter issued a mittimus for the commitment of the former to jail, reciting in the mittimus that the trial of the charge was necessarily postponed by reason of the drunkenness of Schaw, and he having failed to give bail for his appearance in the sum of fifty dollars, the jailor was commanded to receive said Christian Schaw into his custody in the jail of said county, there to remain until discharged by due course of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Schaw was kept in jail until the next day, when, on the order of Justice Dietrichs, he was brought out, and the prosecution pending against him terminated in a finding of guilty, and a nominal fine, with costs. No record of the proceedings was made in the docket of Justice Dietrichs for more than a month afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">After his release, Schaw brought this suit for the alleged assault, arrest, and imprisonment. Dietrichs filed the general denial, and a second paragraph of answer, setting up the above recited proceedings before him against plaintiff, as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The other defendants pleaded the general denial separately. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Charles G. Coulon filed a second paragraph, justifying under the writ issued, and delivered to him by the Justice. The other defendant's answered further in justification, that they acted as citizens under the command of Charles G. Coulon, as special constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Court at Special Term sustained demurrers to all'the special answers, to which defendants severally excepted. The cause was tried by jury \u2014 verdict against all the defendants for \u00a7500 damages. The defendants filed separate motions for a new trial. The plaintiff remitted \u00a7250 of the verdict, whereupon the Court overruled the motion for a new trial, and rendered judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The only real question presented by the record is, did the writ delivered by the Justice to Charles G. Coulon authorize him to arrest the plaintiff? If it did, the Justice acquired jurisdiction of the person of plaintiff, and such jurisdiction protected him from suit for subsequent irregularities j and the other defendants could justify under the writ. On the other hand, if the writ gave Charles G. Coulon no authority to make the arrest, he, and all others acting in the premises under his orders, as well as the Justice who committed plaintiff to jail after his arrest, are trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The statute defining the powers of Justices in State prosecutions \u2014 2 G. &amp; H., 639 \u2014 provides that special constables may be appointed under like circumstances, and such appointment impose like liabilities as in civil cases. The statute relative to such appointments in civil cases is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201c Whenever there shall be no constable convenient, and in the opinion of the Justice an emergency exists for the immediate appointment of one, such Justice may appoint a special constable to act in a particular cause, and shall note such appointment and such cause on the docket, <em>and shall direct process to him by his*name </em>and such constable so appointed shall discharge the duties, receive the fees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>have the powers, in sueh cause, appertaining to the office.\u201d 2 <em>G. </em>&amp; H., 607.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">This statute was passed upon by the Supreme Court in <em>Benninghoof </em>v. <em>Finney et al, </em>22 Ind., 101, where it was held that the provisions of the statute requiring the Justice to .note the appointment of a special constable on his docket, and to direct process to him by name, are imperative, and directory, and that a writ directed to any constable of the \u00a1county, &amp;c., will not justify a trespass committed by such \u2022special constable in attempting to serve such writ. Under that decision, the defendants in this case were clearly trespassers in restraining the plaintiff of his liberty. No jurisdiction of his person was obtained, nor did he voluntarily \u2022submit to the jurisdiction of the Justice. Indeed, the Justice\u2019s mittimus recites that he was too drunk to be tried. If so, he was too drank to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the Justice, nor did he do so. He attempted to leave the .Justice\u2019s office, but was restrained from doing so by the defendants Blame, and Charles Coulon. They were bound to know whether Charles <em>G. </em>Coulon was a regular constable, or if they aeted under his orders as a special constable, they were bound to know whether he in fact bore that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The ruling of the Judge at Special Term on the demurrers, and in overruling the motion for a new trial, were therefore right, and the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Note. \u2014 In all oases where the cause of action against a judicial officer, .exercising only a special, and limited authority, is founded on his acts done <em>colore officii, </em>the single inquiry is, whether he has aeted without any jurisdiction over the subject matter, or has been guilty of an excess of jurisdiction. 1 <em>Leading Criminal Cases, </em>306. <em>See also </em>1 Chitty, <em>Pl., </em>(14 <em>Am. </em>Md.), 181, <em>et seq, and notes; </em>1 <em>Conn., </em>11, 95; 3 <em>Binney, </em>404; 3 <em>Campbell, </em>388 ; 15 Johnson, 121; 19 <em>do., </em>39; <em>1 Wallace, </em>523, 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">If a magistrate acts beyond the limits of his jurisdiction, his'proceedings are deemed to he <em>coram non judice, </em>and void, and if he' attempts to enforce .any process founded an any judgment, .sentence, or .conviction in such aases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>her thereby becomes a trespasser.
