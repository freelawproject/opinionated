The defendant has interposed a motion to dismiss the-appeal, on the ground that the order was not one from which an appeal lies to the General Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The'25th Section of the Act organizing this Court, provides for an appeal to the General Term from the decision, of a single Judge, and-those eases only, where, if the decision\u00bb complained of had been rendered- by the Circuit Court, an. appeal would lie from that tribunal to the Supreme Court* It is a general rule of practice that an appeal does not lie from an inferior- to the Supreme Court, except from a final judgment of such inferior court. The only exceptions to-this rule are made- by the statute*</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Among those excepted eases is an interlocutory order,, \u201cgranting, or dissolving, or overruling motions to dissolve an injunction <em>intern?, </em>and <em>granting </em>an injunction, <em>in vacation^' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>2 G. &amp; H., 277, Sec. 576. It seems to me a clear proposition, &gt;that this appeal does not come within the above exceptions to the general rule, that an appeal lie only .from a final /judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The restraining order was noPan injustice, consequently 'the defendant could not have appealed from that order, vide <em>Cincinnati &amp; Chicago R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Huncheon and another, </em>16 Ind., 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The order dissolving the restraining order was not appeal-able for two reasons: <em>First, </em>it was nut the-dissolution of <em>an injunction, </em>for no injunction had been granted. <em>Second, </em>The \u00aborder was not made <em>'in term, </em>but in vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The case does not come within any exception laid down an the statute, and we\u2019 have no power to legislate to .cover .\u25a0such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The defendant\u2019s motion is therefore well taken, and the Appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
