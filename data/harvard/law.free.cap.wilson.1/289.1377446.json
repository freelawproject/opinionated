The finding and judgment of the Court is not sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">2. That the finding and judgment of the Court is not supported by, and is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">3. That the judgment is not sustained by the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">4. That the Court erred in failing to make special finding upon the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">The three first specifications present the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of the Court. There was conflicting evidence on some points in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The evidence satisfactorily shows that the services charged were rendered to defendant\u2019s wife, and that she needed <em>medical </em>attention; that no other physician was.at the time attending upon her, and that the wife employed plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We are of opinion that the wife had a right to make such employment, and that the defendant is liable for the reasonable charges of plaintiff' for such services as he rendered under such employment. The husband is liable for necessaries furnished his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">See 1st, <em>Blackstone\u2019s </em>Commentaries, <em>side page </em>442; <em>Litson </em>v. Brown, 26 <em>Ind., </em>491. <em>Medical bills </em>are necessaries. See 1st, <em>Blackstone's Commentaries, side page </em>466, <em>and notes, authorities there cited.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The fourth specification for a new trial was properly overruled because the renewal does not show that defendant requested the Court-to make a special finding, and for its failure to do so the defendant objected and excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">It is assigned for error that the Court erred in admitting in evidence the conversations, and statements of defendant\u2019s wife. This error, if such it is, was not assigned as a reason for a new .trial, and therefore cannot be considered here; See <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>12 <em>Ind., </em>675; <em>Snodgrass </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>15 <em>Ind., </em>274 ; <em>Medder </em>v. <em>Hiatt, </em>14 <em>Ind., </em>406; <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>present Term Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Note. \u2014 If tho husband wrongfully deserts his wife and children, making no provision for them, he is answerable for necessaries furnished them upon his credit. <em>(Note to Carter </em>v. Howard, 6 <em>Am. Law Reg., </em>(n. s.) 411, and supported by <em>Walker </em>v. Leighton, 11 Foster, 111;<em>Evans </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>5 <em>Gill </em>569; <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Fazan, </em>1 <em>Bosanguet &amp; Puller\u2019s Reports, C.
