Thomason and others, to compel the specific performance of a contract for the purchase of land, and to have a deed therefor declared void and cancelled. The material facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>are that on March 3, 1893, the defendant H. Christian, being the owner in fee of a tract of land in Polk County, executed, with his wife, Emily Christian, and delivered to the plaintiff J.. S. Cooper, as trustee, a warranty deed therefor. On the 25th of the next month, in consideration of the payment of $1,000, and the execution of a note for $6,100, payable in ninety days, Cooper, as trustee, by the advice and with the consent of Christian, executed a warranty deed of said premises to the defendant W. J. Thomason, who immediately entered into and retained the possession thereof. The deed and note were deposited with one W. H. Hawley, the cashier of the plaintiff the First National Bank of Independence, to be delivered to Thomason upon the payment of said note. At the date of the execution of the deed by Christian, he was indebted to said bank on his own account, and as a member of the firm of Klemsen &amp; Christian, and on April 26, 1893, had a partial settlement with the bank, and, upon being credited with the $1,000 so paid by Thomason, gave his note for $2,250, and took up some of his matured notes, but left in the bank several other notes on which he was liable as maker or indorser, amounting to $1,981.22. On the next day the said firm settled their account with the bank by giving it their note for $2,368.11. On May 2, 1893, Christian and wife executed to the defendant H. Hirschberg a quitclaim deed to said premises, which was recorded prior to the deed to Cooper. Thomason having made default in the payment of his note, this suit was instituted, and, the issues being joined, a.trial was had by the court, which, having found for the plaintiff, rendered a decree granting the relief prayed for, from which the defendants Christian and wife and Hirschberg appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b183-4\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-5\">For appellants there was an oral argument by <em>Messrs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Martin L. Pipes </em>and /. /. <em>Daly, </em>with a brief by <em>Messrs. Reuben S. Strahan </em>and <em>Martin L. Pipes, </em>urging these points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-5\">The parol evidence admitted to prove the terms and conditions of the trust of which specific performance is asked is incompetent and in violation of the statute of frauds. The contention of respondents is that the statute of frauds is answered in this case by the mere fact that the trust deed from H. Christian and wife to J. S. Cooper designates the grantee as trustee. That the word trustee is deemed potent to satisfy the statute of frauds, and is in effect the conveyance or instrument in writing referred to in the statute. We contend that not only must it appear that a trust has been created or declared, but the writing itself must show the trust so created; that is to say, it must specify distinctly all the terms and conditions of the trust. It is time that a resulting trust, or one that arises by operation of law, can be proved by parol. A trustee ex maleficio cannot protect himself under the statute of frauds, but that is a very different case from one where an express trust is sought to be specifically enforced by a court of equity. Counsel for the respondents has fallen into the error of applying the law that relates to trusts of the former kind to this case, and that is shown by the authorities he cites in his brief. An examination of these authorities, will show that in every one of them it was the trustee who sought to retain the property against the terms of the trust, and a resulting trust was in fact proven.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">It has been held in numerous cases that a deed absolute on its face cannot be shown by parol evidence to have been made in trust for the grantor, and for the good reason that to permit this to be done would be to allow the written instrument to be contradicted by parol evidence. But in the cases cited by respondents, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>held that the trust relationship between the parties was sufficiently shown by the designation of the grantee as trustee. As soon as that relationship is established, then parol evidence is competent, not for the purpose of establishing the trust, but for the purpose of showing that, the express trust having failed, a trust results in favor of the grantor. It arises by operation of law. But no case has been cited where a parol trust has been specifically enforced by the court, either in favor of the trustor or the trustee. On the other hand, the cases are numerous which hold that any contract concerning land must have all its terms reduced to writing before it can be specifically performed: <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Ivers, </em>63 Am. Dec. 420; <em>Ratliff </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>63 Am. Dec. 471; <em>May </em>v. <em>Cavendor, </em>29 S.

Cooper, trustee, is a sufficient declaration of the trust to take the case out of the statute of frauds, and a sufficient compliance with section 781 of Hill\u2019s Code, which provides that \u201cno estate or interest in real property, other than a lease for a term not exceeding one year, nor any trust or power concerning such property, can be created, trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ferred or declared otherwise than by operation of law, or by a conveyance or other instrument in writing, subscribed by the party creating, transferring or declaring the same, or by his lawful agent under written authority and executed with such formalities as are required by law.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>38 Pac. 847; <em>Calnan </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>34 Pac. 907; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Linn, </em>5 Pac. 645; <em>Union Pacific R.

The rule is, that where the oral agreement has been in good faith so far performed that it is impossible to put the parties in statu quo, or to compensate the doer in damages for the breach of the agreement, and where certain specific acts of part performance have been done, the statute no longer applies, and equity will grant specific performance or give compensation in damages: <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Linn, </em>5 Pac. 645; Browne on the Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 483; 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 1409, note; <em>Meach </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>1 D.

But, conceding that he did not have, he was in possession of facts sufficient to put a reasonably prudent business man upon inquiry. With the knowledge, as he admits, that Cooper had some sort of writiixg from Christian with reference to the land, and of Thomason\u2019s possession, the only effort he made to find out the true status of the land alleged to have been purchased by him was to telephone to Dallas about the title and send Christian to the plaintiffs to ascertain the amount of his indebtedness. Under Hirschberg\u2019s testimony Christian was his agent, and he was bound by the knowledge which Christian had with reference to the matter: <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>12 Or. 10; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>115 Ill. 293; The Distilled Spirits, 11 Wall. 336; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank, </em>33 Vt. 252; <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>Nat.

The parol evidence admitted at the trial, of which the defendants complain, clearly shows that Christian, being indebted to the First National Bank of Independence on his own account, and as a member of the firm of Klemsen &amp; Christian, entered into a contract with Cooper, who was the president of said bank, by the terms of which he agreed to convey said premises to Cooper, who was to sell the same, and out of the proceeds arising therefrom discharge the obligations of Christian and the firm of which he was a member, including any advances that might be made, and pay the remainder, if any, to Christian; that, in pursuance of this agreement, Christian and wife executed to Cooper, \u201cas trustee,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>said deed, without specifying therein the nature of the trust; that Cooper, with the consent of Christian, entered into a verbal contract with Thomason for the sale of said land; that, in accordance therewith, he, as trustee, made to him a deed thereof, which was deposited with Hawley, and accounted with Christian for the payment made by Thomason; and that the bank, on the faith of the conveyance to Cooper, and the sale by him to Thomason, advanced money to Christian and the firm of Klemsen &amp; Christian. The principal question for consideration is whether this evidence was admissible. If it be conceded that this is a suit to establish a parol trust in lands, it must be admitted that its introduction was in contravention of the statute of frauds, which provides that no trust or power concerning real property can be created, transferred, or declared otherwise than by operation of law, or by a conveyance or other instrument in writing, subscribed- by the party creating, transferring, or declaring the same, or by his lawful agent, under written authority, and executed with such formalities as are required by law: Section 781, Hill\u2019s Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The rule is universal that a parol declaration of a trust will not affect the land, and for this reason parol evidence is inadmissible to establish such a trust. In <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>Rasdall, </em>9 Wis. 379, the court, speaking of the universality of this rule, say: \u201cWe do not feel called upon to cite authorities to show that, in the absence of fraud, accident, or mistake, parol evidence cannot be received to prove that a deed, absolute on its face, was given in trust for the benefit of the grantor.\u201d But if it be agreed that the land shall be sold and converted into money, and in pursuance thereof a sale is made, the subsequent declaration of the trust by the trustee will bind the proceeds or the money: x Perry on Trusts and Trustees, \u00a7 86. The reason assigned for the existence of this rule is that a trust in personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>property may be declared by parol, and a sale of the land by the trustee of a parol trust under an agreement to convert it into money changes the land into personal property, and the subsequent declaration of the trust by the trustee, being supported by the prior agreement to hold the premises in trust, furnishes a sufficient consideration for the enforcement of the declaration: <em>Hon </em>v <em>Hon, </em>70 Ind. 135; <em>Mohn </em>v. <em>Mohn, </em>112 Ind. 285 (13 N. E. 859); <em>Maffitt\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Rynd, </em>69 Pa. St. 380; <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Baylor, </em>69 Tex. 63 (6 S. W. 743). In <em>Karr </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>56 Wis. 303 (14 N. W. 189), it is held that a parol trust in land is not absolutely void, but void only at the election of the, trustee. The court, speaking of the power and duty of the trustee under a parol trust in lands, say: \u201cHe may execute it or not, as he chooses, and the courts will not interfere to compel him to execute it, or to restrain him from doing so. If he refuses to execute it, from thenceforth the trust, which rests only upon a moral obligation, is a nullity.\u201d Tested by this rule, it appears that the land in question was converted into personal property by Cooper under a parol agreement to apply the proceeds to the satisfaction of Christian\u2019s debts, and that, having executed the trust, he subsequently declared his liability to Christian, and accounted with him for the money received from Thomason. Such a declaration of the trust in personal property rendered Cooper liable to Christian for any balance that might be left after the satisfaction of his debts, and an action could be maintained for its recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> In such an action parol evidence would be admissible to show the parol declarations of a trust in personal property, and such evidence must be admissible, also, in equity to prove a parol declaration of the trust in land, as a consideration for the subsequent declaration. The deed to Cooper having recited a consideration of $7,000, the conveyance of the land was either absolute or in trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and, if the latter, the trust'has been fully executed, and the subsequent declaration must take the case out of the statute; but, if the deed was absolute, Cooper would be liable to Christian for the balance of the fund, after the satisfaction of the debts agreed to be paid out of it; and in either case the facts, in our judgment, show a sufficient consideration, as between Cooper and Christian, to support the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The conveyance to Cooper transferred the legal title, which must prevail unless defeated by the prior record of Hirschberg\u2019s deed. If Hirschberg, for a valuable consideration, acquired his deed without notice or knowledge of the execution of the prior deed, it must be conceded that he has the paramount legal title. His deed recites a consideration of $6,100, but it is difficult to ascertain from the evidence what amount he has actually paid on account of the purchase. He assumed, however, the payment of a portion of Christian\u2019s indebtedness, and agreed to pay him the balance of the ^purchase price, and this would furnish a valuable consideration for the conveyance. Before Hirschberg accepted the deed, he sent Christian to the First National Bank for a statement of its demand against him, and was furnished a written memorandum showing that the amount thereof was $2,482.47. Concerning this transaction, the cashier of the bank testifies that Christian demanded, and he furnished him, a statement of his individual indebtedness, but that no request was made for a statement of the firm or other notes on which Christian was liable. This statement cannot become the foundation of an equitable estoppel against the bank, so as to preclude it from recovering more than the amount stated in the. written memorandum, because it was furnished upon a request for a statement of Christian\u2019s individual indebtedness, and not for a statement of the whole demand against him. Nor is Hirschberg in a position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>invoke such an estoppel, for the reason that his agreement with Christian was to pay $6,100 only on account of the purchase of the premises, and hence the amount of Christian\u2019s indebtedness to the bank was immaterial. Hirschberg caused the records of Polk County to be searched, and, finding that they showed the title to the property to be in Christian, he accepted the deed; and this want of notice by the record would give him a perfect title, if it were not for the existence of certain facts of which he had knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Christian testifies that he told Hirschberg he had given Cooper some writing concerning the property, but he did not know the nature or character of the instrument, and, on cross examination, further testifies that Hirschberg knew he had given Cooper a deed of trust. Klemsen, the partner of Christian, says he heard Christian tell Hirschberg he had given Cooper a deed to the land. It also appears that Hirschberg, at the time he was negotiating for the purchase, knew that Thomason was in possession of the premises, and had a conversation with him about the payment of his note, but made no inquiry of him in relation to his right of possession. Such possession was sufficient to put a person of ordinary prudence upon inquiry concerning Thomason\u2019s right thereto, and was constructive notice of everything to which that inquiry might lead: <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>100 Mass. 382; <em>Bohlman </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>4 Or. 313; <em>Petrain </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>23 Or. 455 (32 Pac. 158). \u201cAs a general rule,\u201d says Bean, J., in <em>Exon </em>v. <em>Dancke, </em>24 Or. 110 (32 Pac. 1045), \u201cthe authorities declare that open, notorious, and exclusive possession and occupation of real estate by a stranger to the title is sufficient to put a purchaser from a vendor out of possession upon inquiry as to the legal and equitable rights of the party in possession.\u201d In <em>Pell </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>36 Cal. 268, the court, discussing this question, says: \u201cHe cannot be regarded as a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>chaser in good faith who negligently or willfully closes his eyes to visible, pertinent facts, indicating adverse interest or incumbrances upon the estate he seeks to acquire, and indulges in possibilities \u00f3r probabilities,, and acts upon doubtful presumptions, when, by the exercise of prudent, reasonable diligence, he could fully inform himself of the real facts of the case.\u201d We must, therefore, conclude that Hirschberg, at the time of his purchase, had constructive notice of the unrecorded deed to Cooper, if not actual knowledge of the fact, and that his title mitst be subordinate to the equities created by the prior deed. We are strengthened in this conclusion by the fact that Hirschberg\u2019s deed recites a consideration equivalent to the amount evidenced by Thomason\u2019s note, and the further fact that Hirschberg, soon after obtaining his deed, served on Thomason a written notice that this note was payable to him at its maturity. These circumstances tend in no' small degree to show that Hirschberg knew of and acquiesced in the sale made by Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> The next question for consideration is whether a court of equity can compel Thomason to specifically perform his oral contract of purchase. In discussing this question, it may be well to consider whether Thomason could compel a specific performance of the contract. The deed executed by Cooper, as trustee, to Thomason, and deposited with Hawley, did not contain the terms of the verbal agreement to convey the premises, and in such case it has been held that a deed deposited in escrow, unless it contained a memorandum of the agreement, was inoperative to take the case out of the statute of frauds: <em>Kopp </em>v. <em>Reiter, </em>146 Ill. 437 (34 N. E. 942). The payment of the purchase price is not such a part performance of an oral contract to convey land as to overcome the plea of the statute, but possession in pursuance of the terms of the contract, and improvements made upon land, are sufficient for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>purpose. When possession, in pursuance of the terms of a verbal agreement to convey land, has been taken by the purchaser, he thereby acquires an equitable estate in the premises; and his notorious occupation thereof is such evidence of his equitable title as to overcome the statute, and renders parol proof admissible to establish the terms of the verbal contract upon the faith of which he has acted. Applying this rule to the case at bar, the evidence shows that Thomason, relying upon the validity of the contract made with Cooper, took and retained the possession of the land, and has made valuable improvements thereon. He alleges that he has been damaged in the sum of $1,000, but the evidence fails to show the value of the improvements made by him. It is the universal rule that courts of equity will enforce a parol contract relating to land within the statute of frauds when the refusal to execute it would amount to practicing a fraud: Browne on the Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 438. Where one party has done acts in part execution or upon the faith of the contract, with the knowledge and consent of the other, this will take the case out of the statute: <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>7 Or. 302; <em>Plymale </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>9 Or. 321; <em>Wagonblast </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>12 Or. 83 (6 Pac. 399); <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Scoggins, </em>18 Or. 502 (17 Am. St. Rep. 749, 21 Pac. 558).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> It is the equitable estoppel created by force of the acts, or silent acquiescence of the party who would plead the statute of frauds, that prevents him from doing so. There is no doubt that Thomason in a court of equity could have compelled the specific performance of the contract, had he instituted a suit for that purpose; and, this being so, can the plaintiffs enforce the contract against him? To entitle a party to invoke the aid of equity for the enforcement of a verbal contract to convey real property the acts relied upon as part performance to take the case out of the statute must have been done by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>plaintiff himself: Browne on the Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 453. It is the possesion by the purchaser, in pursuance of the terms of the contract, that entitles him to the specific performance, and, upon the theory of the mutuality of the contract, it is held that the owner should have a right to enforce its terms when he has delivered possession: <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>Good, </em>3 Watts &amp; S. 56; Waterman\u2019s Specific Performance of Contracts, \u00a7 15; Browne on the Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 471. -The deed to Cooper transferred the legal title which drew after it the possession <em>(Swift </em>v. <em>Mulkey, </em>14 Or. 64), and this Cooper, with the consent of Christian, delivered to Thomason. The bank also, relying on the faith of the agreement, advanced money to Christian and to the firm of which he was a member, and, while the payment of the money is not such part performance of a verbal contract as to take the case out of the statute, yet, taken in connection with the delivery of the possession by Cooper as agent for the bank, it was in execution and .amounted to a part performance of the terms of the contract on the part of all the parties to and interested in it, and, as Thomason could compel a specific performance of the contract to convey, the plaintiffs for like reasons are \u25a0entitled to a mutuality of remedies, and can invoke and obtain the aid of a court of equity to compel the specific performance of the agreement to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> It is contended that the decree is inoperative in that it requires Cooper to cause Hawley, who is not a party to this suit, to deliver the deed deposited with him to Thomason upon the payment of said note, or, upon the failure of Hawley to so deliver it within thirty days, that Cooper execute to Thomason a new deed, or, if Cooper neglect or refuse to do either within thirty days from the default of Hawley, that the decree operate as and for a deed to Thomason. It is alleged in the complaint that Hawley had offered and was ready and willing to deliver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the deed to Thomason upon the payment of the note, and this fact is not denied in the answer. The objection to this part of the decree must prove unavailing, for the defendants, knowing that Hawley was not a party, did not demur for defect of parties. This defect was apparent upon the face of the pleading, and the defendants, by failing to demur, have waived their objection to the nonjoinder: Section 71, Hill\u2019s Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><bracketnum>7.</bracketnum> Besides, Thomason is the real party in interest, who is affected by this portion of the decree, and, not having appealed therefrom, it must be presumed he is satisfied therewith. It follows that the decree is correct..</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Affirmed,</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-7\">Mr. Justice Wolverton, having been of counsel in the trial in the court below, took no part in the trial or decision here.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
