J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiI\">It is an interesting phenomenon in our society that frequently the most pedestrian events can achieve constitutional status. In the \u201cFuck the Draft,\u201d free speech case of <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 15 [29 L.Ed.2d 284, 91 S.Ct. 1780], Justice Harlan said: \u201cThis case may seem at first blush too inconsequential to find its way into our books, but the issue it presents is of no small constitutional significance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 16 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 288].) We have similar feelings in this case where we are asked to determine whether John V.\u2019s act of calling his neighbor a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d violated Penal Code section 415, subdivision (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That section makes it a misdemeanor for a person to use offensive words in a public place which are inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">As we shall explain we reject John\u2019s several constitutional arguments and aifirm the order modifying one of its probationary terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">Sixteen-year-old John and Nancy W. are neighbors. John screamed \u201cfucking bitch\u201d at W. as she drove past his house, about 15 to 25 feet away. W. was startled. She felt fear and shock. When she arrived home she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>angry. Her anger then turned to fury. She became incoherent, enraged and humiliated. John had been screaming at her and calling her obscene names for about three years. Included within his repertoire of epithets were \u201cwhore,\u201d \u201cfucking bitch,\u201d \u201cbitch,\u201d and \u201cfucking liar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Police Officer Rebecca Bigbie responded to W.\u2019s telephone call. John admitted to Bigbie he had a big mouth; he needed to learn to control it.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">At trial John admitted hollering \u201cfucking bitch\u201d at W. because \u201cshe flipped me off as she was going by.\u201d Although W. conceded giving him a vulgar gesture (\u201cthe finger\u201d) on previous occasions she denied doing so on this day. On an earlier occasion John\u2019s obscene language made W. so angry she swung at him with a baseball bat. She missed and hit her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The court found John violated section 415(3) and ordered him placed on probation. One probation condition was that John was \u201cto have no contact with W. directly or indirectly, nor [was he] to make any motions towards her or any comments to her or about her in her presence or out of her presence.\u201d John appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">John contends section 415(3) is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. He says the former condition violates his rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 2, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution; the latter violates his right to due process of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Even though an overbreadth challenge is concerned with the risk of punishing a constitutionally protected right, in this case free speech, while a vagueness challenge is directed to due process, judicial responsibility in addressing both arguments is essentially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">A court should not find a statute facially overbroad when a limiting construction can be placed on it to remove the seeming threat to constitutionally protected speech. <em>(Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 601, 613 [37 L.Ed.2d 830, 840, 93 S.Ct. 2908].)  Similarly \u201c[t]he judiciary bears an obligation to \u2018construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague.\u2019 [Citation.] ... \u2018A statute will not be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>construction can be given its language.\u2019 [Citation.] If by fair and reasonable interpretation we can construe [a statute], to sustain its validity, we must adopt such interpretation.\u201d <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 253 [58 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].) Thus we proceed to answer John\u2019s dual constitutional attack by examining the language of the statute in light of its legislative and decisional history. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mirmirani </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 375, 383-384 [178 Cal.Rptr. 792, 636 P.2d 1130].) In doing so we must remember \u201c[t]he meaning of the language of the statute can appear either on the face of the statute or from any \u2018established technical or common law meaning.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">To say we do not write on a clean slate on John\u2019s arguments is to understate the obvious. Section 415 in one form or another has had an interesting, dynamic and surprisingly long life. For a relatively innocuous misdemeanor it has traveled to high places: intrastate to the California Supreme Court in <em>In re Bushman </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 767 [83 Cal.Rptr. 375, 463 P.2d 727] and <em>In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 612 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017]; interstate to the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. 15. These judicial experiences have been embellished by side trips to Sacramento where the Legislature has treated court-inflicted wounds. Full legislative revitalization was attempted in 1974 when section 415 was repealed and replaced by a new statute with the same number designed to meet constitutional limitations. Amendments were also made in 1976. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1263, \u00a7 2, p. 2742 amended by Stats. 1976, ch. 298, \u00a7 1, p. 606, see 2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1983 supp.) Crimes Against Public Peace and Welfare, \u00a7 621, p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The statutory or common law counterparts to section 415 from other states are equally well traveled, having visited the United States Supreme Court on many occasions over the last 50 years. These cases, generally of humble origin, are microcosms of the political climate in our country at particular times and places. Viewed retrospectively they represent a continuum of judicial concern with the fundamental right to free speech protected by the First Amendment. Whether the problems of expression arise in the context of religion <em>(Cantwell </em>v. <em>State of Connecticut </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 296 [84 L.Ed. 1213, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A.L.R. 1352]; <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 568 [86 L.Ed. 1031, 62 S.Ct. 766]), civil rights <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 229 [9 L.Ed.2d 697, 83 S.Ct. 680]; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1964) 379 U.S. 536 [13 L.Ed.2d 471, 85 S.Ct. 453]; <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294]), political disillusionment with the government and its treatment of blacks <em>(Street </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 576 [22 L.Ed.2d 572, 89 S.Ct. 1354]) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>or its involvement in Vietnam <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. 15; <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 518 [31 L.Ed.2d 408, 92 S.Ct. 1103]; <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 105 [38 L.Ed.2d 303, 94 S.Ct. 326]), or potential interference with law enforcement <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 130 [39 L.Ed.2d 214, 94 S.Ct. 970]), the United States Supreme Court has consistently, firmly and eloquently explained why abridgment of free speech will not be tolerated. Recognizing the First Amendment may be the \u201cmost majestic guarantee\u201d (Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) \u00a7 12-1, p. 576), Supreme Court justices have repeated the principle that drafters of the Constitution \u201cbelieved that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; . . . Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law\u2014the argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed. \u201d <em>(Whitney </em>v. <em>People of State of California </em>(1927) 274 U.S. 357, 375-376 [71 L.Ed. 1095, 1105-1106, 47 S.Ct. 641] cone. opn. of Brand\u00e9is, J.) \u201cThe constitutional right of free expression is powerful medicine in a society as diverse and populous as ours.\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. at p. 24 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 293].) \u201c[I]t is only through free debate and free exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and peaceful change is effected. The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is therefore one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes.\u201d <em>(Terminiello </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 1, 4 [93 L.Ed. 1131, 1134, 69 S.Ct. 894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">This historical perspective is important here for two reasons. The first is that these cases emphasizing the majestic guarantee of free speech highlight what the case before us is not about. Under no stretch of the imagination can John\u2019s comments be construed as having political or social import. Second, the foregoing authorities categorically state that protected free speech under the First Amendment is not without limitation. One such limitation is the \u201cfighting words\u201d exception as expressed in <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra, </em>315 U.S. 568.  \u201c[I]t is well understood that the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances. There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and insulting or \u2018fighting\u2019 words\u2014those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 571-572 [86 L.Ed. at p. 1035], fns. omitted.) In California it is well established that the First Amendment does not protect words specifically addressed to another spoken under circumstances which create a clear and present danger that violence will imminently erupt. <em>(In re Brown, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 618 explaining <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. 15.) \u201c[T]he mere use of a vulgar, profane, indecorous, scurrilous, opprobrious epithet cannot alone be grounds for prosecution. . . . The context in which the words are used must be considered, and there must be a showing that the words were uttered in a provocative manner, so that there was a clear and present danger violence would erupt.\u201d <em>(Jefferson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 721, 724-725 [124 Cal.Rptr. 507].) Although protected conduct may begin with the expression of opinion, it must stop with the perpetration of violence. <em>(In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 223 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The legislative response to judicial interpretation of the First Amendment has been prompt. In 1974, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans, supra, </em>415 U.S. 130 declared a New Orleans ordinance unconstitutionally overbroad. The court explained that only \u201cfighting words\u201d or words which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an <em>immediate </em>breach of the peace could be proscribed. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 133 [39 L.Ed.2d at p. 219].) The Legislature reacted to this decision by repealing section 415 and enacting a new section 415. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1263, \u00a7 2, p. 2742.) In 1976 section 415 was amended again to change the definition of \u201coffensive\u201d words. The phrase \u201cinherently likely to produce a violent reaction\u201d was replaced with \u201cinherently likely to <em>provoke an immediate </em>violent reaction. ...\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 298, \u00a7 1, p. 606, italics supplied.) The Legislature made this further effort to insure the constitutionality of the statute. Aware of <em>Chaplinsky </em>and <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>405 U.S. 518, the Legislature attempted to remove all doubt about the constitutionality of section 415 by requiring the threatened breach of the peace be immediate. <em>(Review of Selected 1976 California Legislation </em>(1977) 8 Pacific L.J. 275.)  Section 415(3) as enacted and construed by the courts is not unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">A vagueness argument necessarily concerns our interpretation of \u201cwords\u201d which inevitably contain germs of uncertainty. There are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief which present problems of interpretation. <em>(Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>413 U.S. 601, 608 [37 L.Ed.2d 830, 837, 73 S.Ct. 2908].)  But a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>statute is not vague if an ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with its language. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Even though words may be marked by \u201cflexibility and reasonable breadth, rather than meticulous specificity\u201d it is sufficient if a statute gives fair notice to those to whom it is directed. <em>(Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. 104 at p. 110.) \u201c \u2018The presumptive validity of the legislative act militates against invalidating a statute merely \u201c. . . because difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal offenses fall within . . . [its] language\u201d \u2019 [citations.] We are not obligated to \u2018consider every conceivable situation which might arise under the language of the statute\u2019 [citation], so long as it may be given \u2018a reasonable and practical construction in accordance with the probable intent of the Legislature\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 798, 810 [201 Cal.Rptr. 311, 678 P.2d 886].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Unless we are prepared to reject the \u201cfighting words\u201d exception to the First Amendment we must accept the premise that there are certain words in our society which when directly communicated to a person under certain circumstances will in fact provoke an immediate violent reaction. As infrequent as that situation may be we are satisfied it occurred in the case before us. We are hard pressed to think of a more volatile situation than the one here when John decided to provoke W. once again by calling her a \u201cfucking bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We understand \u201cfuck\u201d is now a ubiquitous term frequently heard in movies or songs or overheard in essentially every social environment. We are also aware <em>Cohen </em>explained \u201cthe particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric.\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>403 U.S. at p. 25 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 294].) But our concern is not with improving the auditory ambiance of the community by excising certain words which some may think are offensive. Rather it is with the right of the Legislature to assure public peace by proscribing conduct which causes violence. The statute as now rewritten with what we believe is the narrow specificity necessary to withstand constitutional scrutiny validly serves that purpose. As applied here it gave fair notice to John what he could not lawfully say to W. in a public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">John additionally argues the statute is unconstitutional because it lacks a scienter requirement. He includes in his parade of horribles a scenario describing the person whom he says can be unjustly convicted even though he or she did not reasonably know the words used were \u201coffensive.\u201d Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>this may be a dramatic argument it is fallacious. Under such circumstances the person would not be guilty of section 415(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Section 20 provides that \u201cIn every crime or public offense there must exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, or criminal negligence. \u201d  Section 415(3) is not a strict liability offense.  \u201cA person does not act unlawfully where he commits an act under an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of certain facts and circumstances which, if true, would make the act lawful. \u2018When a person commits an act based on a mistake of fact, his guilt or innocence is determined as if the facts were as he perceived them. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 736, 742-743 [203 Cal.Rptr. 842], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 823, 831 [194 Cal.Rptr. 633].)  A defendant cannot be convicted under section 415(3) where from all the evidence the trier of fact has a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant reasonably and in good faith believed the language used was not inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 529, 535-536 [39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673, 8 A.L.R.3d 1092].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">John\u2019s arguments on vagueness and scienter are theoretical only. John is no stranger to either using or understanding vulgar words. He intentionally directed selected epithets at W. to provoke her. In light of the relationship between the parties his last recitation of these words in a public place created the clear and present danger that violence would immediately erupt. (9) (See fn. 3.) There is no basis to conclude the court applied the wrong legal standard. There is ample evidence to support the court\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Consistent with our discussion of the protection afforded by the state and federal Constitutions we hold the court\u2019s probationary order re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>straining John from making comments about W. out of her presence is invalid because it is overly broad, including situations which would effectively preclude John from discussing W. with anyone including his lawyer or members of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The probation condition preventing John from talking or commenting about W. out of her presence is stricken.

All further constitutional references are to the federal Constitution there being no legal reason in this case for us to rely upon the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">John\u2019s opening brief contains a footnote in which he tersely states section 415(3) violates the equal protection clause of the United States and California Constitutions. He does not furnish us with the reasons for this statement. Presumably his contention is based on the different treatment afforded conduct as compared to speech. In other words he believes section 415(3) unlawfully discriminates against those who orally express obscene or vulgar words while excluding those who make similar expressions through informative gestures by hand, finger or otherwise. We do not view this distinction as being arbitrary. A state may distinguish between different groups of individuals provided the classifications created bear a rational relationship to a legitimate public purpose. <em>(In re King </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 226, 231 [90 Cal.Rptr. 15, 474 P.2d 983], cert. den. 403 U.S. 931 [29 L.Ed.2d 709, 91 S.Ct. 2249].) As difficult as it is to determine what is meant by \u201cfighting words\u201d at least this determination is legally and factually possible. It is virtually impossible to do the same with conduct. The Legislature simply decided to limit the scope of section 415(3) to words rather than undertaking the impossible task of including conduct. On this basis alone the distinction is rational. Section 415(3) is not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
