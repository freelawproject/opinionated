We also hold that Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (e)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits more than one of three enhancements to be imposed for a single offense except for attempted or actual robbery, rape or burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Defendant Ronald Hopkins was convicted after a court trial of the following crimes: count I, attempted robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211/664); count II, burglary (\u00a7 459); count III, possession of a sawed-off shotgun (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)); count IV, assault with a firearm on one Lloyd Perry (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)); count V, assault with a deadly weapon on one Ronald Rlauer (\u00a7 245, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(a)(1)); counts VI-XVIII, XX and XXII-XXVI involve false imprisonment of 19 persons (\u00a7 236). The court also found true the following enhancements set forth as special allegations: first enhancement, use of a firearm (\u00a7 12022.5); second enhancement, intentional infliction of great bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.7 and 1203.075); third enhancement, personal use of a deadly weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)); fourth enhancement, armed with a firearm, having previously been convicted of felonies (\u00a7 1203.06, subd. (a)(2)); fifth enhancement, four prior serious felony convictions (a 1972 robbery, assault with intent to commit robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and an ex-felon in possession of a firearm [\u00a7\u00a7 667, 1192.7]); seventh enhancement, service of a prior prison term (a 1972 conviction for robbery, assault with intent to commit robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and an ex-felon in possession of a firearm) and failure to remain free of prison custody for a period of five years after serving that prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)); eighth enhancement, service of a prior prison term (a 1975 conviction for possession of drugs/alcohol in prison) and failure to remain free of prison custody for a period of five years after serving that prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of nineteen years and four months, calculated as follows: The upper base term of four years on count IV, assault with a firearm on Lloyd Perry, deemed to be the principal term; consecutive terms of one year on count V, assault with a deadly weapon on Ronald Klauer; and eight months on count III, possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Sentence was stayed pursuant to section 654 on counts I, II, VI through XVIII, XX and XXII through XXVI. Additionally, the sentence was enhanced by a consecutive term of thirteen years, calculated as follows: Two years on the first enhancement (use of a firearm); three years on the second enhancement (intentional infliction of great bodily injury); one year on the third enhancement (use of a deadly weapon); five years on the fifth enhancement (1972 serious felony convictions, \u00a7 667); one year on the seventh enhancement (1972 prior prison term, \u00a7 667.5); and one year on the eighth enhancement (1975 prior prison term, \u00a7 667.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Finally, defendant was sentenced to a consecutive term of eight months for an attempted escape from county jail while awaiting trial in violation of section 4532, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court made sentencing errors. In reviewing the calculation of defendant\u2019s sentence, we are bound by the court\u2019s findings of fact and sentence choices made when judgment was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">At 7:40 p.m. on January 16, 1983, defendant was seen entering the K &amp; S Market. Shortly after 5 a.m. on the following day, he was encountered by Sergio Ruedas, a stock clerk. Defendant was wearing a blue and white ski mask and was armed with a sawed-off shotgun. He forced Mr. Ruedas to go from a warehouse upstairs down into the main part of the store. There, both men encountered Ronald Klauer, manager and part owner of the market. Defendant forced both men into the nearby men\u2019s restroom which was occupied by Charles Castillo, a truck driver for a food wholesaler.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Defendant told Castillo and Ruedas to remain in the restroom and ordered Klauer to go to the office in the northeast corner of the store. He cocked his weapon and told Klauer to open the safe. When Klauer was unable to remember the combination, defendant threatened to cut off his fingers with a machete that he produced from his pants. He pressed the blade against Klauer\u2019s neck and stomach; when Klauer was unable to open the safe, defendant hit him in the back of the head with the butt of the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">After Klauer\u2019s unsuccessful effort to open the safe, defendant directed 17 store employees to go to the restroom; these 17 people joined Castillo and Ruedas in the restroom. One of the employees, Emma Lamb, eluded defendant\u2019s sweep of the store, went to the locked front doors, and asked a passerby to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Meanwhile, defendant and Klauer proceeded to the rear of the store and were met by Lloyd Perry, a bread salesman. Defendant pointed a shotgun at Perry and pulled him inside the building. Klauer then grabbed defendant\u2019s shotgun and a struggle ensued. While Klauer and defendant were struggling over the shotgun, Perry started to hit the defendant over the head with a plastic price label marker. At some point during the struggle, defendant\u2019s gun discharged and wounded Perry in the leg. Defendant pulled the machete out of his pants and put the blade to Klauer\u2019s throat. Klauer cut his hand when he grabbed the machete and pulled it away from defendant. In the struggle, defendant\u2019s mask was removed. Defendant fled and was quickly apprehended by the police. Three of the people involved in the incident positively identified defendant in court as the man who had attempted to rob the K &amp; S Market.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Section 654 provides that an \u201cact or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>under more than one . . . .\u201d Whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of this section depends on the intent and objective of the actor; if all offenses were incident to one objective, defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses, but not for more than one. <em>(Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Defendant correctly contends that the trial court\u2019s eight-month sentence imposed for possession of the sawed-off shotgun, count III, was improper. Defendant argues that possession of the shotgun was merely incidental to, and was part of defendant\u2019s overall objective of accomplishing a robbery. Although defendant was convicted for the crime of attempted robbery, sentence for that crime was not imposed but was stayed. Sentence was imposed for the two assaults. There was no evidence of an antecedent possession of the firearm; the evidence showed a possession only in conjunction with these greater offenses. The result of imposing an additional consecutive sentence here for possession of a firearm would therefore be a violation of section 654 in that it would constitute a multiple punishment for the assaults. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hays </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 534, 552-553 [195 Cal.Rptr. 252]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 314, 317 [150 Cal.Rptr. 93].) The sentence imposed on count III must be stayed, with the stay becoming permanent upon completion of the imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erred in imposing a one-year consecutive prison term on count V, assault upon Klauer with the machete and the shotgun, because that assault was incident to one overall criminal objective\u2014the robbery of the K &amp; S Market. Defendant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 809 [103 Cal.Rptr. 337] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Flowers </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 584 [183 Cal.Rptr. 276], That reliance is misplaced. In those cases, it was ruled error to impose sentences on a single assault and a single robbery conviction where both were part of an indivisible course of conduct with a single objective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>at pp. 823-824; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flowers, supra, </em>at p. 588.) While we agree that the assault with a deadly weapon upon Klauer was incidental to the attempted robbery, sentence was <em>not </em>imposed on both convictions. Sentence on the attempted robbery conviction was stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">As a general rule, even though a defendant entertains a single principal objective during an indivisible course of conduct, he may be convicted and punished for each crime of violence committed against a different victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 885 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552].) Assault is recognized as a crime of violence in this context. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prater </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 695, 699 [139 Cal.Rptr. 566].) Sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was properly imposed on count V, the assault with a deadly weapon on Ronald Klauer, as well as on count IV, the wounding of Lloyd Perry with the shotgun. Since the sentence for the attempted robbery was stayed, there was no violation of section 654. If defendant\u2019s argument were accepted it would result in a staying of the sentences for both the attempted robbery and the assault on Klauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">As his third contention, defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence under sections 667 and 667.5, subdivision (b) violates section 654. The trial court imposed a five-year enhancement under section 667 for the four 1972 serious felony convictions (fifth enhancement), and a one-year enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b) for failing to remain free from custody for five years after serving a prior prison term for the 1972 felony convictions (seventh enhancement). Defendant correctly argues that the trial court\u2019s use of these same 1972 felony convictions to enhance his sentence under sections 667 and 667.5 violates the proscription against multiple punishment under section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Section 654 generally proscribes punishing the same act twice under different enhancement statutes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 534, 543 [193 Cal.Rptr. 193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moringlane </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 811, 818 [179 Cal.Rptr. 726] [disagreeing with the language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Boerner </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 506, 511 [174 Cal.Rptr. 629], which suggests that \u00a7 654 does not apply to enhancements].) The same fact may not be used to justify imposition of the upper base term and to enhance a defendant\u2019s prison sentence. (\u00a7 1170, subd. (b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 441(c).) The same factor cannot be used to impose two enhancements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 67 [171 Cal.Rptr. 365].) \u201cCommon sense leads to the conclusion that the Legislature, having expressed its concern with the dual use of facts both to aggravate and enhance, has expressed a policy equally applicable to dual use of the same fact to impose two enhancements. Further indication of this policy can be seen in the prohibition of Penal Code section 654 against multiple punishment for one criminal act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 79.) The <em>Flores </em>court reasoned that reversal was not required in light of the multitude of valid factors that were considered by the trial court in its decision to impose consecutive sentences, and the fact that it was not reasonably probable that in the absence of the invalid factor a different result would have occurred. (Id., at p. 80.) This is not the situation in this case.  A single fact\u2014the 1972 felony convictions\u2014was relied on as a basis for imposing both the five-year section 667 enhancement (fifth enhancement) and the one-year section 667.5 enhancement (seventh enhancement). This dual use of defendant\u2019s criminal past violates section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The People contend that there was no dual use problem in this case. They argue that under section 667 the simple fact of <em>conviction </em>of a specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>offense is sufficient to trigger the five-year enhancement under section 667. The People attempt to distinguish this with the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, arguing that under this section the defendant must be (a) convicted of a specified crime, (b) imprisoned, and (c) unable to remain free for five years. Therefore, they argue that the court is using different facts, conviction alone (\u00a7 667) and imprisonment (\u00a7 667.5), to impose two different punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The same argument was considered and rejected in an analogous context in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 534. In <em>Carter, </em>defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced under both section 667.5, subdivision (a), which provides an enhancement for each \u201cprior separate prison term served\u201d and section 667.6, subdivision (a), which provides an enhancement where the defendant \u201chas been convicted previously of any\u201d enumerated forcible sex offense. In <em>Carter, </em>the court reasoned: \u201cThe fact one statute talks of a \u2018prison term\u2019 while the other talks of a \u2018conviction\u2019 is a distinction without a difference. It is the prior sex offense that is the \u2018act\u2019 for purposes of section 654. The fact that some forcible sex convictions might result in a prison term (punishable under \u00a7 667.5) while others may not, does not alter the circumstances of this case, in which defendant\u2019s prior rape resulted in both a conviction and a prison term. The prior <em>sex offense </em>is the act which is the object of both statutes and therefore may be punished under either section, but not both.\u201d <em>(Id,., </em>at p. 542, italics added.) The acts which are being punished under two different statutes are defendant\u2019s 1972 offenses of robbery, assault, and possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The People\u2019s final contention is that <em>Carter </em>should be disregarded to the extent that it failed to consider one of the arguments set out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurley </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 706 [192 Cal.Rptr. 805]. In <em>Hurley, </em>the court determined that it was not unfair to aggravate the base term for numerous prior convictions, which also included prior convictions used for enhancement purposes, yet enhance the sentence for serving a prior prison term under section 667.5 because \u201c[different qualitative factors are involved.\u201d (Id<em>., </em>at p. 713.) <em>Hurley </em>does not compel a different conclusion. The trial court\u2019s pronouncement at the time of sentencing reasonably indicates a desire to impose the greater of two punishments, should any punishment be invalidated. Accordingly, the one-year term imposed on the seventh enhancement is stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing more than one enhancement on a single offense in violation of section 1170.1, subdivision (e). Section 1170.1, subdivision (e) provides that if two or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>enhancements under sections 12022, 12022.5 and 12022.7 may be imposed for a single offense, only the greatest shall actually be imposed, except in cases of actual or attempted robbery, rape or burglary. Section 1170.1, subdivision (e) permits imposition of only one enhancement\u2014for intentional infliction of great bodily injury\u2014on the offense of assault with a firearm (count IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Finally, the trial court is not precluded from imposing the first enhancement (use of a firearm) on count V (assault with a deadly weapon on Ronald Klauer), provided the third enhancement (use of a deadly weapon) is vacated. Only one-third of that enhancement may be imposed. Section 1170.1, subdivision (a) provides that the subordinate term for any offense which is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d shall include one-third of any enhancements imposed pursuant to sections 12022, 12022.5 or 12022.7. The assault on Ronald Klauer was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d because defendant used a firearm when he hit Klauer on the back of the head with the butt of the shotgun. (See \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(8); <em>People </em>v. <em>Walls </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 447, 454 [149 Cal.Rptr. 460].) The trial court erred in imposing a full two-year enhancement for use of a firearm and should have imposed only one-third of that term. The first enhancement must therefore be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Based on the court\u2019s findings of fact and sentence choices, defendant\u2019s sentence must be recalculated as follows: The eight-month sentence on count III is stayed, with the stay becoming permanent upon completion of the imposed sentence; the seventh enhancement is vacated; the third enhancement is vacated; the first enhancement is modified and reduced to eight months. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is ordered to modify the abstract of judgment so that it conforms to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Principal Term:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">Four years (upper term imposed on count IV)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">Three years (second enhancement imposed on count IV)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">\n<em>Subordinate Term:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">One year (one-third of the midterm imposed on count V)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">Eight months (one-third of the first enhancement, imposed on count V)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-13\">Eight months (one-third of the midterm imposed for the attempted escape)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-14\">\n<em>Other Enhancements:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-15\">Five years (fifth enhancement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-16\">One year (eighth enhancement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-17\">\n<em>Total:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-18\">Fifteen years, four months</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>King, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-12\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Additional enhancements were alleged in the complaint, but they are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b114-4\">HANING, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4e\">I concur except for the directions to the superior court.
