By the complaint, Eiko Mueller sought her community property interest in her former husband\u2019s (Donald Leroy Walker) military pension benefits. The military pension was previously awarded to Walker as his separate property in a divorce decree which became final in October 1982. The trial court held the prior decision to be res judicata, barring relitigation of the military pension issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The 16V\u00a3-year marriage of Eiko Mueller (wife) and Donald Leroy Walker (husband) was dissolved by a final judgment on August 23, 1982, incorporating the provisions of an interlocutory judgment entered July 15, 1982. The parties were married in 1964. Husband was in the United States Marine Corps during the marriage. In the judgment of dissolution, husband was awarded, inter alia, the retirement benefits from his military pension as his \u201csole and separate property.\u201d The judgment also contained an \u201cafter-discovered property\u201d provision which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered that in the event there is any after-discovered property that would have been community property or quasi-community property under the law applicable as of the date of separation of the parties hereto, the said property will be divided equally between the parties hereto, share and share alike; in the event said after-discovered property has been wilfully concealed by one of the parties hereto, then and in that event the concealing party will transfer or convey to the other party, at the other party\u2019s election,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered that the court reserves jurisdiction in this proceeding to dispose of any after-discovered property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered that the herein order is not intended to impair the availability, in a court of competent jurisdiction, of any other remedy arising from the undisclosed ownership.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>When the judgment of dissolution of marriage became final, the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 210 [69 L.Ed.2d 589, 101 S.Ct. 2728], decided June 26, 1981, expressed the controlling law as to military retirement pay. <em>McCarty </em>held, upon dissolution of marriage, federal law precluded a state court from dividing military nondisability retired pay pursuant to state community property laws. The United States Congress quickly responded to the <em>McCarty </em>decision by enacting the Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act (FUSFSPA). (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408.) FUSFSPA became effective February 1, 1983, and provides in part: \u201c[A] court may treat disposable retired or retainer pay payable to a member for pay periods beginning after June 25, 1981, either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court.\u201d (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">This language, together with the legislative history of FUSFSPA, has been declared to be a clear indication by Congress \u201c \u2018to abrogate all applications of the <em>McCarty </em>decision (see J. Explanatory Statement of the Com. on Conf. on Pub.L. No. 97-252 from House Conf. Rep. No. 97-749, Aug. 167, 1982, pp. 166-168, Cong. Rec., vol. 128 (1982)).\u2019 <em>(In re Marriage of Buikema </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 689, 691 . . .).\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Ankenman </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 833, 837 [191 Cal.Rptr. 292].) In addition, appellate court decisions have concluded Congress intended \u2018\u201c. . .the law relative to community property treatment of military retirement pensions be as though <em>McCarty </em>did not exist, i.e., that such pensions would be subject to division as community property before and after June 25, 1981.\u2019 <em>(In re Marriage of Frederick </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 876, 879 . . . .)\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Ankenman, supra, </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Despite the intention FUSFSPA be applied retroactively in order to abrogate all applications of the <em>McCarty </em>decision, FUSFSPA has been held applicable only to those cases not yet final as of its effective date, i.e., February 1, 1983. (See <em>In re Marriage of Hopkins </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 350, 356-360 [191 Cal.Rptr. 70]; <em>In re Marriage of Fairfull </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 532, 535 [207 Cal.Rptr. 523].)  Here, the judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage became final before the effective date of FUSFSPA. Consequently, FUSFSPA does not have retroactive application to allow reopening of a final judgment. Based upon these cases, husband argues res judicata bars wife\u2019s action for partition and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">It is true as a general principle of law after the trial court has divided the property, and the judgment has become final, the court loses jurisdiction to modify or alter the division made. <em>(Bodle </em>v. <em>Bodle </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 758 [143 Cal.Rptr. 115].) An exception to this general rule, however, arises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>in cases where the court expressly reserves jurisdiction to modify a property award. <em>(In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 838 [126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561, 94 A.L.R.3d 164]; <em>In re Marriage of Fink </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 357 [126 Cal.Rptr. 626]; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 4800, subd. (a).)  Wife unmeritoriously argues the \u201cafter-discovered property\u201d provision of the judgment is applicable to husband\u2019s military pension because she acquired a community property interest in the pension after the judgment was entered by virtue of the enactment of FUSFSPA. No authority has been tendered or found to support the theory that an after-discovered property provision may be invoked in order to assert an \u201cafter-acquired interest\u201d in property which was specifically mentioned and disposed of in the final judgment of dissolution. There is authority to the contrary. (See e.g., <em>Henn </em>v. <em>Henn </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 323, 330 [161 Cal.Rptr. 502, 605 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Due to the application of res judicata principles, the <em>McCarty </em>decision continued to state the controlling law as to those judgment decrees which became final during the 18-month hiatus created by the enactment of FUSFSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">To bridge the hiatus, the California Legislature enacted Civil Code section 5124 (eff. Jan. 1, 1984) permitting modification of a community property settlement, judgment or decree which became final on or after June 25, 1981, and before February 1, 1983\u2014the 18-month hiatus period\u2014to include a division of military retirement benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Modification is authorized regardless whether the settlement, judgment or decree reserved jurisdiction over the pension or treated the pension as other than community property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Thus, by positive act the Legislature has superseded and modified the preclusive effect of the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel as applied to military retirement benefits in decrees or judgments or settlements which became final in the specified time frame. Civil Code section 5124 in most clear and explicit language authorizes the remedy sought here by wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">It is argued Civil Code section 5124 violates due process; it authorizes a taking of property without due process if applied, as it expressly provides, to judgments which became final before February 1, 1983, and which did not reserve jurisdiction over the military pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Absent an indication of any purpose upon the part of the state authority (whether legislative or judicial) to evade some prior decision of the United States Supreme Court or federal Congress, the principles of finality protecting the parties to this litigation (res judicata or collateral estoppel) are, within the broad limits of fundamental fairness, solely the concern of state law. <em>(Konigsberg </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 36, 44 [6 L.Ed.2d 105, 112, 81 S.Ct. 997, 1003].) \u201cThe rule of <em>res adjudicata </em>is to prevent vexatious litigation. \u201d <em>(Miller &amp; Lux Inc. </em>v. <em>James </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 38, 44 [179 P. 174].) It is for the public good that there be an end to litigation. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Krumsiek </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 411 [280 P.2d 486].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">If it be assumed arguendo there is a \u201ctaking\u201d by the legislative negation of the finality of a judgment, such taking may be constitutional where public policy and fairness considerations are great. Thus, the Legislature may modify the doctrine of res judicata, allow relitigation, for reasonable public policy grounds or other \u201crational bas[e]s.\u201d <em>(Deas </em>v. <em>Knapp </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 69, 79 [171 Cal.Rptr. 823, 623 P.2d 775]; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Department of Real Estate </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 1, 5 [195 Cal.Rptr. 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The leading and dispostive case on this constitutional issue is <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371], where the 1972 amendment to Civil Code section 5118 making postseparation earnings separate property was held retroactive. In <em>Bouquet, </em>the parties agreed \u201cthat amended section 5118 can be applied retroactively if such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>a retroactive application is necessary to subserve a sufficiently important state interest. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 593.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In face of the argument of an unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d of property, the Supreme Court reasoned: \u201cThe application of the quasi-community property legislation to property acquired before its effective date clearly impaired the husband\u2019s vested property rights; prior to the enactment of the legislation he had been the sole owner of certain property and afterwards the property belonged to the community. Nevertheless, we deemed the retroactive application of the legislation a proper exercise of the police power. The state\u2019s paramount interest in the equitable distribution of marital property upon dissolution of the marriage, we concluded, justified the impairment of the husband\u2019s vested property rights. (See generally <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1942) 317 U.S. 287, 298 . . . .)\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 583, 593; fn. omitted.) and: \u201cRetroactive legislation, though frequently disfavored, is not absolutely proscribed. The vesting of property rights, consequently, does not render them immutable: \u2018 \u201cVested rights, of course, may be impaired \u2018with due process of law\u2019 under many circumstances. The state\u2019s inherent sovereign power includes the so-called \u2018police power\u2019 right to interfere with vested property rights whenever reasonably necessary to the protection of the health, safety, morals, and general well being of the people. . . . The constitutional question, on principle, therefore, would seem to be, not whether a vested right is impaired by a marital property law change, but whether such a change reasonably could be believed to be sufficiently necessary to the public welfare as to justify the impairment\u2019. \u201d <em>(Addison </em>v. <em>Addison, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 566 . . ., quoting Armstrong, <em>\u2018Prospective \u2019 Application of Changes in Community Property Control\u2014Rule of Property or Constitutional </em>Necessity? (1945) 33 Cal.L.Rev. 476, 495.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 592, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In determining whether Civil Code section 5124 contravenes the due process clause, we must consider inter alia the significance of the state interest served and the importance of retroactive application to effectuate that interest. (See generally Reppy, <em>Retroactivity of the 1975 California Community Property Reforms </em>(1975) 48 So.Cal.L.Rev. 977, 1048-1049; Note, <em>Retroactive Application of California\u2019s Community Property Statutes </em>(1966) 18 Stan.L.Rev. 514, 518, 519, 521, 522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We conclude the language of this section as well as its legislative history<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> leave no doubt that any property divisions made in reliance upon the <em>McCarty </em>decision which became final before the effective date of FUSFSPA are susceptible to redivision as community property so long as action is taken before the scheduled repeal date. This law is a clear expression of legislative intent that recovery of a community property interest in a military pension benefit should not be barred simply because the case by chance falls into the 18-month gap between the effective dates of FUSFSPA and the <em>McCarty </em>decision. Section 5124 contemplates persons such as wife here should be entitled to the same protections as those persons whose judgments of dissolution did not become final during that same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Here, no subtle balance is required for the legislative intent is patent, clear, explicit, and the state\u2019s \u201cparamount interest\u201d in the equitable distribution of marital property upon dissolution of the marriage points to section 5124 as proper exercise of the police power. Finally, such a curative type of legislation supplements and carries into effect the congressional intent of FUSFSPA (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(2)) to \u201cabrogate all applications of the <em>McCarty </em>decision.\u201d We hold that section 5124 authorizes the modification of the final judgment here to include a division of military retirement benefits. To this end the wife\u2019s pleadings may be amended to state a claim for relief under Civil Code section 5124.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Brown (Gerald), P.
