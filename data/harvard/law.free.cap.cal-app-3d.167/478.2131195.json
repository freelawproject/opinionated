We conclude the findings of the Board are legally inadequate to support a dismissal and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Lanny Vance and Len Cimino, City of Fairfield police officers, were on special duty to make security checks in residential and school areas where there had been incidents of burglary. As they pulled into the parking lot of an elementary school at approximately 10 p.m., they saw a figure running westerly in the yard area. Officer Vance accelerated the patrol car, and the figure ran into the bushes in front of a fence separating the school grounds from the residential area. The officers apprehended appellant wearing thongs, female undergarments and an unbuttoned white cotton shirt. No other persons were in the area. Appellant identified himself; his residence was adjacent to the west school fence. The officers detained appellant for questioning, determined he had committed no crime, and released him.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Officer Vance made a report of the incident and referred a copy to CMF. He felt \u201cthe capacity that [appellant] was working in that it should be brought to the attention of the [szc] superiors . . . .\u201d Vance also felt that appellant had at all times been completely truthful and straightforward with the officers, and that he did not conceal any information. Vance testified at the subsequent hearing he \u201creally didn\u2019t think [the report] would go this far.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">As a result of this incident, appellant was dismissed pursuant to Government Code section 19572 subdivision (t),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which permits discipline of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>employee for \u201cfailure of good behavior either during or outside of duty hours which is of such a nature that it causes discredit to the appointing authority or the person\u2019s employment.\u201d The matter was heard before a Board hearing officer, who made the following pertinent findings: \u201c[Appellant] was considered a good Officer and had no blemishes on his prior seven-year employment record. However, it must be found that the dismissal action was warranted, [par.] [Appellant] has attributed his wearing of female clothing to job-related stress which he now feels he can handle. But it must be recognized that this incident is widely known at the institution and would as a practical matter cause [appellant] to have great difficulty in working with other Correctional Officers and inmates. This in itself would create a difficult if not impossible situation and in addition would place [appellant] in an atmosphere far more stressful than the normal job circumstances which existed at the time of the . . . episode, [par.] The Department [of Corrections] just cannot be required to run the risk of employing [appellant] in a stressful security position when his reaction to stress is so unusual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The Board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings and decision. Appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied, whereupon he filed his petition under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, seeking a writ of mandate restoring his job. The trial court correctly determined it was obligated to apply the substantial evidence test in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision; it found the evidence supported the Board\u2019s decision and denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the independent judgment test is the basis for review of the Board\u2019s action cannot be sustained. \u201cIt is firmly established that the Board is a statewide administrative agency deriving its adjudicative powers from the California Constitution; accordingly, its factual determinations must be upheld by a reviewing court if they are supported by substantial evidence, with all legitimate and reasonable inferences drawn in support of such findings.\u201d <em>(Stanton </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 729, 734 [164 Cal.Rptr. 557] and citations therein.) This is true even if a vested right is affected by the Board\u2019s decision. (Id., at p. 735; see also <em>Goggin </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 96 [202 Cal.Rptr. 587].) We therefore consider whether there was legally substantial evidence to support appellant\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018 \u201cmust be of ponderable legal significance. Obviously the word cannot be deemed synonymous with \u2018any\u2019 evidence. It must be reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value; it must actually be \u2018substantial\u2019 proof of the essentials which the law requires in a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>case.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lucas </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 124, 136 [96 Cal.Rptr. 356].)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">There must be more than a failure of good behavior before the Board may discipline an employee under section 19572, subdivision (t). The misconduct must be of such a nature as to reflect upon the employee\u2019s job. In other words, the \u201cmisconduct must bear some rational relationship to his employment and must be of such character that it can easily result in the impairment or disruption of the public service. [Citations.] The legislative purpose behind subdivision (t) was to discipline conduct which <em>can be detrimental </em>to state service. [Citations.] It is apparent that the Legislature was concerned with punishing behavior which had <em>potentially destructive consequences.\u201d (Stanton </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>105 Cal.App.3d at pp. 739-740, italics in original.) The Legislature did not intend . . to endow the employing agency with the power to dismiss any employee whose personal, private conduct incurred its disapproval. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Warren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 95, 104 [156 Cal.Rptr. 351], citing <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 225 [82 Cal.Rptr. 175, 461 P.2d 375].)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Alvin Groupe, retired psychiatrist at Vacaville, who interviewed appellant once several weeks after the incident, and Brian Gunn, a 14-year veteran correctional officer with the Department of Corrections with the rank of captain, testified on behalf of the Board at the hearing. They both concluded the incident would make appellant a likely target for blackmail by the inmates and distrust by the officers, thereby creating dangerous situations for himself and other officers. On cross-examination they readily conceded that since the incident in question was known, the blackmail theory was unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Groupe testified that appellant\u2019s problem was medical in nature\u2014related to stress, and that he would be subject to manipulation by the inmates if the incident received notoriety within the institution because many inmates have the ability to \u201cpick up a weakness or indiscretion to develop situations that could be\u2014that are advantageous for them but could be dangerous to others.\u201d However, Groupe did not consider appellant to be homosexual, and he knew of nothing in appellant\u2019s character to indicate he was the sort to be blackmailed or otherwise manipulated. He believed the \u201cbig point\u201d in deciding whether or not appellant could presently function as a corrections officer was how the other employees would respond to him. If appellant\u2019s fellow officers were willing to accept him \u201cas he is, there would be no problem\u201d of dangerous situations developing. Groupe had not interviewed or spoken with any of the correctional officers with whom appellant worked. He did not testify to any problems appellant had ever had on the job, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>stated that a seven-year unblemished record would indicate a correctional officer\u2019s ability to control his stress on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">As the Board found, appellant had worked successfully as a correctional officer for seven years prior to the incident with no negative reports in his service record.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Captain Gunn also offered his opinion that some inmates \u201cmight\u201d assault appellant or attempt to manipulate him, and that other officers would resent working with him. However, like Doctor Groupe, Gunn had not discussed the case with any other officers with whom appellant worked. Appellant had maintained social contact with 20 to 30 of his former colleagues and testified that they all asked him when he was returning to work. He said none of them expressed any concern about his ability to function as a correctional officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Thus, although both Groupe and Gunn offered opinions about how this incident would affect appellant\u2019s job performance, neither of them presented any substantial factual evidence upon which their opinion was based. Appellant himself offered the only evidence about his relationship with his fellow officers. Groupe admitted that appellant\u2019s prior record was solid evidence of his ability to control stress on the job. Gunn\u2019s opinion about how other officers would react to appellant\u2019s return, if relevant, was wholly unsupported, since he had never discussed the situation with any other officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The thrust of Gunn\u2019s testimony was his opposition to what he considered to be the general perception of appellant\u2019s lifestyle, which he variously characterized as \u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cweird.\u201d  \u201cThe notion that a [correctional officer] may be dismissed on the sole basis that his lifestyle (sexual preference) is offensive to his fellow officers has no basis in law.\u201d <em>(Warren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d 95, 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The case before the Board was presented by Groupe and Gunn as though appellant were medically unable to handle the job. But it is important to realize that we are dealing not with a case of medical disability or retirement (see \u00a7 21020 et seq.), but with a <em>disciplinary </em>proceeding where <em>punitive </em>action was taken. A review of prior decisions under section 19572 confirms our conclusion that appellant is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We look first at the following cases in which discipline was sought to be imposed only under subdivision (t) of section 19572, as in the instant case: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>In Nightingale </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 507 [102 Cal.Rptr. 758, 498 P.2d 1006], a referee with the Division of Industrial Accidents had attempted to expedite a friend\u2019s compensation claim pending before that agency. The court noted the \u201cdestructive effect on the appearance of impartiality\u201d (id., at pp. 510, 516) this created, and upheld a 20-day suspension imposed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>Parker </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 84 [174 Cal.Rptr. 333] involved the dismissal of a group supervisor for the California Youth Authority who admitted the commission of a crime, and marijuana was found both growing and in loose form at his residence. In addition, he had a prior misbehavior problem involving wards under his control. His dismissal was upheld, with the court noting that correctional officers could be disciplined for violating laws which their employment requires them to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Hooks </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 572 [168 Cal.Rptr. 822] also involved a state correctional officer who admitted the commission of a crime. He was arrested in possession of approximately 9 grams of marijuana and 10 grams of hashish. His dismissal was upheld on the basis that his criminal conduct related to his duties as a correctional officer, since he was in charge of persons who were incarcerated for violation of the same laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 233 [136 Cal.Rptr. 503], another correctional officer at CMF was disciplined for commission of criminal activity. She had been making threatening phone calls to her former husband\u2019s current girl friend and, inter alia, threatened to kill the woman and her children, threatened to throw acid on them, to \u201cstick\u201d the woman, to shoot her, and to have members of an infamous prison gang put out a \u201ccontract\u201d on the woman\u2019s life. The court upheld a six-month suspension and a demotion from correctional officer to stenographer II.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In <em>Vielehr </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 187 [107 Cal.Rptr. 852], a state tax representative trainee with the Department of Human Resources Development was dismissed for his conviction of possession of marijuana while off duty. The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court on the grounds that no obvious relationship existed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>possession of marijuana off duty and the duties of a tax representative trainee.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Finally, in <em>Orlandi </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 32 [69 Cal.Rptr. 177], a highway patrol officer was dismissed for attempting to \u201cfix\u201d a ticket for a friend. The dismissal was upheld due to the obvious connection between the conduct of \u201cticket fixing,\u201d which the court characterized as \u201cinherently wrong and reprehensible\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 40), and the duties of a highway patrol officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In other cases where subdivision (t) was relied upon as a basis for discipline, it was utilized in conjunction with other statutory grounds or subdivisions of section 19572.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These other grounds generally involve charges of dishonesty [subdivision (f)], insubordination [subdivision (e)], wilful disobedience [subdivision (o)] or conduct which is or was subject to criminal prosecution. None of the cases we have found has imposed punishment for medical reasons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>When measuring appellant\u2019s conduct under the statute in light of existing precedent, one is struck by certain obvious distinguishing characteristics between the instant case and others where discipline was imposed. Appellant did not commit a criminal act, he was not wilfully disobedient, he did not violate any rule or regulation of the department, he was not dishonest, everyone agreed he was cooperative and completely candid in his disclosures, he was not insubordinate, and his prior work record was exemplary. None of this is disputed. Furthermore, although the record is not altogether clear on this point, the sole reason for appellant\u2019s behavior appears to be medical, and may have been caused in some degree by the job itself. It also appears to be transitory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Respondent is correct that reviewing courts do not disturb penalties imposed by the State Personnel Board unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>(Skelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 217.)  \u201cNevertheless, while the [Board] has a broad discretion in respect to the imposition of a penalty or discipline, \u2018it does not have absolute and unlimited power. It is bound to exercise legal discretion, which is, in the circumstances, judicial discretion.\u2019 [Citations.]  In considering whether such abuse occurred in the context of public employee discipline, we note that the overriding consideration in these cases is the extent to which the employee\u2019s conduct resulted in, or if repeated is likely to result in, \u2018[h]arm to the public service.\u2019 [Citations.] Other relevant factors include the circumstances surrounding the misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 217-218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that no substantial evidence exists that appellant is unfit for his employment, and that if any discipline is warranted, the penalty imposed was grossly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Low, P. J., and King, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On May 29, 1985, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Trial lawyers regularly remind juries that no opinion is better than the facts upon which it is based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">A comparison of the conduct in <em>Maynard </em>with the instant case, and the disparity of punishment imposed, highlights the Draconian penalty received by appellant herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Section 19572 states: \u201cEach of the following constitutes cause for discipline of an employee, or person whose name appears on any employment list: (a) Fraud in securing appointment.

(f) Dishonesty, (g) Drunkenness on duty, (h) Intemperance, (i) Addiction to the use of controlled substances, (j) Inexcusable absence without leave, (k) Conviction of a felony or conviction of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. A plea or verdict of guilty, or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere, to a charge of a felony or any offense involving moral turpitude is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section. (1) Immorality, (m) Discourteous treatment of the public or other employees, (n) Improper political activity, (o) Willful disobedience, (p) Misuse of state property, (q) Violation of this part or board rule, (r) Violation of the prohibitions set forth in accordance with Section 19990.
