(Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 2250 et seq.) The Board refused to hear the claim because it determined the legislation changed the penalty for a crime and therefore it lacked jurisdiction. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 2253.2.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The County sought review of the Board\u2019s decision by writ of mandate in the superior court. The court found the law establishing the diversion program did not change the penalty for a crime and issued a writ compelling the Board to exercise its jurisdiction over the claim. The Board appeals. We agree with the court below and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In 1979, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for persons arrested for acts of domestic violence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1000.6-1000.il.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the program, an accused who meets certain criteria can be diverted into a community program of education, treatment or rehabilitation while the criminal proceedings against him are suspended. The accused must consent to participation and waive his right to a speedy trial (\u00a7 1000.7, subd. (b)), but no admission of guilt is required of him (\u00a7 1000.6, subd. (c)). Upon the accused\u2019s successful completion of the diversion program, the charges against him are dropped and his arrest is deemed never to have occurred. (\u00a7\u00a7 1000.9, 1000.10.) If he is unsuccessful, however, he is returned to the court for resumption of the criminal proceedings. (\u00a7 1000.9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Before diversion can be ordered, the court must refer potential cases to the probation department for an investigation to determine if the accused is one who would benefit from diversion and into which community program he should be placed. (\u00a7 1000.7, subd. (b).) The probation department is also required to monitor the progress of the diverted person and to return him to court if he is not benefiting from the program or if he is convicted of any violent crime. (\u00a7 1000.9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The Board argues that diversion constitutes an \u00e1lternate penalty to the crime of domestic violence. It points out a diverted defendant is subjected to a penal statute and criminal judicial proceedings, and is placed under the supervision of the probation department with certain restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>on his behavior. We disagree with the Board and conclude the diversion program creates an alternative to criminal prosecution and conviction rather than changing the penalty. No person can be punished for a crime unless he has been found guilty by a court or jury, or has entered a guilty plea. (\u00a7\u00a7 681, 689; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clapp </em>(1944) 67 Cal.App.2d 197, 200 [153 P.2d 758].) Consequently, since participation in the program occurs prior to a determination of guilt or innocence, it cannot be considered a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">However, the Board stresses the similarity between diversion and probation, arguing both constitute the imposition of a penalty. For this proposition, the Board cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (On Tai Ho) </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 59 [113 Cal.Rptr. 21, 520 P.2d 405], where the court held the act of ordering an accused to a drug diversion program was a judicial act and did not require the consent of the prosecutor. In this context, the court stated: \u201c[Diversion may also be viewed as a specialized form of probation, available to a different class of defendants but sharing many similarities with general probation and commitment for addiction.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 66.) The existence of some similarities between probation and diversion does not affect the basic distinction between the two. Probation means \u201cthe suspension of the imposition or execution of a <em>sentence </em>and the order of conditional and revocable release in the community under the supervision of the probation officer.\u201d (Italics added.) (\u00a7 1203, subd. (a).) Diversion, on the other hand, can only be ordered prior to trial. (See <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 149, 156 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46].) Thus, probation is an alternative sentencing device imposed after conviction, while diversion is a pretrial program designed to avoid conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We conclude the domestic violence diversion legislation did not change the penalty for a crime, and the Board is thus required to hear the County\u2019s claim for reimbursement. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Sonenshine, Acting P.
