(Walton). Plaintiff Alfred E. Carlson, Assessor of the County of Santa Clara (Assessor), filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court to vacate the reduction. The petition was denied and the Assessor has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The question presented is this: Did the Assessment Appeals Board, in determining the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s property, lawfully give effect to restrictions placed upon the property by agreement of the owner and his seller? We answer in the negative and accordingly reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the assessor\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">On January 1, 1980, Walton entered into a written agreement with Standard Realty and Development Company (Standard) to purchase a 4.9 \u00e1cre parcel of unimproved land in Milpitas for $323,830. The agreement required Walton to: construct a warehouse of not less than 60,000 square feet on the property within 2 years or any extension not to exceed 21 years; contract with Standard\u2019s parent company, Western Pacific Railroad, for rail services to the warehouse; pay all costs incident to providing spur track services to the property; and grant Western Pacific a railroad easement thereon. Should Walton fail to construct the warehouse and purchase spur track services, Standard had the option to repurchase the land for the price sold. Walton could neither assign the agreement nor convey the property without Standard\u2019s prior written consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The deed incorporating these restrictions was recorded on January 20, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">On March 26, 1982, Walton was given notice that the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of its property for assessment purposes was $1,084,000 for the 1981-1982 tax year. The Assessor did not give effect to the restrictions set forth in the agreement between Walton and Standard. Instead, the Assessor appraised the property as a \u201cfee simple unencumbered\u201d using the comparable sales method.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>Walton appealed to the Board and argued (1) that the Assessor utilized an improper method of valuation and (2) that comparable sales of other real property supported Walton\u2019s lower estimate of the property\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">After hearing, the Board made the following findings and conclusions: \u201cI [H] The applicant introduced evidence that the property herein is restricted in its use by the voluntary action of the applicant and the party from whom the property was purchased, [t] II [f] The Board finds that these restrictions adversely affect the value of the subject property, [f] III [1f] Based upon the foregoing evidence and rules, as well as the other evidence introduced into the hearing, the Board finds that the Assessor\u2019s determination of full cash value is incorrect and should be lowered to $542,323.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Walton first asserts that the appellate court may not independently weigh the evidence in this case, but must apply the substantial evidence rule. <em>(A. F. Gilmore Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 471 [9 Cal.Rptr. 67].) However, where the legality of the valuation method used by the assessor is in issue, the scope of judicial review is not limited to the evidence. The Supreme Court in <em>Bret Harte Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 14, 23 [127 Cal.Rptr. 154, 544 P.2d 1354], provided the applicable standard of review as follows: \u201c[W]hen the taxpayer challenges the validity of the valuation method itself, the trial judge is faced with a question of law. [Citations.] That question ... is whether the challenged method of valuation is arbitrary, in excess of discretion, or in violation of the standards prescribed by law. . . .\u201d In the instant case, the Board considered the privately imposed restrictions on use in determining the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the property. The Assessor has objected to this valuation method and we are faced with a question of law; hence the substantial evidence rule is not applicable. We must determine whether the method was arbitrary, in excess of discretion, or in violation of the standards prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">B. <em>Validity of Valuation Method</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Article XIII, section 1, subdivision (a), of the California Constitution provides that all property \u201cshall be assessed at the same percentage of fair market value.\u201d \u201cFair market value\u201d or \u201cfull cash value\u201d is statutorily defined as, \u201cthe amount of cash or its equivalent which property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>and both with knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 no.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Revenue and Taxation Code section 402.1 defines the type of \u201cenforceable restrictions\u201d which the Assessor is required to consider in determining the value of property. While this section sets forth a nonexclusive list of restrictions, these examples consist solely of restrictions imposed by government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Furthermore, section 402.1 itself manifests the legislative intent regarding the type of applicable property restrictions. It states in part that the purpose of the section \u201cis to avoid an assessment policy which, in the absence of special circumstances, considers uses for land which legally are not available to the owner and not contemplated by government, and that <em>these sections are necessary to implement the public policy of encouraging and maintaining effective land use </em>planning. \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In the instant case, no public policy regarding land use planning is involved. The public derives no benefit whatsoever as a result of these particular restrictions. Rather, the restrictions were imposed solely for the profit and benefit of Standard and its parent company, Western Pacific Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Walton contends that the restrictions in the case at bar should be treated in the same manner as a \u201cnegative\u201d easement. However, no authority is cited for the proposition that a negative easement reduces the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the servient tenement for tax assessment purposes and our research has failed to disclose the existence of any such authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>While prior cases have not addressed the specific issue before us, we are guided by the views expressed by California courts regarding tax assessment principles in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 546 [290 P.2d 544], which involved the assessment of a possessory interest of a lessee of tax exempt property, the court noted that: \u201cIn practice, assessors usually enter the entire value of land and improvements on the tax roll without distinction between possessory and reversionary interests, and since this practice results in a single amount reflecting both interests on the roll, the constitutional mandate that all property be taxed is obeyed. [Citation.] As between reversioners and possessors payment of the tax is a private arrangement.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The <em>DeLuz </em>court also observed, that regardless of the specific conditions affecting the value of the property to the individual owner, the assessment method for property tax purposes must be objective. \u201cThe present owner may have invested well or poorly, may have contracted to pay very high or very low rent, and may have built expensive improvements or none at all. . . . [S]ince ... the legislative standard of value is \u2018full cash value,\u2019 it is clear that whatever may be the rationale of the property tax, it is not the profitableness of property to its present owner. If a purchaser would buy a given property on an open market, the property has a value equal to the price such purchaser might be expected to pay.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 566.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Relying on <em>De Luz, </em>the court in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 390 [102 Cal.Rptr. 687], disregarded a private agreement reducing the property\u2019s value. The issue in <em>Clayton </em>was whether in determining \u201cfull cash value\u201d the assessor should take into \u00e1ccount the economic rent even though the actual rent stated in the lease was lower than the economic rent. The court held that the parties to a lease cannot escape the full burden of taxation by agreeing upon a rent that was less than market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Walton contends that <em>Clayton, supra, 26 </em>Cal.App.3d 390, is not authority for the Assessor\u2019s position since in <em>Clayton </em>the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the property was determined independently of the lease, while in the present case what Walton believes to be the \u201cfull cash value\u201d was established by the terms of the sale and the price paid. We do not find this distinction persuasive. As in <em>Clayton, </em>the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of Walton\u2019s property can be determined independently of the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">In another case involving a leasehold interest, the court stressed the importance of establishing a policy of uniform tax assessment. \u201cJust as asses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>sors are not bound by private agreements, they should not be frustrated or hindered in performing their vital functions by the necessity of ferreting out the often undisclosed and secret intentions of lessors and lessees relative to the terms of a lease. For the most part, assessors must be allowed to act on the basis of outward appearances.\u201d <em>(Trabue Pittman Corp. </em>v. <em>County of L. A. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 385, 392 [175 Cal.Rptr. 512].)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Other jurisdictions have addressed the issue before us and have resolved it against the taxpayer. In <em>NeBoShone Ass \u2019n </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission </em>(1975) 58 Mich.App. 324 [227 N.W.2d 358], the taxpayer argued that a restriction on the sale of property to a purchaser or purchasers agreeable to a majority of owners should be considered for tax assessment purposes.  The court held otherwise, noting that \u201c[a] private individual could not self-impose a restriction whereby he might be able to avoid or limit paying his just share of the ad valorem taxes.\u201d (Id., at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The court in <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(Tenn.App. 1972) 579 S.W.2d 192, held that a deed restriction preventing the sale or lease of property for a period longer than one year did not constitute legal restrictions on use to be considered in determining valuation. The court recognized that if such restrictions were considered, it \u201ccould allow property owners to effectively control the valuation of their properties for taxation purposes by careful imposition of limited restrictions in the deeds to their properties.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Another factor to consider is the administrative construction of Revenue and Taxation Code sections 110 and 402.1. Government Code section 15606 authorizes the State Board of Equalization to prescribe rules and regulations governing local boards of equalization and assessors in performance of their duties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Assessor\u2019s handbook contains these regulations, which are also made binding on the Assessment Appeals Board. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 324.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In discussing the regulations issued by an administrative agency, the California Supreme Court in <em>Coca Cola Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 918, 921 [156 P.2d 1] stated: \u201cAlthough not necessarily controlling, as where made without the authority of or repugnant to the provisions of a statute, the contemporaneous administrative construction of the enactment by those charged with its enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>ment and interpretation is entitled to great weight, and courts generally will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized. [Citations.]\u201d Thus, a court may properly consider the assessor\u2019s handbook in determining the appropriate method of valuation. <em>(Hunt-Wesson Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 163, 180 [116 Cal.Rptr. 160].)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The handbook provides that \u201cin the appraisal of property for taxation the rights to be appraised are the fee simple unencumbered rights.\u201d (Handbook, p. 18.) A \u201cfee simple unencumbered estate\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he possession of all the rights by a private individual subject only to limitations imposed by government .... Limitations imposed by government include property taxation, police power, eminent domain, and escheat.\u201d (Handbook, p. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We conclude, in light of the principles stated above, that the Board erred in its determination of the subject property\u2019s value. The Board should not have considered the privately imposed restrictions in this case, and for good reason. Scrutiny of the transaction between seller and buyer discloses that the Board\u2019s narrow focus on the interest acquired by the buyer Walton provided a distorted notion of value. Ownership of title in fee simple absolute includes the rights, subject to governmental restrictions, of full use and disposition of the property. (2 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (1977) \u00a7\u00a7 15:3, 15:4, pp. 600-602.) Walton did not acquire complete rights of fee ownership. However, valuable interests in the property were reserved by Standard and to Standard\u2019s parent company, Western Pacific Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Thus, the \u201cfair market value\u201d or \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the property to be assessed is properly determined, as the Assessor contends, by considering the value of the fee simple absolute which includes the combined interests of Walton, Standard and Western Pacific. This approach comports with the traditional real property concept that \u201ca reservation allows a grantor\u2019s whole interest in the property to pass to the grantee, but revests a newly created interest in the grantor.\u201d <em>(Willard </em>v. <em>First Church of Christ, Scientist </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 473, 476 [102 Cal.Rptr. 739, 498 P.2d 987]; citing 4 Tiffany, The Law of Real Property (3d ed. 1939) \u00a7 972.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">At oral argument, Walton suggested that it would be appropriate to separately assess Standard for its interest in the property. Separate legal interests in property, however, will not affect the manner of assessment, because the assessment is against the property itself, and to reiterate the holding in <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 546, 563, payment of the tax should be a matter of \u201cprivate arrangement\u201d among the owners of various interests in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>At the hearing before the Board, the Assessor introduced evidence of comparable sales which supported the valuation determined by the Assessor. Walton\u2019s only objection to this evidence was that the properties in question were not subject to private restrictions. Citing <em>Jones </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 999 [170 Cal.Rptr. 879], Walton asserts that the Assessor must consider properties with similar restrictions when employing the comparable sales method. <em>Jones </em>is distinguishable, however, because in that case the property in question was located in a federal park and local government had designated the property as \u201copen space,\u201d preventing further development of the property. Thus, we return to a situation of governmental, not private restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Walton, on the other hand, introduced evidence of two prior sales embodying terms substantially identical to the sale of the property at hand. Since restrictions imposed by private individuals on the use of real property need not be considered by the Assessor in determining its \u201cfull cash value,\u201d the only relevant evidence before the Board supported the Assessor\u2019s valuation of Walton\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold the valuation method accepted by the Board and the trial court was in violation of the standard prescribed by law and the judgment must be reversed. The cause is remanded with directions to the trial court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate vacating the decision of the Board and remanding the matter to the Board for determination of the \u201cfull cash value\u201d of the subject property in a manner consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Brauer, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Walton so characterized the effect of the agreement in its application to the Board for changed assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Revenue and Taxation Code section 402.1 provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn the assessment of land, the assessor shall consider the effect upon value of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected.
