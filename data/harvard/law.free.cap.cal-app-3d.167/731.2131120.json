Respondent Torrigino is the manager of Coastside and represents the company in its dealings with the union. The two men apparently have had a long and stormy relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The present dispute began in October 1981 when Torrigino learned that the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) planned to conduct a \u201csweep\u201d of Bay Area businesses to discover and deport illegal aliens. Torrigino supplied the INS with a list of Coastside employees whom he suspected were illegal aliens. In response, the INS informed Torrigino that two Coastside employees, Jose Gonzales and Aurelio Navarro, lacked proper immigration documentation. Torrigino discharged both employees. However, he later rehired Gonzales when Gonzales demonstrated that the INS had provided Coastside with erroneous information. Navarro, who was unable to present evidence of proper immigration status, was not reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Upon Navarro\u2019s discharge, Morales wrote a letter to Torrigino, dated November 17, 1981, concerning the discharge of the two employees. In that letter, Morales stated that Torrigino used \u201cunfair tactics\u201d and went out of his way to \u201cintimidate, harass, and provoke\u201d employees. Torrigino replied with a letter on the following day in which he explained the circumstances surrounding the discharges. On December 3, 1981, Morales wrote to Torrigino requesting formal arbitration of Navarro\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In response, Torrigino wrote the letter containing the allegedly libelous statements which are the subject of this action. In that letter, written on December 10, 1981, Torrigino requested that Morales present him with reasons and information as to why Navarro\u2019s termination should be arbitrated. Torrigino closed the letter with this allegedly defamatory paragraph: \u201cI am seriously considering filing charges against you with the N.L.R.B. for your continuing discrimination against American workers, coercion or attempted coercion of us as the employer to hire illegal aliens, and your consistent refusal to negotiate in good faith regarding these matters.\u201d Torrigino sent a copy of the letter to Coastside\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The trial court held the statements were not defamatory, were privileged and constituted protected opinion, and granted Torrigino\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Publications issued during the course of labor disputes are accorded broader constitutional protections in order to secure the Labor Management Relations Act\u2019s (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 et seq.) policy of promoting full discourse between the parties to labor-management disputes. <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>Workers </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 53 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 86 S.Ct. 657]; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 596 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425].) \u201c \u2018[S]ince such . . . disputes, realistically considered, normally involve considerable differences of opinion and vehement adherence to one side or the other, a necessarily broad area of discussion without civil responsibility in damages is an indispensable concomitant of the controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>at p. 602, quoting <em>Emde </em>v. <em>San Joaquin County etc. Council </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 146, 155-156 [143 P.2d 20, 150 A.L.R. 916].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">A necessary prerequisite to recovery in a libel action is that the publication contain a false statement of fact <em>(Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 264 [41 L.Ed.2d 745, 94 S.Ct. 2770]; <em>Okun </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 442 [175 Cal.Rptr. 157, 629 P.2d 1369]) as opposed to opinion, since the latter is not recognized as actionable in the libel context. <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997]; <em>Okun </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra; Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 596.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The determination of whether the disputed libelous publication constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law. <em>(Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. 264; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 596.) The courts have acknowledged that the line of demarcation between fact and opinion is not always clearly delineated, \u201cand what constitutes a statement of fact in one context may be treated as a statement of opinion in another, in light of the nature and content of the communication taken as a whole. Thus, where potentially defamatory statements are published in . . . a heated labor dispute, or in another setting in which the audience may anticipate efforts by the parties to persuade others to their positions by use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole, language which generally might be considered as statements of fact may well assume the character of statements of opinion.\u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>at p. 601.) In labor disputes \u201cthe judgment, loyalties and subjective motives of rivals are reciprocally attacked and defended, frequently with considerable heat.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 603.) \u201c[S]hort of accusations of crime or personal dishonesty, the First amendment protects even sharp attacks on the character, motives, or moral qualification of \u2018. . . an active participant in a labor dispute.\u2019\u201d <em>(Okun </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at p. 451, citing <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 596, 604.) If an action for libel ensues as a result of such interchange, we must view it in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">We note that the only person other than appellant who received a copy of the publication was respondents\u2019 attorney who represented them in their labor relations with appellant and his union. The labor lawyer obvious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ly, and at least inferentially, had a grasp of the actual facts involved and was familiar with the history of animosity between the parties. As the sole member of the audience to whom the publication was broadcast, he reasonably would be expected to view it in a nonlibelous vein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Although a drastic remedy, summary judgment is a favored procedure for resolving First Amendment cases to avoid needless litigation which would interfere with the exercise of the free speech necessary for the continued existence of a free society. <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 244, 251-252 [208 Cal.Rptr. 137, 690 P.2d 610]; <em>Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 672, 684-685 [150 Cal.Rptr. 258, 586 P.2d 572].)  We conclude that the publication at issue consisted of protected opinion. Hence, it is unnecessary to reach the other contentions advanced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Low, P. J., and King, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-12\">An order granting a motion for summary judgment is nonappealable. (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 69, at pp. 4082-4083.) However, a premature appeal may be treated as an appeal from a subsequently entered judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2(c); 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 366, 367, at pp. 4339-4340.) The judgment was later entered, and we treat the appeal as being taken therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Our conclusion is further supported by the many cases in which language more offensive than respondent\u2019s has been held to constitute protected opinion. For example, in <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. 264, the United States Supreme court held that publication of Jack London\u2019s definition of \u201cscab\u201d containing the words \u201c \u2018traitor to his God, his country, his family . . .\u2019\u201d was not libelous. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 268 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 753].) In <em>Greenbelt Coop. Pub. Assn. </em>v. <em>Bresler </em>(1970) 398 U.S. 6, 13-14 [26 L.Ed.2d 6, 14-15, 90 S.Ct. 1537], the Supreme Court determined that the use of the word \u201cblackmail\u201d to describe plaintiff\u2019s negotiating position did not constitute libel. Similarly, the Supreme Court found in <em>Cafeteria Union </em>v. <em>Angelos </em>(1943) 320 U.S. 293, 295 [88 L.Ed. 58, 60, 64 S.Ct. 126], that the use of words \u201clike \u2018unfair\u2019 and \u2018fascist\u2019\u2014is not to falsify facts\u201d in the context of economic and political controversies. As a final example, the California Court of Appeal held in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 277, 283-284, that accusing a city manager of \u201c \u201cstoop[ing] to any form of action ... to continue your stay in office\u2019 \u201d and stating that under his administration, the city\u2019s affairs had descended to a \u201cmutinous character\u201d was not libelous. In view of the examples above, respondent\u2019s comments appear restrained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
