Though the certificate should have upon its face a declaration to whom the money should be paid, and the certificate and declaration be delivered to the person to whom made payable, the money or right to the money does not pass and vest in the person designated.

Hopkins, Aldrich &amp; Thatcher and Hamline, Scott &amp; Lord, for Hattie Dodd, appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\" pgmap=\"49\">Counsel first asks: \u201c Had Hattie Dodd, as the finance of McDougald, an insurable interest in his life ? \u201d to which counsel says the decisions uniformly answer, \u201cHo.\u201d But the decisions which are cited do not support counsel\u2019s assertion.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\" pgmap=\"49\">The case relied upon by appellant is Palmer v. Welch, 23 N. E. Reporter, or which is in the advance sheets, Vol. 132, No. 2, p. 141. It is true that in that case the certificate was payable to the deceased\u2019s fiance, and the court held she could not recover. The right to recover, however, was not denied because she was the fiance and had no insurable interest, but for an entirely different reason. In that case the certificate was issued by the Boyal Arcanum, a mutual benefit association incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-10\" pgmap=\"49(90) 50(16)\">Both the statutes of Massachusetts, and the laws, rules and regulations of the Boyal Arcanum itself, as well as the certificate issued, under which the fiance was claiming, expressly limited the beneficiaries to certain relatives, and those dependent upon the member for \u2022 maintenance, for food, clothing, lodging or education. Inasmuch as it was admitted by stipulation in that case that affianced was not dependent upon the deceased in manner as above required to bring her within the limited list of beneficiaries above provided for, the Supreme Court held that she was not entitled to the benefits of the certificate in that order.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa\" pgmap=\"50\">That decision, the court readily sees, is no authority for counsel\u2019s position, and does not decide at all that a fimice has no insurable interest. It merely decides that a fia/nce who is not dependent does not come within the limited list of beneficiaries provided for by the rules and by-laws of the Royal Arcanum, and the particular statute of the St\u00e1te under which that order was incorporated. But a fiance, .one can readily see, may have an insurable interest in the life of another and still not be actually dependent on that other for the list of necessaries enumerated in the rules and by-laws of the Royal Arcanum. Under a certificate unrestricted as to the beneficiaries, or issued by an association either unincorporated or incorporated under a law which does not so limit the beneficiaries, a fia/nce may have an insurable interest in the life of another and recover accordingly.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3C\" pgmap=\"50\">The other two cases cited by appellant of Ballou v. Gile, 50 Wisconsin, 614, and the American Legion of Honor v. Perry, 140 Mass. 580, are only to the same effect as Palmer v. Welch, supra.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0\" pgmap=\"50\">So much for the decisions cited by counsel in support of his position. On the contrary, as to whether Hattie Dodd, as the fiance of McDougald, had an insurable interest in his life, we maintain, first, that our courts do uphold the claims of a -fiance where no statute or law of the association contravenes; secondly, that under the decisions of our courts it makes no difference whether Hattie Dodd had an insurable interest or not; and thirdly, that appellant can not be heard to object in this case on that ground.</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afe\" pgmap=\"50(99) 51(83)\">In proof of our first reply, that our courts do uphold the claims of a fiance where no statute or law of the association forbids, we cite counsel to the case of Johnson v. Van Epps, found in 14 Ill. App. 201, and 110 Ill. 551. In that case Johnson took out a policy payable to Mrs. Van Epps or his heirs. Mrs. Van Epps was his fiance, and was so represented by him to the association at the time he took out his certificate, and she bore no other relation to him up to the time of his death, and also was not dependent upon him. After his death Mrs. Van Epps filed her bill in chancery and claimed the benefits. The heirs of Johnson contested her claims on the ground that she was only his fiance and as such she had no insuiable interest in his life, and could not recover\u2014as in the case before your honors. But the Circuit, Appellate and Supreme Courts all held that she could recover, and awarded her the full amount of the certificate.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\" pgmap=\"51\">In proof of our second reply, namely, that Hattie Dodd need not have an insurable interest in the life of said Mc-Dougald in order to recover under the policy in question, we cite the case of Bloomington Mutual Benefit Association v. Blue, 120 Ill. 121, where this question is conclusively settled in our State. In that case it was contended that inasmuch as Blue had no insurable interest in the life of Bailey, the contract was void; but the court, after exhaustively considering the decisions of other courts and of the Hnited States Court on the question of insurable interest, lays down the doctrine as follows:</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\" pgmap=\"51(222) 52(21)\">61 It may be regarded as a plain proposition of law that a wagering policy is void, and we think it is also well settled that a policy taken out on the life of a third party by a beneficiary, in the continuance of whose life the beneficiary has no pecuniary interest, may be regarded as a wagering policy, and as such would be void. Had this policy been taken out by Blue on the life of Bailey without his knowledge or consent, and had the premiums been paid by him, it would manifestly fall within what is known as a wagering policy, and would be void. Public policy forbids one person, who has no interest in the continuance of the life of another, from speculating on that life by procuring a policy of insurance; but here it does not appear that Blue had any instrumentality whatever in procuring the policy on the life of Bailey, or that he ever paid any portion of the premiums to procure the policy or to keep it in force; and hence the case of Insurance Co. v, Hogan, 80 Ill. 39, cited by the defendant, has no bearing upon the case. In the case cited, the insurance was procured by the beneficiary, and all the premiums were paid by him, while here, Bailey procured the policy and paid all the premiums. Manifestly, the Hogan case has no bearing upon the facts in this case.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-4\" pgmap=\"52\">Bailey had an insurable interest in his own life, and had a clear right to procure a policy on his life, and unless some principle of public policy is violated, he could make it payable in case of death, to any person whom he might desire.\u201d</p> <opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"AqM\" pgmap=\"52\">Watbemah, J\".</author> <p id=\"Aj0\" pgmap=\"52\">It clearly appears that the assured intended to make, and believed he had made, his policy payable to Hattie Dodd. The association so understood and agreed to make payment.</p> <p id=\"b52-6\" pgmap=\"52\">This being the case, even if there had been a want of a technical compliance with everything requisite to constitute her the beneficiary, a court of equity, which looks to substance rather than form, would carry out the plain and manifest intention of the parties. But so far as appears, the policy was entirely in accordance with the rules and regulations of the association, made payable to Hattie Dodd. She was the beneficiary named at the time the policy was issued and her name was inserted in the only way and place provided for designating beneficiaries.</p> <p id=\"b52-7\" pgmap=\"52\">While a lawyer might not speak of her as a person \u201c to whom the policy was made assignable,\u201d it is evident that what the assured and the association thought necessary to make the certificate payable to her, was done.</p> <p id=\"Ajm\" pgmap=\"52\">There was an undoubted right to make the certificate payable to Hattie Dodd; the parties did what they thought secured this; there \"is no rule of public policy which forbids the carrying out of such intention. The decree of the court below awarding the money paid in on this certificate to her is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b52-10\" pgmap=\"52\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
