Plaintiff sought relief pursuant to the principles announced in <em>Mount Laurel </em>I<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Mount Laurel II</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>same year, the Legislature, in response to <em>Mount Laurel I and II, </em>adopted the Fair Housing Act (FHA), L.1985, <em>c. </em>222; <em>N.J S.A. </em>52:27D-301 <em>et seq. </em>By order dated January 23, 1986, the Law Division granted the Township\u2019s motion to transfer Count One<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the complaint to the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) \u201cpursuant to Section 16(b) of the Fair Housing Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Section 16 of the FHA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">For those exclusionary zoning cases instituted more than 60 days before the effective date of this act, any party to the litigation may file a motion with the court to seek a transfer of the case to the council. In determining whether or not to transfer, the court shall consider whether or not the transfer would result in a manifest injustice to any party to the litigation. If the municipality fails to file a housing element and fair share plan with the council within five months from the date of transfer, or promulgation of criteria and guidelines by the council pursuant to section 7 of this act, whichever occurs later, jurisdiction shall revert to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">b. Any person who institutes litigation less than 60 days before the effective date of this act or after the effective date of this act challenging a municipality\u2019s zoning ordinance with respect to the opportunity to provide for low or moderate income housing, shall file a notice to request review and mediation with the council pursuant to sections 14 and 15 of this act. In the event that the municipality adopts a resolution of participation within the period established in subsection a. of section 9 of this act, the person shall exhaust the review and mediation process of the council before being entitled to a trial on his complaint. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-316; footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Cherry Hill complied with \u00a7 16\u2019s timing requirements and submitted a housing element and fair share plan to COAH on January 5, 1987, the last day of the \u00a7 16 deadline, thereby avoiding the reversion of jurisdiction to the Law Division. On March 7, 1987, COAH instructed the Township to remedy certain plan deficiencies and to resubmit the plan within 60 days. The deadline was extended to July 3, 1987 because of COAH\u2019s adoption of a regulation capping municipal fair share obligations at 1,000 units. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-7.1(b). The Township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>resubmitted its plan on July 1, 1987. Under <em>N.J.A. C. </em>5:91-4.2, Cherry Hill\u2019s submission of the plan constituted a petition for substantive certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">After published notice of the petition for certification, six parties filed objections to the Township\u2019s plan. Mediation commenced on August 27,1987, as required in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-315, and continued for 164 days, 100 days beyond the 60-day time limit established in <em>N.J.A. C. </em>5:91-7.2(e). Mediation concluded in February 1988. It resulted in a plan which resolved objections and which eliminated certain techniques the Township had proposed to utilize in providing its fair share of affordable housing. The plaintiff and the public advocate had vigorously opposed those techniques and the COAH task force had concluded that they were inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Cherry Hill presented the mediated plan at a hearing before its planning board. COAH\u2019s staff presented the Township\u2019s petition for substantive certification based on the mediated plan to COAH at its May 16, 1988 public meeting. The staff recommended that COAH grant the petition with conditions. COAH was scheduled to act on the petition at its June 6, 1988 meeting, but several days before the meeting the Township filed a motion with COAH seeking to amend the mediated plan in many significant respects. The proposed amendment included reinstatement of the objectionable techniques which had been eliminated during the mediation process. On July 25, 1988, COAH entered an order denying the Township\u2019s motion to amend for the reasons expressed in its written opinion. It is from this order that Cherry Hill appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">On the same date, July 25, 1988, COAH adopted a resolution approving the Township\u2019s petition for substantive certification based on the mediated plan. This approval was subject to six conditions, including the condition that Cherry Hill revise its housing element and fair share plan \u201cto reflect the agreements achieved in mediation____\u201d The Township was given 60 days to comply with the conditions. Cherry Hill did not comply, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>on September 26, 1988, COAH adopted a resolution denying substantive certification and returning the controversy to the \u201cjurisdiction of the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In its July 25, 1988 opinion, COAH addressed Charleston\u2019s attempt to file a brief in support of the Township\u2019s motion. Charleston is an association of homeowners residing adjacent to the Sergi tract which, under the mediated plan, was designated as an affordable housing site. COAH noted that Charleston</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">did not participate in the Council process and did not file as an objector to the plan. In fact, the group did not even file as an interested party to Cherry Hill\u2019s plan. The Council has nothing on record to indicate CHA\u2019s participation before it. Accordingly, CHA has no standing before the Council.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Charleston appeals from COAH\u2019s decision precluding its participation. Charleston contends that it did not participate as an objector in the mediation process because the Sergi tract was not part of Cherry Hill\u2019s original plan but was included in the mediated plan without notice to adjoining landowners. It also attacks the absence in COAH regulations of a provision for the filing of objections to a mediated plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">In <em>Hills Dev. Co. v. Bernards Tp., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>1, 510 <em>A.2d </em>621 (1986) our Supreme Court explained the FHA in detail, especially the shifting to COAH of the courts\u2019 responsibility to implement <em>Mount </em>Laurel\u2019s constitutional principles. COAH\u2019s substantive certification of a municipality\u2019s fair share plan and housing element is the FHA\u2019s core. It is a municipal goal which, if achieved, favors the municipality with certain protections. <em>Hills Dev. Co., supra </em>at 35, 510 A.2d 621. The major protection is found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-317. This section provides that if a municipality with substantive certification is a party in an exclusionary zoning case, then \u201cthere shall be a presumption of validity attaching to the housing element and ordinances implementing the housing element,\u201d which the complainant must overcome by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Hills Dev. Co., supra </em>at 34-35, 510 A.2d 621. The FHA also affords a municipality other protections and advantages thereby making COAH certification an attractive alternative to ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>elusionary zoning litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 510 A.2d 621. But a municipality is not required to petition for substantive certification. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 510 A.2d 621. If it does not petition, then it will be subject to <em>Mount Laurel </em>litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 510 A.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The present case involves a transfer to COAH of a pending exclusionary zoning case, pursuant to \u00a7 16 of the FHA, rather than an initial petition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-313 and 314. The difference is significant because in a transfer context the FHA contemplates the reversion of jurisdiction to the courts in the event of a failed COAH proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16a and b <em>supra. N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-318 provides in part that a <em>Mount Laurel </em>plaintiff\u2019s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies as required in \u00a7 16b \u201cexpires if the council rejects the municipality\u2019s request for substantive certification or conditions its certification upon changes which are not made within the period established in this act or within an extension of that period agreed to by the council and all litigants.\u201d <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-319 which authorizes a plaintiff to move before \u201ca court of competent jurisdiction to be relieved of the duty to exhaust administrative remedies\u201d if the review and mediation process exceeds six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In the present case, COAH denied substantive certification to Cherry Hill and returned the matter to the courts. Thus, the exclusionary zoning complaint which triggered the COAH proceedings has not been resolved and we are persuaded that COAH\u2019s July 25, 1988 order continues to be an interlocutory order appealable only upon leave granted. <em>R. </em>2:2-3; <em>R. </em>2:2-4. <em>See Boss v. Rockland Elec. Co., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>33, 42, 468 A.2d 1055 (1983) (agency fact finding and court\u2019s legal conclusions \u201cdrawn therefrom\u201d should be resolved in a single appeal); <em>cf. Olah v. Slobodian, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>119, 574 A.2d 411 (1990) (order granting new trial is interlocutory) at 128-30, 574 A.2d at 416-17);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United Cannery Maintenance v. Local 80-A, </em>16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>N.J. </em>264,108 <em>A.</em>2d 425 (1954) (order denying summary judgment motion is interlocutory); <em>Cardinale Trucking Corp. v. Motor-Rail Co., </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>150, 152 <em>A.2d </em>153 (App.Div.1959) (order restoring previously dismissed ease to trial calendar is interlocutory). The FHA\u2019s structure supports our conclusion that COAH\u2019s order is interlocutory. As to transferred cases, the COAH proceeding is a diversion from the Law Division litigation with the objective of resolving the issues within the FHA framework. But it is merely a diversion, <em>i.e., </em>a temporary suspension of the litigation. If the COAH proceeding fails, then the litigation, which has not been dismissed, resumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Our conclusion is soundly grounded in the ancillary <em>Mount Laurel </em>policy of eliminating delay fostered by piecemeal appeals. On thre\u00e9 occasions in its <em>Mount Laurel II </em>opinion, the Supreme Court condemned appeal-engendered delay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">In most cases, upon determination that the municipality has not fulfilled its constitutional obligation, the trial court will retain jurisdiction, order an immediate revision of the ordinance ..., and require the use of effective affirmative planning and zoning devices. The long delays of interminable appellate review will be discouraged, if not completely ended <em>[Mount Laurel II, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 214, 456 <em>A.2d </em>390.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">The judiciary should manage <em>Mount Laurel </em>litigation to dispose of a case in all of its aspects with one trial and one appeal, unless substantial considerations indicate some other course. This means that in most cases after a determination of invalidity, and prior to final judgment and possible appeal, the municipality will be required to rezone, preserving its contention that the trial court\u2019s adjudication was incorrect. If an appeal is taken, all facets of the litigation will be considered by the appellate court including both the correctness of the lower court\u2019s determination of invalidity, the scope of remedies imposed on the municipality, and the validity of the ordinance adopted after the judgment of invalidity. <em>[Mount Laurel II, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 218, 456 A.2d 390.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">The remedies authorized today are intended to achieve compliance with the Constitution and the <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligations without interminable trials and appeals. Municipalities will not be able to appeal a trial court\u2019s determination that its ordinance is invalid, wait several years for adjudication of that appeal, and then, if unsuccessful, adopt another inadequate ordinance followed by more litigation and subsequent appeals. We intend by our remedy to conclude in one proceeding, with a single appeal, all questions involved. <em>[Mount Laurel II, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 456 <em>A.2d </em>390.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">We perceive no sound reason to deviate from the principle of \u201cone proceeding, with a single appeal,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>merely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the Legislature has provided the FHA\u2019s diversionary machinery. The FHA is the Legislature\u2019s acceptance of our Supreme Court\u2019s invitation to become involved in the implementation of <em>Mount </em>Laurel\u2019s constitutional principles. It would be anomalous to allow a municipality to utilize that machinery to achieve delay through \u201cinterminable appeals\u201d which the Supreme Court has condemned. Indeed, in upholding the FHA\u2019s constitutionality, the Court sounded this warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">That is the general outline of how this Act and the Council created by it are intended to operate, and the results they are intended to achieve. It is a description at variance with the prediction of some who oppose the Act. Our opinion and our rulings today, significantly reducing the courts\u2019 function in this field, are based on this outline, based that is, on the Council\u2019s ability, through the Act, to approach the results described above. If, however, as predicted by its opponents, the Act, despite the intention behind it, achieves nothing but delay, the judiciary will be forced to resume its appropriate role. <em>[Hills Dev. Co., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 23, 510 A.2d 621.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">Cherry Hill\u2019s appeal is dismissed as interlocutory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Charleston\u2019s appeal from COAH\u2019s denial of its attempt to intervene is moot because the mediated plan which Charleston opposed has not been implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s exclusionary zoning suit shall proceed in the Law Division.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-17\"> <em>South Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v.
