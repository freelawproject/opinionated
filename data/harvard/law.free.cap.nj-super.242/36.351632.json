Plaintiffs\u2019 respective decedents, Ronald G. Rubanick and Anthony DeMaio, had been employed at the Witco Chemical<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plant in Perth Amboy during a period when the Witco plant had polychlorinated biphenyl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>(PCB) contamination. The PCBs had been sold to Witco by Monsanto starting in 1969. Plaintiffs alleged in their complaints that their decedents\u2019 exposure to the PCBs caused decedents\u2019 colon cancers and ultimate untimely deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Immediately before the start of the Rubanick trial, peremptorily scheduled for September 8, 1987, Monsanto moved for an Evidence Rule 8 hearing to challenge the qualifications and competence of plaintiffs\u2019 expert in that case, Dr. Earl Balis, a Ph.D. biochemist with primary research responsibilities. Dr. Balis was also listed as the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert in the DeMaio matter. After a three day <em>in limine </em>hearing conducted on September 9,10 and 14,1987, Judge Hamlin, in an opinion reported as <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Corp., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>485, 542 <em>A.</em>2d 975 (Law Div.1988), concluded that while Dr. Balis may offer an opinion as to human carcinogenesis generally, he was not qualified to testify as to specific causation in individual humans because he lacked the requisite education, training and experience in treating cancer patients. <em>Id. </em>at 493-495, 542 <em>A.</em>2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Judge Hamlin also excluded the testimony because Dr. Balis had offered a \u201cnovel scientific opinion\u201d as to causation which had not been accepted by at least a \u201csubstantial minority of the applicable scientific community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495-503, 542 A.2d 975. Upon exclusion of Dr. Balis\u2019 testimony, Monsanto subsequently moved for summary judgment to dismiss both the Rubanick and DeMaio complaints, reasoning that in neither action could the plaintiffs establish a prima facie case without Dr. Balis\u2019 testimony. Judge Hamlin agreed and dismissed both complaints. Plaintiffs then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We agree with that part of the trial judge\u2019s opinion which concludes that the expert witness proffered by the plaintiffs in these consolidated cases may express his opinion as to human carcinogenesis. We reverse the judge\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Balis may not testify as to specific causation in individual humans and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Although we do not necessarily agree with the motion judge\u2019s opinion about the need for a \u201csubstantial minority\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>view for the opinion expressed by the expert, we conclude that in the field of causation of cancers novel opinions may be expressed by nonmedical expert testimony, if based on adequate education, training, or experience of the witness, unless the opinion proffered would be either illogical, outlandish or totally speculative such that no reasonable jury could accept the opinion. Dr. Balis\u2019 proffered opinion in this case would thus be admissible. We hasten to add that Dr. Balis had testified that the general concept that PCBs are carcinogenic and that they could either cause cancer directly or by promoting cancer was neither created by him nor a unique theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The facts developed at the hearing were that Monsanto had sold Witco PCB fluids, under the trade name Therminal, beginning in 1969, but discontinued shipments some time prior to 1976. <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 497, 542 A.2d 975. Therminal is a product name for the PCB compound Arochlor, and during the applicable period Monsanto shipped Arochlor 1242 and 1248, which was said to contain 42% and 48% chlorination respectively. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Ronald Rubanick worked at Witco from 1974 through 1979, when he was diagnosed as suffering from colon cancer. He was a non-smoker with no family history of cancer. Rubanick died of the cancer on July 23, 1980, at the age of 29. About two and one-half years after Rubanick\u2019s death, Anthony De-Maio, a thirty year Witco employee, was also diagnosed as suffering from colon cancer. He died of the cancer on June 29, 1984, at the age of 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">For purposes of the <em>in limine </em>hearing, Judge Hamlin accepted the fact that Rubanick, while working for Witco, had walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>through an area in the work place which had a high degree of PCB contamination \u201cprimarily in the earth.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In his testimony Balis summarized the information given to him about the quantity of PCBs to which Rubanick had been exposed in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">... there was some thirty-five thousand parts per million PCBs in the soil around there, that he would come home covered with this stuff and the material was oozing out of his clothes, according to I guess it was his wife\u2019s testimony, it was something, and I think that report that he lifted these heavy drums and slopping around in this muddy PCB mix, and you also showed some document about the State of New Jersey, some agency complaining about contamination from that stuff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">At the <em>in limine </em>hearing Monsanto presented its three experts first. It produced Dr. Thomas Fahey,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a board certified internist, with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer; Dr. Raymond Harbison, a Ph.D. toxicologist who had knowledge and experience with human exposures to PCBs; and Dr. Philip Cole, an epidemiologist, with a M.D. and a Ph.D. who indicated he was conversant with the medical and epidemiological literature as to cancer causation and PCB exposure. <em>Id. </em>at 490-491, 542 A.2d 975. Each of these experts testified that they were aware of no \u201cstatistically significant\u201d study which had concluded that PCBs cause cancer, and particularly colon cancer, in human beings. Dr. Harbison declined to recognize the International Agency for Research of Cancer (I.A.R.C.) as a valid scientific authority. <em>Id. </em>at 491, 542 A.2d 975. Dr. Cole does not recognize I.A.R.C.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as completely authoritative in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>human cancer causation. <em>Ibid. </em>Their qualifications were challenged not by cross-examination, but by the testimony of Dr. Balis, which was largely elicited as rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Dr. Balis has a Ph.D. and worked as a biochemist for the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research for over 37 years, specializing in cancer research. He was head of a research group which was primarily concerned with investigating the cause, treatment and diagnosis of colon cancer, and has published extensively on the topic of carcinogenesis. Some of his extensive qualifications are referred to in the published opinion of the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 542 A.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Balis\u2019 opinion that PCB contamination at Witco caused Rubanick\u2019s cancer was essentially based on four factors: (1) the extreme rarity of colon cancer in males under the age of 30, particularly when the male is a non-smoker and not from a \u201ccancer family\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) the fact that 5 out of 105 employees at Witco suffered some type of cancer during the pertinent period; (3) \u201ca very large body of evidence\u201d showing that PCBs produced cancer in experimental animals, and (4) the fact that there is not only a variance of the types of cancers in a PCB exposed population, but as he described them\u2014\u201cunusual cancers.\u201d The witness cited various publications, including 13 studies of the effect of PCBs on animals and humans in support of his opinion, with particular emphasis on an epidemiological study by <em>Bertazzi, Riboldi, Pesatori, Radice &amp; Zocchetti, </em>\u201cCancer Mortality of Capacitor Manufacturing Workers,\u201d 11 <em>Amer.J.Indus.Med. </em>165 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Balis testified, referring to the Bertazzi study and what happened at the Witco site:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ay-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>... one can extrapolate based upon the federal government rules that if a compound is found to cause cancer in experimental animals it's presumed to be carcinogenic to man and it is banned, and secondly, the statistical data indicating in two cases groups of people who were exposed to P.C.B. came down with amounts of cancer where, which were so huge statistically that they cannot be attributed to chance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In rejecting Dr. Balis\u2019 theory of causation, Judge Hamlin considered it \u201cnovel\u201d and relied on <em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>878, 522 A.2d 405 (1987). He considered \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d to be acceptance by a substantial minority of the applicable scientific community. <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 500, 542 A.2d 975. Although Judge Hamlin did not spell out what the \u201capplicable\u201d scientific community was he reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">Logic and policy dictate such a construction. If admissibility (as opposed to jury fact finding) were limited only to majority scientific opinions then admissibility would be a simple issue of arithmetic. By opening jury consideration to expert opinions embraced by a substantial minority scientific acceptance, there will be a testing in the advocacy arena of new ideas without prejudicing a party opposing the disfavored or novel principle. [Ru'd]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The question here is not the acceptance of the \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard but whether there are sufficient factual and scientific underpinnings to the expert\u2019s causation theory, recognizing that in experimentation and study of known or suspected cancer causing agents as a rule they are not intentionally administered to humans because of the risks involved. In other words, experiments in the field are not, as far as we know, performed directly on humans in order to see if cancer will result.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\"><em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>373, 522 A.2d 405, does not preclude the type of proffered testimony involved here. The Supreme Court in <em>Windmere </em>observed that in the trial there the testimony of the experts concerned the reliability of a scientific device for voice print analysis and that the proffered experts had very limited experience on the subject. Moreover, although the court recognized that no general acceptance within the professional community of voice print analysis had been established, the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the voice prints into evidence had not constituted prejudicial error. The Court affirmed the verdict in favor of the defendant insurer. The use of voice prints was acknowledged to be highly debated and that this type of evidence was not yet found to be of sufficient stature to validate the equipment used and the results obtained as had been the case with the breathalyzer, <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 78, 474 A.2d 1 (1984); and radar equipment, <em>State v. Dantonio, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>570, 115 A.2d 35 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">When <em>Windmere </em>discussed the \u201crequired reliability in terms of its general acceptance within the professional community\u201d it was talking about the required reliability of a device or machine, <em>i.e., </em>the voice print machine. 105 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 522 A.2d 405. <em>Windmere </em>does not necessarily preclude novel opinions or testimony by the first proponent of any particular theory. It recites various ways in which reliability may be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">There must also be a factual and scientific basis for an expert\u2019s opinion. <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981). The Supreme Court in <em>Windmere </em>was not concerned \u201cwith the qualifications of the experts but with the limited breadth of their experience and their potential bias.\u201d In any event, there is a difference between considering the reliability of a device and medical opinion as to the cause of cancer when the human body is exposed to known or suspected toxic or carcinogenic substances. It has been widely considered that PCBs are a carcinogenic substance. See <em>Winter, </em>\u201cCancer-Causing <em>Agents\u2014A </em>Preventive Guide,\u201d 156 (1979) (discussion of PCBs \u201cPolyclorinated Biphenyls\u201d). <em>Bertazzi, supra </em>\u201cCancer Mortality of Capacitor Mfg. Workers,\u201d 11 <em>Am.J.Indus.Med. </em>165-176 (1987) (possibility of PCBs posing \u00a1a carcinogenic risk to humans); <em>Gustavson, Hogstedt &amp; Rappe, </em>\"Short-Term Mortality and Cancer Incidence in Capacitor Mfg. Workers Exposed to Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs),\u201d 10 <em>Am.J.Indus.Med. </em>341-344 (1986) (cannot rule out possibility of a carcinogenic risk from PCB exposure).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>It appears that it is an improper focus to say that a known carcinogen<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> attacks only a particular target or targets in the body. For instance, although cigarette smoking has been widely discussed as a cause for lung cancer, the lung and pulmonary tract are not the only areas in the body that may be subjected to harm by cigarette smoking. See <em>Sweeting, \u201cA </em>Values Approach to Health Behavior,\u201d 124 (1990); <em>Winter, </em>\u201cCancer-Causing Agents,\u201d 187-188 (1979). Nor should the fact that other cases have involved instances where other types of cancer, for instance cancer of the liver, biliary tract and gall bladder, as potentially causally associated with exposure to PCBs, mean that testimony of the cancer causing propensity of exposures to PCBs should be limited to cases involving only such organ specific cancers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Part of the problem arises in this case because of the fact that an <em>in limine </em>hearing was held at which testimony was taken. We have previously expressed our reservations about the increased frequency of <em>in limine </em>hearings on evidence matters. See <em>Bellardini v. Krikorian, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 464, 537 A.2d 700 (App.Div.1988). There is no doubt that if objections to the expert\u2019s qualifications occurred at trial a Rule 8 hearing could have been held. See <em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 381, 522 A.2d 405. However, the difficulty presented here is that this <em>in limine </em>hearing was extensive and was more than an Evidence Rule 8 hearing on an expert\u2019s qualifications. It forced the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>to become not only the determiner of the expert qualifications of the witness and the existence of a scientific basis for his opinion (which appears to us sufficiently established to result in a jury question), but to become a fact-finder. The judge had to choose between conflicting testimony of experts and substituted himself for the jury\u2019s function on the ultimate issue. This is clear from the three days of testimony in an adversary-type proceeding in which Monsanto actually presented the testimony of its three witnesses first and sought to carry the burden of defending against plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s testimony before he- even got in the witness stand. The judge had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">The burden of proof to proceed and to demonstrate by the preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Balis\u2019 testimony or proffered testimony would not be proper is upon Monsanto. Therefore, they have the duty of going forward, and the duty of persuading me by the evidence that indeed his testimony should not be admitted as expert testimony for the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Monsanto\u2019s attorney disagreed that they had the burden of proof at this hearing, and the judge rephrased his statement so that Monsanto had \u201cthe duty of going forward to convince me [that plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony] has not reached that level\u201d of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The potential confusion between an Evidence Rule 8 hearing and a trial is emphasized when the trial judge pointed out in his opinion that Balis \u201chas previously served on a research team with Dr. Nancy Kemeny, Rubanick\u2019s treating physician at Sloan-Kettering. Dr. Kemeny was not offered as a witness in this case.\u201d 225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 492, 542 A.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Indeed, the trial judge here recognized that he was deviating from the usual and preferred practice, in part because both sides urged him to do so. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">It is generally my custom where challenges of such nature are made, to consider them only when the expert is offered in the context of a trial after a jury has been selected generally because this is [a] fuller and more complete factual record upon which to judge the expert\u2019s opinion, rather than a vacuum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Dr. Balis qualifies by definition as an expert.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He is a person who by knowledge, training or experience is deemed qualified to testify and express his opinion on cancer development and related scientific matters even if that opinion includes medical subjects. See <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>128, 135, 167 A.2d 625 (1961). See also <em>Hake v. Manchester Tp., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>302, 306, 486 A.2d 836 (1985); <em>Rosenberg by Rosenberg v. Cahill, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>318, 327-334, 492 A.2d 371 (1985); <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 124, 493 A.2d 1314 (App.Div.1985), mod. on other grounds 106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 525 A.2d 287 (1987). Deficiencies in the qualification of an expert is a matter to be weighed by the jury. <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 138, 167 A.2d 625; <em>Carbone v. Warburton, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>418, 426, 94 A.2d 680 (1953).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">It is for the jury to determine the credibility, weight and probative value of the expert\u2019s testimony, <em>Savoia v. F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 162, 211 A.2d 214 (App.Div.1965); <em>Angel v. Rand Express Lines, Inc., </em>66 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 85-86, 168 A.2d 423 (App.Div.1961), and the opinion of an expert can rise no higher than the facts and reasoning upon which it is based. <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 91, 477 A.2d 1246 (1984). The jury should, as is usually done, be instructed that it is not bound by any expert\u2019s opinion, but it is to consider it and give it the weight to which it deems it is entitled, whether that be great or slight, by weighing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>reasons, if any, given for it. The jury is also usually informed that it may reject an expert\u2019s opinion, if in its judgment the reasons given for it are unsound, the facts do not exist, or it is not based on knowledge and experience. <em>Polyard v. Terry, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>497, 511, 390 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1978), aff\u2019d o.b. 79 <em>N.J. </em>547, 401 A.2d 532 (1979); <em>Mohr v. B.F. Goodrich Rubber Co., </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 284, 371 A.2d 288 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 74 <em>N.J. </em>281, 377 A.2d 685 (1977). It is elementary that it is always within the personal function of the jury to decide whether the facts on which the answer of an expert is based actually exist, and the value or weight of an expert\u2019s opinion is dependent upon and no stronger than the facts on which it is predicated. <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 91, 477 A.2d 1246; <em>Polyard v. Terry, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 511, 390 A.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">A \u201cnet opinion,\u201d which is an expert\u2019s opinion unsupported by factual evidence, is inadmissible. <em>Matter of Yaccarino, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>175, 196, 564 A.2d 1184 (1989); <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 524, 435 A.2d 1150; <em>Jakubowski v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg., </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>177, 187, 199 A.2d 826 (1964); <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., supra; cf. Pearson v. St. Paul, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>110, 116, 531 A.2d 744 (App.Div.1987). This need for supporting data and a factual basis for the expert\u2019s opinion is especially important when the opinion is seeking to establish a cause and effect relationship. <em>Tabatchnick v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>67 <em>F.R.D. </em>49, 55 (D.N.J.1975). However, the rule frequently focuses, as in <em>Parker v. Goldstein, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 483-484, 189 A.2d 441 (App.Div.1963), certif. den. 40 <em>N.J. </em>225, 191 A.2d 63 (1963), on the failure of the expert to explain a causal connection between the act or incident complained of and the injury or damage allegedly resulting therefrom. See <em>Rempfer v. Deerfield Packing Corp., </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>135, 144-145, 72 A.2d 204 (1950); <em>Castroll v. Franklin Tp., </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 193, 391 A.2d 544 (App.Div.1978).

Bowen, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>36, 50, 473 A.2d 73 (1984), citing <em>Glenn Wall Assoc. v. Wall Tp., </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>Tax 24, 31-33 (1983). Where the basis for the opinion is questionable, it is proper for the trial judge to \u201cdetermine their factual underpinnings outside of the jury\u2019s presence\u201d rather than impose the sanction of excluding the testimony. <em>Gaido v.

If the court determines that the expert\u2019s testimony is unreliable, that opinion may be excluded. <em>Bowen v. Bowen, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 473 A.2d 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Regardless of the standard for admissibility, arguments to the jury concerning the weight to be given an expert opinion or evidence may have significant impact. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 203 (3d ed.1984). This treatise also notes that in environmental or drug litigation a party may seek to prove that the implicated chemical is carcinogenic through the use of statistical studies. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 209.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">The weight that may be given such testimony will depend, of course, on the skill of counsel and the ability and preparation of the witness. In addition, the methods that the expert uses to analyze and interpret that data, so as to assist the court or jury in understanding it, may be of great importance in determining the outcome. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Studies establishing a statistically sound causal relationship between a chemical and human cancer may be supportive of a causation theory, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the relevant disciplines may not have yet expressed agreement with a particular study. A broad approach is desirable when investigating questions of causation, and as the dissent notes: \u201cfactors pertaining to the injured party in question, such as his medical history, significant diagnostic and pathological findings, [as well as] the duration, quantum and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>manner of exposure to the offending chemical, may well add to the reliability of the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the record lacks any reference to the employees\u2019 employment history and other necessary factors, the lack of a complete record is in part a problem with the type of <em>in limine </em>ruling made here. See <em>Bellardini v. Krikorian, supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 464, 537 A.2d 700. We note that in the transcripts of the three day <em>in limine </em>hearings Balis testified that he relied in part on affidavits (marked for identification) of Kenneth D. Rosenman, the Director of Occupational and Environmental Health Services in the New Jersey Department of Health and of Robert H. Tucker who is employed as a research scientist by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Office of Cancer and Toxic Substances Research. Neither of these individuals testified at this hearing, although plaintiff may have intended to have them testify as witnesses at the trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rosenman stated in his affidavit that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">5. Studies have shown that PCBs have the potential for causing acute health problems; <em>such as </em>skin disease (e.g. chloracne), liver disease (e.g.. toxic hepatitis), and restrictive lung disease. Congenital birth defects have also been traced to PCB exposure as well as cancer in animals. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">6. PCBs are a stable compound that are poorly metabolized by the body and, therefore, are stored in the body after exposure. PCB levels in humanfs] increase over time of exposure. Studies of U.S. workers exposed to PCBs have revealed liver, lung, and skin problems. The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists PCBs as a probable carcinogen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">7. The routes of exposure for PCBs are inhalation, skin absorption, and ingestion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Tucker stated in his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">5. PCBs have caused profound toxic effects in humans. A most notable poisoning incident was the Yosho outbreak in Japan in 1968. The skin and liver are major sites of pathology with the gastrointestinal tract and nervous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>systems also being targets. Animal studies have shown that PCBs are carcinogenic and that they ean also enhance the carcinogenicity of other chemicals. Scientists are now in general agreement that there is no lower safe limit for chemicals that cause cancer, that is, although the risk decreases as the chemical concentration goes down there is no \u2018threshold\u2019 value below which no risk occurs. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency calculates that an exposure level as low as 0.26 nanograms of PCBs per liter of water could lead to an increased risk exposure of 1 cancer per 100,000 people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">* * ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">7. PCBs can enter the atmosphere by vaporization and may be found in either gaseous form or absorbed to airborne particulates. Persons in the area of PCB contamination, such as found on the Witco site, are subject to substantial PCB exposure through inhalation of vapors or particulates containing the contaminant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">8. Skin contact with PCBs presents a health risk since these compounds may be absorbed through the skin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">9. With airborne, skin absorption, and foodchain routes of exposure to the human population possible from the PCBs contaminating the Witco site, this situation represents a serious threat to human health. The concentrations of PCBs involved clearly present an unreasonable risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">All of those factors should be explored at a trial to the extent that they are relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The fact that an expert\u2019s opinion may not generally be accepted in the scientific community, is not a reason to preclude a qualified expert from testifying as to his opinion on causation, where there is a well-reasoned basis for the opinion based upon the expert\u2019s training, education and experience. See <em>Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical Co., </em>736 F.2d 1529, 1535-1536 (D.C.Cir.1984), <em>cert. </em>den. 469 <em>US. </em>1062, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>545, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>432 (1984) (pulmonary specialist permitted to testify that paraquat caused plaintiff\u2019s pulmonary fibrosis, notwithstanding the fact that expert\u2019s opinions were not generally accepted in scientific community).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">Thus, a cause-effect relationship need not be clearly established by animal or epidemiological studies before a doctor can testify that, in his opinion, such a relationship exists. As long as the basic methodology employed to reach such a conclusion is sound, such as use of tissue samples, standard tests, and patient examination, products liability law does not preclude recovery until a \u2018statistically significant\u2019 number of people have been injured or until science has had the time and resources to complete sophisticated laboratory studies of the chemical. In a courtroom, the test for allowing a plaintiff to recover in a tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>suit of this type is not scientific certainty but legal sufficiency; if reasonable jurors could conclude from the expert testimony that paraquat more likely than not caused Ferebee\u2019s injury, the fact that another jury might reach the opposite conclusion or that science would require more evidence before conclusively considering the causation question resolved is irrelevant. [736 <em>F.2d </em>at 1535].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">See also <em>Wells v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>788 F.2d 741, 745 (11 Cir.1986), <em>cert. </em>den. 479 <em>U.S. </em>950, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>437, 93 L.Ed.2d 386 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\"><em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, </em>\u00a7 702[03] (1988), suggests that an appropriate approach to determine whether or not to admit expert opinion testimony based on novel scientific evidence would be by reviewing it under a <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>403 analysis. <em>(Fed.R.Evid. </em>403 is essentially identical to <em>Evid.R. </em>4). Thus, the court would first assess the probative value of the proffered testimony and then assess the dangers posed by admitting this testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">After assessing probative value, the court must also assess the dangers posed by this particular kind of expert scientific evidence. The court will have to evaluate the degree to which the jurors might be over impressed by the aura of reliability surrounding the evidence, thereby leading them to abdicate their role of critical assessment. In making this determination the nature of the evidence may be significant. Some scientific evidence merely guides the jury in making its own assessment of the evidence; in other instances, the jury may be incapable of estimating the accuracy of the expert\u2019s conclusions by reference to the data on which the expert relies. Confusion of the jury, and the inordinate consumption of trial time are other dangers for the court to consider. See Rule 403. [Footnotes omitted]. <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, </em>\u00a7 702[03] (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Under such an approach the court should also consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">... such factors as the significance of the issue to which the evidence is directed, the availability of other proof, and the utility of limiting instructions. * * * The court may also be influenced by the extent to which the issues posed by this novel evidence were explored prior to trial, and whether the party opposing admissibility is adequately prepared. * * * The availability of competent experts to explore the limitations of the novel technique may also enter into the court\u2019s calculus. [Footnotes omitted.] <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">A relevancy analysis favors admissibility whenever the general conditions for admissibility are met. <em>Ibid. </em>It is not clear in this case that no reasonable expert could base an opinion on the studies and research relied on by Dr. Balis. In our view, Dr. Balis need not have treated or have been able to medically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>treat plaintiffs in order to render a scientific opinion as to the cause or causes of the decedents\u2019 colon cancer. It was for the jury to determine the facts and to either accept or reject the methodology used by Dr. Balis and his opinion based on the reasons given therefor. The motion judge in this case usurped the jury\u2019s fact-finding function. Moreover, in concluding that Dr. Balis had \u201cglossed over\u201d significant factors the motion judge again intruded on the jury\u2019s function. Such matters are properly the subject of exploration and cross-examination at a trial. Obviously, the proceeding here was not intended to be a substitute for a trial. It did, however, prevent a trial and had the effect of precluding plaintiffs from having their proper day in court. In our view Dr. Balis qualified as an appropriate expert and should have been allowed to express his opinion with respect to whether PCB contamination at Witeo was a proximate cause of Rubanick\u2019s cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The dissent relies in part on cases involving the effect of and adverse reactions by some individuals to certain medications. We find these types of cases inapposite with respect to a discussion of the carcinogenic effect of PCBs. The dissent also notes that Dr. Balis\u2019 ultimate opinion is couched in terms of \u201chighly probable\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d but when pressed his testimony was couched in terms of \u201cpossibilities\u201d and \u201chigh possibilities.\u201d Of course, the medical and scientific professions do not necessarily think or speak in terms of legal jargon. Hence, it must be ascertained what is meant by the witness when terms such as \u201chighly probable,\u201d \u201cprobable,\u201d \u201cpossibility\u201d and \u201chigh possibility\u201d are used in relation to the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard. Parenthetically, Dr. Balis conceded he had never testified as an expert witness before (and hoped it would be his last). Thus, he would not necessarily express his opinion in carefully phrased legal jargon. Judge Hamlin asked Balis if in general the majority of the scientific community accepts the thesis that PCBs are carcinogens. The witness responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIu\">Well, let <em>me put </em>it this way. I don\u2019t think the majority of the scientific community pays any attention to PCBs whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>If you\u2019re talking about those who have worked on PCBs and who have published on PCBs, I would say that of the thirty-nine papers that I\u2019ve looked at, thirteen say yes, three or four are sort of equivocal, and the others I don\u2019t remember in detail, but I have, somewheres around here I had thirteen papers that supported it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In addition, the testimony which discusses possibilities versus probabilities was in response to the court\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">Within the scientific community, based upon all the information and literature you have seen, is there general or majority agreement by the scientists involved in the discipline that exposure to PCBs would probably cause colon cancer in humans?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Balis\u2019 answer was \u201cProbably, that\u2019s very difficult.\u201d He said that the scientists with whom he had discussed the proposition said \u201cthey think it\u2019s a damn good candidate but they\u2019re not saying probableft] ... they said it\u2019s a high possibility.\u201d The issue is whether <em>Balis\u2019 </em>opinion is that the PCB exposure probably caused Rubanick\u2019s cancer, not the phraseology used by other scientists.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">With regard to \u201cProbability and possibility; capacity and tendency; cause and effect\u201d 7 <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>(Chad-bourne rev.1978) \u00a7 1976 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">There is no sufficient reason for excluding such statements from qualified witnesses, because it must almost always be impossible for a witness to reproduce in words absolutely all the detailed data which enter into his estimate, and there can be no danger in receiving such an estimate from him____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">It should be added that courts sometimes misapply the opinion rule to enforce the doctrine of torts that a recovery for future <em>personal injuries </em>must include only the certain or fairly <em>probable, </em>but not the merely <em>possible, </em>consequences; so that the judge, instead of covering the subject by an instruction to the jury as to the measure of recovery, excludes from evidence a physician\u2019s opinion expressed in terms of possibility only. This attempt to control the course of expert testimony is of course unreasonable in itself. Its unsoundness becomes the more notable when the same court is found ruling, in another line of precedence, that the physician may express an opinion as to what might have caused an injury, but not as to what did cause it. In other words, possibility, as affecting <em>consequences, </em>is tabooed, and only actuality is to be accepted; a possibility, as affecting <em>causes, </em>is sanctioned, while actuality is tabooed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">This is only one of the many instances in which the subtle mental twistings produced by the opinion rule have reduced this part of the law to a congeries of nonsense which is comparable to the incantations of medieval sorcerers and sullies the name of reason in our law.

This case cannot turn on the fact that Dr. Balis has not developed and reduced his theory to writing in a scientific journal. In my judgment facts may be developed so as to render his opinion reliable even if no other expert in the scientific community has to date conducted any study which supports the theory. For example, if an extraordinarily high percentage of Witco employees of decedents\u2019 ages, who worked contemporaneously with them, contracted cancer, as compared with the general population of cancer victims, there would be factual support which might itself substantially enhance the reliability of Dr. Balis\u2019 theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\"> Of course, defendants will challenge the credibility and opinion of Dr. Balis, if it is admitted, by pointing out all the evidence and factors lacking from his analysis, as developed by Judge Havey.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b93-7\">HAVEY, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The lead opinion concludes that the absence of any scientific support for Dr. Balis\u2019 \u201cnovel\u201d causation theory is no impediment to its admission into evidence.

I would affirm the order precluding Dr. Balis\u2019 testimony and consequent summary judgment orders in Monsanto\u2019s favor. However, I would do so not by deciding whether Dr. Balis\u2019 theory has received \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d within the scientific community, <em>see Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins.

Second, I would exclude it because the opinion has no factual basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">At the <em>in limine </em>hearing, Monsanto argued that Dr. Balis\u2019 theory that PCBs cause colon cancer in humans must be rejected because the theory had not received \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d within the scientific community. Monsanto\u2019s argument was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>predicated on the pronouncement in <em>Windmere </em>that the admissibility of expert scientific evidence requires that the proponent prove the reliability of the evidence in terms of its \u201cgeneral acceptance within the professional community.\u201d 105 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 522 <em>A.2d </em>405. <em>See also State v.

Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 536, 432 A.2d 86 (1981). This \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard flows from the essential requirement that a scientific technique have \u201csufficient scientific basis to produce uniform and reasonably reliable results <em>and </em>contribute materially to the ascertainment of truth[.]\u201d <em>Windmere, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 386, 522 A.2d 405, quoting <em>State v. Cary, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>343, 352, 230 <em>A.2d </em>384 (1967) [emphasis in original]. This requirement is a refinement of the standard originally proposed in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 <em>F. </em>1013 (D.C.Cir.1923), that a scientific principle or discovery is admissible when it has \u201cgained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs\u201d; that is, when it passes from the \u201cexperimental\u201d stage and reaches a \u201cdemonstrable\u201d stage. <em>Id. </em>at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Judge Hamlin interpreted \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d to mean acceptance by \u201cat least a substantial minority of the applicable scientific community.\u201d <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Corp., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>485, 500, 542 A.2d 975 (Law Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">My problem with applying the <em>Frye-Windmere </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard, or any quantified standard in a toxic tort case is that it involves the admissibility of the results of a scientifically novel device, technique or mode of analysis. <em>See e.g., Windmere, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 377, 522 A.2d 405 (voiceprint analysis); <em>Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 211-212, 478 A.2d 364 (scientific reliability of \u201cbattered-woman\u2019s syndrome\u201d); <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 78, 474 A.2d 1 (1984) (breathalyzer test); <em>Cavallo, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 525-526, 443 A.2d 1020 (diagnosis of tendency to commit rape on basis of rapist profile not generally accepted). The rationale of these decisions is that once a showing of \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d of the instrument or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>technique has been made, courts may take judicial notice of its reliability and will admit into evidence test results without requiring further proof. <em>See Windmere, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 522 A.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">A simple mechanistic application of the \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard is not appropriate when the issue, as here, is whether a specific chemical has probably caused a particular disease. The issue is not whether there should be a judicial validation of a scientific device or mode of analysis \u201cfor all future use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 522 A.2d 405. Rather, the question is whether there are sufficient factual and scientific underpinnings to the expert\u2019s causation theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Application of the \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard may spawn unjust results in a field such as toxic torts. Plaintiffs face complex and unique practical difficulties in their effort to prove causation because of long latency periods between exposure and illness, as well as the countervailing proofs that the plaintiffs have encountered other intervening exposures or forces which may have been the \u201ccause\u201d of their injury or disease. <em>See Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 585, 525 A.2d 287 (1987). In my view, an epidemiological study of recent vintage may stand alone in establishing a causal relationship between a specific chemical and human cancer. Nevertheless, the study may be statistically sound because the population studied and controls and methodology employed render its results reasonably reliable. A qualified expert, who relies on this single study, as well as other pertinent facts and data, should not be prevented from rendering the causation opinion simply because a majority of those practicing in the applicable discipline have not yet confirmed the reliability of the study. A scientific \u201cnose counting\u201d to determine whether the expert\u2019s causation opinion has received \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d would, in such a circumstance, be unjust. <em>U.S. v. Downing, </em>753 A.2d 1224, 1238-1243 (3rd Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>I therefore agree with the lead opinion that admission into evidence of a causation opinion should not be dependent upon \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d of the expert\u2019s underlying theory. However, while an expert\u2019s well-reasoned opinion, based on even a single epidemiological or other relevant study (together with other pertinent facts) may be admissible, there must be at least <em>some </em>conclusive support in the scientific community for the proffered theory in order to render the opinion reliable. It is one thing to say that the lag in majority acceptance of a theory should not deprive a litigant of his day in court; it is another to permit a jury to reach scientific conclusions that not a single scientist has yet been able to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Rather than applying the \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard, determining admissibility of an opinion as to causation must be accomplished on a case-by-case basis because of the fact-specific nature of each case. However, the underlying concern is the same as that addressed in <em>Frye, Windmere </em>and <em>Cavallo: </em>the lynchpin to expert testimony is that it be reliable. <em>See Cavallo, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 517-518, 443 A.2d 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">It is clear that the reliability requirement is not satisfied simply by the expert testifying as to his or her personal belief or opinion. The causal relationship between exposure to a chemical and human disease is not necessarily so simply because plaintiff\u2019s expert says it is so. <em>See Viterbo v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>826 F.2d 420, 424 (5th Cir.1987). Also, the opinion cannot be based on \u201cguess or conjecture.\u201d <em>Pelose v. Green, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>545, 549-551, 537 A.2d 745 (App.Div.), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>610, 546 A.2d 530 (1988). While <em>Evid.R. </em>56(2) permits an expert to base his opinion on facts or data made known to him before the hearing, and the underlying facts or data need not be admissible \u201c[i]f of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field[,]\u201d there are \u201climits to the permissible inferences that may be extracted from experts\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 91, 477 A.2d 1246 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>An expert\u2019s \u201cbare conclusions,\u201d unsupported by factual evidence, is no more than an inadmissible \u201cnet opinion.\u201d <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981). There must be a factual and scientific basis sufficient to meet the reliability threshold. Recently we stated the rule in <em>Vuocolo v. Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 299, 573 A.2d 196 (App.Div.1990) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Historically, courts have refused to admit expert medical testimony based on mere speculation or possibility, unsupported by the evidence. As one commentator has noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">It seems universally agreed that an expert medical opinion as to the cause of death, disease, or other physical condition is inadmissible if it is solely an unsupported conclusion of the witness, since however well qualified the witness is, and however scientific or abstruse the subject matter is, an opinion must have reference to the material facts of the case as reflected by the evidence. [Annotation, \u201cOpinion Evidence\u2014Disease or Injury,\u201d 66 A.L.R.2d 1082, 1086 (1959)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In requiring facts and data to support the opinion, the obvious concern is that such scientific theory, simply because it is termed \u201cscientific\u201d by the expert, will be accorded undue weight by untrained lay jurors, \u201cwho are overly deferential to anything portrayed as \u2018science.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker and Monahan, </em>\u201cSocial Frameworks: A New Use of Social Science in Law,\u201d 73 <em>Va.L.Rev. </em>559, 576 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">As stated, a salient and recent study establishing causal connection between a chemical and human cancer may be supportive of a causation theory notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the relevant discipline has not yet expressed agreement with the study. Also, rather than focusing solely on a single discipline, such as epidemiology, other scientific methods and data may be helpful, such as toxicology, animal studies, clinical research, public sector studies and investigations conducted of the specific contaminated site in question. <em>See Mauro v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Co., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 206, 542 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1988), aff\u2019d <em>sub. nom. Mauro v. Raymark Indus., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>126, 561 A.2d 257 (1989). Further, factors pertaining to the injured party in question, such as his or her treatment and medical history, significant diagnostic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pathological findings, and the duration, quantum and manner of exposure to the offending chemical, may well be significant in resolving the threshold question of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The federal court decisions on this point are instructive. For example, the lead opinion cites <em>Ferebee v. Chevron Chem. Co., </em>736 <em>F.2d </em>1529 (D.C.Cir.1984), <em>cert. </em>den. 469 <em>US. </em>1062, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>545, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>432 (1984), for the proposition that an expert\u2019s opinion as to causation is admissible despite absence of \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d of the theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">However, of significance is that in <em>Ferebee, </em>plaintiff\u2019s exposure to the toxic herbicide paraquat was extensive and the indicia of his illness was immediate. <em>Id. </em>at 1532. Moreover, the experts who gave the opinion that the paraquat caused plaintiff\u2019s pulmonary fibrosis were his treating physicians who diagnosed his sickness, treated and examined him and employed standard tests in reaching their conclusion as to causation. <em>Id. </em>at 1533. Of most significance is the court\u2019s observation that since 1960, paraquat exposure \u201chas been known\u201d to lead to lung cancer, and medical literature and defendant\u2019s own incident reports had cataloged cases in which paraquat had caused immediate death or lung problems. <em>Id. </em>at 1537. Thus, in contrast to the case before us, plaintiff\u2019s experts had <em>some </em>scientific support for their opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The lead opinion does not cite <em>Richardson v.

Applying the Federal Rule of Evidence 703 (essentially identical to our <em>Evid.R. </em>56(2)), the court reasoned that plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s opinion as to causation lacked a scientific or factual basis. 857 F.2d at 829-833.

Defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that plaintiff\u2019s experts failed to refute a federal study (the ATSDR<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> study) which concluded that the residents\u2019 PCB level did not differ significantly from the PCB level borne by the general population, and further that the experts\u2019 opinions were contrary to generally accepted scientific and medical opinion regarding PCBs. <em>Id. </em>at 365-366. In granting summary judgment, the court \u201clooked behind\u201d the experts\u2019 statements that animal studies supported their conclusion that PCBs cause disease in humans. <em>Id. </em>at 368. It rejected the use of such studies as being unreliable, and found the Yusho and Yu Cheng studies, regarding disease in a Japanese population that had ingested PCB-contaminated rice, was of no value. <em>Ibid. </em>The court also concluded that plaintiff\u2019s experts\u2019 opinions had no scientific or medical support for their conclusion that PCB caused specific diseases, particularly in view of the ATSDR study. <em>Id. </em>at 370-372.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The <em>Paoli </em>court also rejected the expert\u2019s use of a \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d of many epidemiological studies of PCBs, none of which independently showed any connection between PCBs and cancer. <em>Id. </em>at 373. The expert claimed that when the data was read together, it presented \u201csubstantial evidence for a causal association between excess risk of death from cancer of the liver, biliary tract and gall bladder and exposure to PCBs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373. The court found the \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d as an unreliable, novel scientific technique which could potentially confuse the jury because of its scientific nature, and because none of the plaintiffs had cancer of the liver, biliary tract or gall bladder. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">It is evident that the federal cases conflict in their approach to the \u201creliability\u201d issue. This conflict no doubt arises because of the fundamental difference between the more exacting standard of proof necessary before a theory is \u201caccepted\u201d in the scientific community, and the legal standard predicated on reasonable medical probability. <em>See Ferebee supra, </em>736 <em>F.</em>2d at 1536. However, what clearly evolves from these cases is that if there is <em>no </em>support for the proffered theory found in the scientific community, and if the opinion is so lacking in underlying facts and probative force that no reasonable expert would render it, then it must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A careful examination of all facts and data relied on by Dr. Balis in support of his causation theory satisfies me that his opinion was properly excluded. That occurrence of colon cancer in males under 30 is rare does not by itself prove that 29-year old Rubanick\u2019s exposure to PCBs probably caused his colon cancer. He simply may have fallen within the statistical minority for reasons entirely apart from PCB exposure. As Judge Hamlin observed, the \u201chuman body, with its residual genetic weaknesses and differences, requires an accounting of other factors and information.\u201d <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 494, 542 <em>A.</em>2d 975. The judge concluded that Dr. Balis had \u201cglossed over\u201d significant factors such as decedent\u2019s health, diet, family history and exposure to other causative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>sources. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 542 A.2d 975. In addition, little was said by Dr. Balis as to the duration and quantum of exposure to the offending chemical, or whether the dosage in question was sufficient to cause any adverse health effect in humans. Indeed, as in <em>Paoli, </em>the witness completely disregarded the results of the federal (NIOSH)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> study of the Witco site which disclosed that blood serum PCB levels of Witco employees were within normal range. <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 542 A.2d 975. Further, unlike the physicians-experts in <em>Ferebee, </em>Dr. Balis did not, and indeed could not treat the decedent. Absent here is a sound methodology employed to reach a cause-effect relationship such as use and examination of \u201ctissue samples, standard tests, and patient examination,\u201d the results of which may or may not have been supportive of a claim of causation. <em>Ferebee, supra, </em>736 F.2d at 1535-1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The fact that three other Witco employees had died of other forms of cancer is also of little qualitative value. Absent from the record is any reference to the employees\u2019 employment history, their exposure to PCBs, their family history and potential exposure to other cancer-causing chemicals outside or even within the Witco plant. Without such a factual foundation, Dr. Balis\u2019 bare conclusion that the deaths are somehow significant in proving causation between the PCBs and decedents\u2019 colon cancer is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moreover, while Dr. Balis\u2019 ultimate opinion is couched in \u201chighly probable\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d terms, his <em>in limine </em>testimony throughout, when pressed, is based on \u201cpossibilities\u201d and \u201chigh possibilities.\u201d A medical or scientific opinion must be couched in terms of reasonable probability, not possibility. <em>Vuocolo, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 300, 573 A.2d 196; <em>Johnesee v. Stop &amp; Shop Cos., Inc., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 431, 416 <em>A.2d </em>956 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Of most importance is the total lack of support in the scientific studies and literature for Dr. Balis\u2019 theory. Bertazzi\u2019s study of PCBs\u2019 adverse effects on humans, cited by the majority and Dr. Balis, reports cases of cloracne, and cancer of the liver, GI tract and pancreas, but not of the colon. <em>Bertazzi, et al, </em>\u201cCancer Mortality of Capacitor Manufacturing Workers,\u201d 11 <em>Amer.J.Indus.Med. </em>165, 169-171 (1987). Nowhere does Bertaz-zi suggest that scientists can extrapolate his findings into a conclusion that PCBs also cause colon cancer. Moreover, Ber-tazzi reports that while the number of tumors found was higher than expected, the number of cases \u201cwas small, and the excess was not statistically significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169. He concludes that the \u201climitations discussed did not permit a causal association to be either proved or dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174. Such a finding is far short of reasonable scientific or medical certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Similarly, Brown's study of workers exposed to PCBs reported no colon cancer. Also, he reports that the \u201cslight excesses for liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver are consistent with previously reported findings on experimental animals exposed to PCBs, and <em>suggest </em>that there <em>may be </em>an association between these causes of death and occupational exposure to PCBs.\u201d <em>Brown and Jones, </em>\u201cMortality and Industrial Hygiene Study of Workers Exposed to Polychlorinated Biphenyls,\u201d 36 <em>Arch. Environ. Health </em>120, 128 (1981) [emphasis added]. Specifically, Brown states that \u201c[b]ecause a relatively small number of deaths were observed, conclusions drawn from the results of this study are tentative.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>I find that the lack of conclusive epidemiological proof in these studies as being fatal to Dr. Balis\u2019 opinion. <em>See Brock, supra, </em>874 F.2d at 313. As in <em>Richardson, </em>857 A.2d at 830, the studies merely raise a <em>suspicion </em>of causal relationship between PCBs and certain forms of human cancer and provide no support for an opinion that PCBs <em>probably </em>cause <em>colon </em>cancer in humans. In my view, it is inappropriate to allow a jury to conclude from these studies that causation in a specific case exists when the studies them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>selves conducted by experts in the field, are at best inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Dr. Balis\u2019 reliance on the animal studies, is also unwarranted. Preliminarily, decisions dealing with whether the results of animal studies can be used to predict the carcinogenicity of chemicals in humans are split, and thus provide us with little guidance. <em>See Lynch v. Merrell-National Laboratories, </em>830 F.2d 1190, 1194 (1st Cir.1987) (in vivo animal studies not capable of proving causation in human beings in the absence of confirmatory epidemiological data); <em>In re Agent Orange, </em>611 <em>F.Supp. </em>1223, 1241 (E.D.N.Y.1985), aff\u2019d 818 <em>F.2d </em>187 (2d Cir.1987), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub. nom. Lombardi v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>1234, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2898, 101 L.Ed.2d 932 (1988) (animal studies \u201cnot helpful\u201d because they involved different biological species); <em>but see Villari v. Terminix Intern., Inc., </em>692 <em>F.Supp. </em>568, 571 (E.D.Pa.1988) (substantial segment of scientific community relies on animal studies in assessing health risks in humans).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In any event, I am in accord with Judge Hamlin\u2019s observations regarding the animal studies cited by Dr. Balis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">In short the bulk of those studies deal with ingested PCBs in rodent populations with varying degrees of chlorination, higher than that involved here. In some cases where PCBs with 54% chlorination were administered (along with benzenehexachloride), liver cancers were observed. Lesser degrees of chlorination did not give rise to these results. In no cases did any test animals develop colon cancer. To make the quantum leap from laboratory animal non occurrence to human causality to a reasonable degree of medical certainty is not warranted or supportable. <em>[Rubanick, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 502, 542 <em>A.2d </em>975].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">I am also in accord with the judge\u2019s rejection of the Environmental Protection Agency's declaration that PCBs are \u201charmful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497-498, 542 <em>A.</em>2d 975. As he properly observes, the regulation, 40 <em>C.F.R. </em>761.20, refers to toxicity, not carcinogenicity. Moreover, the regulation and enabling statute, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>2601 (1982), are intended to regulate chemical substances; they do not pretend to establish a basis of proving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>within scientific certainty that a particular chemical caused illness in a specific person.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The lead opinion suggests that Dr. Balis should be permitted to testify and that all factors which may support his opinion \u201cshould be explored at a trial to the extent that they are relevant.\u201d At 55, 576 A.2d at 13. Presumably, this would allow the scope of Dr. Balis\u2019 opinion to be expanded beyond his written report, deposition and <em>in limine </em>testimony, based on facts which may be adduced at trial, even though such an expansion would no doubt cause undue surprise and prejudice to Monsanto. <em>See R. </em>4:10-2(d) and <em>R. </em>4:17-7. In any event, plaintiffs have not suggested to us that other facts will be adduced at trial that may lend support to Dr. Balis\u2019 theory. Indeed, once Dr. Balis\u2019 testimony was precluded, plaintiffs did not oppose Monsanto\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The majority also concludes that the absence of a factual basis or scientific support for Dr. Balis\u2019 causation theory goes to the weight to be accorded his opinion, not to its admissibility. At 50-51, 576 A.2d at 11. However, the purpose of <em>Evid.R. </em>56(2) is to provide \u201csome assurance of reliability before scientific evidence is admitted.\u201d <em>Cavallo, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 518, 443 A.2d 1020. As stated, this is so because of the substantial danger that the jury will accord \u201cexcessive weight to unreliable expert testimony ... because the evidence is labeled \u2018scientific\u2019 and \u2018expert.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is therefore the trial court\u2019s function, and not the jury\u2019s, to make the threshold reliability determination. The judge here made that finding after a thorough <em>in limine </em>hearing and painstaking analysis of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Judge Hamlin properly granted Monsanto\u2019s application to bar the testimony of Dr. Balis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\"> Because I would rest my affirmance on the absence of scientific and factual bases for Dr. Balis\u2019 opinion, I do not reach the question whether Dr. Balis, as a biochemist, was qualified to testify as to causation in specific human beings. I note, however, that while our courts have taken a liberal approach in allowing cross-qualification of experts in other contexts, I hesitate to conclude that a biochemist, while highly qualified in the field of cancer research, may testify as to causation between a chemical and a disease in a specific individual without any experience in the medical treatment of human beings and the diagnosis of diseases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> The lead opinion also cites <em>Wells v.
