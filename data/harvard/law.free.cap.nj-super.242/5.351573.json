The issue presented on appeal is whether the JUA may rescind an automobile insurance policy after erroneously extending coverage to an \u201cunqualified applicant\u201d under <em>N.J. S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m) when that applicant did not make any misrepresentations in obtaining the contested policy. We hold that the summary judgment was mistakenly entered and reversed the judgment under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">Despite the rather truncated facts and narrow issue presented to the Law Division judge, both parties have submitted documents containing factual information not before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>trial court. Such conduct is in violation of appellate rules. <em>R. </em>2:5-4(a); <em>Middle Dep\u2019t Insp. Agency v. Home Ins. Co., </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 56, 380 A.2d 1165 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 76 <em>N.J. </em>234, 386 A.2d 858 (1978). However, because we find it necessary to reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings, we will utilize the additional material since it is largely immaterial to the outcome of the case and will provide guidance to the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">These are the facts. On December 19, 1984, plaintiff Joseph Catton entered into a lease agreement with Braman Cadillac Leasing Corp. of Miami, Florida, for a 1985 Porsche. At the time, plaintiffs were insured under a JUA policy issued by State Farm Insurance Companies (State Farm) on June 5, 1984 covering a 1983 Audi owned by plaintiffs. The policy indicated that plaintiffs lived in Oakhurst, New Jersey. Plaintiffs requested that the Porsche be added to the policy through their regular broker, R.S.A. Brokerage in Brooklyn, New York. The Porsche was not registered in New Jersey nor, apparently, was plaintiff Joseph Catton a licensed New Jersey driver. The declaration sheet of the policy was amended as requested and, thereafter, the policy was renewed in June, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">On or about October 29, 1985 the Porsche was stolen from the driveway of plaintiffs\u2019 home located in Oakhurst. A report of the theft was filed with the Ocean Township Police Department. Thereafter, plaintiffs submitted a claim to State Farm for the loss of the Porsche. State Farm refused payment, claiming that plaintiffs were ineligible for coverage pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m), which requires, among other things, that the insured automobile be registered in New Jersey. Thereafter, State Farm rescinded the policy and issued a check to plaintiffs for the amount of the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">In response to State Farm\u2019s refusal to satisfy the claim, plaintiffs filed this action. Prior to trial, State Farm moved for and was granted summary judgment. Plaintiffs do not challenge that decision. In due course, the case was assigned to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>judge for trial. Rather than proceed to a plenary hearing, the parties, at JUA\u2019s request, stipulated certain facts and presented a narrow issue .to the trial judge for decision by way of summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The parties stipulated that the Porsche was not registered in New Jersey and, for the purpose of the motion only, that there were no misrepresentations appearing in plaintiffs\u2019 application for insurance coverage. The precise issue presented to the trial judge, as contained in the summary judgment order executed by him, was \u201cwhether the defendant has the right to rescind the insurance policy rather than cancel it on the basis that the plaintiffs are not qualified applicants for insurance under the provision of <em>N.J.S. </em>17:30E-1 et seq. (New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Availability Act), in that it has been stipulated that plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle was not registered in the State of New Jersey and for purposes of this motion the court makes no finding as to any misrepresentation as to the registration appearing in the plaintiff\u2019s application for insurance.\u201d Based on that stipulation and the legal arguments presented, the trial judge upheld defendant\u2019s right to rescind the policy and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice and without costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Plaintiffs contend on appeal that, because they made no misrepresentations in obtaining the policy, they are entitled to coverage. JUA contends that it is irrelevant that plaintiffs made no factual misrepresentations in order to procure the insurance. It contends that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m) it is able to rescind the policy because: 1) plaintiff, Joseph Catton, did not possess a valid New Jersey Driver\u2019s License at the time the insurance was obtained;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 2) the leased Porsche was registered in Florida and not in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>As previously stated, it is undisputed for the purpose of this opinion that any and all questions asked of plaintiffs when applying for the insurance policy were answered honestly. Moreover, neither the JUA, State Farm nor JUA\u2019s approved broker, R.S.A. Brokerage, ever inquired into where the subject automobile was registered. In addition, the policy itself does not make any reference to the statutory definition of qualified applicant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m) defines a \u201cqualified applicant\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">a person domiciled in New Jersey who is an owner of an automobile registered, or to be registered within 60 days of application, and principally garaged in this State, who has been refused coverage in the voluntary market, and who cannot be or is not placed in the voluntary market____ No person shall, however, be deemed a qualified applicant, if the principal operator of the automobile to be insured does not hold a driver\u2019s license which is valid in this State; or if a regular operator of the automobile other than the principal operator does not hold such a license____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Absent \u201cexplicit indication of a special meaning\u201d words must be given their ordinary meaning. <em>In re Barnert Memorial Hosp. Rates, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>31, 40, 455 A.2d 469 (1983). Accordingly, as defendant contends, plaintiffs do not qualify for coverage under the above provisions. However, plaintiffs maintain that because defendant failed to elicit the necessary information concerning eligibility, they were led to believe that they were properly covered. Therefore, we must determine which party bears the responsibility of making certain that only \u201cqualified applicants\u201d are provided coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">A \u201cSenate Labor, Industry and Professions Committee Statement\u201d was issued in connection with the statute. The first paragraph of the Statement explains the purpose of the statute. It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The JUA, as the association [New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association] is commonly called, was established by the Legislature in 1983 to supplant the Assigned Risk Plan for private passenger vehicles. It was designed to provide private passenger automobile insurance coverage at voluntary market rates for drivers who are unable to secure coverage in the voluntary market. <em>This bill deals primarily with the governance, operations, and revenue of the association. [Id. </em>(Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The legislative statement indicates that the JUA is responsible for following the guidelines set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m). Further, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:3QE-9(b) provides that an insurance policy may issue only after the \u201cservicing carrier determines that the applicant is a qualified applicant.\u201d Clearly, the legislative statement and the statutory provision when read together place the burden on the JUA, through its servicing carriers, to ascertain whether the applicant meets the qualifying provisions of the statute. Obviously, this can only be done through the application process. The servicing carrier, State Farm, failed to make the necessary inquiry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">It is, we think, disingenuous for the JUA to argue that an applicant should be conversant with statutory provisions which are intended to regulate the JUA, not the applicant. The evidentiary presumption that everyone is presumed to know the statutory and regulatory law of the State is intended to apply only to those litigants whose conduct the statute or regulation was intended to regulate. Support for this conclusion is also found in <em>Harr v. Allstate Ins. Co., 54 N.J. </em>287, 255 <em>A.</em>2d 208 (1969). In that case, the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized that insurance policies are \u201ccomplex contracts of adhesion, prepared by the insuror ... [possessing] terms and provisions [which are] quite unintelligible to the insured even were he to attempt to read and understand their unfamiliar and technical language and awkward and unclear arrangement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 255 A.2d 208. The court stressed that the insurer must obtain \u201cthrough its representatives all information pertinent to the risk and the desired coverage before the contract is issued; and that it is likewise its obligation to make policy provisions, especially those relating to coverage, exclusions and vital condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tions, plain, clear and prominent to the layman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 255 A.2d 208. Thus, it is firmly established that insurers must deal with applicants as laymen and not as experts in the ever changing law of underwriting. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, in <em>Merchants Indem. Corp. v. Eggleston, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>114, 179 A.2d 505 (1962) the Court posited that, \u201c[i]t would be unjust to visit the loss upon an insured whose good faith is unassailable, and to absolve a carrier which could have asked, but did not, for the facts it regards as material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 179 A.2d 505. <em>See also Portella v. Sonnenberg, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 360, 181 A.2d 385 (App.Div.1962). While admittedly these cases apply to voluntary market policies, as opposed to JUA policies, we see no reason why the principles should not remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">JUA\u2019s reliance on the recent case of <em>Bidnick v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 552 A.2d 1023 (App.Div.1989) is misplaced. In that case, we determined that an insurer could rescind an automobile insurance policy and rebate the insured\u2019s premiums after it discovered the insured had falsely represented that he was a New Jersey resident. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 552 A.2d 1023. The facts we are required to accept as true in this case, however, are vastly different from those in <em>Bidnick. </em>Here, plaintiffs did not make any misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Accordingly, the summary judgment entered in favor of defendant is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\"> This argument does not appear to have been a basis for defendant\u2019s argument below, although it is a disqualifier under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>However, as will be seen <em>infra, </em>the allegation is irrelevant, assuming plaintiff made no misrepresentations in obtaining the insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-12\"> We assume that the policy included in plaintiffs\u2019 appendix, certified to be true by an agent of State Farm, is the policy issued to plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
