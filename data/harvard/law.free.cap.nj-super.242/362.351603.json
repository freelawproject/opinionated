Purex\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Allied appeals and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">As both parties framed the issue, it is whether Purex had sufficient \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with New Jersey to justify the exercise of State jurisdiction. Purex contended that, while it owned real property here, registering its agent for process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>was only related to New Jersey environmental litigation stemming from its predecessor\u2019s activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Purex claimed it had effectively left the State for purposes of Allied\u2019s action, citing <em>Keech v. Lapointe Mach. Tool Co., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 182, 491 A.2d 10 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We know of no New Jersey or Supreme Court authority for the proposition that a corporation may limit a state\u2019s jurisdiction in the manner Purex suggests and none has been cited to us. Moreover, Purex asserts no limiting action on its part in the appointment process under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:4-2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor does Purex contend it has unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw its registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Our review of the authority on which Purex relies discloses only one case that found <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction lacking over a corporation registered to do business in the forum state where the corporation\u2019s registered agent was served with process: <em>Ratliff v. Cooper Labs, </em>444 F.2d 745 (4th Cir.1971), <em>cert. den. </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>948, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>271, 30 L.Ed.2d 265 (1971), reh\u2019g den. 404 <em>U.S. </em>1006, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>561, 30 L.Ed.2d 559 (1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There the Circuit Court reasoned</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 only interest in South Carolina is in its relatively long statute of limitations (six years), and plaintiffs\u2019 only contact with South Carolina is the bringing of these lawsuits for the sole purpose of availing themselves of that statute\u2014the limitations period having run in all other states having any connection with the claims presented____ [444 <em>F.2d </em>at 746],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>That ease stands in the shadow of many succeeding Supreme Court cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether it remains good law is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">New Jersey chooses to exercise jurisdiction over nonresidents to the utmost limits allowed by the United States Constitution. <em>R. </em>4:4\u20144(c)(1); <em>Charles Gendler &amp; Co. v. Telecom Equipment Corp., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>460, 473, 508 A.2d 1127 (1986). Under the Constitution it is fundamental that every state possess exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">While due process merely requires that a nonresident defendant \u201creasonably anticipate\u201d being sued in the forum state, <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>286, 292, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>559, 567, 62 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>490, 498 (1980), presence of an individual defendant in the forum state accompanied by service, confers <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. <em>See Burnham v. Superior Court of California, County of Marin, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2105, 2109, 109 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>631, 638 (U.S. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">There Justice Scalia is quoted as saying for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1U\">Despite this formidable body of precedent, petitioner contends, in reliance on our decisions applying the <em>International Shoe </em>standard, that in the absence of \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 contacts with the forum, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>a nonresident defendant can be subjected to judgment only as to matters that arise out of or relate to his contacts with the forum. This argument rests on a thorough misunderstanding of our cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">Nothing in <em>International Shoe or </em>the cases that have followed it ... offers support for the very different proposition petitioner seeks to establish today: that a defendant\u2019s presence in the forum is not only unnecessary to validate novel, nontraditional assertions of jurisdiction, but is itself no longer sufficient to establish jurisdiction. That proposition is unfaithful to both elementary logic and the foundations of our due process jurisprudence. The distinction between what is needed to support novel procedures and what is needed to sustain traditional ones is fundamental, as we observed over a century ago----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The short of the matter is that jurisdiction based on physical presence alone constitutes due process because it is one of the continuing traditions of our legal system that define the due process standard of \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 That standard was developed by <em>analogy </em>to \u2018physical presence,\u2019 and it would be perverse to say it could now be turned against that touchstone of jurisdiction. [\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2113-2115 (emphasis in original)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Although this case concerns jurisdiction over an individual defendant, contrary to defendant\u2019s position, the principle applies to defendant corporation. In the footnote, upon which defendant relies to distinguish <em>Burnham, </em>Justice Scalia said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">It may be that whatever special rule exists permitting \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts, ... to support jurisdiction with respect to matters unrelated to activity in the forum, applies <em>only </em>to corporations, which have never fitted comfortably in a jurisdictional regime based primarily upon \u201cde facto power over the defendant\u2019s person.\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 <em>U.S. </em>310, 316 [66 <em>S.Ct. </em>154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95] (1945). [\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-n. 1, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2110 n. 1 (emphasis in original)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Justice Scalia was not there referring to circumstances limiting state jurisdiction, but to circumstances expanding state jurisdiction and possibly unique to corporations, which obviously have no personal presence anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Originally a corporation was held to have no \u201cpres\u00e9nce\u201d outside the state of its incorporation. <em>Bank of Augusta v. Earle, </em>38 <em>U.S. </em>(13 Pet.) 519, 10 <em>L.Ed. </em>274 (1839). There followed the doctrine that, because a state could prevent a foreign corporation from engaging in local business, it could permit a corporation to conduct local business on condition that the corporation consent to having a registered corporate \u201cpresence\u201d within the state. <em>Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, </em>59 <em>U.S. </em>(18 How.) 404, 15 <em>L.Ed. </em>451 (1855). Only where there was no service on a corporate registered agent has question been raised involving service upon unregistered agents as the corporate \u201cpresence\u201d in the state. <em>See Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>342 <em>U.S. </em>437, 440, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>413, 415, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952), cited in <em>Burnham, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-n. 1, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2110 n. 1. We are satisfied that the authority concerning \u201cminimum contact\u201d jurisdiction relied on by Purex to support its contention reflects what Justice Scalia referred to as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cmisunderstanding of our [Supreme Court] cases.\u201d \u2014 <em>US. </em>at -, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2113.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Having concluded that service on Purex\u2019s registered agent conferred personal jurisdiction over Purex, regardless of the nature of the litigation, we need not explore the extensive other contacts Purex had with New Jersey respecting the transaction underpinning plaintiff\u2019s cause. <em>See Lebel v. Everglades Marina, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>317, 322, 558 A.2d 1252 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-14\"> We recognize that defendant also sought a dismissal on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>That argument was expressly rejected as a basis for the judge\u2019s ruling and is not the basis of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> AIthough not relied on by plaintiff, a careful reading of Purex\u2019 certification shows that Purex never asserted that New Jersey <em>required </em>it to have a registered agent for that limited purpose, merely that it was \"convenient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:4-2 provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">(1) Every registered agent shall be an agent of the corporation which has appointed him, upon whom process against the corporation may be served.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\"> Purex also relied on <em>In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation, </em>525 <em>F.Supp. </em>1265, 1278, modified 541 <em>F.Supp. </em>62 (D.Md.1981), aff'd 704 <em>F.2d </em>125 (4th Cir.1983). The service there questioned, however, appears to have been made on the Secretary of State who was attorney in fact for every corporation registered to do business in the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\"><em> See Keeton v.
