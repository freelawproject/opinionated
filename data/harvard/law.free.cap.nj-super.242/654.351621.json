Tax </em>309 (1989), holding that because the subject property is used \u201cfor commercial purposes,\u201d it did not \u201cqualify for exemption\u201d from local property taxation pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.52. The Woman\u2019s Club claims that under the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.52 the property is tax exempt irrespective of its use. The respondent Town of Morristown (\u201cMorristown\u201d) asserts that the statutory exemption must be considered in light of the general constitutional requirement of uniformity of assessment and taxation, <em>see N.J.S.A. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1(a), that any exemption must be granted by the general laws, <em>N.J.S.A. Const. </em>Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 2, and that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.52 is unconstitutional because it grants an exemption based upon the status of the property owner, not the use of the property. The Attorney General, as intervenor, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:28-4(d), contends that, properly construed, the statute is constitutional. The Attorney General disagrees with the trial judge, however, to the extent his opinion would prohibit application of the exemption by virtue of any commercial use of the property, as opposed to its predominant use. In other words, the Attorney General agrees that the statute should be construed to save its constitutionality, but contends that the statute can be construed as constitutional if the property is used, to some degree, for a non-profit, non-commercial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">There is no substantial challenge to the Tax Court\u2019s finding of standing in this case, and the facts are undisputed. <em>See </em>10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 312-316. It is apparent that the Tax Court construed the statute as it did, in light of the maxim that \u201c[t]he Judiciary is obliged to interpret legislation so that it will be constitutional.\u201d 10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 320; <em>see also, e.g., N.J. Bd. of Higher Ed. v. Shelton College, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>470, 478, 448 A.2d 988 (1982). The Tax Court perceived that a different construction would run afoul of Art. VIII of the Constitution which provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ARTICLE VIII</p>\n<p id=\"AYB\">Taxation and Finance</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">Section 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">1. (a) Property shall be assessed for taxation under general laws and by uniform rules. All real property assessed and taxed locally or by the State for allotment and payment to taxing districts shall be assessed according to the same standard of value, except as otherwise permitted herein, and such real property shall be taxed at the general tax rate of the taxing district in which the property is situated, for the use of such taxing district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">2. Exemption from taxation may be granted only by general laws. Until otherwise provided by law all exemptions from taxation validly granted and now in existence shall be continued. Exemptions from taxation may be altered or repealed, except those exempting real and personal property used exclusively for religious, educational, charitable or cemetery purposes, as defined by law, and owned by any corporation or association organized and conducted exclusively for one or more of such proposes and not operating for profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The constitutional problem arises because of the perception that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.52 provides an exemption based on the status of the property owner and that its constitutionality can be saved only by limiting the use of the exempt property so that the exemption turns upon the nature or use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The nature of the issue is best understood in light of the governing constitutional principles of taxation as explained by Chief Justice Vanderbilt in <em>N.J. Turnpike Authority v. Washington Tp., </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>38, 44-45, 106 A.2d 4 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">... tax exemption statutes, if based on the personal status of the owner rather than on the use to which the property is put, run afoul of the tax article of the Constitution of 1947 which provides in part: \u201cProperty shall be assessed for taxation under general laws and by uniform rules,\u201d <em>Const. Art. VIII, </em>Sec. I, par. 1. The similar provision of the <em>Constitution of 1844, </em>Art. IV, Sec. VII, par. 12, that \u201cProperty shall be assessed for taxes under general laws, and by uniform rules, according to its true value,\u201d has been soundly construed to prohibit such exemptions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">\u201cThe decisions construing this constitutional provision, in so far as they have sanctioned classifications as the basis for legislation, either for taxation or for exemption, have done so upon the express ground that such classifications were based upon features that inhered in the property itself, or in the purposes to which it or its usufruct was devoted. To substitute for property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>in such classifications the persons who own property, and then to base the proposed exemption upon the <em>status </em>or vocation or avocation of such persons, is without any constitutional warrant. Exemptions from taxation, therefore, of property, real or personal, that are based not upon any characteristic possessed by such property, or upon the uses to which it is put, but upon the personal <em>status </em>of the owners of such property, are void.\u201d <em>Tippett v. McGrath, </em>70 <em>N.J.L. </em>110, 113 [56 <em>A. </em>134] (Sup.Ct.1903), affirmed 71 <em>N.J.L. </em>338 [59 <em>A. </em>1118] (E. &amp; A. 1904). [emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In light of the constitutional requirements, the Court in <em>N.J. Turnpike Authority </em>also made clear \u201c[w]e must decline to give a construction to the statute under consideration that would render it unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 106 <em>A.</em>2d 4. It is clear that the Tax Court endeavored to be faithful to this command.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">However, in construing a statute we must ordinarily first consider its plain language and give the statute its ordinary meaning in the absence of any specific indication of legislative intent to the contrary. <em>See Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 128, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987); <em>Mortimer v. Board of Review, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>393, 398, 493 A.2d 1 (1985). We cannot speculate on legislative intent \u201c[wjhere the wording of the statute is clear.\u201d <em>See Duke Power Co. v. Patten, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>42, 49, 118 A.2d 529 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Under the plain language of the statute there are only two requirements for exemption, (1) ownership by a non-profit corporation, and (2) certification of the property as an historical site by the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, as the successor to the former Commissioner of Conservation and Economic Development.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no expressed statutory requirement that this property be used, predominantly or otherwise, in furtherance of its historical purpose. In considering legislative intent, we note that the existence of other exemption statutes which embody use require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ments reveal that the legislature expressly adopted such requirements when it intended to do so. In light of these statutes, <em>see </em>and <em>compare, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.3, -3.5, -3.6, -3.10, -3.15, -3.24, -3.26, -3.27, most or all of which were enacted before <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.52, we believe that the Legislature would have provided for a use requirement or a provision with respect to the use of any income from commercial leasing of the premises, if it desired to do so. Accordingly, we agree with Woman\u2019s Club that the Tax Court added a requirement for exemption not embodied in the statute. Further, it is a well established maxim that while statutes are to be interpreted to save their constitutionality, the constitutional issue should not be addressed \u201cunless absolutely imperative in the disposition of the litigation.\u201d <em>Donadio v. Cunningham, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>309, 325-326, 277 A.2d 375 (1971); <em>see also Ahto v. Weaver, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>418, 428, 189 A.2d 27 (1963); <em>Grant v. Wright, </em>222 <em>N.J. Super. </em>191, 197-198, 536 A.2d 319 (App.Div.1988), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>562, 546 A.2d 493 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">In <em>Paper Mill Playhouse v. Millbum Tp., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>503, 472 A.2d 517 (1984), discussed by the trial judge in this ease, the exemption in question arose under a different statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.6, which required that the property be \u201cactually and exclusively used\u201d by a non-profit association or corporation for \u201cmoral and mental improvement\u201d in furtherance of the tax exempt purpose. The Supreme Court considered questions of statutory construction and application, and held that the theatre was entitled to the exemption despite the fact that it retained surplus and occasionally ran financially successful productions. <em>Id. </em>at 520-21, 472 A.2d 517. Unlike <em>Paper Mill Playhouse, </em>here the statute in question does not contain a requirement as to use, exclusive or otherwise, or a prohibition on use of part or all of the premises for profit. <em>See also The Kimberley School v. Town of Montclair, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>28, 65 A.2d 500 (1949), which also involves a construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.6, in which the Supreme Court indicated that the appropriate test for exemption involved consideration of the \u201cdominant motive in the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>of the school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 65 <em>A.</em>2d 500.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These cases, however, must all be understood in light of the issues raised, the statute involved and the totality of facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We do not believe that a construction of one statute must control the construction of another. We further conclude that the language of the statute involved here, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.52, by its plain language, and in the absence of a use restriction similar to ones embodied in the other real property exemption statutes, must be interpreted to embody only the requirements that the legislature expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The trial judge perceived, however, \u201cthat it was the intent of the Legislature to grant tax exemption to a certified site owned by a nonprofit corporation when the use of the property is in furtherance of the preservation of the historic site by making the site available for public purposes, not for commercial purposes.\u201d 10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 320-321. The judge reached this conclusion in order to avoid a declaration of unconstitutionality by virtue of the constitutional requirement of uniformity of assessment, because \u201c[t]he Legislature could not constitutionally exempt commercial properties from local property taxation solely because they are owned by nonprofit corporations.\u201d 10 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 320. The court stated \u201c[w]hen historic sites are used for commercial purposes, the fact that they are historic and are owned by nonprofit organizations is not sufficient to entitle them to exemption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Morristown thus contends that a literal reading of the statute without a use restriction would render it unconstitutional because non-profit organizations would enjoy tax exempt status regardless of the use to which the real property is put, while similarly situated profit-making organizations would not enjoy the exemption. It is this concern for uniformity which led the Tax Court to be troubled by the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-8.52. The argument emphasizes that the statute would be unconstitutional as a violation of the uniformity clause because the exemption would be based on the personal status of the owner, rather than on the use to which the property is put. As noted, while contending that the statute is constitutional, the Attorney General at oral argument agreed with the need for some statutory construction in order to preserve its constitutionality. He suggested that, as the exemption is not based on the personal status of the owner, but on the physical status of the property as a historic site, the Legislature intended to assure that a building certified as a historic site and granted exemption would be so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We agree with the premise of the trial judge, and with the Attorney General and the Town of Morristown, that tax exemption statutes based upon the personal status of the owner, as opposed to the use of the property, runs afoul of the New Jersey Constitution which provides that property shall be assessed for taxation under general laws and by uniform rules. <em>N.J. Turnpike Authority v. Washington Tp., supra, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>at 44-45, 106 A.2d 4. \u201c[T]he use to which the property is devoted is the essential consideration and [it is] not the character or status of the owner\u201d which controls the constitutionality of an exemption. <em>Teaneck Tp. v. Lutheran Bible Institute, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>86, 89-90, 118 A.2d 809 (1955). To be a general law, the tax exemption must be based on classifications which rest upon \u201csubstantial distinctions\u201d that have a \u201clogical and reasonable basis\u201d and include all property \u201cfalling within the named classification.\u201d <em>General Electric Co. v. Passaic, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>499, 508, 147 A.2d 233 (1958), app. dism. 359 <em>U.S. </em>1006, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>L.Ed.2d 987 (1959), quoting <em>Schwartz v.

Bardin, </em>147 <em>N.J. Super. </em>557, 371 A.2d 776 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 74 <em>N.J. </em>281, 377 A.2d 685 (1977), the Legislature has differentiated \u201cbetween organizations such as those involved in this case and profit-oriented and other organizations which do not qualify\u201d for exemption. 147 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 564, 371 A.2d 776. <em>Bardin </em>dealt with a \u201cGreen Acre\u201d property tax exemption under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.63 to 3.71. The plaintiff township claimed that the exemption was unconstitutional, in part, because it applied only to \u201cnonprofit corporations or organizations organized under the laws of this or any State____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 371 A.2d 776. We rejected the contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">This contention has no merit. To be general, a tax exemption statute must draw classifications which rest upon \u201csubstantial distinctions\u201d that have a \u201clogical and reasonable basis,\u201d and include all property falling within the named classification. <em>General Electric Co. v. Passaic, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>499, 508 [147 A.2d 233] (1958), app. dism. 359 <em>U.S. </em>1006, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 3 L.Ed.2d 987 (1959); <em>Schwartz v. Essex Cty.

A legislative enactment is a special law \"if the law does not \u2018affect equally all of a group who, bearing in mind the purposes of the legislation, are distinguished by characteristics sufficiently marked and important to make them a class by themselves\u2019 * * *. Legislation can be unconstitutionally special even where it affects groups [of subjects] if its classification of them has no rational relationship to its object.\u201d <em>Meadowlands Regional Redevelop.

Such an objective clearly fulfills the \u201clogical and reasonable basis\u201d aspect of the <em>General Electric </em>standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">There is a \u201csubstantial distinction\u201d between organizations and corporations which are required by their state charters, and hence by state law, to operate in a nonprofit manner and which are authorized by their charters to engage in and do engage in the conservation activities contemplated by the act, and those individuals, organizations and corporations who are not so limited and authorized or who do not so use their lands. In classifying the property eligible for the exemption, the legislative purpose was to differentiate between organizations such as those involved in this case and profit-oriented and other organizations which do not qualify under the federal statute. We are satisfied that this legislative classification does not reflect an arbitrary or insubstantial differentiation. [147 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 563-64, 371 A.2d 776],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Our Supreme Court recently had occasion to exhaustively analyze the history, meaning and interplay of the uniformity, <em>N.J.S.A. Const. </em>(1947) Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1(a), and exemption, Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1, clauses of the constitution. In <em>N.J. St. League of Municipalities v. Kimmelman, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>422, 522 A.2d 430 (1987), with respect to the taxation of real property, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">Given that the constitutional focus of the delegates on the taxation of real estate was upon a judicial decision that had sustained the power of the Legislature, prior to the 1947 Constitutional Convention, to allow for the preferential taxation of real estate based on the classification of the industry ... and given that the single galvanizing event that brought about agreement on a tax article was a compromise that gave greater flexibility to the executive and legislative branches in taxing all types of property other than real estate, with the apparent purpose of providing that real property dedicated to municipal tax purposes should never be taxed at an unequal burden, we cannot conclude that the delegates intended that the Legislature could achieve, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>exemption clause, what could not be done under the constitutional restraints imposed upon it. [Id. at 436, 522 A.2d 430].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQS\">While finding <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-23a, an endeavor to encourage the construction of new housing, to be in violation of the uniformity clause, and despite the exemption clause,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court noted that the drafters of the Constitution were primarily concerned with the preferential taxation of real estate based on the classification of industry and thus with preferential taxation resulting in commercial advantage to one group, as opposed to another. <em>See League of Municipalities, supra, 105 N.J. </em>at 436, 522 <em>A.</em>2d 430. On the other hand, the Court recognized that some classifications advance a purpose \u201cgenerally beneficial to society as a whole unrelated to a particular industry or the status of the taxpayer,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 522 <em>A.</em>2d 430. While we appreciate Justice Clifford\u2019s concurring view in <em>League of Municipalities, </em>we must also recognize his statement (that \u201cthe opinion can be read to say that the exemption clause can never defeat the uniformity requirement for taxation of real property. That is my view of the correct holding\u201d) embodies the opinion of only one member of the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 522 <em>A.</em>2d 430. Hence, in the words of Justice Clifford, we must wrestle with whether the Court allowed for the possibility that a \u201c \u2018public purpose\u2019 classification for partial exemption from real property taxation can be achieved without a constitutional amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">In light of the opinion of the Court in <em>League of Municipalities, </em>we believe that a statute providing an exemption, even from real property taxation, can be adopted when it \u201cplainly appear[s] to advance purposes generally beneficial to society as a whole unrelated to a particular industry or the status of the taxpayer.\u201d 105 <em>N.J. </em>at 438, 522 <em>A.</em>2d 430. As the majority noted, \u201c[rjecognition of such exemptions would appear to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>much more in accord with the history and tradition that surround this power of exemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 522 <em>A.</em>2d 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We are not here concerned with a statute giving preferential treatment to a particular industry which the Constitution endeavored to avoid. Nor do we deal with a claim of special legislation. Rather, this case deals with a statutory exemption which makes a \u201csubstantial distinction\u201d that has a \u201clogical and reasonable basis\u201d, premised on the public purpose and works of a non-profit corporation, <em>General Electric Co. v.

In deciding the question presented, we are satisfied that, even though <em>League of Municipalities </em>declared a statute unconstitutional, it supports a holding that the statute before us is constitutional as written by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\"> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:lD-2 transferring the functions, duties and powers of the Commissioner of the Department of Conservation and Economic Development to the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> It is apparently on this basis that the Attorney General, at oral argument, asserted his construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\"><em> County of Essex v.
