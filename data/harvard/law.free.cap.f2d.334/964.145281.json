It found him guilty on four counts of robbery, five counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, and nine counts of housebreaking. The court committed appellant to St. Elizabeths Hospital on the verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity and imposed sentences on the guilty verdicts to begin from date of imposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are urged to reverse the guilty verdicts chiefly on the ground tha,t the trial court erred in admitting several damaging oral and written statements which the police elicited from appellant in violation of Rule 5(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., and of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-26\">These statements were obtained in the following circumstances. After Mrs. M., a rape victim, had identified appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>photograph, Detective Wallace arrested appellant, without a warrant, at his home at approximately 3:50 p. m. on a Sunday, and took him immediately to the Ninth Precinct Police Station where he was charged on the arrest book with rape and housebreaking. Appellant denied the charges. At 4:20 or 4:25, Mrs. M. positively identified him in a line-up as her assailant, and Detective Wallace, the arresting officer, was \u201cperfectly satisfied\u201d with her identification. But appellant continued to deny the charges. Sex Squad Detectives Wolfgang and Kline arrived at the precinct station at about 4:30 and were informed of Mrs. M.\u2019s positive identification. Within five or ten minutes Detective Wolfgang began interrogating Ricks, and Detective Kline began efforts to reach an Assistant United States Attorney by telephone for advice as to a \u201cnight arraignment.\u201d Kline reached an Assistant at 5:10 p. m., and upon being told that \u201cit would be perfectly all right to hold the man over until Monday morning,\u201d Kline made no effort to locate a committing magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">At 5:30 Detective Wolfgang brought Mrs. M. into Ricks\u2019 presence, where she related her version of the alleged crime. During this confrontation, which lasted until 6:00 p. m., Ricks did not depart from his claim of innocence. But after Mrs. M. stepped out of the room, Ricks admitted raping her, and he apologized to her when she returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">At 6:05 p. m. Ricks was placed in a second line-up before a Miss S., who had been raped over seven months earlier, and before a son-in-law of Mrs. L., a victim of a more recent assault with a razor blade. Neither identified Ricks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">As Ricks left this line-up, Wallace told him that his fingerprints were found on the razor blade, and said, \u201cCalvin, you might as well tell the truth.\u201d Ricks said nothing, but a few moments later he passed Mrs. L.\u2019s son-in-law in the corridor and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the man that chased me out of the house when the woman on the second floor screamed.\u201d At 7:00 p. m. Ricks was placed in a third line-up before a Miss A., who was unable to identify him as her attacker seven months previously. When the police ended their questioning of Ricks at 7:00 p. m. on Sunday, he had denied attacking Misses A., S. and C., and admitted attacking Mrs. M. and Mrs. L.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Ricks, who had no counsel, was taken before a Commissioner the next day (Monday) at 10:20 a. m. The Commissioner stated the charges and advised Ricks of his right not to make any statement and his right to retain counsel and to have a preliminary hearing. The Commissioner stated that Ricks could choose either (1) to have a hearing, (2) to waive the hearing, or (3) to postpone the hearing \u201cfor the purpose of contacting counsel or contacting any member of his family relative to securing counsel for him.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Ricks chose the latter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>the hearing was continued for three days and he was held without bond. Immediately after Ricks\u2019 appearance before the Commissioner, Detective Wolfgang obtained Ricks\u2019 permission for an interview in the Commissioner\u2019s cellblock. Ricks agreed to Wolfgang\u2019s suggestion that Mrs. M. join them, but when Mrs. M. entered, Ricks asked her to leave. Then in the presence of only Detective Wolfgang, Ricks admitted several crimes, including those charged here, orally and by writing on cards and signing his name opposite various items on a list of open crimes. He stated that he wanted to apologize to his victims. Wolfgang left about 11:55 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">At 2:23 that afternoon Ricks was taken before a judge of the United States District Court for a hearing on the United States Attorney\u2019s request to release Ricks to the police \u201cto assist in the solution of various * * * crimes.\u201d Ricks agreed to go with the police, although the judge told him that he did not have to and that anything which transpired could be used against him. The judge did not tell Ricks that he had a right to counsel, nor did he offer to appoint counsel. Ricks was released to the police for four hours during which he repeated his earlier admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">At trial all of Ricks\u2019 statements were admitted into evidence over his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">In Mallory v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Supreme Court provided a clear interpretation of Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-15\">\u201cThe scheme for initiating a federal prosecution is plainly defined. The police may not arrest upon mere suspicion but only on \u2018probable cause.\u2019 The next step in the proceeding is to arraign the arrested person before a judicial officer as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>quickly as possible so that he may be advised of his rights and so that the issue of probable cause may be promptly determined. The arrested person may, of course be \u2018booked\u2019 by the police. But he is not to be taken to police headquarters in order to carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself, even if not so designed, to eliciting damaging statements to support the arrest and ultimately his guilt.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\"> We think <em>Mallory </em>requires exclusion of the statements which the police elicited from Ricks on the day of his arrest. Mrs. M. positively identified Ricks to the satisfaction of the arresting officer about thirty minutes after the arrest. At least at that point, if not earlier,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the police were required to take Ricks before a committing magistrate unless further delay was occasioned by some proper purpose, such as the checking of a volunteered alibi or explanation \u201csusceptible of quick verification.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is said that such verification is required for the accused\u2019s protection against wrongful charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But Ricks did not volunteer an alibi or explanation. Instead he maintained his innocence throughout the approximately two hours of detention after his arrest. The police activity during that period hardly reflects \u201cthe ordinary administrative steps required to bring a suspect before the nearest available magistrate.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the questioning which preceded Ricks\u2019 statements precludes any claim that they constituted \u201cspontaneous threshold confessions.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\"> Nor can the delay of a preliminary hearing be justified on the ground that police activity for that period was required to investigate other unsolved crimes for which there was no probable cause to arrest the accused.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The ban against delay was not lifted each time the accused was confronted with another charge. Apparently the police were aware of this, for shortly after Mrs. M.\u2019s positive line-up identification of Ricks, they tried to reach an Assistant United States Attorney about a \u201cnight arraignment.\u201d It is clear, however, that neither the Assistant\u2019s advice nor the posited inaccessibility of a committing magistrate licensed the police to continue \u201cto carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself, even if not so designed, to eliciting damaging statements to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>port the arrest and ultimately his guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Appellant maintains that his statements on Monday after his appearance before the Commissioner must also be excluded because they were the \u201cfruit\u201d of his earlier illegally obtained admissions. See Killough v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241 (1962). We do not reach that question, however, because these statements must be excluded on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">\u201cThe complicated process of criminal justice is * * * divided into different parts, responsibility for which is separately vested in the various participants upon whom the criminal law relies for its vindication.\u201d McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 343, 63 S.Ct. 608, 614, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943). This division underlies the scheme of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Detection and apprehension are police functions. But \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d after arrest the police must relinquish custody and control of the accused to the committing magistrate, a judicial officer. His function is to advise the accused of his rights under Rule 5 and-to conduct a hearing as soon as possible-to determine whether there is sufficient probable cause to warrant further detention of the accused. Pending that determination, and in the absence of bail, the accused is transferred to jail where he is in the custody of the warden<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> subject to judicial, and not police, control.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The purpose of the transfer is \u201cto avoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation\u201d by the police. See McNabb v. United States, supra, 318 U.S. at 344, 63 S.Ct. at 614. Those implications would not be avoided if the police were free to continue interrogation after the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-14\">Here Ricks was committed to jail pending the determination of probable cause, and the hearing thereon was continued solely for the purpose of granting him an opportunity to obtain counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But the police nipped this opportunity in the bud by virtually following upon Ricks\u2019 heels, from the Commissioner\u2019s hearing room into the cellblock, to continue their interrogation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And later the same day, an Assistant United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Attorney moved in the District Court for Ricks\u2019 release to the police for four hours.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Despite the fact that Ricks had not yet obtained counsel<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the District Court released him to the custody of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">If Ricks had had counsel, the police would not have interrogated him in private and at length in the Commissioner\u2019s cellblock.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nor could they have taken him uncounselled into the District Court for the hearing which culminated in his delivery to the police and further interrogation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The mere fact that Ricks had not yet obtained counsel did not allow police to \u201ccontinue to hound [him] * * * to give evidence against [himself] * * * until there is no escape at the trial * * <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Ricks\u2019 right to counsel did not depend on a race with the police. The police activities here violated the general scheme of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the specific order of the Commissioner implementing Ricks\u2019 right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">The Supreme Court has recently ruled that a confession obtained by a police agent from an uncounselled defendant on bail after indictment could not be used against him at trial. Massiah v. United States, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 1204 (1964). The Court recognized as a \u201cconstitutional rule\u201d the New York doctrine that \u201cAny secret interrogation of the defendant, from and after the finding of the indictment, without the protection afforded by the presence of counsel, contravenes the basic dictates of fairness in the conduct of criminal causes and the fundamental rights of persons charged with crime.\u201d People v. Waterman, 9 N.Y.2d 561, 565, 216 N.Y.S.2d 70, 175 N.E.2d 445, 448 (1961). Mr. Justice White, in dissent, recognized that the Court\u2019s holding \u201cwould seem equally pertinent to statements obtained at any time after the right of counsel attaches, whether there has been an indictment or not * * ''.\u201d And the New York Court of Appeals in People v. Meyer, 11 N.Y.2d 162, 227 N.Y.S.2d 427, 182 N.E. 103 (1962), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>People v. Rodriguez, 11 N.Y.2d 279, 229 N.Y.S.2d 353, 183 N.E.2d 651 (1962), has barred confessions obtained in the absence of counsel both after probable cause had been found and during continuance in the probable cause hearing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">We need not decide whether the logic of <em>Massiah </em>requires all Federal courts to exclude such pre-indictment confessions since we may, and do, reach our conclusion here in the exercise of our local supervisory power.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">. The court imposed sentences of five to fifteen years on each of four of the housebreaking verdicts, to run consecutively, and sentences on all the other guilty verdicts, to run concurrently with the sentences for housebreaking. Appellant has not raised, and we therefore do not consider, the question whether the verdicts of guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity on counts arising out of a single occurrence are inconsistent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">. The Commissioner did not offer to appoint counsel for Ricks if he was indigent. He was apparently prepared to hold the hearing without counsel if Ricks chose this alternative; he would also have allowed Ricks to waive hearing without a lawyer\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Twenty-two years ago, in holding that the privilege against self-incrimination applied at preliminary hearings, we said that the hearing was a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d and not a \u201cprosecutor\u2019s inquisition,\u201d that its purpose is \u201cto decide between the informer or prosecutor and the accused on the preliminary question of his temporary restraint. * * * In subject matter and function, the hearing is judicial. It should be so in essential procedure.\u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-11\">\u201cFor the same reasons the accused is entitled to have counsel at the hearing. If authority for this is needed, it is supplied by the decisions which sustain the right when the accused demands such aid at this stage. [Citing eases.] * * * As with the right of counsel, waiver of the privilege must be informed and intelligent. There can be no waiver if the defendants do not know their rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">Wood v. United States, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 279-280, 286, 128 F.2d 265, 270-271, 277, 141 A.L.R. 1318 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">In 1946, however, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure stated in a note to Rule 44, that the Rule\u2019s requirement for the assignment of counsel at every stage of the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>ings \u201cdoes not include preliminary proceedings before a committing magistrate.\u201d And in 1949 this court, relying upon this note, observed in a habeas corpus proceeding that \u201c[t]here is no constitutional ' requirement that the accused be represented by counsel on arraignment where he pleads not guilty * * * [or] at the preliminary hearing where he pleads not guilty.\u201d Council v. Clemmer, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 177 F.2d 22, cert. denied, 338 U.S. 880, 70 S.Ct. 150, 94 L.Ed. 540 (1949). Quoting a Ninth Circuit case which had asserted that \u201cthe preliminary hearing is an ex parte proceeding,\u201d the <em>Council </em>opinion concluded that no prejudice could occur if a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea was entered. But <em>Wood </em>had pointed out that the temporary loss of liberty authorized by the magistrate\u2019s \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d was itself prejudicial. And the inconsistencies with <em>Wood </em>were unnecessary to <em>Council\u2019s </em>holding that a conviction is not subject to collateral attack merely because counsel was absent during pretrial proceedings, unless that absence prejudiced the accused at trial. Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), and White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963), east doubt on the <em>Council </em>dicta that a lawyer is necessary only if a defendant pleads guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">If the advisory note to Buie 44, taken with Buie 5(b), is construed to establish a right only \u201cto <em>retain </em>counsel\u201d for the preliminary bearing, then the question arises whether there is an \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d between defendants who can afford to retain counsel and those who cannot. See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956); Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963); Hardy v.

Presumably, legal ethics forbid a United States Attorney or a Government agent to bypass the lawyer of a defendant fortunate enough to have the means to engage counsel. This is a proper ethic for lawyers. But here the effect is to allow the prosecution to take advantage of an indigent prisoner without counsel, imperilling his constitutional rights by subjecting him to questioning intended to convict him, while recognizing an accused\u2019s freedom from secret inquisition if he can afford counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">.

The Rule clearly contemplates the presence of counsel for all parties at the deposition. In fact, Rule 15(c) requires that \u201cif a defendant is without counsel the court shall advise him of his right and assign counsel to represent him unless the defendant elects to proceed without counsel or is able to obtain counsel.\u201d Thus there can be no doubt that when the court orders in effect that a defendant\u2019s own \u201cdeposition\u201d be taken purportedly at his own request (see note 15, <em>supra,), </em>his counsel must be notified and given the opportunity to attend, and if he has no counsel, he must be told of his right to appointed counsel for the purpose of the \u201cdeposition.\u201d See also note 18, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">.

M. \u2019s home at 723 Massachusetts Avenue, N. E., threatened her with a knife, took money from her and raped her. Appellant was arrested at 3:50 or 3:55 P.M. on June 24, 1962, after his photograph had been identified by the victim from a group of photographs. He arrived at the police station at about 4:02 P.M. L. M. was called to the police station for the purpose of observing a line-up. She identified appellant from among the members constituting the line-up at approximately 4:25 P.M. The Sex Squad, which had jurisdiction over all such cases, was notified of Ricks\u2019 arrest. Two officers of that squad who had been investigating a number of similarly executed rapes in the same general neighborhood<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were advised of the arrest, and arrived at the police station around 4:30 P.M. After consulting with the arresting officer, about \u201cfive or ten minutes after arrival,\u201d they talked to Ricks. After identifying themselves, they informed him of his right to remain silent and warned him that, if he said anything, it might be used against him in a future trial. Detective Wolfgang testified that he then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-18\">\u201ctold him that he had been identified by [L.M.] that she was emphatic in her identification of him; the time and the date that this had happened, etc.; and where he was at that particular time and dates if he could tell me; if there was anybody \u2014 if he had any people that could verify his whereabouts at the time, would be glad to talk to these people; and things of that nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Detective Wolfgang also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-5\">\u201cI didn\u2019t have reason to doubt it [L.M.\u2019s identification of Ricks], but by the same token, I didn\u2019t in my own mind feel that that was \u2014 that identification alone was conclusive enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">(L.M. later testified that since the attack had occurred in her unlighted room, she had been able to view her assailant only by the light from a flashlight turned on and off intermittently by him, and by the illumination from a near-by streetlight.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">About 5:30 P.M. L.M. recounted, in Ricks\u2019 presence, the details of the attack upon her. Immediately upon her leaving the conference room, about 5:55 or 6:00 P.M., Ricks confessed to the commission of the rape. Thus, this confession was made approximately two hours after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">On June 1, 1962, just three weeks before the crimes against L.M., premises 704 East Capitol Street were entered in the same manner as were the premises of L.M. S.L., sleeping on a couch, was awakened when a blanket was placed over her face. When she started to scream, her throat was slashed several times with a safety razor blade, part of which remained embedded in her neck. Upon hearing her screams, S.L.\u2019s son-in-law went to her rescue and chased the attacker from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Ricks was placed in a line-up at 6:05 P.M. on Sunday, June 25, 1962, at which time S.L. was unable to identify him as her assailant. After the line-up had been completed at 6:10 P.M., however, appellant was told by the police that his fingerprints had been found on the razor blade used in the attack upon S.L. Passing the son-in-law of S.L. on his way back to the detectives\u2019 office, Ricks stopped and told him: \u201cYou\u2019re the man that chased me out of the house when the woman on the second floor screamed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">With regard to the statements made prior to the appearance of appellant before the United States Commissioner, it is to be noted that his confession concerning L.M. was made within two hours after he had been apprehended, and the statement to S.L.\u2019s son-in-law was made within two and a half hours after his arrest. No other statements were made prior to his appearance before the United States Commissioner, nor were any offered in evidence, so that we have only to consider, on this phase of the case, the confession of the crimes against L.M. and the statement relating to the S.L. case.)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">My colleagues apparently find little dif-ficutly in determining that the statements of Ricks above referred to were \u2018inadmissible. I, however, feel that unless we ignore the word \u201cunnecessary\u201d in Fed.R.Crim.P. 5(a), there is absolutely no warrant for excluding Ricks\u2019 statements. Certainly the fact that he was not presented to the United States Commissioner until 10:00 o\u2019clock of the morning after his arrest would not make inadmissible the statements made within two hours after arrest. See United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">I think the majority in this case has extended the <em>Mallory </em>doctrine far beyond the import of that decision. Contrary to the situation in <em>Mallory, </em>where the accused was questioned continuously by four detectives, there was no such questioning in the instant ease. The import of <em>Mallory </em>and such cases as Heideman v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 128, 259 F.2d 943 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 959, 79 S.Ct. 800, 3 L.Ed.2d 767 (1959), is that it is the duty of the arresting officers to see that a prisoner is arraigned without unnecessary delay, but this does not indicate that \u201cthe command calls for mechanical or automatic obedience.\u201d The admissibility of confessions received during a period of delay cannot be measured by a time clock. See Muschette v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 322 F.2d 989 (1963). The facts and circumstances must be considered. Although the <em>Mallory </em>doctrine is clear and definite, the opinion of the Supreme Court in that case leaves one essential aspect without any definition. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>meaning of the vital term \u201cunnecessary-delay\u201d is left open, presumably for delineation by future decisions. The opinion makes it clear, however, that the term is flexible and that the extent of a permissible delay depends on circumstances. Thus, it contains the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aog8\">\u201cThe duty enjoined upon arresting officers to arraign \u2018without unnecessary delay\u2019 indicates that the command does not call for mechanical or automatic obedience. Circumstances may justify a brief delay between arrest and arraignment, as for instance, where the story volunteered by the accused is susceptible of quick verification through third parties. But the delay must not be of a nature to give opportunity for the extraction of a confession.\u201d Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. at 455, 77 S.Ct. at 1359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Similarly, in the Notes of the Advisory Committee to Rule 5(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, it is observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arj-dedup-0\">\u201cWhat constitutes \u2018unnecessary delay\u2019, i. e., reasonable time within which the prisoner should be brought before a committing magistrate, must be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances of the case. The * * * authorities discuss the question what constitutes reasonable time for this purpose in various situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">In this case, the main time between appellant\u2019s arrest and his statements was spent in booking, processing, calling witnesses to the crimes, and giving appellant an opportunity to explain where he was if he was not at the scene of the crimes. The mere appearance of a man before the United States Commissioner and the holding of him for action by the Grand Jury is a stigma which cannot be easily erased, and the police are not anxious to arrest an innocent person. Appellant was living with his wife; he was a man of superior intelligence; he was employed at an adequate salary; and he should have been able to exculpate himself, if that were possible. In <em>Heide-man </em>we used language particularly applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">\u201cAt the outset, the police, assuming they have probable cause for arrest, are entitled to ask the arrested suspect what he knows about a crime. If he denies knowledge, they are entitled to state to him what evidence they have and ask whether he cares to comment upon it. A strong circumstantial case which would satisfy the U. S. Commissioner, prima facie, might well be explained away by a suspect who knew what information the police relied on \u2014 hence leading to no charge being made. If the suspect continues to deny knowledge, the police are entitled to conclude the interview by saying, in effect, \u2018Do you have anything further to tell us, or do you just want to let it stand the way it is?\u2019 which was what [the detective] asked appellant. Such questions as these the police may ask \u2014 indeed <em>should </em>ask; it is only when the questioning crosses into what can be termed \u2018grilling,\u2019 or is continued beyond the brief period allowed, that the resulting confession may be held inadmissible.\u201d 104 U.S.App.D.C. at 130-131, 259 F.2d at 945-946.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Cf. Trilling v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 159, 260 F.2d 677 (1958); Metoyer v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 250 F.2d 30 (1957). And see Muschette v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Also in <em>Heideman, </em>we distinguished <em>Metoyer </em>from <em>Mallory </em>and called attention to the fact that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-11\">\u201cIn the Mallory case, contrariwise, an afternoon and entire night separated arrest from arraignment, and the time was intermittently used for extensive interrogation of the accused, including use of a lie detector test and simultaneous questioning by a number of officers. In the pre-arraignment interval there, more occurred than the mere handling of administrative details and the corroborating of the accused\u2019s identifl-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>cation.\u201d 104 U.S.App.D.C. at 130, note 2, 259 F.2d at 945, note 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">In making his ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial judge in the instant case succinctly stated the point as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-6\">\u201cShe was sleeping in the room when this thing started and I am sure she wasn\u2019t sleeping in full light.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-7\">\u201cEven if she had been, which I am sure she wasn\u2019t and I am sure when she gets on the stand, she will so testify, these fleeting identifications when a person is absolutely terrorized \u2014 it is one thing, perhaps, when you are standing around Sears Roebuck store, looking at somebody, not scared to death, and when somebody has a knife on you, raping you and threatening you.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-8\">\u201cI would hate \u2014 I would hate to ever have to sentence someone to death for rape on an identification like that, I would not like it in any case, but I would be very disquieted if that were the only evidence brought in before a jury and the jury found him guilty and recommended the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything that would upset me more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-10\">\u201cI feel that the admission, and I take it that actually the statement made at 6:05 was an admission rather than a confession\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-11\"># #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-12\">\u201cdoes not violate the Mallory Rule or Rule 5(a); that the admission to [S. L.\u2019s son-in-law], which he apparently volunteered as he went up the steps, does not violate Rule 5(a); so when we come to the confessions on the morning of the 25th, we do not have any poisonous tree to have fruit thereof.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">With this I wholeheartedly agree. My opinion is that this court has too often extended <em>Mallory </em>far beyond its import. My colleagues make much of the fact that one witness stated that L.M.\u2019s identification was sufficient to go to arraignment. However, the officer in charge, Detective Wolfgang, testified to the contrary. The trial judge, hearing the motion to suppress, had this to say: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-19\">\u201cOfficer Kline said that the identification was ample for him to go to arraignment. I was much more impressed with Officer Wolfgang, Detective Wolfgang, who said in his opinion, he didn\u2019t want to go to arraignment or take a man before the Commissioner on a crime of this sort simply on this type of identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-20\">\u201cI have a great deal more respect for Detective Wolfgang\u2019s feeling in the matter because the cases that give me the most trouble, as I sit here as a Judge, are those cases where the only evidence of the crime or the primary evidence of a crime is a fleeting glimpse of someone by a witness while a crime is being committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-21\">We must remember that the trial judge has more opportunity to see the witnesses and to determine the matter than do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-22\">I think the statements made prior to appearance before the United States Commissioner were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-23\">It is my feeling that the thinking of some members of this court is to prevent the offering in evidence of <em>any </em>statements voluntarily made by an accused after being placed under arrest. I cannot believe the Supreme Court had any such thought in mind. (See quotation from <em>Mallory, </em>supra.) This circuit has in some cases read into the <em>Mallory </em>decision a meaning widely divergent from that ascribed to it by other circuits. See, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Ladson, 294 F.2d 535 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 824, 82 S.Ct. 840, 7 L.Ed.2d 789 (1961); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>United States v.

United States, 280 F.2d 273 (8th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 838, 81 S.Ct. 750, 5 L.Ed.2d 747 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">\n<em>Confessions after Original Appearance before the United. States Commissioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">I turn now to a consideration of the admissibility of the statements made by appellant after his first appearance before the United States Commissioner, on June 25, 1962, and after his appearance before District Judge McGarraghy later the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">The uncontroverted record shows the following: At 9:55 A.M. on June 25, 1962 (the day after appellant\u2019s arrest), complaint for violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2801 was filed against Ricks charging the rape of L.M., and that at 10:20 A.M. he was brought before the United States Commissioner. According to the Commissioner\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, Ricks was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-8\">\u201cadvised that he was there as a result of the complaint charging him with violation of Title 22 of the D. C.Code, Section 2801, specifically, that on June 22, 1962, at premises 723 Massachusetts Avenue, Northeast, in the District of Columbia, that he did have carnal knowledge of or rape [L.M.] forcibly and against her will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-9\">\u201cHaving been apprised of this complaint, I then advised the defendant that in regard to this complaint he was not required to make any statement; that any statement he made could be used against him at this or any other hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-10\">\u201cI further advised the defendant he had a right to retain the services of an attorney, and that he was entitled to a preliminary hearing in this matter, and at such hearing he would have a right or his counsel would have a right to cross-examine any witnesses against him and introduce testimony in his own behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-12\">\u201cI then told the defendant that the preliminary hearing was not the trial, and that he had a choice at that hearing of having a hearing then and there, or that he might waive the hearing, and I explained to him what a waiver meant; that the matter would then be sent directly to the Grand Jury without the benefit of a hearing, and if he was indicted he would be called upon to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty, and if the matter was ignored he would be freed from custody in the matter; and that finally he had a third choice of requesting a continuance of the matter for the purpose of contacting counsel or contacting any member of his family relative to securing counsel for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-13\">\u201cAt that time the defendant chose to request a continuance for the purpose of contacting his family regarding the retention of counsel in his behalf. The case at his request was continued for a short period to the date of June the 28th.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">By \u201cOrder of Temporary Commitment,\u201d Ricks was then committed to the custody of the United States Marshal and taken to the cell block behind the Commissioner\u2019s office pending transfer to the District of Columbia jail. Thereupon, Detective Wolfgang of the Sex Squad and Detective Wallace of the Ninth Precinct went to the cell block and requested to see the prisoner. The Deputy United States Marshal in charge stated that Ricks would have to consent to see them. While the officers waited, the Deputy went to Ricks\u2019 cell and was given the necessary permission by Ricks. The Deputy informed the officers of Ricks\u2019 consent and asked them to wait until the interviewing room was available, as it was in use at the time. The room was vacated a few minutes later and the officers met with Ricks. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>advised him that \u201che didn\u2019t have to say anything or he didn\u2019t have to talk to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">The officers informed Ricks that they had brought L.M. to the courthouse, but that he did not have to see her if he did not want to. Ricks, however, said that he did want the opportunity to apologize to her again. L.M. entered the room and was about to be seated when Ricks asked that she step outside the room, that he wanted to talk to the officers alone. As soon as she had left the room, Ricks stated that \u201che wanted to get himself straight, that he wanted to straighten everything out,\u201d and requested a piece of paper and a pencil, which were provided. He then indicated in writing seven various locations where he had broken into houses, further indicating that he had sexually attacked a woman in four of the instances, all of which assaults were under investigation by the police department. Wolfgang then showed him a copy of a police memorandum which enumerated and summarized various unsolved sexual attacks which were under investigation. By signing his name beneath the particular summary, Ricks indicated those crimes which had been of his doing. He then told the officers that he wanted to see the victims, to be able to \"talk to them\u201d and \u201capologize to them.\u201d When he was told that he probably would be taken to the jail, Ricks asked if he could talk to them there. The officers were not sure that they could bring the victims to the jail, but indicated that they would attempt to locate somebody in the United States Attorney\u2019s office who could advise them. At 11:55 A.M. the officers left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The record next indicates that at 2:23 P.M. on the same day, appellant appeared with an Assistant United States Attorney before Judge McGarraghy of the United States District Court. Motion was made that Ricks be released to the custody of a Deputy United States Marshal and two named members of the Metropolitan Police Department to assist in the solution of certain unsolved crimes, the motion being made \u201cupon the express desire of Calvin Lee Ricks to assist the Police Department.\u201d The following then transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-7\">\u201cThe Court : Are you Calvin Lee Ricks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-9\">\u201cThe Court: You had a hearing before the United States Commissioner this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir. &gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-11\">\u201cThe Court : And he advised you of your rights, I suppose, and told you that you are not required to make any statement of any kind regarding these charges against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-13\">\u201cThe Court: You understand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-14\">that, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-16\">\u201cThe Court: And I am advising you again to the same effect, that you are not required to make any statement and that any statement that you may make may be used against you.

Wallace and Detective Sergeant John Klein will return the prisoner, Calvin Lee Ricks, into the custody of the Superintendent of the District of Columbia Jail not later than 6:30 p. m. June 25,1962.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-11\">\u201cDo you understand that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-12\">\u201cThe Dependant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-13\">\u201cThe Court: And do you want me to sign this order ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-15\">\u201cThe Court: Very well. I will sign it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">Ricks then accompanied the deputy marshal and the detectives to the Sex Squad office of Police Headquarters, where M.S., D.C. and K.A. were present. At 2:45 P.M. Ricks spoke first with M.S., who repeated to Ricks what had happened to her on the night that she was assaulted; Ricks apologized, and also explained how he had made a hole in the screen door with a small butcher knife in order to gain entry. At 2:51 P.M., D.C. related her recollection of what had tran-spix*ed on the night she was assaulted; Ricks acknowledged the crime and asked her forgiveness. At 2:56 P.M., K.A. stated to Ricks what had happened on the night of her alleged assault; Ricks himself then recounted certain additional facts relating to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">When the officex's subsequently talked with Ricks about the knife used in the attack on L.M., the crime for which he had been ax'rested, he pointed out that the police did not have the knife but that it was in the kitchen drawer at his home, and said that if they would take him there, he would get it for them. The officers, still in the company of the deputy marshal, took Ricks to his home, where he gave the detectives the knife which he said he had used in the assault on L.M. Ricks was then returned to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-18\">On June 28, 1962, Ricks again appeared before the United States Commissioner. Upon his statement that he could not afford to retain couxxsel, the Commissioner offered to have a member of the Legal Aid Agency represent him. Ricks accepted this offer and counsel was provided promptly. Following a conference between Ricks and his counsel, a hearing was requested and held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-19\">On the basis of this factual background, my colleagues determine that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>statements made by Ricks after his appearance before the Commissioner on June 25 must be excluded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The authority invoked is \u201cour local supervisory power.\u201d I most heartily disagree. In my opinion, and under prior law, Ricks was accorded all appropriate safeguards; his statements were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">Rule 5(b) requires the Commissioner to inform the accused, among other things, \u201cof his right to retain counsel,\u201d and further, to \u201callow the defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel * * In this case, the Commissioner fully informed Ricks of his rights. In compliance with Rule 5(b), the proceedings were continued by the Commissioner at Ricks\u2019 request, to aiford him the opportunity to retain and consult with counsel. It is clear, therefore, that Ricks was accorded everything to which he was entitled under Rule 5. Cf. Moon v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 317 F.2d 544 (1962), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 884, 84 S.Ct. 154, 11 L.Ed.2d 113 (1963); Porter v.

The Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to Rule 44 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-14\">\u201cThe rule is intended to indicate that the right of the defendant to have counsel assigned by the court relates only to proceedings in court, and, therefore, <em>does not include preliminary proceedings before a committing magistrate. Although the defendant is not entitled to have counsel assigned to him in connection with preliminary </em>proceedings, he is entitled to be represented by counsel retained by him, if he so chooses.\u201d [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>In addition, no constitutional direction for counsel\u2019s presence would require the exclusion of Ricks\u2019 post-presentment statements. Even Massiah v. United States, 84 S.Ct. 1199 (1964), decided May 18, 1964, in which the Supreme Court extended the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel\u2019s presence to the post-indictment stage, would not apply to Ricks\u2019 pre-preliminary hearing situation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, unlike Massiah, Ricks was not unaware of either the identity of his questioners or the purpose for his assisting the police.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He was fully informed of his rights by the Commissioner and a continuance was immediately granted. <em>He was not required to plead; no preliminary hearing was held; no hearing was waived. </em>I cannot see how Ricks' post-presentment statements were anything but entirely independent statements, made with full knowledge of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">Finally, D.C.Code \u00a7 2-2202 provides in pertinent part .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A226\">^ \u201cThe [Legal Aid] Agency shall make attorneys available to represent indigents in criminal proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and in preliminary hearings in felony cases * * *\u2022 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOIh\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ak_-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * The judges or other presiding officers of the several courts and tribunals may assign attorneys employed by the Agency to represent indigents * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZ\">\u201cEach such court and tribunal will make every reasonable effort to provide assignment of counsel as early in the proceeding as practicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ak4-dedup-0\">At the outset, I should state that I feel that \u00a7 2-2202 could not have been a predicate for the Commissioner\u2019s appointment of counsel, much less that it <em>required </em>such an appointment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, as related to the circumstances here, the statute provides for counsel for indigents in preliminary hearings. As we have seen, <em>preliminary hearing was held </em>in this case prior to Ricks\u2019 statements. But assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the statute is applicable, I further feel that it cannot be reasonably interpreted to require exclusion of Ricks\u2019 post-presentment statemenfe_ Abgent ig tbe requigite causal relationship between an assumed violation of the statute and Ricks\u2019 subsequent statements. The purpose of appointment 0f counsel under the statute is to provide assistance to an indigent in intelligently dealing with the preliminary hearing sit-nation. Here, however, Ricks\u2019 admissions did not grow out of inability to cope with a preliminary hearing; none was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>progress. His statements were not un-intelligently made pleas or judicial admissions. On the contrary, they were \u25a0completely independent, voluntary statements, made with full knowledge of his rights. In my opinion, unless the statute is intended to seal the lips of an accused,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Ricks\u2019 statements were not a \u25a0consequence of a violation of \u00a7 2-2202. They were not a product of ignorance of the law which the presence of counsel would have avoided. Ricks had already \u25a0been fully apprised of his rights by the \u25a0Commissioner, including his right to remain silent. While it may be that there is a qualitative difference in advice between the Commissioner\u2019s statement to Ricks and what counsel might suggest to an accused-client, I do not feel that the statute here involved is in any way predicated upon such a differentiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">I think the statements made immediately after Ricks\u2019 appearance before the Commissioner, being voluntary and with knowledge of his rights, were not obtained as a result of a violation of \u00a7 2-2202 and were properly admitted into evidence. As we observed in Jackson v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 237, 285 F.2d 675, 679 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-6\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has made it clear that a challenged confession voluntarily given after fair warning may be competent. [Citing United States v. Bayer, 331 U.S. 532, 541, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947); United States v. Carignan, 342 U.S. 36, 45, 72 S.Ct. 97, 96 L.Ed. 48 (1951)]. We have so decided as to a confession reaffirmed after judicial caution has been imparted. [Citing Goldsmith v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 310, 277 F.2d 335, 340, cert. denied sub nom.

United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 367, 371, 278 F.2d 247, 251 (1960)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">Regarding Ricks\u2019 admissions following the District Court\u2019s order allowing him to accompany the police, there is no room for doubt that those statements were properly admitted. Robinson v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 308 F.2d 327 (1962), cert. denied 374 U.S. 836, 83 S.Ct. 1887, 10 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1963); Goldsmith v.

United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 2, 193 F.2d 24 (1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 908, 72 S.Ct. 639, 96 L.Ed. 1326 (1952). From the record of the proceedings before Judge McGarraghy quoted above, nothing could be clearer than that Ricks was completely aware of the purpose for his presence before the court, and that he desired to help the police. Since the order signed by the District Judge specifically provided that Ricks was to be accompanied by a deputy marshal as well as the two named officers, it is apparent that Ricks was not subjected to covert interrogation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The presence of the deputy marshal insured against that very possibility. There is simply not one iota of evidence that Ricks\u2019 conduct during that day was anything but completely voluntary, and the record is replete with evidence affirmatively indicating his desire to assist the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">For the above reasons, I am of the opinion that Ricks\u2019 statements, both immediately following his presentment before the Commissioner and following the issuance of the District Court order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>were properly admitted into evidence by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">I do not feel that there is any warrant to exercise the court\u2019s \u201csupervisory power\u201d in this case. This authority is one for the formulation of evidentiary rules in absence of other authority. In view of the circumstances here involved, as well as substantial precedent militating in favor of a contrary result, the promulgating of a rule which will determine the course of future controversies not now before the court seems unwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">In addition, there is a substantial' doubt in my mind that our \u201csupervisory powers\u201d give rise to an ability to establish new law, in lieu of statutory or deci-sional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-27\">. Counts 10 and 12 charged assault with a dangerous weapon and rape against one B..J. These counts were dismissed by the Government prior to trial because of the absence of the complaining witness, who was under treatment for a pre-exist-ing epileptic condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1019-54\">.

A similar position, <em>viz. </em>that questioning by the police \u201cin violation of the spirit of the Commissioner\u2019s order\u201d required exclusion of a defendant\u2019s voluntary statements, was taken by Judges Bazelon and Edgerton in a separate opinion in Trilling v. United States, <em>104 </em>U.S.App.D.C. 159, 260 F.2d 677 (1958), and was specifically rejected in that case in an opinion by three other members of the court. Likewise, this rationale was implicitly rejected by this court in Goldsmith v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 277 F.2d 335, cert. denied <em>sub nom. </em>Carter v. United States, 364 U.S. 863, 81 S.Ct 106, 5 L.Ed.2d 86 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">. Council v.

See, however, the Committee\u2019s Second Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts, proposed Rule 44, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-9\">\u201c(a) Right to Assigned Counsel. Every defendant who is unable to obtain counsel shall be entitled to have counsel assigned to represent him at every stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the commissioner or the court through appeal, unless he waives such appointment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">Even under the proposed rule Ricks\u2019 right to counsel would not have been breached by the Commissioner. The Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to the proposed rule state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOYm\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018from his initial appearance before the commissioner or court\u2019 is intended to require the assignment of counsel as promptly as possible <em>after it appears that the defendant is unable-to obtain counsel.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-17\">In this case, there was no indication that Ricks was \u201cunable to obtain counsel\u201d; he had not tried. The proceedings, were continued at his request in order that he might have an opportunity to obtain counsel. Nor was his financial history such that indigence should have been apparent to the Commissioner. On the-contrary, the record indicates that he had been steadily employed on a painting-crew for at least one year prior to his arrest and, at the time of his arrest, was. earning $24 a day as a supervisor. Moreover, his wife was working as a nurse in a, District of Columbia hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"ahw-dedup-0\">. \u201cWe bold that the petitioner was denied the basic protections of that [Sixth Amendment] guarantee when there was used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents had deliberately elicited from him <em>after he had teen indicted </em>and in the absence of his counsel.\u201d Massiah v.

Strictly speaking, therefore, the Commissioner could not have appointed an attorney to represent him. Even if the two sections are read to require the Commissioner to inform the ac-cusod of the availability of an oath asserting indigence, it is more than dubious that Ricks could have subscribed to such an oath. [See note 9.] At the time of his arrest, he had $20 in his pocket, and to speculate that he was \u201cunable to afford a modest attorney\u2019s fee\u201d is to assume a fact in order to postulate a rule of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">.
