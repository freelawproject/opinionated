Appellee Gar-trell had often supplied Southern with meat on open account. In August 1957, Southern owed Gartrell over $15,000. In response to a demand for payment, Keane wrote Gartrell the following letter on a \u201cSouthern Hotel Supply Co.\u201d letterhead:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cDear Charlie:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">* * * Enclosed please find two checks, one for $832.89 reducing the account to $15,000.00 even, also another check for the $3,099.-57 which pays the week of 7/30 to :8/2, and $500.00 on account. This reduces the account to $11,900.43 \u25a0on which you agreed to take $500.-00 each week until paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">Charlie, you can feel sure we will live up to this arrangement, even if I have to pay you personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">Regarding further business with us, and I do hope you will continue to sell us, I will agree to any terms .you state, however I would hate to have you put us C.O.D. for my father\u2019s sake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">Please let me assure you or yours will never lose a penny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">Southern Hotel Supply Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-15\">Sincerely</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-16\">/s/ Tom Keane</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-17\">Thomas T. Keane, Sr.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">Gartrell did not reply but continued fo supply Southern on open account. \u25a0Southern made some payments but was in arrears when it was adjudged bankrupt in August 1958. Gartrell received .a dividend in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-20\">Soon after Southern filed its petition, Keane filed a personal petition in bankruptcy. He did not list Gartrell as a creditor. Keane received his discharge in bankruptcy in October 1958. Gar-trell brought the present suit against him on the theory that the quoted letter was a personal guarantee by Keane of Southern\u2019s debt. The District Court directed a verdict for Gartrell for the amount Southern owed when Keane wrote the letter, less later payments and the dividend in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"AzSb\">The words \u201cyou can feel sure we will live up to this arrangement, even if I have to pay you personally\u201d were in our opinion only a gratuitous promise, made without any sort of condition, that Keane would pay Southern\u2019s debt if Southern did not, and were not an offer to guarantee the debt if Gartrell would furnish consideration. Neither the quoted promise nor any other part of the letter mentions consideration. The next sentence in the letter discusses nothing but \u201cfurther business\u201d. The letter \u201clacks any expression which can be construed as an offer to enter into a contract. In a sense it is an assurance. But every \u00e9xpression in the nature of an assurance is not a guaranty. * * * It is not capable of construction which would support the conplaint * * Stone v. Commonwealth Finance Corp., 127 Misc. 368, 216 N.Y.S. 639, 641, 642 (1924), aff\u2019d, 243 N.Y. 528, 154 N.E. 592 (1926). Even if the letter could be interpreted as conveying, by implication, some sort of offer, the interpretation would be too uncertain and the offer too indefinite for any attempted acceptance by Gartrell to turn it into a contract. A contract to answer for the debt or default of another is within the Statute of Frauds. It cannot rest on dubious implication but must be clearly expressed. Since there was no clear and definite offer we do not reach any question of acceptance, cf. Davis Sewing Machine Co. v. Richards, 115 U.S. 524, 6 S.Ct. 173, 29 L.Ed. 480 (1885), or the question whether Keane\u2019s signature on the letter was per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sonal as well as corporate within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds, or the question whether Keane\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy barred Gartrell\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Reversed and remanded with direction to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
