The defendant, Trimmings, having a previous federal and several state narcotics convictions, testified that the special employee had ingratiated himself by the gift of two $5 bags of heroin and subsequently enlisted Trimmings\u2019 aid in delivering an ounce of heroin to the agent. The special employee, called at the suggestion of the judge, who was trying the case without a jury, admitted that he was a substantial dealer in narcotics; that he had been arrested for a federal narcotics violation some 19 months before the incident here at issue; that he had been released on nominal bail of $500 (in lieu of the $50,000 initially fixed) in consideration of agreeing to act as a \u201cspecial employee\u201d; and that he had worked as such on 29 cases with agents of the Bureau of Narcotics. However, he denied any dealings with Trimmings, who, he asserted, had asked him ti&gt; help in locating customers \u2014 this leading to the introduction of Trimmings to the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">The spectacle of the United States failing to prosecute a criminal charge against a dealer in narcotics, so long as he engages in large scale pushing as a \u201cspecial employee,\u201d is one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>we find exceedingly unattractive. But whether the special employee induced Trimmings to make the instant sale, as Trimmings alleged, was an issue of fact, for determination by the trial judge. Since he was \u201cconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense of entrapment does not stand up in this case\u201d and the testimony was sufficient, if believed, to warrant that conclusion, existing rules of law render us powerless to interfere.

Ackell, Esq., who, as assigned counsel, argued Trimmings\u2019 appeal with great sincerity and ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
