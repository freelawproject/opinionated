P. Gonzalez Corporation, which had a record of contractual relations with Commodity Credit for a number of years, received notice by telegram<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the Gonzalez Corporation and its officers and affiliates, including Thomas P. Gonzalez and Carmen Gonzalez, Gonzalez and Blanco, J. F. Gonzalez Company, the American Chili Powder Company, and any corporation in which Thomas or Carmen Gonzalez was a partner or officer, were temporarily debarred from doing business with Commodity Credit pending investigation into possible misuse of official inspection certificates relating to commodities exported to Brazil by Gonzalez Corporation. Only Carmen Gonzalez, Thomas P. Gonzalez and Thos. P. Gon-i zalez Corporation joined as plaintiffs in the District Court action now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">By letter dated October 31, I960 Commodity Credit advised appellants that the suspension would be continued until conclusion of an investigation by the Department of Justice. On May 24, 1962, Thomas P. Gonzalez, individually, was indicted on felony charges for alleged misuse of the official inspection certificates referred to in the January 1960 notice of temporary suspension. Following the receipt of the telegram announcing temporary suspension appellants presented information relevant to their position and various representations were' made in their behalf by counsel to officials of appellees. On May 24, 1962, after consideration of information and arguments submitted by appellants, Commodity Credit informed appellants by letter that they were suspended for five years from the date of the original temporary suspension on January 13, 1960. The letter stated no reasons or grounds for the final debarment action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">Meanwhile, on January 15, 1962, the indictment of May 24, 1961, charging Thomas P. Gonzalez personally with misuse of official inspection certificates, was dismissed, and Gonzalez entered a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor based essentially on the same acts. 60 Stat. 1087 (1946), as amended, 69 Stat. 553 (1955), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1622(h) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">Appellants sought review by the Secretary of Agriculture, who declined to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>consider, stating: <em>\u201cWe </em>feel that further discussions would serve no useful purpose unless you are in a position to present new facts concerning this matter which heretofore have not been considered.\u201d Appellants offered none.</p>\n<p id=\"aiq-dedup-0\">Thereafter, appellants instituted the declaratory judgment action from which this appeal arises. Since January 1960, appellants have been ineligible to participate in any programs of Commodity Credit or to purchase surplus government commodities for resale. Their complaint in the District Court alleged that in appellants\u2019 course of dealings with Commodity Credit they had purchased for export under license an aggregate of more than $7,000,000 in surplus commodities, that this was a large part of their business, and that loss of this business has deprived them of more than $100,000 in profits. The chronology of this record shows that for more than two and one-half years, while under temporary and then final suspension, appellants have protested unsuccessfully against the action which made them ineligible to purchase surplus government commodities under control of Commodity Credit.</p>\n<p id=\"A5G\">Appellants contend that the debarment is invalid for four reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"AiJ0\">1. Debarment is not authorized by statute or by regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"A9P\">2. Debarment was imposed without rules or regulations specifying grounds for debarment and establishing a procedure for debarment.</p>\n<p id=\"A2A\">3. Debarment was imposed without notice of charges relied upon and without a meaningful opportunity to meet and refute charges.</p>\n<p id=\"A9Kp\">4. Debarment of appellants was a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"A9o\">Appellants seem to concede that if the action of debarment is authorized by law, a preliminary or temporary debarment may be made in summary fashion. They contend, however, that final action of debarment imposes such serious economic injury on a contractor that debarment can be imposed only by a procedure which comports with constitutional standards of due process. The temporary suspension of January 1960 was to continue only \u201cpending completion of an investigation\u201d by the Department of Justice. At that point \u2014 when this investigation was completed \u2014 appellants insist, notice of charges, opportunity to be heard, and opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses were required.</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">Appellees\u2019 position is that (1) doing business with Commodity Credit is not a legally protected right and suspension of eligibility for five years gives rise to no justiciable controversy; (2) Congress has expressly precluded judicial review of Commodity Credit action; (3) appellants committed a willful act in violation of law basically destructive of the purposes and operations of Commodity Credit;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) appellant Gonzalez\u2019 guilty plea to fraudulent misuse of official inspection certificates established the truth of criminal misuse of such certificates and made it unnecessary to conduct hearings to ascertain the facts on which suspension and debarment rested; (5) opportunity was afforded appellants to present evidence and arguments; (6) the sanction imposed was plainly related to the successful execution of Commodity Credit\u2019s statutory objectives and reasonably commensurate with the gravity of appellants\u2019 misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"ahy-dedup-2\">The issues which emerge from the opposing contentions can be restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A39\">(1) Does debarment of a government contractor from eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>purchase of surplus commodities give rise to a justiciable controversy if it is alleged that debarment was imposed without due process ?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">(2) Did Congress provide for judicial review of the debarment process conducted by Commodity Credit?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">(3) May debarment of a government contractor be imposed without express statutory authority?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\u2022(4) If Commodity Credit has legal authority to debar, can appellants be debarred:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">(a) in the absence of regulations establishing standards and procedures, and</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">(b) in the absence of written notice of charges, evidentiary hearing and findings on charges of misconduct ?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">\n<em>Justiciability and Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aym-dedup-0\">There can be no doubt that the invasion of some legally protected right is 'the predicate upon which any exercise of judicial power must rest. See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 140-141, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (principal opinion). It is equally correct, broadly speaking, to say that no citizen has a '\u201cright,\u201d in the sense of a legal right, to do business with the government. See Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 60 S.Ct. 869, 84 L.Ed. 1108 (1940). Put use of such terms as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cprivilege\u201d tends to confuse the issues presented by debarment action. Interr ruption of an existing relationship between the government and a contractor places the latter in a different posture from one initially seeking government contracts and can carry with it grave economic consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">The consequences of administrative termination of all right to bid or contract, colloquially called \u201cblacklisting\u201d and formally called suspension or debarment, will vary, depending upon multiple factors: the size and prominence of the contractor; the ratio of his government business to non-government business; the length of his contractual relationship with government; his dependence on that business; his ability to secure other business as a substitute for government business. These are some of the basic factors involved. The impact of debarment on a contractor may be a sudden contraction of bank credit, adverse impact on market price of -shares of listed stock, if any, and critical uneasiness of creditors generally, to say nothing of \u201closs of face\u201d in the business community.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These consequences are in addition to the loss of specific profits from the business denied as a result of debarment. We need not resort to a colorful term such as \u201cstigma\u201d to characterize the consequences of such governmental action, for labels may blur the issues. But we strain no concept of judicial notice to acknowledge these basic facts of economic life.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\"> Thus to say that there is no \u201cright\u201d to government contracts does not resolve the question of justiciability. Of course there is no such <em>right; </em>but that cannot mean that the government can act arbitrarily, either substantively or procedurally, against a person or that such person is not entitled to challenge the processes and the evidence before he is officially declared ineligible for government contracts. An allegation of facts which reveal an absence of legal author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ity or basic fairness in the method of imposing debarment presents a justiciable controversy in our view. The injury to appellants alleged in their complaint gives them standing to challenge the debarment processes by which such injury was imposed. See Copper Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Campbell, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 177, 179-180, 290 F.2d 368, 370-371 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"AYJz\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">\n<em>Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APl\">The next question to be resolved is whether Congress has provided for judicial review of Commodity Credit action imposing debarment of a contractor. Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243 (1946), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009 (1958), under the title of \u201cJudicial review of agency action,\u201d after carving out two areas of exception where no review is available, defines the right of review, the form of proceedings, the acts reviewable and the scope of review. The introductory sentence of Section 10 withholds from judicial scrutiny cases where \u201c(1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion\u201d; neither exception is applicable here. Appellees contend that the challenged agency action here falls within both of these categories under 63 Stat. 1057 (1949), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alp-dedup-0\">\u201cDeterminations made by the Secretary [of Agriculture] under this Act shall be final and conclusive: <em>Provided, </em>That the scope and nature of such determinations <em>shall not be inconsistent </em>[emphasis added] with the provisions of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. * * * <em>ft</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">Action challenged as a denial of due process \u2014 whether substantive in the sense of being arbitrary or by capricious classification, or procedural in the sense of denying minimum safeguards \u2014 could be immune from judicial review, if ever, only by the plainest manifestation of congressional intent to that effect. See American and European Agencies v. Gillilland, Inc., 101 U.S.App.D.C. 104, 106 at n. 4, 247 F.2d 95, 97 at n. 4, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 884, 78 S.Ct. 152, 2 L.Ed.2d 114 (1957); see generally, Hart, <em>The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts, </em>66 Harv.L.Rev. 1362, 1386-1401 (1953). We find no such intent reflected in the statute. To the contrary, Congress must have contemplated that a claim of \u201cinconsistency\u201d in the Secretary\u2019s action was to be resolved by judicial review. In short, far from precluding judicial review this statute authorizes it, and \u201cthe responsibility of determining the limits of statutory grants of authority in such instances is a judicial function entrusted to the courts by Congress * * Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 310, 64 S.Ct. 559, 571, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"AXT\">The determination to debar a contractor does not fall within the scope of the second exception, \u201cagency action * * * by law committed to agency discretion.\u201d The language, relied upon by appellees, relating to \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d determinations of the Secretary has as its primary thrust the removal from judicial scrutiny of the operational policy decisions and programs of the agency, not standards of procedure for debarment. Compare Pauling v. McNamara, 118 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 331 F.2d 796 (1963), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>32 U.S. L. WEEK 3352 (U. S. April 2, 1964) (No. 965). Appellants here do not challenge broad policy decisions, as in the <em>Lukens Steel </em>and <em>Pauling </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>but narrowly attack as beyond agency authority a debarment or \u201cblacklisting\u201d which the complaint alleges inflicted a special injury on appellants and was accomplished in a procedurally unfair and unauthorized manner. Nothing in the statute confers unreviewable finality on determinations of the Secretary as to questions of the scope of his congressional authority or of the requisite procedural safeguards. <em>Cf. </em>Harmon v. Brucker, 355 U.S. 579, 582, 78 S.Ct. 433, 2 L.Ed.2d 503 (1958) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"A8h\"> The invasion of a legally protected right also constitutes a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>wrong<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under the meaning of \u201clegal wrong\u201d as used in Section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have already demonstrated that appellants have a right not to be debarred except in an authorized and proeedurally fair manner; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appellants\u2019 allegations of the means by which debarment was imposed in this ease set forth a claim of invasion of that right and give them standing under Section 10(a). See Copper Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Campbell, <em>supra. </em>We read Section 10(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243 (1946), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(b) (1958), as providing that whenever judicial review is not \u201cspecified by statute\u201d or is inadequate \u201cany applicable form of legal action (including actions for declaratory judgments or writs of * * * injunction * * *) \u201d may be brought \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d This specifically authorizes the type of action brought by appellants in the District Court. Finally, although this is not agency action for which Congress has specifically provided judicial review, debarment here is \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court * * * \u201d under Section 10(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 10(c) thus contemplates judicial review under the terms of Section 10(e).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-20\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-21\">\n<em>Authority For Debarment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-22\"> Congress has made no explicit provision for debarring contractors doing business with Commodity Credit. The question presented is whether Commodity Credit is powerless to terminate business relations with irresponsible, defaulting or dishonest contractors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Not-</p>\n<p id=\"asf-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>withstanding its severe impact upon a contractor, debarment is not intended to punish but is a necessary \u201cmeans for accomplishing the congressional purpose\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of Commodity Credit to \u201caid in the development of foreign markets for, agricultural commodities.\u201d 62 Stat. 1072 (1948), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714c(f) (1958). Without such power to deal with irresponsible bidders and contractors, the efficiency of Commodity Credit\u2019s operations would be severely impaired. See L. P. Steuart &amp; Bro., Inc. v. Bowles, 322 U.S. 398, 406, 64 S.Ct. 1097, 88 L.Ed. 1350 (1944). We conclude that such a power is inherent and necessarily incidental to the effective administration of the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Commodity Credit Corp. v. Worthington, 263 F.2d 178 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 1012, 79 S.Ct. 1148, 3 L.Ed.2d 1036 (1959). But to the debarment power there attaches an obligation to deal with uniform minimum fairness as to all. <em>Cf. </em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">\n<em>Debarment Procedures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APt6\">No regulations have been established by appellees authorizing or governing debarment for misuse of official inspection certificates relating to the commodities exported by appellants to Brazil.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">Section 3(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\">\u201c(a) Every agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register * * * (2) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>formal or informal procedures available as well as forms and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or <em>examinations; </em>and (3) substantive rules adopted as authorized by law and statements of general policy or interpretations formulated and adopted by the agency for the guidance of the public, but not rules addressed to and served upon named persons in accordance with law. No person shall in any manner be required to resort to organization or procedure not so published.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201c(b) Every agency shall publish or, in accordance with published rule, make available to public inspection all final opinions or orders in the adjudication of cases (except those required for good cause to be held confidential and not cited as precedents) and all rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">60 STAT. 238 (1946), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a), (b) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The command of the Administrative Procedure Act is not a mere formality. Those who are called upon by the government for a countless variety of goods and services are entitled to have notice of the standards and procedures which regulate these relationships. Neither appellants nor others similarly situated can turn to any official source for guidance as to what acts will precipitate a complaint of misconduct, how charges will be made, met or refuted, and what consequences will flow from misconduct if found. In the contractual relationship shown by this record an experienced businessman could reasonably anticipate that some agency action might well be taken as a result of misuse of inspection certificates, but he could only speculate as to the nature of the action and the processes by which it would be effected. This condition does not accord with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On this record there is neither the appearance nor the reality of fairness in the process by which debarment of appellants was accomplished. Disqualification from bidding or contracting for five years directs the power and prestige of government at a particular person and, as we have shown, may have a serious economic impact on that person. Such debarment cannot be left to administrative improvisation on a case-by-ease basis. The governmental power must be exercised in accordance with accepted basic legal norms.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Considerations of basic fairness require administrative regulations establishing standards for debarment and procedures which will include notice of specific charges, opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses, all culminating in administrative findings and conclusions based upon the record so made.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See notes 20 and 21* <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>On the record before us we see that the preliminary notice of temporary suspension alluded to an alleged misuse of inspection certificates and to a proposed investigation into the subject, but the final notice of five year debarment was silent as to reasons for the action taken<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and was sent only to Thomas P. Gonzalez, Thos. P. Gonzalez Corporation and their attorneys. At no time was there any detailed specification of charges so far as the record shows, although the details may well have been discussed in conferences. No hearing was held, no evidence recorded, no findings were made. At no point were appellants in a position to cross-examine officials who proffered or supported the allegations which presumably led to debarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Having looked \u201cfirst to petitioners\u2019 nonconstitutional claim that respondent acted in excess of powers granted * * * by Congress,\u201d Harmon v. Brucker, 355 U.S. 579, 581, 78 S.Ct. 435 (1958), we conclude that although the Act vests Commodity Credit with power to impose debarment for misuse of official inspection certificates, we cannot agree that Congress intended to authorize such consequences without regulations establishing standards and procedures and without notice of changes, hearings, and findings pursuant thereto. Absent such procedural regulations and absent notice, hearing and findings in this case, the debarment is invalid; to reach any other conclusion would give rise to serious constitutional issues. See, <em>e. g., </em>Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 507-508, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959); Bland v. Connally, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 293 F.2d 852 (1961); Davis v. Stahr, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 293 F.2d 860 (1961). Conceivably a summary debarment, in the nature of a temporary suspension,, might be warranted for a reasonable period pending investigation ;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> whether it would be warranted absent statutory authority or valid regulations, we need not decide. What seems clear is that since the summary final action here was not authorized by statute or governed by regulation, the challenged debarment action could not lawfully be taken without safeguards which satisfy the demands of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The cases in this general area culminating in Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961), make clear that the procedures due one person in one situation are not mechanically the same as those due another in a different context. The governmental interests on the one hand and the individual interests on the other must be balanced and the procedures established must be considered in light of various questions which courts have postulated from time to time: How was the individual likely to be hurt? What governmental interest was to be protected ? How would the governmental interest be affected, if at all, by extending procedural safeguards to cover the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>action ?<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Supreme Court found severe economic injury in Greene v. Mc-Elroy, <em>supra, </em>which was probably dis-positive; in the Cafeteria Workers case the injury was neither severe nor lasting.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Appellants have urged that their debarment violated due process standards. Our interpretation of the Act under which appellees administer the affairs of Commodity Credit makes unnecessary our reaching these constitutional contentions. In short, we construe, the pertinent statutory scheme as authorizing debarment but as not authorizing debarment without either regulations establishing standards and a procedure which are both fair and uniform or basically fair treatment of appellants. The scope and detail of these regulations are for the agency to resolve in the first instance. We have suggested enough on this subject to make further elaboration unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Accordingly we remand with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of Thomas P. Gonzalez and Thos. P. Gonzalez Corporation, whose debarment was invalid because it was imposed without observance of procedural requirements and hence in excess of statutory jurisdiction and authority; <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and to enter summary judgment in favor of Carmen Gonzalez, whose debarment was invalid for the same reasons and because arbitrary and capricious, and hence an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Reversed and remanded.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">.
