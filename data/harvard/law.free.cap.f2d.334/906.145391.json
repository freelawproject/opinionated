As a recent note in the Harvard Law Review says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">\u201c[T]he group cannot be classified as purely religious in nature: \u2018Although the Black Muslims call their Movement a religion, religious values are of secondary importance. They are not part of the Movement\u2019s basic appeal except to the extent that they foster and strengthen the sense of group solidarity.\u2019 [Lincoln, The Black Muslims in America 27 (1961).] The central doctrine of the movement is black supremacy and the equation of the white race with \u2018total evil.\u2019 [Worthy, The Angriest Negroes, Esquire, Feb. 1961, p. 102.] The Black Muslims\u2019 exact political aspirations are nebulous, although vague statements have been made concerning the establishment of a separate Black Muslim state in America, estimated to include from one to ten of the present states. How this territory is proposed to be acquired is a matter of mystery. There is within the movement an elite army, called the Fruit of Islam, whose activities have been shrouded in secrecy.\u201d 75 Harv.L.Rev. 837, 838-9 (1962).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b955-9\">HAYS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">This is an action brought under 28- U. S.C. \u00a7 1343 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by the appellants \u201cin behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.\u201d Plaintiffs are inmates of Attica State Prison at Attica, New York. Defendants are the Commissioner of Correction of the State of New York and the Warden of Attica State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Plaintiffs allege that they are \u201cmembers\u201d of the Islamic religion, known as Muslims, and followers of the sect led by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. They complain that they have been denied certain rights with respect to the practice of their religion, including the right \u201cto attend together congregational worship,\u201d the right to communicate with ministers of their faith and to have such ministers visit the prison and the right to have various religious publications and to carry these publications outside their cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">The relief which the plaintiffs seek includes an order to the defendants to provide congregational religious services and an injunction against \u201cmaking, promulgating, maintaining and enforcing any and all rules, regulations or practices which prohibit, prevent or impede Plaintiffs and other Muslim inmates of Attica Prison\u201d from holding or attending congregational services, communicating and conferring with ministers of their religion, receiving religious literature and \u201ccarrying, displaying, discussing or otherwise using\u201d such literature. The plaintiffs also ask that defendants be enjoined \u201c[f]rom making, promulgating, maintaining or enforcing any and all rules, regulations or practices which inflict any punishment or loss of good time or other penalty on Plaintiffs or other Muslim inmates of Attica Prison solely because of the exercise of their freedom of worship in accordance with their faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">They ask that defendants be ordered to \u201cnullify\u201d any loss of good time \u201cor other similar punishment\u201d heretofore imposed on account of plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to exercise \u201ctheir freedom of religious worship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">The district court entered judgment for the defendants \u201con the claim of religious persecution\u201d and otherwise dismissed the complaint on the ground that decision should be withheld while the New York courts were \u201cgiven an opportunity to act to safeguard and define the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under New York law within the framework of New York\u2019s legitimate policies governing penal institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"alr-dedup-0\">j While we reverse and remand for a slightly different disposition of the case, we are basically in agreement with the district court\u2019s holding that the state authorities, including its courts, must be given an opportunity to propose workable rules for the administration of the rights claimed by these plaintiffs. We believe, however, that the District Court should retain jurisdiction so that it may act if there should be any unreasonable, delay on the part of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">We accept, as we must, since it is not clearly erroneous, the finding of the district court that the beliefs of the organi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>zation with which plaintiffs associate themselves constitute a \u201creligion.\u201d However, it is obvious from the-evidence in the record that the activities of the group are not exclusively religious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">To the extent that it is a religion those who profess to follow its teachings have some measure of constitutional protection, even though they are confined to prison and are subject to prison discipline. Cooper v. Pate, 84 S.Ct. 1733 (1964); Pierce v. LaVallee, 293 F.2d 233 (2d Cir.1961). This protection is, however, subject to extensive limitations which would not be applicable were the plaintiffs not prisoners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Moreover, to concede that we are dealing here with a group which has some characteristics of a religious sect is separated by an enormous gap from the conclusion which the plaintiffs press upon us, the conclusion that since it is a religion this sect is subject to the same rules and regulations and must be treated in the same way as are Catholics, Protestants and Jews.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">But before we reach the question of equality of treatment, we should point out that the practice of <em>any </em>religion, however orthodox its beliefs and however accepted its practices, is subject to strict supervision and extensive limitations in a prison. The principal problem of prison administration is the maintenance of discipline. Attica Prison is a maximum security prison designed for the detention of only the most desperate criminals. No romantic or sentimental view of constitutional rights or of religion should induce a court to interfere with the necessary disciplinary regime established by the prison officials. \u201c[E]xcept in extreme cases, the courts will not interfere with the conduct of a prison, with the enforcement of its rules and regulations, or its discipline,\u201d Childs v. Pegelow, 321 F.2d 487, 489 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 932, 84 S.Ct. 702, 11 L.Ed.2d 652 (1964) (citing-many supporting cases).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A prisoner has only such rights as can be exercised without impairing the requirements of prison discipline. \u201cLawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">The differences between the beliefs of the Muslims, who, like the plaintiffs, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>followers of Elijah Muhammad, and the beliefs of other religions, including, incidentally, the orthodox Islam of several hundred millions of Asians and Africans, are far more striking than the similarities.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">Father Charles M. Whelan, testifying as an expert in Fulwood v. Clemmer, 206 F.Supp. 370, 373 (D.D.C.1962), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t know any other religion that teaches racial hatred as an essential part of the faith of the religion. There are many religions which have practiced racial hatred at various times, but this movement is the only movement that I know of which makes it a tenet of the faith that all white people should be hated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Basic to the problem of prison discipline is the fact that the teachings of Elijah Muhammad include condemnation of the entire white race as wholly \u201cevil,\u201d composed of devils, murderers, thieves, robbers, scientists at tricks, world snoopers, meddlers and liars.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Presenting almost equal difficulty is the Muslims\u2019 demand for total segregation between whites and blacks. These Muslims also adopt the position that the Christian religion is loathsome and despicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When these doctrines are preached openly in the presence of white fellow-prisoners, most of whom are Christians, the result is outrage, resentment and attempts at reprisal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is for this reason that plaintiffs were not permitted to carry certain Muslim literature from their cells and display or distribute it to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>An example of the kind of literature which is subject to these limitations is the Los Angeles Herald Dispatch which carries a column by Elijah Muhammad. Receipt of this publication is permitted at Attica but prisoners are presumably not permitted to take it from the cells. The Director of Correction of the District of Columbia banned the\u2019publication entirely because of information that \u201cboth white and negro inmates were agitated by Mr. Muhammad\u2019s inflammatory articles.\u201d (Fulwood v. Clemmer, 206 F.Supp. 370, 375 (D.D.C.1962).)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The so-called Muslim Brotherhood, an \u201cadjunct of the Islamic faith,\u201d is a semi-secret organization which was formed by these plaintiffs and others as a kind of government within the prison. Of this organization Judge Brennan said in Pierce v. LaVallee, 212 F.Supp. 865, 869 (N.D.N.Y.1962), aff\u2019d, 319 F.2d 844 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 850, 83 S.Ct. 1913 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">\u201cAdmittedly there existed at Clinton Prison an organization of inmates with inmate leadership dedicated to the formation of secret plans, strategy and policies and further dedicated to the extension of objectives of said organization throughout the state prison system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Plaintiff SaMarion was an \u201cassistant leader\u201d of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood had a constitution <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which, among other things, provided for kangaroo courts to punish erring members. We have held that the Brotherhood had \u201covertones of secrecy and intrigue,\u201d Pierce v. LaVallee, 319 F.2d 844, 845 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 850, 83 S.Ct. 1913 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">\u201cRiots, prompted by disputes over religiously unacceptable prison food, proselytizing in the exercise yard, and refusals by individual Muslims to obey white guards have occurred in a number of prisons.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At Attica Prison the authorities were fortunately able to nip in the bud a sit-down strike of Muslim inmates in protest against punishment of Sostre. Some of the difficulties with the Muslims at Clinton Prison, another New York penal institution, are described by Judge Brennan in Pierce v. LaVallee, 212 F.Supp. 865 (N.D.N.Y.1962), aff\u2019d, 319 F.2d 844 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 850, 83 S.Ct. 1913 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">At Lorton Reformatory, a District of Columbia penal institution, riots occurred in which Muslims armed with sticks, stones and pickaxes, ran from building to building breaking plate glass windows and causing damage estimated at between seven and twelve thousand dollars. They were demanding \u201ca proper respect for their religion\u201d and a separate dormitory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On another occasion the Muslims at Lorton insisted on being served meals before sunup and after sundown during Ramadan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Other racial troubles at Lorton caused by Muslim action are described in Fulwood v. Clem-mer, 206 F.Supp. 370 (D.D.C.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">Of the difficulties with the Muslim group at Folsom State Prison, the California Supreme Court said (In re Ferguson, 55 Cal.2d 663, 672, 361 P.2d 417, 421, 12 Cal.Rptr. 753, 757, cert. denied, Ferguson v. Heinze, 368 U.S. 864, 82 S.Ct. 111, 7 L.Ed.2d 61 (1961)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-15\">\u201c[I]t is apparent that the Muslim beliefs in black supremacy, and their reluctance to yield to any authority exercised by 'some one [who] does not believe in [their] God,\u2019 present a serious threat to the maintenance of order in a ei'owded prison environment. Even conceding the Muslims to be a religious group it can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>not be said under the circumstances here presented that the Director of Corrections has made an unreasonable determination in refusing to allow petitioners the opportunity to pursue their claimed religious activities while in prison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The particular characteristics of the Muslims obviously require that whatever rights may be granted because of the religious content of their practices must be carefully circumscribed by rules and regulations which will permit the authorities to maintain discipline in the prison. As the California court said in Ferguson, supra, 55 Cal.2d at 675, 361 P.2d at 423, 12 Cal.Rptr. at 759:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-6\">\u201cCertainly it cannot be said that the prison officials would be acting arbitrarily or unreasonably in withholding a version of any bible or other literature adapted by the Muslim Religious Group to support their doctrines of the supremacy of the black race and segregation from the white race. To so hold would be to compel the prison officials to permit inmates to purchase and disseminate in the prison literature advocating and encouraging the very conduct which the prison authorities may lawfully suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">At Lorton Reformatory certain rights were granted to Muslims but each of these rights was hedged about with protective limitations in support of prison discipline. See Sewell v. Pegelow, 304 F.2d 670 (4th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">We do not believe that the Constitution requires the granting of rights free from proper limitations. In this respect we believe that a note in the Columbia Law Review (62 Colum.L.Rev. 1488, 1503-04 (1962)) sets forth the correct position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-9\">\u201cOnce the imminence of danger is apprehended and proved, it would seem preferable to give the warden the discretion his competence warrants, and uphold all disciplinary measures reasonably necessary to meet the threatening situation. It is conceivable that finding that a religious group presents a \u2018clear and present danger\u2019 would not ipso facto lead to a proscription of all their activities. Normally, the most private and contemplative of religious activities is the reading of one\u2019s bible. The Black Muslim <em>Koran, </em>however, is the source of the anti-white doctrine that prompts many of the disciplinary problems, and Black Muslim services almost invariably involve stirring expositions of the implications of the black supremacy doctrine \u2014 words that may well pervade the behavior of those who attended for the rest of the day. To offer the Black Muslims expurgated bibles and censored sermons would be to engage in the very activities the first amendment was designed to avoid. Thus, upon clear demonstration of the imminent and grave disciplinary threat of the Black Muslims as a group in a particular prison, proscription by prison officials of their activities seems constitutionally permissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">i The problem presented by the Muslim group is not whether they should be permitted to have congregational services, a minister, religious literature, but rather, under what limitations protective of prison discipline they should be permitted these rights.^</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">It is of little use for us to announce that because of the religious content of the Muslims\u2019 beliefs and practices they must be given the right, even in prison, to follow the dictates of their faith, if we find it necessary immediately to add, \u201cOf course all these rights are subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as .the authorities impose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">In other words the nub of this whole situation is not to be found in the existence of theoretical rights, but in the very practical limitations on those rights which are made necessary by the requirements of prison discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\"> It is not the business of the Federal Courts to work out a set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>rules and regulations to govern the practices of religion in the state prisons. Surely this is a task for the state authorities to undertake. We do not stop with an empty declaration of rights accompanied by generalities as to proper limitations on those rights. We prefer, having given expression to the requirement that insofar as possible within the limits of prison discipline the Muslims be allowed what they ask for, not to leave it at that, but to request that the state authorities propose the rules and regulations which they believe are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The Supreme Court has approved abstention in litigation arising under the Civil Rights Act. Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152 (1959). Abstention is appropriate where its purpose is \u201cthe avoidance of unnecessary interference by the federal courts with proper and validly administered state concerns,\u201d Harrison v. NAACP, supra at p. 176, 79 S.Ct. at 1030, and where the issues are delicate, Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., 316 U.S. 168, 172, 62 S.Ct. 986, 86 L.Ed. 1355 (1942), or involve a sensitive state social policy, Railroad Comm\u2019n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 498, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Moreover the present case raises important questions of state law \u2014 the extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under Section 610 of the Correction Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 43, which provides for freedom of worship for prisoners in New York\u2019s penal institutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state courts have ordered the issuance of administrative regulations implementing Section 610. Matter of Brown v. McGinnis, 10 N.Y.2d 531, 225 N.Y.S.2d 497, 180 N.E.2d 791 (1962). We are informed that further litigation involving such regulations is now pending in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court, including its judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>in favor of the defendant on the issue of religious persecution, and remand the case with instructions to retain jurisdiction pending action by state authorities, and with the further proviso that either party may apply to the district court for further action at any time after one year from the date of this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-14\">. \u201cIt is true that prison administration ordinarily demands that rights to speech and assembly, guaranteed to members of free society by the first and fourteenth amendments, be sharply curtailed.\u201d 75 Harv.L.Rev. 837, 839 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b956-15\">. We do not consider Pierce v. LaVallee, 293 F.2d 233 (2d Cir. 1961) to be at variance with the Pegelow case and the many cases supporting the proposition for which it is cited. This first Pierce case appeared on its face to be \u201cextreme,\u201d since it was alleged that prisoners were being punished solely because of their religious beliefs. Actually the ultimate disposition of the case involved no interference by the court with prison discipline. Pierce v. LaVallee, 319 F.2d 844 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 850, 83 S.Ct. 1913, 10 L.Ed.2d 1070 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b957-6\">.
