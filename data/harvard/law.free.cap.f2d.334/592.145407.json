The district court consented to hear the case, which was filed as a class action pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 23, and which sought injunctive relief. The complaint based jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1337. After the cause was heard, the district court duly entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AD0Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>'Briefly stated, the fact's are these: 'The plaintiffs are Texas rice farmers whose 1962 farm acreage allotments and marketing quotas were cancelled by the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They attack this caneellation and assert that: (1) such act was wholly beyond the power of the defendants to effect; (2) that substantial unwarranted penalties were assessed against them as a result of said caneellation; and (3) that they were unable to market their crop for the year in question because of the unauthorized recall of their marketing quota cards.</p>\n<p id=\"AKa\">Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, a functional scheme is provided commencing with the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary is required to determine a national acreage allotment for rice after determining the national marketing quota based upon the relationship between \u201ctotal supply\u201d of the corn-modity in question for the year and \u201cnormal supply\u201d, and to apportion the acreage allotment among the states. Apportionment of state acreage allotment among the counties is a function of the State Committee, subject to certain authorized reserves. The county allotment is apportioned by the County Committee pursuant to detailed regulations. The State Committee has certain supervisory powers over the County Committee. The County Review Committee is authorized to review the actions and decisions of the County Committee. Fulford v. Forman, 245 F.2d 145 (5 Cir. 1957).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>portant and broad functions required of the Secretary to administer and enforce the law make it necessary that the Secretary prescribe such regulations as are authorized and needful to the enforcement of the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">None of the plaintiffs planted acreage to rice in excess of their original acreage allotments and quotas as fixed by the County Committee initially. However, upon receipt of information by the ASCS to the effect that there was an indication that applicable regulations had been violated and improper practices might have been employed by some applicants with regard to obtaining their allotments, an audit of rice allotments was initiated. The practices referred to concerned whether certain rice producers who had certified to the ASCS that they were engaged in the production of rice were, in fact, so engaged.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on the auditors\u2019 reports as interpreted by the general counsel, the defendants, pursuant to 7 CFR 1021(e),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> initiated the actions about which complaint is herein made.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Certain creditors of the plaintiffs also petitioned the district court for leave to intervene. The district court found that the interests of these creditors were adequately represented by the plaintiffs and denied them leave to intervene. These creditors, now appellant-lien creditors, have assigned the district court\u2019s refusal to grant' their petition as error, thereby also placing that issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The district court concluded that the plaintiffs had been properly notified of the change in their farm acreage allotment within the meaning of the Act. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1362 (see f.n. 1). The State Committee notified the County Committee, and the County Committee notified the farmers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Actions by the County Committee are subject to administrative review by a Review Committee pursuant to Section 1363 of the Act, and to further review by either the United States District Court or any State Court of general jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1365, 1366.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court determined that the remedy provided by the foregoing sections was ex-elusive, and that, in view of 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1367<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it was wholly without power to grant the relief prayed for inasmuch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the plaintiffs had failed to properly pursue the remedy provided for by the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The plaintiffs assign the holding of the district court as error with respect to its interpretation of the Act and the powers granted defendants thereunder; and further, in their reply brief, contend that basic federal jurisdiction is present and that the trial court erred in not ruling to this effect. We are thus presented with issues relating to a judicial interpretation' of the Act as well as issues relating to-the existence of federal jurisdiction under the Act. By approaching the matter of jurisdiction first, it is unnecessary for us to reach the problems concerning our interpretation of the Act and the validity of the defendants\u2019 actions. To put it' another way, we agree with the findings of the district court regarding its lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>jurisdiction, and therefore it is not necessary to consider the issues presented which are not related to the matter of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The specter of jurisdictional deficiency has haunted these proceedings throughout, and while the plaintiffs have attempted to steer a course through its murky waters, we are unable to follow their theories and contentions. Any constitutional questions concerning due process were laid to rest when the trial court, upon plaintiffs\u2019 own motion, ordered the \u201cdue process\u201d allegation stricken from their complaint'.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">There are no personal rights of property created in the plaintiffs by the Act which would allow them to recover in a suit against governmental functionaries. The Agricultural Act is a public law, not a private law; therefore no vested rights may be obtained under it. Dighton v. Coffman, 178 F.Supp. 114 (D.C.E.D.Ill.1959), aff\u2019d 279 F.2d 497 (7 Cir. 1960); Bishop v. Review Committee, Venue V, Com. Stab. Serv., 298 F.2d 386 (8 Cir. 1962). The chief purpose of the Act is to control the production of certain agricultural products, including rice. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1282, 1304; Fulford v. Forman, 245 F.2d 145 (5 Cir. 1957); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 130, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122, 138. Since the Act and its attendant regulations do not vest in the plaintiffs any legally recognizable rights other than those specifically enumerated therein; and since administrative avenues have been carefully laid out along which an aggrieved party may travel while seeking redress, we must reason that the plaintiffs choosing \u25a0not to travel the road to administrative review as provided for them, have placed 'before the court a controversy over which we lack the power to render a binding \u2022decision under the facts and in the circumstances here involved.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">It may be that if the acts complained of are in fact, <em>ultra vires, </em>and beyond any powers granted to the defendants under the Act; then the plaintiffs are the victims of a simple action <em>ex delicto, </em>which may be maintained against the defendants individually much the same as against any other tort-feasor. Such a theory however, lends no support to the assertion of basic federal jurisdiction in this cause. See Goltra v. Weeks, 271 U.S. 536, 544, 46 S.Ct. 613, 616, 70 L.Ed. 1074, wherein the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cNeither they [government agents] nor the government which they represent could trespass upon the property of another, and it is well settled that they may be stayed in their unlawful proceeding by a court of competent jurisdiction, even though the United States for whom they profess to act <em>is not a party and can not be made one. </em>By reason of their illegality, their acts or threatened acts <em>are personal </em>and <em>derive no official justification </em>from their doing them in asserted agency for the government.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We do not take the position that either the Act or the regulations pursuant to the Act are simple. We regard them as complicated, lengthy and difficult. See Fulford v. Forman, 245 F.2d 145, 149. However, complexity and difficulty are not synonymous with arbitrariness, unreasonableness or invalidity. Review Committee Venue VII v. Wiley, 8 Cir., 275 F.2d 264, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The language of the Act imports to us that an exclusiveness of jurisdiction and review is lodged within the framework of the administrating agency. Weir v. United States, 310 F.2d 149, 156, 157 (8 Cir. 1962); Miller v. United States, 242 F.2d 392, 395 (6 Cir. 1957); Corbin v. United States, 279 F.2d 431, 432 (6 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>1960); Corpstein v. United States, 262 F.2d 200, 201 (10 Cir. 1958), Cert. denied, 359 U.S. 966, 79 S.Ct. 877, 3 L.Ed.2d 834; Rigby v. Rasmussen, 275 F.2d 861, 865 (10 Cir. 1960); Donaldson v. United States, 264 F.2d 804, 805, 806 (6 Cir. 1959); United States v. Jeffcoat, 272 F.2d 266, 271 (4 Cir. 1959); United States v. Lillard, 143 F.Supp. 113, 119 (U.S.D.C.W.D.Mo., S.D., 1956); Paul v. United States, 222 F.Supp. 102, 106 (U.S.D.C.E.D. North Carolina, 1963); United States v. Bonderer, 139 F.Supp. 391, 395, 396 (U.S.D.C.W.D.Mo., W.D. 1956); United States v. Johnson, 155 F.Supp. 898, 901, 902 (U.S.D.C.W.D. Ark.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The plaintiffs rely heavily on the case of Hasty v. Carter, (1961) 105 Ga.App. 139, 123 S.E.2d 563, and urgently insist that it constitutes judicial authority for their position and authorizes the relief sought. We do not so interpret the Hasty case. That case arose after review by the Review Committee and after the plaintiff had complied with the administrative remedies provided by the Act. There are also factual differences. In the instant case the plaintiffs had not marketed their crops when the defendants took action. In Hasty the tobacco had been marketed. The regulations applicable in Hasty are also different from those applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We are not' unmindful of the recent case of Morrow v. Clayton, 326 F.2d 36 (10 Cir. 1963) which, in effect, finds the presence of federal jurisdiction over controversies arising out of an allotment of acreage and marketing quotas adverse to the farmer which was determined by a State Committee, but fails to locate such jurisdiction where the adverse decision was rendered by a local county committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The crucial question for our determination is whether the court has jurisdiction to review and revise the action of the County ASCS Committee; or, whether the plaintiffs must follow the administrative procedure of having their complaints first reviewed by the Review Committee. The plaintiffs contend that our case of Fulford v. Forman, 245 F.2d 145 (5 Cir. 1957), is authority for the proposition that they are not required to first present their complaints to the Review Committee. We do not so interpret Fulford. We were there considering the power of the Review Committee to review complaints of farmers who were protesting only the allotment of the entire state quota by the State Committee among the various counties of the state. We were not dealing with a complaint by a farmer protesting the action of the County Committee as to allotments made by such Committee to specific individuals or farms. This fact is made clear by the opinion of Judge Dooley when the case was before the District Court, 144 F.Supp. 536, where the court had occasion to say, in speaking of the farmer\u2019s contention: \u201cHe found no fault, however, with the action of the county committee, and thought they had been fair and did the best they could under all of the circumstances, but pointed his grievance entirely against the State committee.\u201d In affirming the action of the district court, our opinion in Fulford clearly rejected the contention there urged by the farmers that the language of Section 1363 is so broad that a Review Committee can review the action of the State Committee and even pass upon the actions of the Secretary himself. Concluding that such review was not authorized, this court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cSince the statute itself does not accord to the Review Committee power to consider things beyond those matters relating to the use and distribution of the County Allotment as established by the State Committee, the regulation, Section 711.30 (b), 12 F.R. 1388, implements this approach and is obviously valid. \u201cThis does not mean that the cotton farmers are necessarily without the means of judicial review for those acts by the State Committee, the Secretary, or his other agencies, deemed to be not in accordance with law. What those rights are, or where, or how they may be asserted is not before us. We merely hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that the route through Sections 1363, 1365, 1366 is not the one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We feel that Morrow supports Fulford and the conclusion here reached. In Morrow, the County Committee not only failed to act, but refused to act. Therefore, the court was not considering a complaint with respect to adverse action by the County Committee or whether such -adverse action was reviewable by the Review Committe.e, as we are in the instant case. Indeed, Morrow concludes that district courts do not have jurisdiction of complaints by a farmer who has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by proceeding under Section 1363 authorizing review by the County Review Committee; and further, that exhaustion of this administrative remedy is a prerequisite to court review. As indicated in Morrow there was no adverse action or decision by the County Committee or by the Review Committee so far as the complaining farmers were concerned. It was concluded, therefore, that since the County Review Committee was not authorized to review the actions of the State Committee or the actions of the Secretary himself, the complaining farmers in Morrow were not bound to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by Section 1363. That section is simply not applicable to actions by the State Committee. It is applicable to adverse decisions by the County Committee. In the case at bar we are asked in effect, to review adverse decisions by the County Committee, albeit that the primary cause for such actions and decisions by the County Committee were facts disclosed by the audit, and by State Committee action.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">It is neither the function nor duty of this court to rewrite statutory enactments in order to create a remedy where none has previously been held to exist. We must remain attentive to the policies enumerated by the framers of the Act, Title 7, \u00a7 1282, 1304, U.S.C.A. As was carefully stated by this court in Fulford, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cOf course, the heart of the Act is the elimination of excessive supplies of cotton [here rice] * * * through a detailed scheme for regulating production.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">* -\u00bb * -x- -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">\u201cAnd control of \u2018 * * * total supply, upon which the whole statutory plan is based, depends upon control of <em>individual supply.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Citing Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 130, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122, 138.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">In the light of the foregoing, we find it impossible to superimpose a tenuous distinction upon the Act which would thwart and undermine its expressed legislative scheme for the determination and control of <em>individual supply. </em>We conclude, therefore, there was no error in the district court\u2019s rulings regarding its lack of jurisdiction and its denial of the appellant-lien creditors\u2019 right to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"Asmy\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\">.

Some point is made in briefs as to the time sequence involved with respect to the investigation and actions taken by the State and County Committees and the fact that suit was filed prior to receipt of notice by farmers of final action by the Committees. After the usual and-pre-seribed routine of filing applications for producer allotments, the issuance of notices as to farm acreage allotment and marketing quota, and notice of acreage had been issued by the County Committee, an investigation into certain practices and conduct was initiated in June 1962. There were two investigations. One was conducted by the F.B.I., and the other by the Internal Audit Division of the Department of Agriculture. None of the named plaintiffs were involved in the F.B.I. investigation, which related more particularly to fictitious producer allotments, and the only way such investigation is related to these proceedings would be a rather remote connection under the contention of the plaintiffs that they are entitled to represent all rice farmers in a class action. The cases of the named plaintiffs were investigated by the Internal Audit Division, which investigated more particularly the question of whether the holders of producer allotments were, actually engaged in \u201cthe production of .rice\u201d on the farms to which their allotments had been allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Early in August 1962 an audit report was submitted which contained information indicating the possibility that some of the producers were not actually engaged in the production of rice. On August 9, the County Committee mailed notices to producers advising them of a hearing to be held before the County Committee on August 13, 1962, with reference to the subject matter, and advising the producer of- his right to be present personally and by counsel. On August 10, 1962, the County Committee gave notice to producers that marketing cards theretofore issued were cancelled. A hearing was held before the County Committee on August 13, 1962. On September 14, 1962, a United States Government Memorandum from the State Executive Director of the State Committee, U. S. Department of Agriculture, was issued to the office manager of the County Committee that, based on the evidence presented, the State Committee had determined that certain of the-producers were not actually engaged in-, \u201cthe production of rice\u201d and the rice allotment of the producers should be recalled and revised allotment notices issued, and penalties invoked for excess: acreage. Thereafter (September 17-1S) the County Committee issued such notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The plaintiffs filed suit on September 7, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">A number of forms are involved. No-useful purpose would be served in undertaking to give the number, designation or-general description of the various forms. It should be noted however that Form-, MQ-24-1 designated \u201cNotice of Farm Acreage Allotment and Farm Marketing Quota\u201d contained a notice on the front of the form calling attention to certain provisions on the reverse side, among which-, is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">\u201c1. REVISION OF ALLOTMENT. This allotment is subject to such changes as may be necessary under the procedure for determination of allotments-for the designated crop year, taking into account (1) any incorrect data or-information used in establishing this allotment or (2) any change in the total', land in the farm for such year from that shown on the reverse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">Another form,\" No. 590, entitled \u201cNotice-of Acreage,\u201d issued by the County Committee, contains the following statement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIZ\">\u201cC. RICE \u2014 Unless the planted acreage-is adjusted to the farm allotment in accordance with applicable regulations, a. penalty will become due on the farm.', marketing excess, and rice produced on, the farm will be ineligible for price sup\u2014 port.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b647-11\">. After suit was filed, the State Committee determined that one of the plaintiffs was engaged in \u201cthe production of rice\u201d and proper adjustment was made as to that plaintiff. Other rice farmers of the class which the plaintiffs seek to represent, and who were involved in substantially the same difficulties as the plaintiffs, followed the review procedures provided by the Act and the trial court found that their cases were being entertained and moved to decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
