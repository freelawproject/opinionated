The prisoner said he had twice been under psychiatric care. His lawyer told the court that in the last 31 years, Leach\u2019s entire adult life, he had been out of prison only 63 days. The pre-sentence report characterized Leach as \u201cthe classical picture of the psychopathic offender.\u201d Yet the judge ignored his request for an examination. Alleging this and other errors, Leach appealed. This court held the other errors harmless and affirmed the conviction. Leach v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 320 F.2d 670 (1963). But we remanded the case to the district judge to reconsider the sentence because there was \u201cno indication here that the court * * * made use of any of the aids to sentencing placed at its disposal by the Congress of the United States. * * * In view of the fact * * * that the record reflects no response on the part of the court to appellant\u2019s request for examination prior to sentence, that request may not have been considered.\u201d 115 U.S.App.D.C. at 354, 320 F.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>On remand, the trial judge reconsidered the sentence without further investigation of any kind, and in particular, without referring the prisoner for a mental examination. The judge reinstated the original sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant had no hearing, though he sought one,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the need for a mental examination. Reconsideration of the sentence occurred in the defendant\u2019s absence, though Rule 43, F.R.Crim.P., requires his presence \u201cat every stage of the trial * * * including the imposition of sentence.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Leach\u2019s counsel also was not present at the reconsideration of the sentence, though this was an important step in the proceedings against him. Compare White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The judge gave four reasons for adhering to the former sentence: the probation officer had recommended the maximum sentence and had not himself, as he had power to do (D.C.Code \u00a7 24-106), referred Leach for a mental examination; the crime was a serious one; the defendant had a record of repeated robberies; and \u201cthere was no competent evidence of any kind prior to, during or after the trial or prior to the imposition of sentence, that the defendant Leach was suffering from any mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">We think these reasons do not support the judge\u2019s decision. That the probation officer failed to refer Leach for an examination is no reason for the judge, who is in a supervisory capacity over the officers, to fail also.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That the crime was serious and that previous efforts at rehabilitation had collapsed made this the sort of case in which further study was needed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That the judge thought there was no competent evidence of \u201cmental illness\u201d should not have precluded an examination as an aid to sentencing and treatment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>The adamant refusal in this case to refer the prisoner for a mental examination was an abuse of discretion. Three statutes make a psychological evaluation of the prisoner available to the sentencing judge in the District of Columbia. The court may refer him to a mental hospital for examination if \u201cit shall appear * * * from the court\u2019s own observations or from prima facie evidence * * * that the accused is of unsound mind or is mentally incompetent * * * to understand the proceedings.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301(a). This statute may have misled the judge. He stated that there \u201cwas no evidence * * that the defendant had any mental illness,\u201d which implies that he thought the conditions set by \u00a7 24-301 are always requisite for a pre-sentence examination. But provisions other than \u00a7 24-301 allow such examinations and there are other reasons than those in \u00a7 24-301 for ordering such examinations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Leach\u2019s case extreme recidivism was combined with a request for aid, and the probation officer, who had investigated Leach\u2019s background and had talked to him at length, called him a psychopathic offender. The diagnosis of the New Jersey State Prison, part of the pre-sentence report, was: \u201cpsychopathic personality, unstable, unreliable, recidivistic, antisocial, poor prognosis for good adjustment if released.\u201d This might well be a sufficient <em>prima facie </em>case for an examination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it was not, it was enough to make clear the usefulness of a psychological evaluation in determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Section 24-106 (D.C.Code) provides \u201ca qualified psychiatrist and a qualified psychologist\u201d for the district judges and the probation officers, among others, \u201cto assist them in carrying out their duties.\u201d The statute leaves to the judges\u2019 discretion the cases in which they should use the Legal Psychiatric Services. But we pointed out in our former opinion herein that the District Court had recently refused to employ the service at all. This seems to reflect a failure to exercise discretion. In 1960, 51 cases were referred to the service and in 1962 only 3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the absence of any indication of major change in the types of cases before the courts, or of poor performance by the service, we were at a loss to discover the reason for this sudden drop in referrals. Leach could have been examined under this statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Also open to the sentencing judge is the possibility of sentencing the prisoner, then referring the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General where the Prison Bureau may make a complete survey of his mental, social and emotional adjustment in a controlled atmosphere.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P., provides that \u201cthe court may reduce a sentence within 60 days after [it] is imposed.\u201d Thus the judge may refer the prisoner for two months of study and if a prognosis for rehabilitation appears he may then reduce the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The widely acknowledged usefulness of this technique moved Congress in 1958 \u201cto make the opportunity [for study]' more certain\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by allowing a Federal judge to refer a prisoner for a possible 6-month rather than 2-month period. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b). The statute calls for the collection of \u201cdata regarding the prisoner\u2019s previous delinquency or criminal experience, pertinent circumstances of his social background, his capabilities, his mental and physical health, and such other factors as may be considered pertinent.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c). Though the 6-month period is not applicable to offenses under the D.C. Code, the opportunity to reduce a sentence after evaluation is available for a 60-day period<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> under Rule 35, Fed.R. Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">Section 4208(b) was one of a group of statutory changes by which Congress showed profound interest in the rehabilitative function of sentencing and recognized the potential value of modern psychological knowledge in achieving the aim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The legislation resulted from a movement by judges over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>the country to examine and improve sentencing techniques.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The traditional effort to make the punishment fit the crime is largely superseded by an effort to make the treatment fit the offender. The presentence report in which a probation officer makes a study of the social background and history of the offender has become routine. This court recently reversed a case in which a judge sentenced two youthful offenders immediately after trial without awaiting a <em>pre-sentence </em>report. Peters v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 236, 307 F.2d 193 (1962). Psychiatric evaluation through the Legal Psychiatric Services or through the Prison Bureau program, like the presentence report, is a useful tool for rehabilitative rather than retributive sentencing. Such evaluation does not, of course, provide all the answers to the sentencing puzzle, but Congress and experts in criminology agree that it has a crucial place in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">This plainly appears from House and Senate reports on \u00a7 4208 (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">\u201cThe Federal judge has a heavy caseload, and the time and resources available to him in the determination of sentences are extremely limited. He frequently does not get sufficient information from the prosecuting attorney, the defense attorney, the probation officer\u2019s presen-tence report, or the defendant himself to enable the court to formulate a sentence which is equitable both to the defendant and to the public. H.Rep. No. 1946, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">\u201cThis observation and diagnosis would be extremely helpful to the court in making disposition in certain types of cases; particularly where a difficult medical, psychiatric, sex, or rehabilitative problem may be-involved.\u201d S.Rep. No. 2013, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News, p. 3898 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Since these considerations apply to Leach\u2019s case, we must respectfully reject the dissent\u2019s contention at pp. 954, 955 that the concerns of \u00a7 4208 (b) are somehow inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">A judge sentencing for a D.C. Code violation has two sources other than D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301(a), <em>supra </em>p. 948,. from which to obtain a psychiatric evaluation: The Legal Psychiatric Services, D.C.Code \u00a7 24-106, and the two-month study made possible by Rule 35, Fed.R.CRIM.P. But the first has fallen into desuetude and the judges have ignored the second even after its endorsement by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b). Against this background of neglect, Leach\u2019s case is a dramatic example of' the need for such services. If Leach,, his family or friends had had the intellectual and financial ability, he would have been able to present psychiatric and other information directed to the separate issue of sentencing. Compare the extensive psychiatric evidence and argument offered to mitigate the sentence by the wealthy defendants in the <em>Loeb-Leopold </em>case. Sellers, THE LOEBLEOPOLD CASE. A wide difference between the opportunities for justice available to the rich and poor has often been held \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956); Greenwell v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 44, 317 F.2d 108 (1963); Brown v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. -, 331 F.2d 822 (decided April 10, 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">In Jones v. United States, No. 17485, decided <em>en banc </em>Dec. 13, 1963, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 327 F.2d 867, we reversed a death sentence because the trial judge had not received and considered the results of a mental examination before exercising his statutory discretion to reimpose a capital sentence. <em>Cf. </em>Watson v. Cameron, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 312 F.2d 878 (1962).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">We do not question the general rule that an appellate court will not ordinarily review sentences that are within the statutory maximum. We hold only that the sentencing judge should use some of the resources which Congress has provided and that he may not arbitrarily ignore the data properly obtained thereby. See United States v. Wiley, 267 F.2d 453 (7th Cir. 1959); United States v. Wiley, 278 F.2d 500 (7th Cir. 1960), in which the appellate court first remanded because of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to hold .a probation hearing, and, on the second .appeal, after a hearing had been accorded and probation denied, set aside the .sentence as too severe. See also United States v. Frank, 245 F.2d 284, 288 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 819, 78 S.Ct. 25, 2 L.Ed.2d 35 (1957); United States v.

Pronounced recidivism is almost universally agreed upon as a basis for referring a prisoner for psychiatric study. See, e. <em>g., </em>C. E.

No. ST/SoA/Ser. M/3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afh-dedup-1\">\u201cThe criminal career in itself often affords a good criterion [for referring a prisoner for mental examination]. Thus, the repetition of some special category of crime, the character of the recidivism (for example, the very frequent repetition of an offence) or the reaction of the offender to previous punishment will often direct attention to the offender in a way that will reveal the need for examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b995-19\">. If the judge thought Leach was raising an issue of incompetency or insanity, even as late as sentencing, it would have been .well to order a mental examination to avoid the necessity of a later \u00a7 2255 motion. See Mock v. United States, 329 F.2d 496 (6 Cir., 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b996-5\">. If a prisoner is found incompetent or mentally ill under \u00a7 24-301 (a), lie maybe treated on a short-term basis or even committed until cured. Section 24-301 (a) has generally been applied in but is not limited to cases in which insanity has failed as a defense or in which the defendant has pleaded guilty and his competency to undergo sentencing is at issue. See the discussion of the section by the Supreme Court in Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b996-6\">. Pew eases in this court, none recent, have dealt with the showing necessary under the statute (\u00a7 24-301 (a)) before sentencing. Apparently, defendants have not often raised the issue and this court has not often had occasion to review the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b996-7\">. 320 F.2d at 673 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b996-8\">. The dissent argues that the legislative history of \u00a7 24 \u2014 106 prevents Leach\u2019s referral under it. In making the Legal Psychiatric Services available to district judges, Congress was apparently concerned with the specific situation of the incompetent prisoner who desires to plead guilty. But the statute did not restrict the judges\u2019 use of the service to this specific situation. Bather, it made the service available to judges on the same basis as to probation officers, juvenile court officers, etc., \u201cto assist them in carrying out their duties.\u201d The fact is that prior to 1961, and since our first opinion herein, Leach v. United States (1963), <em>supra, </em>district judges were and are using the service to aid in a variety of sentencing problems. Letter to Chief Judge Ba-zelon from Dr. David A. Lanham, Chief of the Legal Psychiatric Services, dated March 25, 1964. Thus nothing in the statute itself or the practice under the statute prevented the judge from referring Leach to the Legal Psychiatric Services. Of course, the abuse of discretion was not the refusal to use the Legal Psychiatric Services in particular, but the failure to order a mental examination which was available through several facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b997-6\">.

The case is then submitted to us in Washington where it is again reviewed by our staff, and a letter written to the judge outlining what seems to us to he the pertinent points to be considered, the kind of treatment that we believe would be most effective in bringing about the offender\u2019s rehabilitation and what sentence we believe would be most fitting.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">.

I shall deal with each of the statutes stated by my colleagues to be authority for the granting of a psychiatric evaluation, the non-use of which they hold to be an abuse of discretion by the trial judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">In pertinent part this section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9i\">\u201c(a) Whenever a person is arrested, indicted, [or] charged by infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>mation * * * for or with an offense and, prior to the imposition of sentence * * * it shall appear to the court from the court\u2019s own observations, or from prima facie evidence submitted to the court, that the accused is of unsound mind or is mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, the court may oi*der the accused committed to the District of Columbia General Hospital or other mental hospital designated by the court, for such reasonable period as the court may determine for examination and observation * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The District Judge held, in effect, that it did not appear to him from his own observation, nor was there a <em>prima facie </em>showing, that appellant was of unsound mind or that he was \u201cmentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense,\u201d and the record sustains that view. Certainly the comment of the probation officer in the pre-sentence report was not sufficient evidence. His opinion was not that of an expert, and it is settled that opinion evidence by a lay witness is insufficient to establish <em>prima fade </em>that a defendant is mentally incompetent so as to require commitment for examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fact that the probation officer himself did not recommend that Leach be referred for examination indicated his actual belief that appellant was not mentally incompetent. Also, the reports of the New Jersey State Prison, compiled nine and twelve years prior to appellant\u2019s trial here, would be of little or no value for the purpose of establishing a <em>prima fade </em>showing of his mental condition at this. time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the final analysis, and as stated by counsel for appellant at the time of sentencing, there was no <em>prima facie </em>showing and \u201cthe only thing there was, was recidivism.\u201d According to prior holdings of this <em>court, </em>recidivism alone is insufficient to require the granting of a mental examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">On the basis of this statute, therefore, there can be no justifiable finding of improper exercise of discretion by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>judge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and consequently there are no grounds for vacating the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Rule 35 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-7\">\u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The court may reduce a sentence within 60 days after the sentence is imposed, or within 60 days after receipt by the court of mandate issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within 60 days after receipt of an order of the Supreme Court denying an application for a writ of certiorari.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">It is well established that the narrow function of Rule 35 is, as its wording makes clear, to permit <em>correction </em>of an <em>illegal </em>sentence, not to provide re-examination of other proceedings prior to imposition of sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, Rule 35 presupposes a valid conviction and affords the procedure for bringing an improper sentence (e. g., one in excess of the statutory maximum) into conformity with the law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, the rule vests the trial court with broad discretionary powers to reduce a sentence within 60 days of its imposition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the discretion of a judge in imposing sentence is virtually unassailable so long as the sentence is within the statutory limits,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the discretion involved in the use or non-use of the power to reduce such a sentence is <em>at least </em>equally removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>from appellate interference, if not more so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">The majority, however, point out that the period provided by Rule 35 may be used for psychiatric study of the prisoner for the purpose of a more informed resentencing, and hold that the non-use of this novel \u201ctechnique\u201d contributes to an abuse of discretion on the part of the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">In attempting to justify its position, the majority construes 18 U.S.C. 4208 (b)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to be an \u201cendorsement by Congress\u201d of a procedure for the referral of a prisoner for pre-sentence mental examination under Rule 35, and suggests that the force of this \u201cendorsement\u201d <em>required </em>the sentencing judge to follow this method here. Putting aside the matter of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in using Rule 35, which I feel precludes the majority\u2019s holding on this point, the position of the majority is otherwise wholly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">First, as noted in our earlier opinion,, <em>18 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>4208 does not apply to persons charged with or convicted of offenses under the District of Columbia-Code.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It follows that, Leach having-been convicted under D.C.Code \u00a7 22\u2014 2901, \u00a7 4208 has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">Second, the analogy between \u00a7 4208' and Rule 35, the asserted force of which is said to incorporate the statutory procedures into the discretionary 60-day provision of the Rule, is tortured at best'.. Both the wording and the legislative history of the entire section 4208 indicate that its primary concern is with the-<em>disparity </em>in the <em>length of sentences, </em>and', was clearly intended to encourage uniformity in the determination of parole eligibility dates at the time of sentencing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under subsection (a), the trial court, in its discretion, may designate-a minimum period, not to exceed the-maximum sentence, at the end of which; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the prisoner will be <em>eligible for parole. </em>In the alternative, the court, again in its discretion, may impose the maximum term and specify that the prisoner\u2019s \u25a0eligibility for parole will be determined \"by the parole board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Subsection (c) provides that if the prisoner is sentenced in either of the two ways provided in subsection (a), the Director of the Bureau of Prisons will conduct a complete study of the prisoner and .furnish the <em>parole board </em>with a summary of the findings. In the words of the court in Van De Bogart v. United States, 305 F.2d 583, 585 (5th Cir. 1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-6\">\u201c[T]he purpose of such study [under \u00a7 4208(c)] is <em>specifically confined to \u2018determining the suitability of the prisoner for parole.\u2019 \u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Under these provisions, therefore, juris\u2022diction in determining parole dates is \u25a0vested in the parole board, sentence having already been pronounced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consequently, no \u201cendorsement\u201d of <em>any </em>type \u25a0of court-ordered pre-sentence mental examination can be derived from this part of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Subsection (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-9\">\u201cIf the court desires more detailed information as a basis for determining the sentence to be imposed, the court <em>may </em>commit the \u25a0defendant to the custody of the Attorney General, which commitment shall be deemed to be for the maximum sentence of imprisonment prescribed by law * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Under this subsection the court is to be furnished, within three months, a complete report on the prisoner by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, at which time the court may, in its discretion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alb-dedup-0\">\u201c(1) Place the prisoner on probation as authorized by section 3651 of this title, or (2) affirm the sentence of imprisonment originally imposed, or reduce the sentence of imprisonment, and commit the offender under any applicable provision of law. * # * <em>ff</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-18\">On its face, as well as by virtue of its legislative history, this subsection also is primarily concerned with the <em>length </em>of sentences and the determination of <em>parole eligibility. </em>While there is no indication in the congressional consideration of the measures, nor any decided cases discussing the point, some writers and individual judges have felt that under \u00a7 4208 (b), prisoners may also be referred for study in order to determine whether psychiatric hospitalization rather than imprisonment is indicated<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The majority here, however, state that by virtue of the authority of a sentencing judge to refer for pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation under \u00a7 4208(b), Rule 35 also permits (in fact, requires) the same procedures. To my mind, the inference is a <em>non sequitur. </em>Perhaps the only characteristic common to both Rule 35 and \u00a7 4208(b) is their discretionary nature. Clearly suggesting some of the many distinctions between \u00a7 4208(b) and Rule 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>is the language of the Supreme Court in United States v. Behrens, <em>supra </em>note 2, at p. 165 of 375 U.S., at 296 of 84 S.Ct., 11 L.Ed.2d 224:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-7\">\u201cThe whole point of using \u00a7 4208 (b) is, in its own language, to get \u2018more detailed information as a basis for determining the sentence <em>to be imposed </em>* * *.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.) It is only after the Director of the Bureau of Prisons makes his report that the court makes its final decision as to what the sentence will be. Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifically requires that the defendant be present \u2018at every stage of the trial including * * * the imposition of sentence * * *.\u2019 It is true that the same rule provides that a defendant\u2019s presence is not required when his sentence is reduced under Rule 35. <em>But a reduction of sentence under Rule 35 is quite different from the final determination under </em>\u00a7 <em>4208 (b) of what a sentence is to be. </em>Rule 35 refers to the power of a court to reduce a sentence which has already become final in every respect. There is no such finality of sentence at a \u00a7 4208(b) preliminary commitment. The use of \u00a7 4208(b) <em>postpones </em>action as to the final sentence ; by using that section the court decides to await studies and repoi\u2019ts of a defendant\u2019s background, mental and physical health, etc., to assist the judge in making up his mind as to what the final sentence shall be. It is only then that the judge's final words are spoken and the defendant\u2019s punishment is fixed. It is then that the right of the defendant to be afforded an opportunity to make a statement to the judge in his own behalf is of most importance. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">I cannot agree that \u00a7 4208(b) and Rule 35 are related in such a fashion that the procedures of one are attributable to the other, nor that such an <em>inference, </em>even if <em>logically </em>proper, could provide a basis for a finding of abuse of discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">D.C.Code \u00a7 24-106</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">This statute provides in part for \u201ca qualified psychiatrist and a qualified psychologist whose services shall be available to <em>* * </em>* (1) In criminal cases, the judges of the district court * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">The majority coxrrectly observes that the statute leaves to the discretion of the trial judge when such services shall be employed. However, the majority position that the txdal judge\u2019s non-use of this \u201cavailable service\u201d in this case constituted an abuse of discretion is unwarranted, unpx*ecedented, and contrary to the wording and intent of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-17\">Title 24-106 was originally enacted by Congress in 1953<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as part of an omnibus crime bill for the District of Columbia. As initially enacted, the section established and made available psychiatric and psychological services to \u201c(1) the px-obation officers of the district court and the municipal court * * In 1954 the section was amended<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to make the services (originally intended only for the assistance of probation officers, the Department of Corrections and the Board of Parole) available to District Court judges<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>in those few cases where a defendant desires to enter a pretrial plea of guilty and the judge entertains some doubt that the defendant is mentally competent to do so. </em>That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>amendment was enacted for this restricted purpose is unquestionable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Ironically, the greatest hesitation on the part of Congress in the passage of this amendment was its concern that the psychiatric personnel would be called upon too much by trial judges and that, as a consequence, the services provided for by the 1953 Act would be unduly diverted from the Parole Board and others for whom it was originally intended. In the words of the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-5\">\u201cThe committee has been assured that the district court judges would use the medical personnel as authorized by the bill in only a limited number of cases, such as cases where, before accepting a plea of guilty, the judge feels in fairness to the accused he should be advised as to the mental capacity of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cUnless the services of the psychiatrist and the psychologist authorized by section 405 are sparingly used by the district court judges, the primary purpose for which the section was enacted will have been defeated. * * *\u201d S.Rep. No. 1779, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">And the House Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-15\">\u201cSeveral of the members of the committee felt that, if the bill were amended to include the language proposed by the United States attorney, there might be some abuses. The judiciary of the District of Columbia assured the members of this committee that the provisions of this bill would be administered with extreme caution. This assurance was made to the members of the House District Committee by the chairman of the subcommittee which handled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>the bill, in which he read the contents of a letter addressed to him by a member of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1816, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Contrary to the congressional intent, and in complete disregard of the assurances of the District Court and others to Congress, this court now implies that \u00a7 24-106 <em>compels </em>a judge, on the request of a convicted defendant, to refer him for a mental examination prior to sentencing. In effect, this court is directing the District Court to act in a manner certain to divert the efforts of the Legal Psychiatric Service from its proper function. Not only has Congress not left the purposes for which the Service personnel are available to the District Court open to speculation, it has indicated an intent flatly contrary to the overreaching view of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">It seems clear, therefore, that the \u201csources * * * from which to obtain [a psychiatric] evaluation\u201d stated to be available to \u201ca judge sentencing for a D.C.Code violation\u201d are actually not appropriate for the mental examination which the majority feels should have been granted this appellant. As we have seen, Rule 35 is inapplicable since it is acknowledged that the sentence was not illegal, and the trial judge\u2019s discretion to reduce the sentence was not exercised. Furthermore, the unambiguous purpose of the enactment of D.C.Code \u00a7 24-106 renders that statute inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">In view of the fact, tacitly admitted by the majority opinion, that no <em>prima facie </em>showing under \u00a7 24-301 was made, there seems to be no justification for the holding here other than a desire to review the sentence imposed in the District Court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Ignored is the 73-year history of undeviating federal precedents holding that an appellate court has no power to modify a sentence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In view of the actual result in this case, the statement \u201cWe do not question the general rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>an appellate court will not ordinarily review sentences that are within the statutory maximum\u201d has little redemptive value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">I agree with my colleagues that the sentencing of criminals should not be predicated on a wholly retributive concept, but I also think that it should not be limited to purely rehabilitative ends.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Additional considerations, including reformation, deterrence, and the protection of the public, are factors which must also be regarded.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> All of these, however, are considerations which the <em>trial judge </em>must weigh and decide, and our capacity as an appellate court does not permit the substitution of our judgment for that of the trial court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Congress has not given us the power to review sentences,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and I do not think we should have that power. The sentencing judge, who has heard the details of the crime, has observed the defendant at close range, and who is not dependent on a mere printed record, is in a better position to judge the matter of sentence than is an appellate court. It should be remembered also that the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>trict Judge here had the benefit of the probation officer\u2019s pre-sentence report.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">I think the District Judge in this ease fulfilled his duties, and I am afraid that the present disposition is an example of appellate judges applying their own ideas of what the law ought to be, and not what the law is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">APPENDIX TO DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The original majority opinion in this case contained no reference whatever to \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d In addition, page 10 of the original slip opinion has been amended to make reference, among other things, to Leach\u2019s \u201cfinancial ability\u201d and to the Loeb-Leopold case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This post-decision inclusion by the majority is so completely extraneous as to require no answer. Since, following this court\u2019s earlier remand, the original sentence was left undisturbed and no hearing was had, the matter of Leach\u2019s financial ability to offer \u201cpsychiatric or other information\u201d never presented itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Further than this, it is particularly unfortunate, in my opinion, to indicate by the language used that Leach suffered because of his \u201cfinancial ability.\u201d Such is not the case. He had the benefit, in his trial and on his two appeals here, of able counsel, who diligently protected his interests; and certainly Clarence Darrow (who kept the defendants in the Loeb-Leopold case from the electric chair) could have done no more than did counsel in this ease for Leach \u2014 all without compensation, and in the best traditions of our bar. In this connection, let me add that the bar of this court and of the District Court has always responded, at great sacrifice on their part and with great ability, to the many thousands of requests by the courts to represent indigent defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-17\">. United States v. Leach, 218 F.Supp. 271 (D.D.C.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b999-18\">. The majority\u2019s dictum that Leach was entitled to be present with counsel at the time of the reconsideration of the sentence, following the remand, is untenable. Cf. Corey v. United States, 375 U.S. 169, 84 S.Ct. 298, 11 L.Ed.2d 229 (1963) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>its companion case, United States v. Behrens, 375 U.S. 162, 84 S.Ct. 295, 11 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963); United States v. Rosanc, 326 F.2d 487 (3rd Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"AtHi\">This court\u2019s first opinion stated: \u201c[The case] should be remanded to the District Court for <em>reconsideration of the sentence. </em>It may be that on reconsideration <em>the sentence previously imposed will be undisturbed.\u201d </em>320 F.2d at 673. [Emphasis supplied.] On remand, Judge Curran stated: \u201cThis court has carefully <em>reconsidered the sentence imposed, </em>as suggested by the appellate court. * <em>* </em>* [T]ho sentence heretofore imposed by this court <em>will not be disturbed.\u201d </em>218 F.Supp. at 274. [Emphasis supplied.] It is manifest, therefore, that the status of the case on remand was one of an existing sentence subject to modification; the original sentence had not been vacated, and the District Judge\u2019s decision can in no way be construed as an imposition of a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Both White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963), and Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961) (on which the <em>White </em>case was premised), dealt only with an accused\u2019s right to counsel during pre-trial criminal procedures. The concern of those cases was the protection of the rights of an accused in a capital case, the court fearing that without \u201ccounsel at every step in the proceedings against [the accused] * * * he faces the <em>danger of conviction </em>because he does not know how to <em>establish Ms innocence.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.] 368 U.S. at 54, 82 S.Ct. at 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 114, quoting Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932). Those cases do not apply where, as here, the accused has already been convicted and, moreover, was present with counsel at the time of original sentencing. It cannot seriously be contended that one properly convicted of a crime has a right to a sentence other than the one imposed (assuming, of course, that the sentence imposed is within the limits allowable by statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1000-18\">.
