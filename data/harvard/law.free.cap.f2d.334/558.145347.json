In No. 17176, the appellant on May 17, 1962 filed his notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order of May 8,1962, which denied appellant\u2019s March 29, 1962 motion to reduce his death sentence to life imprisonment. The motion was based upon Public Law 87-423, <em>infra </em>note 8, and Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In No. 17177, the appellant on June 15, 1962 filed his notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order of June 8, 1962, which denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the sentence of death pronounced by trial Judge Letts on June 30, 1960. This latter motion, based upon Rule 35, asserted that the sentence was \u201cunauthorized by law.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">Indicted pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2401 (1951), the appellant on June 11, 1960 had been convicted of the murder of a police officer while appellant and his brother, Raymond S. Coleman, were perpetrating a robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time D.C. Code \u00a7 22-2404 (1951) provided that the \u201cpunishment of murder in the first degree <em>shall be death </em>by electrocution\u201d (emphasis added), and on June 30, 1960, the trial judge pronounced sentence accordingly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After <em>en banc </em>consideration of Coleman\u2019s appeal, this court on Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tember 8, 1961 affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court on March 5, 1962.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rehearing was denied on April 2, 1962.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the appellant\u2019s 1960 death sentence was mandatory, final and unreviewable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A reduction of that sentence to life imprisonment might thereafter have been available only by Executive clemency except for possible relief under an intervening Act of Congress which became effective March 22, 1962, and which gives rise to questions hereinafter considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The amendatory Act, Public Law 87-423,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the main spoke prospectively in prescribing the death penalty unless a jury by unanimous vote should recommend life imprisonment. If the jury should fail to agree as to punishment, the trial judge was authorized to impose \u201ceither a sentence of death * * * or life imprisonment.\u201d But Congress was aware that there were pending various cases <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in which we had affirmed convictions of murder in the first degree wherein death sentences had already been imposed, the execution of which had been stayed pending exhaustion of appellate remedies. Separate provision was therefore made respecting such cases \u201ctried prior to March 22, 1962\u201d as to which relief might become available by action of the judge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">On March 29, 1962, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. Following Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 and based upon the proviso of the amendatory Act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the motion invok<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ed exercise of the court\u2019s discretion \u201cupon consideration of the circumstances in mitigation and in aggravation.\u201d However, the motion was addressed simply to points which had already been considered and settled upon direct appeal. The motion alleged, for example, that of \u201cprime importance\u201d was the existence of a \u201creasonable doubt as to the legal correctness of defendant\u2019s conviction of first degree murder.\u201d In furtherance of that theme, the motion raised a question of the appropriateness of an instruction as to murder in the second degree. It was suggested as a matter of legislative history that Congress had deemed appropriate here a sentence of life imprisonment on the <em>facts of the crime </em>as committed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Counsel so argued the motion, and the Government joined issue in the same tenor, but concluded it was making no \u201crecommendation as to sentence in this case, but only points out that the argument made by the defense motion from the evidence does not have merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The motion contained no allegation of fact and no proffer<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of testimony as to other \u201ccircumstances\u201d which might have tended to mitigate the sentence. To be sure, the statute before us contained no requirement that the \u201ccircumstances\u201d to be relied upon must be presented by the testimony of witnesses examined in open court as had been true of the Oklahoma statute before the Court in Williams v. Oklahoma.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There, a post-conviction inquiry by the Court as to punishment was to be predicated upon the \u201csuggestion of either party that there are circumstances which may be properly taken into view, either in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Oklahoma court had held that the prisoner \u201cwaived\u201d the benefit of the statutory proceedings by failing to request a hearing. Since the petitioner had not requested or suggested that the trial court hear evidence in mitigation of the sentence, the Supreme Court of the United States found no deprivation of right or of fundamental fairness in the failure of the trial court to pursue the presentenc-ing procedures prescribed by the Oklahoma statutes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It would come with poor grace, to say the least, if the post-conviction successor judge in our unique situation were to be criticized for proceeding to decide the motion to reduce sentence on the only basis upon which it was proffered to and argued before him. He ruled in accordance with our earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>opinion<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> on the merits, that the points urged upon him had been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">But he need not have been so limited in view of the purpose of the statute as Congress clearly intended it to be applied as to sentences imposed before its effective date. The appellant\u2019s death sentence when imposed in 1960 was \u201cmandatory,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> with no opportunity for a showing of mitigating circumstances, no matter what the claims might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Under that 1962 proviso, however, the judge was authorized to ascertain whether or not a sentence of life imprisonment might be justified, and if so, that sentence was to carry a minimum imprisonment of twenty years. Whereas in cases charging murder in the first degree <em>after </em>March 22, 1962, a jury was authorized to recommend life imprisonment,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as to the appellant\u2019s case a \u201cprocedure\u201d was \u201cestablished whereby\u201d <em>the judge </em>was \u201cto consider the circumstances in mitigation and in aggravation.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">We can not suppose that a judge in considering circumstances in mitigation was intended to be more narrowly restricted than the jury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We know at once that matters entirely apart from the evidence at a trial may and frequently do \u2014 and in proper cases should \u2014 affect the punishment to be accorded once the issue of guilt has been resolved, as it had been here. Rule 32(c) provides for a pre-sentence report and specifies its scope to include such information as may be required by the court and \u201cbe helpful in imposing sentence.\u201d Rule 32(a) provides that the defendant shall be afforded \u201can opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d While the facts of the crime are not without bearing, the purpose of the proviso of the amendatory Act was directed to the possible existence of circumstances in mitigation, not of the <em>crime, </em>per se, but of punishment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Further to implement the procedure established by the proviso and in aid of the congressional purpose, it is clear the judge was not circumscribed in the inquiry he was intended to make. By the same token previously discussed, he was free to consider circumstances in aggravation. The task of the judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">\u201cis to determine the type and extent of punishment after the issue of guilt has been determined. Highly relevant \u2014 if not essential \u2014 to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics. And modern concepts individualizing punishment have made it all the more necessary that a sentencing judge not be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">To recapitulate, Congress by the pertinent portion of Public Law 87-423 intended to create a mechanism here applicable to a previously convicted murderer by which the judge might determine whether the case \u201cjustifies a sentence of life imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Congress unlike various state legislatures did not adopt a \u201ctwo-trial\u201d statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Bather, Congress chose to rely upon the experience, training and expertise of the judge who was to make the appropriate determination \u201cin his sole discretion\u201d\u2014 that is, sitting without a. jury. The legislative procedure clearly was to be pursued in light of the congressional intent, and due process considerations required an appropriate inquiry as to all factors bearing upon the \u201cfateful choice of sentences.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Since such a hearing; was not held, we deem the error material. Under Buie 52(b) we must reverse-on this ground<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> despite the deficiency,, indeed the absence, of factual allegation in the motion for reduction of sentence as presented in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Trial Judge Letts who had pronounced sentence in 1960, retired on June 1, 1961 at the age of 86. Thereafter, except for previously assigned matters involving his sitting as a \u201cspecial judge,\u201d he undertook no new assignments. Appellant has here for the first time contended that no judge other than trial Judge Letts was competent to hear and act upon his motion to reduce sentence, filed in March, 1962. Neither in that motion for reduction of sentence nor in his later motion to vacate sentence <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> was there a challenge by the appellant to the <em>authority </em>of Judge McGarraghy to consider the post-conviction motions. Only in his reply to the Government\u2019s answer to the motion to reduce-was there a reference to that point. There he argued that even if the motion to reduce sentence were being considered by the judge who had presided at trial, it would be \u201cquestionable\u201d for the judge to consider the \u201cfacts\u201d as set up in the Government\u2019s answer. It was asserted that Judge Letts \u201cdid not sit as a trier of fact.\u201d Accordingly appellant contend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ed that where a successor judge was to hear the motion, it would seem \u201cclearly unreasonable\u201d were such findings to be made by a judge \u201cwho did not preside at the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 25 clearly contemplates that if by reason of absence from the District, death, sickness or other disability the judge before whom the defendant has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court after a verdict or finding of guilt, any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court may perform those duties. The record shows that Chief Judge McGuire ascertained from Judge Letts \u201cthat he was disabled from proceeding\u201d with reference to the appellant\u2019s motion. Thus the motion was referred to Judge McGarraghy pursuant to Rule 25 and in accordance with the District Court\u2019s practice.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Had Judge McGarraghy\u2019s authority so to act been challenged in the District Court, it is possible that in essential respects, the record might have been more complete. Appellant\u2019s attack in this court not only comes too late, but we find no occasion to look behind the pronouncement in Judge McGarraghy\u2019s opinion that he deemed himself competent to act pursuant to Rule 25. There was no suggestion to Judge McGarraghy that he not sit because not himself \u201csatisfied that he cannot perform those duties\u201d devolving upon him as a successor to the trial judge, either because he had not presided at the trial or \u201cfor any other reason.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">There is nothing in the amendatory Act to suggest that \u201cthe judge\u201d who might be asked to <em>consider a post-trial </em>motion for relief must be the trial judge and no other. Appellant on brief here tells us that the instant record showed factors which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">\u201camply afforded an adequate basis for granting appellant\u2019s motion without need to resolve the conflicting testimony bearing on whether the homicide was accidental. It would accordingly have been proper for the successor judge to have granted the motion for reduction of sentence on the basis of his examination of the record; and appellant, of course, would have no standing to complain of such a decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">We quite agree there was no longer a \u201cneed to resolve\u201d conflicts in the testimony. The jury had done so. We further agree that the appellant would have no basis to complain of a favorable decision. The appellant equally lacks \u201cstanding\u201d at this point in the proceedings to challenge Judge MeGarraghy\u2019s qualifications to render his decision, for there was no question on this record which turned upon the credibility of controverted testimony.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The plain fact is there had been no post-trial showing by the appellant in mitigation or by the Government in aggravation which, taken together with all \u201ccircumstances,\u201d might have had an effect upon the sentence. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon his interpretation of the applicability of Rule 25 is totally lacking in substance. Judge Mc-Garraghy was not disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">As here, the appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the sentence of death upon constitutional grounds <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> was extensively argued before the District Judge where counsel said: \u201cWe are not challenging the conviction in this argument.\u201d Rather, counsel insisted that the <em>sentence </em>imposed by Judge Letts \u201cwent beyond that authorized by the verdict.\" He contended that under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 the sentence of death was illegal and therefore should have been reduced to life imprisonment. It was submitted that the provisions of the federal stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(b), should have governed and should have been applied.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We do not agree, for the federal statute clearly is designed to apply within \u201cthe special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d which, in turn, is defined, as here pertinent, in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(3).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The prosecution here went forward pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2401 (1951), 54 STAT. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The robbery had its inception in a liquor store wherein were located police officers who immediately commenced pursuit of the appellant across a public street in the District of Columbia. It was in the course of that pursuit that the police officer was murdered in a nearby alley, as detailed in our opinion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The area by no tenable construction can be said to have been within \u201cthe special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d This court had occasion to consider and reject a not dissimilar contention in Johnson v. United States <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Supreme Court on appeal noted that the 1897 statute which conferred authority on a jury to qualify its verdict and which had been held applicable to the District of Columbia in Winston v. United States,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> had been deleted from the District Code, effective January 1, 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Court held, in short, that the federal statute and the District Code were separate instruments. It was pointed \u25a0out that the effect of the \u201cseparation is important and necessarily had its purpose.\u201d The opinion went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR0s\">\u201cThe Codes had in the main special spheres of operation, and provisions accommodated to such spheres. There is certainly nothing anomalous in punishing the crime of murder differently in different jurisdictions. It is but the application of legislation to conditions. But if it be anomalous, very little argument can be drawn from it to solve the questions in controversy. The difference existed for a number of years between the District and other places under national jurisdiction, for, as we have seen, the qualified verdict has not existed in the District since the enactment of the District Code, and did not exist when the Criminal Code was enacted. There is certainly nothing in the mere act of enacting that code which declares an intention to give to the provision conferring power on a jury to qualify their verdict greater efficacy against the Code of the District than the same provision in the act of January 15, 1897, possessed.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">The Court, in different context but nonetheless cogently, reemphasized the distinctive position of the District of Columbia in matters of criminal law in Griffin v. United States.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> There the Court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-14\">\u201cThis Court, in its decisions, and Congress, in its enactment of statutes, have often recognized the appropriateness of one rule for the District and another for other jurisdictions so far as they are subject to federal law. Thus, the \u2018federal rule\u2019 in first-degree murder cases is that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>unless the jury by unanimous vote agrees that the penalty should be death, the court must fix the sentence at imprisonment for life. 35 Stat. 1151, 1152, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 567, now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 (1948), Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740. But a defendant convicted of first-degree murder in the District cannot look to the jury to soften the penalty; he must be given the death sentence. 31 Stat. 1321, 43 Stat. 799, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2404, Johnson v. United States, 225 U.S. 405. Furthermore, the Court\u2019s decision in Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, makes clear that when we refused to reverse the Court of Appeals for the District we were not establishing any \u2018federal rule\u2019 in interpreting the murder statutes which apply in places other than the District of Columbia over which Congress has jurisdiction. In fact, this Court has been at pains to point out that \u2018Congress * * * recognized the expediency of separate provisions\u2019 pertaining to criminal justice applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia in contradistinction to the Criminal Code governing offenses amenable to federal jurisdiction elsewhere. Johnson v. United States, 225 U.S. 405, 418.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The trial judge fully considered and sufficiently dealt with the contentions in such respects, as the record shows. He correctly concluded that the prosecution and the sentence had been predicated upon the provisions of the District Code. In his denial of the motion to vacate sentence there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Because the amendatory Act of 1962 was unique and its applicability to this ease was a matter of first impression in the District Court, we have extensively explored its impact. We remand only that the judge may conduct an inquiry and the appellant be afforded a hearing pursuant to and as discussed in Part I,. <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Remanded for further proceedings-consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\">. Appellant alleged that the first degree murder sentence should have been determined pursuant to 18 TJ.S.O. \u00a7 1111(b) (1958), rather than under D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2404 (1951); and further, that imposition of the death sentence under the latter section was \u201cconstitutionally impermissible and in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-24\">. Appellant alone, was convicted of the \u201cfelony murder.\u201d Both men were found guilty of the robbery. Raymond S.

In our opinion which appears at 111 U.S.App.D.C. 210, 295 F.2d 555 (1961), various contentions advanced by the appellant received detailed consideration. Importantly it may be noted that the minority held the view that the trial judge should have submitted an instruction on second degree murder. The majority concluded that such an instruction may be justified only when there is evidence of record which will support a finding of guilt in respect to a lesser offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. 369 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 689, 7 L.Ed.2d 613; Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stewart were of the opinion that cer-tiorari should have been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">.

United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 327 F.2d 867, 876-878 (1963) <em>(en banc) </em>(concurring opinion).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b614-13\">BURGER and McGOWAN, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"aef-dedup-0\">concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">We concur in the remand, but we can find no basis in this record, read in light of the statute and its legislative history, to support reversal on the ground upon which the majority relies. We think a remand necessary only because appellant was not affirmatively tendered an opportunity to speak on his own behalf. Although the point was not raised on appeal, it cannot be ignored in a capital case, which affords a special status to the right of allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">Appellant, represented by counsel highly experienced in criminal matters, had an unlimited opportunity to present to the District Court in mitigation whatever information, evidence or argument he desired. We can see no difference between this and the undefined \u201ceviden-tiary hearing\u201d now directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">We are, of course, dealing here with the special provisions of a statute, 22 D.C.Code ANN. \u00a7 2404 (Supp. II 1963), addressed by Congress to those cases in which unexecuted death sentences had been imposed in the District of Columbia before the change in the law eliminating the mandatory character of this particular punishment. 22 D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 2404 (1961). We find no mystery as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u25a0the process which Congress intended \u25a0should be employed in these circumstances. Upon motion made pursuant to the amendatory Act, the District Court was to hold a hearing in order to be able to exercise an informed discretion in determining whether the sentence should be the death sentence already imposed \u25a0or life imprisonment. At such hearing the District Court was to listen \u25a0to all representations seriously advanced ~vvith respect to the alternatives; to receive all relevant evidence tendered; and thereafter to choose between the two \u2022available sentences. Our reading of the record fails to disclose that the District 'Court departed from this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">At a hearing in open court, the District Judge very carefully refused to begin until appellant himself was present. Counsel for appellant, obviously sensitive to his grave responsibility, made a long \u2022and impressive statement which incorporated significant factual information relating to appellant\u2019s personal life and \u00a1background. Counsel was not restricted in any way, either as to the length or content of his argument. Had he chosen to offer corroborative matter by way of \u2022documentary or testimonial evidence, nothing in the record indicates that it would not have been received. We do not intend any criticism of counsel for not having proffered such evidence; it was his responsibility to decide what should be presented. His statements about the facts of appellant\u2019s life and background were unchallenged. Further, in this as in other areas of our jurisprudence, the client\u2019s protection must depend primarily upon his attorney\u2019s strategic wisdom and tactical .skill \u2014 his familiarity with all the facts, good and bad, from which his presentation may be drawn. Counsel was here engaged in the most sobering effort at persuasion that can devolve upon any lawyer. The majority opinion, by implication at least, seems to suggest that appellant will be better served if the District Court actively undertakes the conception and development of this effort. We doubt this; and, in any event, Congress has not directed judicial intervention of this nature by the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">When Coleman was first sentenced by Judge Letts on June 30, 1960, after verdict and judgment of guilty for first degree murder, the District Court was bound by the then existing mandatory death sentence. 22 D.C.Code Ann \u00a7 2404 (1961).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before imposing the mandatory death sentence required by law, Judge Letts, pursuant to Rule 32 (a), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allowed appellant to make a statement, but it is clear that, under the mandatory statute then controlling, such statement could not have influenced the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">On March 22, 1962, Congress amended the D.C.Code to provide alternatives to the death sentence for subsequent first degree murder convictions. 22 D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 2404 (Supp. II 1963). See Jones v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. --, 327 F.2d 867, 870-871 (1963). This Act provided further that as to cases tried prior to March 22, 1962, which are before the court for resentencing, \u201cthe judge may, <em>in his sole discretion, </em>consider circumstances in mitigation and in aggravation and make a determination as to whether the case in his opinion justifies a sentence of life imprisonment, in which event he shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.\u201d 22 D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 2404 (Supp. II 1963). (Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>phasis added.) In Jones v. United States, <em>supra, </em>we held that sentences imposed prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act were not vacated by that Act; however, we stated that \u201cshould [the judge] decide that life imprisonment was appropriate he was to resentence appellant * * 327 F.2d at 871. Thus \u201cresentencing\u201d would occur only when the original sentence is altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On March 22, 1962, the effective date of the amendatory Act, appellant filed in the District Court a motion styled \u201cMotion For Reduction Of Sentence To Life Imprisonment\u201d pursuant to the \u201cresen-tencing\u201d provision of the amendatory Act and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. This was not an accurate characterization of a motion addi\u2019essed to the District Court\u2019s discretion under this statute, but the caption of a motion does not determine its essential nature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This motion, insofar as it was filed pursuant to Rule 35, was indeed one for reduction of sentence, in the sense that it sought a lesser sentence than death, but as to the amendatory Act it was a motion praying that the court \u201cconsider circumstances\u201d which might lead to resentencing appellant to life imprisonment. See Jones v. United States, <em>supra. </em>On May 4, 1962, the motion was argued before the District Court in appellant\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">Although appellant\u2019s attorney made extensive representations on appellant\u2019s behalf, he did not request that appellant be allowed to speak. Notwithstanding this, we believe that judicial policy calls for an opportunity for appellant to speak; when so much is at stake, \u201c[t]he most persuasive counsel may not be able to speak for a defendant as the defendant might, with halting eloquence, speak for himself.\u201d Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 304, 81 S.Ct. 653, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961). Although the particular statute under which the District Court\u2019s discretion was invoked does not expressly provide for a right of allocution, it is probable that Congress, in light of the historic standing of allocution \u2014 particularly in capital cases \u2014 and its more modern codification in Rule 32(a), passed the amendatory Act with the expectation that allocution would be accorded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Moreover, this court, pursuant to its supervisory powers, has directed that under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a) a sentencing judge in all cases must address an inquiry directly to a defendant in order \u201cto afford him a personal opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf, which might include information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d Couch v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 294, 235 F.2d 519, 521 (1956) (per curiam).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The Supreme Court has since approved this rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Literally read, of course, <em>Couch </em>and the Supreme Court cases apply only to sentencing, and, although consideration whether or not to resentence appellant to life imprisonment is not strictly a \u201csentencing\u201d process, it seems to us that the rationale of those cases applies with equal force here. Viewed realistically, the hearing presented appellant\u2019s first meaningful opportunity to be heard personally by way of a plea for leniency, since this was the first occasion when he was before a judge who had any choice as to sentence on the first degree murder conviction. Thus, at this point, before the District Judge decided whether to allow the prior sentence of death to stand or to resentence appellant to life imprisonment, appellant had not only his first but his last opportunity to make, in his own behalf, some statement that might influence the decision of the District Judge on the death sentence. The Supreme Court said recently, although in another context: \u201cIt is only [when final sentence is determined] * * that the judge\u2019s final words are spoken and the defendant\u2019s punishment is fixed. It is then that the right of the defendant to be afforded an opportunity to make a statement to the judge in his own behalf is of most importance. * * * This right [of allocution] would be largely lost * * * if for administrative convenience the defendant were not permitted to invoke it when the <em>sentence that counts </em>is pronounced.\u201d United States v. Behrens, 375 U.S. 162, 165-166, 84 S.Ct. 295, 297 (1963). (Emphasis added.) And as Mr. Justice Harlan said, concurring in the same case: \u201cEven if he has spoken earlier, a defendant has no assurance that when the time comes for final sentence the district judge will remember the defendant\u2019s words in his absence and give them due weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>375 U.S. at 168, 84 S.Ct. at 298 (concurring opinion) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Having in mind, as we have noted, that Coleman\u2019s exercise of his right to speak before Judge Letts imposed sentence was pointless because the statute then controlling required the death penalty, we conclude that Coleman has not yet been afforded the meaningful opportunity contemplated by prior opinions to address himself personally to the court empowered to make the decision \u201cthat counts.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">.
