Our examination of the record reveals evidence from which the jury could conclude that a burglary within the meaning of the policy definition occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">It is likewise clear that whether the insured was guilty of fraud or false swearing, which under its terms made the policy void, was properly a question for jury determination.

Co., 5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">The other asserted errors having been examined and found to be without merit, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-17\">. The policy defined burglary for the purposes of the policy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-18\">\u201c5. Burglary: The term burglary shall mean the felonious taking of property from within a building or room by a person who has made a felonious entry into the building or room by force or violence, of which there are visible marks by tools or explosives at the place of such entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
