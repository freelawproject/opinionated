Subsequent to these tragic events, Congress enacted amendments to the Food and Drug Act greatly widening the powers of the Secretary to adopt regulations pertaining to interstate distribution and sale of new drugs. The new amendments also authorized promulgation of regulations for exempting from the new drug application requirements drugs intended solely for investigational use by experts. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355, as amended October 10, 1962. Public Laws 87-781, \u00a7 103(b), 76 Stat. 783, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Among the important provisions of the 1962 Amendments were provisions which placed upon the applicant the burden of establishing that the drug proposed to be distributed in interstate commerce was safe for human use, and requiring testing prior to approval of such new drug application, with the power extended to the Secretary to require tests on animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Petitioners had been manufacturing the \u201cU\u201d Series Drugs and testing them on Mongoloid children under medical supervision for some eleven years prior to the adoption of the 1962 Amendments. On June 5, 1963, they filed \u201cNotice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(i), as .amended October 10, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">On September 30 the Commissioner of Food and Drugs wrote petitioners notifying them of \u201cinadequacies\u201d in their \u201cNotice of Claimed Investigational Exemption\u201d for the \u201cU\u201d Series Drugs. Among other asserted deficiencies there were these entries: \u201cNo animal data are submitted. There is an inadequate amount of reporting of clinical data. * * No real plan is submitted.\u201d The letter required correction of the inadequacies within ten days of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">This was followed on November 26 by a letter from the Commissioner to petitioners notifying them: \u201cThe conditions of exemption have not been met; and the exemption allowing clinical testing of the drug is terminated. You should immediately recall the drug from all clinical investigators and discontinue administering it to human beings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Subsequent thereto an informal conference was held in the office of the Assistant Commissioner, Winton B. Rankin, on Tuesday, December 17, 1963, between representatives of the Food and Drug Administration and the petitioners at which the controversy was reviewed at some length. At this conference the position of the Commissioner was reaffirmed by the representatives of the Food and Drug Administration who were present. Petitioners thereupon filed a petition in this court to review the decision of the Food and Drug Administration terminating the investigational exemption as conveyed in the Commissioner\u2019s letter of November 26, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Prior to initiation of this petition for review, petitioners had also filed and then withdrawn a New Drug Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Respondent Food and Drug Administration moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that' 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(h), relied upon by petitioners as establishing their right of appeal to this court, did not in fact confer jurisdiction upon this court in relation to withdrawal of an exemption for investigational distribution of a drug. Respondent asserts that said section grants a right to appeal only from an order of the Food and Drug Administration approving or disapproving a New Drug Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">After briefing of the question involved and oral argument thereon, this court has concluded that the government\u2019s motion to dismiss should be granted. It is our interpretation of the 1962 Amendments to the Food and Drug Act that the right of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals granted by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(h) applies only to an order of the Secretary refusing or withdrawing approval of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>application for sale and distribution of a new drug. The denial of investigational exemption does not prohibit the processing of an- application for distribution and sale of a new drug through the statutorily-provided hearing and final administrative order called for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Essentially, petitioners contend before us that requiring them to proceed with the New Drug Application and hearing prior to judicial review is a futile exercise, since they contend denial is a foregone conclusion. The answer to this is that by proceeding through the New Drug Application procedure and \u25a0 hearing, an adequate record for review will be developed in accordance with the congressional intent. The statute appears to us to contemplate appeal to the courts only after exhaustion of the administrative remedies and entry of a final administrative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that subsection (h) upon which petitioners rely is placed immediately following the subsections dealing with applications for distribution of new drugs, and immediately prior to the section providing for exemptions of drugs for research.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">As bearing on congressional intent in this regard, we also note that the first sentence of subsection (i) pertains to \u201cExemption of drugs for research\u201d and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-7\">\u201cThe Secretary shall promulgate regulations for exempting <em>from the operation of the foregoing subsections of this section </em>drugs intended solely for investigational use by experts * * (Emphasis added.) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Subsection (h), which contains the appeal procedure, is one of the \u201cforegoing subsections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">As bearing on the questions posed by this appeal, we also note that the Food and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations granting a prompt hearing in the event the applicant' desires to protest a rejection by them of his New Drug Application as inadequate or incomplete.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-12\">\u201c\u00a7 130.5 Reasons for refusing to file applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-13\">\u201c(d) if an applicant disputes the finding that his application is incomplete or inadequate, he may make written request to file the application over protest. In such case, the application shall be reevaluated, and within 30 days of the date of receipt' of such written request, the application shall be approved, or the applicant shall be given written notice of an opportunity for a hearing on the question whether the application is approvable.\u201d 21 C.F.R., Section 130.5(d), as revised June 20, 1963, 28 F.R. 6380.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">In the event a petitioner\u2019s New Drug Application is rejected on grounds of inadequacy of human investigational data, where an investigational exemption had previously been refused, it appears that the merits of such refusal could be a proper issue at the New Drug Application hearing and thus be preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">Such an interpretation of the statute and regulations appears to us also to be strongly suggested by the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">We conclude that the statute upon which petitioner relies does not grant a right of appeal from withdrawal of an investigational exemption, except by appeal from subsequent denial of a New Drug Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">The jurisdiction of the United States Courts of Appeal to review administrative acts of federal agencies is wholly dependent upon statute. American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board, 308 U.S. 401, 60 S.Ct. 300, 84 L.Ed. 347 (1940); United States v. Agne, 161 F.2d 331 (C.A. 3, 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">The petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
