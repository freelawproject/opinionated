United States, 3 Cir., 334 F.2d 469, a similar ease decided today by this court, is whether the mineral produced by the taxpayers\u2019 quarry during the taxable year 1953 qualifies for a 15 per cent depletion allowance as \u201cchemical grade limestone\u201d, or merely qualifies as \u201ccalcium carbonates\u201d for which a 10 per cent depletion allowance is authorized. See section 114(b) (4) (A) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Court applied the 10 per cent depletion rate and the taxpayers have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-19\">The taxpayers\u2019 limestone was suitable for use in agriculture to neutralize the acidity of soil, and much of it was so used. Such soil conditioning involves and depends upon a chemical reaction between the limestone and other substances in the soil. Here, as in the Lehigh Portland Cement case, the taxpayers\u2019 argument is that suitability for a use in which limestone reacts chemically with some other substance makes taxpayers\u2019 mineral \u201cchemical grade limestone\u201d. We rejected that argument in the Lehigh case and we reject it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-20\"> We think it is clear from the legislative history discussed in our Le-high opinion that Congress used the phrase \u201cchemical grade limestone\u201d to identify an unusually pure grade of limestone with very high carbonate content and very little of such impurities as silica, alumina and sulphur. Moreover, it was repeatedly pointed out during the legislative hearings that agricultural limestone is of the ordinary, relatively impure grade. For example, the following colloquy occurred between Congressman Jenkins and an industry witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8Wg\">\u201cMr. Jenkins: What is the grade of limestone that is used in farming * * * <em>\u2022&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-21\">\u201cMr. Dickey : It is the more common type of limestone, and the amount of silica in it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-22\">3 House Hearings, Revenue Revision of 1951,1569.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-23\">There also was uncontradicted testimony that the presence of more than 5% of impurities would prevent limestone from qualifying as \u201cchemical grade\u201d. On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>appeal, the taxpayers do not challenge the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the \u201cresults of various analyses made of the limestone (from taxpayers\u2019 quarry) indicate a range of from 79.27 per cent to 89.02 per cent calcium carbonate content, with an average of 84.38 per cent. In terms of combined carbonate content, the range was from 83.98 per cent to 93.6 per cent and the average was 88.3 per cent.\u201d Thus, taxpayers\u2019 limestone contains more than 10 per cent of impurities and has not been shown to qualify as \u201cchemical grade limestone\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
