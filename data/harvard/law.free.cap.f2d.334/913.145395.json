Ready-mix concrete was a material used in the construction. Hor-rocks Ready-Mix Concrete Company provided concrete at the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-27\">General Insurance Company of America was the insurer of Teller and Western Casualty &amp; Surety Company was the insurer of Horrocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>The operation of the delivery of the ready-mix at the construction site was as follows. Teller operated a crane to which was affixed a cable and bucket. Hor-rocks would drive a load of concrete to a point where the bucket could be lowered to allow concrete to flow from the truck to the bucket. After the bucket was filled it was hoisted and the concrete distributed from it to the place needed in the construction. At the time in question here a loaded truck arrived at the construction site and was spotted for unloading. One Korth, a state concrete inspector, climbed upon the truck to make an inspection of its contents. While so engaged, the bucket was lowered, and in the process thereof struck and injured Korth.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The operator of the crane with which the bucket was raised and lowered was an employee of Teller.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Korth brought suit in the state court of Idaho for damages, naming Teller, Horrocks, the crane operator, and the truck driver as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">General Insurance Company sought a declaration in the United States District Court that Western was obligated to furnish a defense in the state court action because of a provision in the insurance policy it <em>issued </em>to Horrocks on its truck, which provides, in effect, for liability in the event of injury caused by one using said truck with consent of the owner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Hence, the sole <em>issue </em>before us is: Was the crane operator \u201cusing\u201d the truck within the meaning of the omnibus clause of appellee\u2019s insurance contract? We think, as did the trial court, that the question requires a negative answer. To hold otherwise does not comport with any normal use of the word and is unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">In construing the meaning of the word \u201cusing\u201d as it is contained in the policy of insurance we look to the plain and ordinary sense in which the word is generally used. To support appellant\u2019s contention would require the view that a crane operator who merely sets a bucket behind a truck to receive concrete is using a truck, and further, that a crane operator who is in the process of setting a bucket behind a truck, which is not yet prepared to unload, is also using a truck. We cannot stretch the word \u201cusing\u201d to such lengths.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">If unloading had been in progress at the time of the accident, we cannot agree that the mere operation of the bucket was a \u201cuse\u201d of the truck by the crane operator. More basically, however, we are convinced that the unloading process had not yet begun at the time when Korth was injured. The engines on the cement truck had not been reversed and the unloading chute had not yet swung into position, both of which actions are necessary before the unloading of the truck is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Had the omnibus clause of the insurance contract extended coverage to those \u201cloading and unloading\u201d a vehicle, then perhaps the broader interpretation urged by appellant would be justified. See Connecticut Indemnity Co. v. Lee et al., 1 Cir., 168 F.2d 420; Pacific Automobile Ins. Co. v. Commercial Cas. Ins. Co., 108 Utah 500, 161 P.2d 423, 160 A.L.R. 1251; 160 A.L.R. 1259. Here, however, there is no \u201cloading and unloading\u201d clause; the contract merely contains the word \u201cusing\u201d. In these circumstances we are persuaded that the activity of the crane operator should not be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-8\">. The omnibus clause provides, in part: \u201cThe unqualified word \u201cinsured\u201d includes the named insured and also includes * * * (2) under coverages A and B, any person while using an owned automobile or a hired automobile and any person or organization legally responsible for tbe use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or with his permission. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
