He also alleged that his counsel informed the court that' appellant was hospitalized at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and that the court was aware of an attempted suicide by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">The motion incorrectly states what occurred on May 15 and May 17, 1961, the dates of arraignment. Defendant\u2019s attorney did not move the court for a psychiatric examination under \u00a7 4244. The only pre-trial motion before the court was one for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-17\">The colloquy between the appellant Wilkins\u2019 attorney, Mr. Leland H. Logan, the District Judge and Mr. William B. Jones, United States Attorney, and this court\u2019s comments are set forth in footnote one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The defendants were arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. The court asked each of the defendants whether he understood the charge against him, and each answered \u201cYes.\u201d The Court entered a plea of not guilty for each defendant, and both the District Attorney, Mr. Jones, and defense counsel, Mr. Logan, announced that they were ready for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The case went to trial on the following day, May 18, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The case commenced at ten o\u2019clock in the morning; the jury was impaneled, the Government made its opening statement, the defense reserving its opening statement, and two witnesses testified for the Government, Mallie C. Taylor and Sue Payne Bransford.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The case continued until noon and was recessed until 1:15, when defense counsel, Mr. Logan, moved to withdraw the plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty to the charges for each of the defendants. The court then questioned the defendants as to whether they desired to withdraw their plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty. Both of the defendants responded \u201cYes,\u201d and both stating that they had read the indictment, specifically entered a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-17\">The Court then asked the attorneys-if they had anything to say before sentence was pronounced. A pre-sentence report on each of the defendants was given to the Court by the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-18\">Mr. Logan made a plea for leniency for each of the defendants. As to Mr. Wilkins, he stated in particular that he had a good record, was regularly employed, and had served in the Navy in the South Pacific. Mr. Logan stated that on the morning of the day of the robbery, however, Wilkins, together with his co-defendant, had consumed about two and a half to three and a half pints of liquor. Each of the defendants was asked if he desired to make a statement. Defendant Wilkins\u2019 statement was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-19\"><em>\u201cI </em>understand the graveness of this mistake I made and I have made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>in this 46 years and I am sure if and when given an opportunity to society again that it will never happen again and what I have done will follow me the rest of my life in my knowledge.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Court sentenced each of the men to twenty years on the second count and the first count was nolle prossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">At no time between the appearance before the Commissioner and the sentence did defendant Wilkins or his attorney make a motion for psychiatric examination. Mr. Logan, appellant\u2019s counsel, in presenting his motion for a continuance, did state that he felt that by some form of psychiatric examination the sudden deviation from a normal course of good conduct could be cleared up.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Later, on June 20, 1961, Robert Barker Wilkins, through his attorney, Leland H. Logan, filed a motion for reduction of sentence, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, stating in part that prior to the sentencing by the court, the defendant\u2019s attorney had submitted a statement from Dr. William R. McCormick, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, which showed that appellant was suffering from Reynauds\u2019 Disease, the effect of which can and often does bring about the death of the patient. There was no mention made in the motion, either about mental incompetency, or that the appellant did not understand the nature of the charge against him, or could not assist counsel in preparation and defense in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">This motion was heard on July 10, and testimony was taken as to the physical condition of Robert Barker Wilkins. The court denied this motion by an order made on July 10, 1961 and entered July 11, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Thereafter, on May 25, 1962, defendant filed his <em>first </em>motion under Section 2255, Title 28 U.S.C. for leave to file a petition to vacate sentence and leave to file and to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">This motion raised three questions: (1) whether or not the sentence should be vacated since he was insane before, during and after the sentence; (2) whether or not the sentencing court improperly denied petitioner\u2019s request for a psychiatric examination, and if so, whether <em>nunc pro tunc </em>determination of his mental competency should be made; and (3) whether or not the petitioner was entitled to a hearing conducted in open court, and opportunity to submit testimony and other evidence upon his averments of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">The court in a two and a half page memorandum dated October 10,1962, and entered October 11, 1962, denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court found that a period of five months elapsed from the commission of the crime until the charge was made by the grand jury, and that the defendants appeared with their counsel and to all appearances were normal and fully aware of the proceedings. They were represented by experienced and competent counsel, who announced he was ready for trial, and after the trial had progressed, defendants moved to withdraw their plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty. The significance and import of this step were fully discussed, and before sentence was imposed they were given an opportunity, and their counsel was given an opportunity, to make statements to the court. The court further found that defendant\u2019s motion filed June 20, 1961, made no representation or suggestion that Robert Barker Wilkins was suffering from any mental disorder, and the court concluded that this was approximately seven weeks after the trial, and after the defendant had been committed to a Federal Penitentiary, where observation would naturally be made by the prison personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">The Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">On July 1, 1963, appellant Robert Barker Wilkins filed his <em>second </em>motion under Section 2255, Title 28 U.S.C., and Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to vacate and set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>sentence. Among other things, he alleged that on Page 4 of the Transcript of Plea, Arraignment and Disposition, counsel for the defendant raised the question of sanity, and specifically requested a psychiatric examination of defendant Wilkins; that at Page 6 of the record, counsel informed the Court that defendant Wilkins was hospitalized at Chattanooga, Tennessee; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the court was aware of the attempted suicide by the defendant; and finally that the present report included both the fact of his irrational behavior, and medical reports stating the movant was an alco-liolic. A pyschiatric examination and hearing were requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The motion incorrectly states what occurred on May 15 and May 17,1961. Respondent\u2019s attorney did not move the court for a psychiatric examination under \u00a7 4244. The only pre-trial motion before the court was for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The District Judge in a memorandum dated July 11, and entered July 13, 1963, \u25a0denied appellant\u2019s <em>second </em>motion made on July 1,1963, pointing out that Section '2255, Title 28, \u201cexpressly provides that the sentencing court is not required to \u25a0entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same ^prisoner.\u201d The court also pointed out that there was \u201cno new theory for the second motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">On August 1, 1963, appellant petitioned for permission to file notice of appeal and leave to proceed in forma pauperis, which petition was granted by an order dated and entered on September 12, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The ease is presently before this Court on the petition of August 1, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Diligent, appointed counsel asserted many reasons for reversal of the District Court\u2019s order of July 11, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, the general rule is that in every case when a motion is filed which sets forth grounds that constitute reasonable cause to believe that the defendant \u201cmay be presently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against- him or properly to assist in his own defense,\u201d Lebron v. United States (1955), 97 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 229 F.2d 16, 18, it is then mandatory for the District Court to have the defendant examined as to his mental condition by a qualified psychiatrist who is to report back to the court. Krupnick v. United States (CCA 8, 1959) 264 F.2d 213; United States v. Walker (CCA 6, 1962) 301 F.2d 211; Kenner v. United States (CCA 8, 1960) 286 F.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>When, however, the motion does not set forth grounds for reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may be insane or mentally incompetent, or when the motion appears with reasonable certainty to be frivolous, or made in bad faith, see Shelton v. United States (CCA 5, 1953), 205 F.2d 806, 815; Lebron v. United States, supra; and Behrens v. United States (CCA 7, 1962), 312 F.2d 223, 225, the motion can be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The present case is more in accord with Lebr\u00f3n v. United States, supra, where four Puerto Ricans, members of an anti-American party on the Island of Puerto Rico, planned a visit to the Capitol in Washington, and demonstrated for Puerto Rican independence by shooting at members of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">While two hundred forty-three Congressmen were engaged in voting on the floor of the House, they shot into the well of the House and five Congressmen were wounded. They were indicted and went to trial. The trial judge was charged with error in refusing to respond to associate defense counsel\u2019s statement made at the close of defendant\u2019s evidence, to appoint a psychiatrist and proceed under \u00a7 4244. The defense counsel\u2019s statement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cIf your Honor please, at this time it has occurred to us as counsel for these people, for these defendants, there is probably something mentally wrong with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201cWe are asking the Court at this time to have these people examined by psychiatrists other than those who Mr. Rover (the United States Attorney) had examine them. Because of the conversation, the testimony on the witness stand, and what the testimony was, their lack of remorse, their peculiar attitude towards this entire situation, that I am firmly convinced there is a strong probability that these people are mentally unstable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">District Judge Alexander Holtzoff was affirmed, in an opinion by Judge Wilbur K. Miller. The Circuit Court held that the grounds stated by the movant were slight and of little weight or importance, and thus were frivolous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">\u201cIt set forth no particulars and can be characterized as a statement of vague impressions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Previously in the case the Circuit Judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">\u201cThe motion in this ease, quoted above, fell short of meeting the statutory requirements as to the belief of the movant concerning the mental condition of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">Counsel did not say he had reason to-believe that petitioner \u201cmay be presently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or assist in his own defense.\u201d He merely stated that \u201cit has occurred to us * * * there is strong probability there is something mentally wrong with them, and I am firmly convinced that there is a strong probability these people are mentally unstable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-17\">\u201cWe do not mean to say a motion under \u00a7 4244 must be couched in the exact language of the statute; but it is insufficient unless its recital approximates the meaning of the statutory language. Cf. Perry v. United States, 1952, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 195 F.2d 37.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">In the instant case, defendant\u2019s attorney, Mr. Logan, did not make a motion-under Section 4244; on the contrary, he moved for a continuance and his motion, sounded more in the nature of a request for a continuance to investigate as to whether or not the defendants, particularly appellant, would have a defense of' insanity in the trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-19\">The contents of Mr. Logan\u2019s oral motion on May 17, 1961, fell short of the-statutory requirements, first, because it in fact was not a motion for appointment of a psychiatrist by the court, and\u2019 secondly, because it did not state particulars upon which it could reasonably be concluded that Wilkins was presently insane, or otherwise so mentally incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>petent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him, or to assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">On the contrary, the record discloses that appellant and his co-defendant each stated that they knew the nature of the charge made against them, had read the indictment, and that the defendants themselves later desired to change the plea from not guilty to guilty, this decision having been made during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">After the plea of guilty and before sentencing, the attorney for defendant Wilkins and each defendant made a statement to the Court. Upon the record in this ease, the District Judge was not in error in denying the post-trial motions. Defendants\u2019 guilt was clear, and defendant Wilkins\u2019 conviction must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-18\">. The case was called for arraignment on the return date of the indictment, May 15, 1961. The defendants appeared with their counsel, Leland H. Logan, of Bowling Green, Kentucky. At that time Mr. Logan advised the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-19\">\u201c * * * why to my mind and what I can find, with regard to Mr. Wilkins here, there is some question in my mind as to whether or not they were legally responsible and knew the conse\u25a0quences of their acts at the time it is supposed to have happened. I say that for this reason, that he himself has never been in a courtroom in his life (sic) for any reason at all and I do fieel that by some form of psychiatric examination, that we could at least clear this matter up and, as Your Hon- or knows, a competent, first-class psychiatrist is hard to obtain, it cannot be done on one day\u2019s notice, and in addition to that fact, the local physician here, Doctor William McCormick, has given me a short statement in which\u2014 well, I would rather your Honor just read it (handing document to the Court.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t think that statement, Mr. Logan \u2014 if you want to put it in the record you may \u2014 I don\u2019t think it would have anything to do with this particular motion for continuance. \u201cMR. LOGAN: X have no desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>place this in the record because that is another question on which I am not fully informed and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC2\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, it has nothing to do With his mental state nor does it have anything to do with \u2014 a condition of his feet there that should be given intensive treatment \u2014 but he does not say that he is not capable of being tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cMIt. LOGAN: Under the circumstances that is all I will offer in a formal motion for a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUDp\">\u201cMR. JONES: I might for the record, if the Court please, make one statement. These defendants have been at liberty since December 12th and have had sufficient time to prepare their defense. They knew it was coming and knew it was coming at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM-l\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am of the opinion that no showing has been made here to justify the Court to continue this case. It has been nearly six months. These matters are serious both to them and to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM1\">\u201cMR. LOGAN: I agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab4\">\u201cTHE COURT: And it shouldn\u2019t go over. While the indictment is only recently returned, it has been pending, they have been before the commissioner, and they know the nature of the-charge. There is nothing that they are not fully advised of and have been for many months. Now, the Court feels that on the present showing it would have to overrule your motion for a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acl\">\u201cMR. LOGAN: May I say this one more word? I don\u2019t like to take time of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjKq\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, that is what the Court is for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q\">\u201cMR LOGAN: Now, the Commissioner\u2019s record in this case was before Clarksville, as I understand, in Tennessee. Those same papers were later sent to Louisville and there was some delay in getting them back here to-Bowling Green. Now, then, this mam has been in the hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and those records have not been made available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2eN\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I suppose the only record there would be as far as; the Commissioner\u2019s papers were concerned if they were brought before the Commissioner and either had a formal hearing or waived\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afj-dedup-0\">\u201cMR LOGAN: It was waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-26\">(Tr. 4-7)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-14\">.
