Therefore, the \u2022order is reversed and the cause remanded, with instructions to enter an order discharging the applicant from custody under the sentence, but staying its effectiveness for 30 days to enable the state if it is so advised to take applicant before the state court in which his plea of guilty was entered for the imposition of valid sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
