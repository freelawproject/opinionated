To avoid this consequence, the result of the insured\u2019s admitted failure to pay premiums, appellant advances numerous theories, namely, that appellee incorrectly advised the insured that a cash payment was required to satisfy a premium payment; that appellee failed to give the required notice that outstanding loans and interest would equal or exceed the policy\u2019s loan value; that appellee failed to properly notify the insured of the payments necessary to avoid the lapse; and that ap-pellee should have applied equity in other policies owned by the insured to the payment of the premium in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">The thorough opinion of the district court, 230 F.Supp. 329 (S.D.N.Y.1963) analyzes the facts in considerable detail and applies the proper legal principles in rejecting each of appellant\u2019s theories. We affirm the- judgment dismissing the complaint on the basis of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
