Appellees Charron, who owned the vacant land between these two structures, contracted with appellee Dreyfuss, an architect, and with appellant Lesmark, Inc., a contractor, to construct a building thereon. After Les-mark began excavation, the party walls of both adjoining buildings sank, causing damage to floors, ceilings, elevator equipment, and other walls in those buildings, Pryce and Ash filed suit against the Charrons, Lesmark, and Dreyfuss, alleging that the defendants had negligently removed earth adjacent to and directly under the party walls. The Charrons, denying negligence on their part, cross-claimed against Lesmark for indemnification against any judgments which might be rendered in the principal action, and for costs and attorneys\u2019fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQng\">The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found that Lesmark\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 properties, and that the Charrons \u201cas owners * * * have a liability established in law.\u201d Judgments in favor of Pryce and Ash were awarded against the Charrons and Lesmark. Lesmark was held liable to the Charrons on the cross-claim for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"ArRv\">After the District Court denied Les-mark\u2019s motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, for remittitur, Lesmark filed a notice of appeal from the judgments against it. Thereafter the Charrons, who had not noted an appeal, satisfied the judgments against them when the District Court and this Court refused to stay , execution of those judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"aoz-dedup-0\">Pryce and Ash have moved to dismiss Lesmark\u2019s appeal against them as moot&gt; since their claims against Lesmark were released by the Charrons\u2019 pay-ment of the principal judgments. Pryce and Ash assert that Lesmark\u2019s rights will not be jeopardized by such a dismissal. We aeree- Lesmark is not harmed by any error in the principal judgments un^ess error is carried into the Char-rons\u2019 Judgment against Lesmark for in-demnification. Since ^ this ^ judgment is appealed, we can adjust it if circumstances require.</p>\n<p id=\"A7W\">jn jts appeai from the judgment in favor 0f the Charrons, Lesmark contends that the trial court erred (1) in holding the Charrons liable ,to the plaintiffs, and, therefore, in holding Lesmark liable over to the charrons, (2) in computing plain-tiffs\u2019 damages, and (3) in awarding at-torneys\u2019 fees to the Charrons.</p>\n<p id=\"AjRI\">(l) We need not consider the liability <em>vel non </em>of the Charrons. Les-mark agreed to \u201chold harmless and in-demnify the Owner [Charrons] of and from all claims, suits, actions, costs, counsel fees, expenses, damages, judgments or decrees\u201d arising out of Lesmark\u2019s per-formance of the construction contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the District Court found upon am-pie evidence that Lesmark\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>here, Lesmark must bear the ult\u00edmate</p>\n<p id=\"A9EU\">liability to Pryce and Ash, whether or not the Charrons are also liable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">(2) Lesmark contends, however, that the determination of plaintiffs\u2019 damages was erroneous and that its liability should be reduced accordingly. It claims that the Charrons should bear the difference because they failed to appeal the principal judgments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not reach this claim since we think the determination of damages was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Lesmark challenges three items of damages. The first is the amount allowed for loss of rent. It claims that Pryce\u2019s premises were \u201crestored to a habitable condition by January 1, 1960\u201d and that no rent should be allowed after that date since Pryce \u201cmade no real effort to rent the premises.\u201d However, the parties had stipulated that the repairs \u201cwere completed by March 1, 1960,\u201d and the trial judge found that Pryce \u201cmade diligent efforts to obtain a tenant or tenants or a purchaser for said premises\u201d until the building was sold on December 15, 1960. He therefore awarded $9,800 to Pryce for loss of rent for the period August 1, 1959, through December 15, 1960. We think the record supports these findings, and that the allowance of nine months to secure a tenant or purchaser was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Next, Lesmark claims that the record does not support the award of $7,500 for permanent damage to Pryce. There was evidence of substantial damage to the building which could not be alleviated by repairs, including the adverse effects of an extended period of disuse and of the community\u2019s knowledge of the accident. A real estate expert testified that in his opinion the pre-accident value of the building was $80,000, based on a capitalization of rental income. One and a half years after the accident, when the building had been repaired as much as possible, it was sold for $67,500. This reflected a $12,500 differential in value. Subsequently the building was resold for $75,000, when partial occupancy and the first successful sale had neutralized significant elements of the permanent damage. The real estate expert testified that this post-accident resale of the repaired and tenanted building reinforced his estimate of $80,000 as the pre-accident value.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge fixed the pre-acci-dent value at $75,000. Thus, he found a loss of $7,500 to Pryce. We cannot say that this conclusion is unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Finally, Lesmark says that in determining the amount of damages, the court failed to distinguish between expenditures \u201cfor repairs\u201d to restore the premises to their prior condition and expenditures for enhancement beyond restoration. We find no support for this contention. On the contrary, the record shows that the court excluded certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>expenditures because they exceeded the needs of restoration. For example, the court reduced a floor covering bill by over 35 per cent because asphalt tile was used to replace the damaged linoleum floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">(3) We turn now to Lesmark\u2019s contention that the Charrons are not entitled to indemnification for counsel fees because their insurance carrier furnished the counsel who appeared for them and they \u201care neither obligated nor responsible for the fee.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We cannot agree. The fact that the Charrons carried liability insurance which covered the claims of Pryce and Ash did not relieve Lesmark of its obligation to indemify the Char-rons against such claims, and Lesmark does not contend otherwise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, it was not relieved of its liability for litigation expenses arising from those claims, which were also covered by insurance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And the insurer\u2019s agreement to provide direct legal representation rather than reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees merely reflects an understandable preference of the insurer to control the litigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The appeals from the judgments in favor of Pryce in No. 17739, and Ash in No. 17740 are dismissed. The remaining judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Apq\">. The Charrons also cross-claimed against Dreyfuss. The trial court\u2019s judgment for Dreyfuss was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">At trial Lesmark entered an oral cross-claim against Dreyfuss. The trial court\u2019s judgment for Dreyfuss was appealed, but this appeal was abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ATgs\">. \u201cShould any person or persons or prop-crty be damaged or injured * * * by the contractor * * * in the course of the performance by them of this agreement, or otherwise resulting from any action or operation under this agreement, whether by negligence or otherwise, said contractor shall alone be liable, responsible and answerable therefor and does hereby agree * * * to hold harmless and indemnify the Owner * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-7\">.

New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 72 F.2d 323 (8th Cir. 1934) ; cf. Tighe v. Maryland Casualty Co., 99 F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1938), but see Rule 74, Fed.R.Civ.P.; or whether the Charrons were remiss in failing to take easy, formal steps to protect Les-mark\u2019s rights when they were under an obligation to do so, cf.

He testified: \u201cIn the interim, they had obtained \u2014 they had been able to obtain partial tenancies for part of the building.
