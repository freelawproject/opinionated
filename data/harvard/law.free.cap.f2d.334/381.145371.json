A Show Cause Order was issued and respondent union answered, alleging affirmatively that petitioner, prior to instituting the action, had failed to conduct a hearing as required by the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ute under which the injunction was sought and that petitioner had acted arbitrarily, capriciously and abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Prior to the return date of the Show Cause Order, counsel for the union caused a subpoena duces tecum to be issued out of the office of the Clerk of the Court, commanding the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board to appear on the return date and testify on behalf of the union, as an adverse witness, in the injunction action and to bring with him all records, reports, files, memoranda and correspondence, except statements and affidavits of witnesses, pertaining to the Board\u2019s Case Numbers 27-CE-l and 27-CA-1303.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner moved to quash the subpoena duces tecum on the following grounds: (1) That the rules and regulations of the Board forbid the disclosure or production of information, files, records or documents of the Board without the prior consent of the Board or its general counsel; (2) that the documents covered by the subpoena are official papers of the Board and neither the Board nor the general counsel had granted the requisite written consent for their disclosure; and (3) the general counsel had not granted the requisite written consent for the witness to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The court below heard the arguments on the Motion to Quash and denied the same.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the order of denial, the court included a provision allowing the witness to submit all of the files and documents requested in the subponea to it in camera, prior to production, for the purpose of enabling the court to make a determination as to which documents, if any, should be produced. The order also expressly provided that it was made \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of Petitioner to object to any question which may be propounded by respondent to the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel, in chambers, advised the court that the files and records would be submitted to the court in camera as ordered, but only if he could reserve the right to thereafter decline to comply with the court\u2019s order and dismiss the action in the event the court ruled that any part of the records should be produced in open court. The trial judge then made certain, in open court, that petitioner\u2019s position as to production of the records remained as it had been expressed in chambers. Counsel for respondent moved for a dismissal of the case because of petitioner\u2019s refusal to comply with the order of the court and the court entered an order of dismissal, from which this appeal arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Appellant says in substance that the order of dismissal was erroneous because there was no merit to the defenses raised by the union and further that the Motion to Quash the subpoena should have been sustained because the union did not make a showing of good cause-for production of the documents re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>quested. Appellee, to sustain the dismissal, urges that the question of privilege raised by appellant in its Motion to Quash was for the trial court to decide and that appellant had no right to reserve to itself the right to review and reject the court\u2019s decision on the issue,</p>\n<p id=\"AyT8\">At the_ outset, we deem the appellant s conditional offer to abide the court\u2019s order for an in camera examination of the documents as tantamount to a refusal to comply with that order and it will be so considered. Such an order cannot be conditionally accepted by a governmental agency, or the head thereof, any more than it could be so accepted by any private litigant. And, while this action was brought by the appellant m his official governmental capacity, he is in no different position than any ordinary litigant and is, therefore, bound by the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the same respects as any ordinary litigant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Supreme Court said in United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 356 U.S 677, 681, 78 S.Ct. 983, 986, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077: \u201c * -x- * qjbe Government as a litigant is, of course, subj\u2019ect to the rules of discovery. * * * \u201d At the same time, the policy of withholding information based upon a claim of privilege has not been abolished.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAiqH\">It is a generally accepted rule of evidence that the Government, or an agency thereof, is entitled in a court of law to a privilege against revealing state secrets of a diplomatic or military nature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But, there is nothing in this case pertaining to a state secret. Accordingly, the only basis for a claim of privilege in tMg cage must be found in either the we]j rec0gnjze(j \u201cwork product\u201d rule <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or by virtue of the Board&gt;s regulation, promulgated pursuant <em>to 5 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> whicb provides; \u00abNo regional director * * * shall produce or present any djeS; documenb3) reports, memoranda, or recordg of the Board or tegtify in behalf of any party to any cauge pending in any court * * * with respect to the contents of any files, documents, reports, <em>memoranda&gt; </em>or records of the <em>Board&gt; </em>whetber in answer to subpena [sic.]; subpena [sic ] duceg tecum) or otherwise, without the written consent * * *\u201d 0f the Board or its chairman or the generai counsel, depending upon which one of them bag control of tbe document in <em>tion. </em>29 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 102.118.</p>\n<p id=\"ak3-dedup-0\">It is for the Court, and not the governmental agency or executive branch, to determine whether documents sought to be withheld under a claim of privilege are entitled to the protection of that privilege.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>court properly sought to make such a determination, by ordering the documents to be submitted for an in camera examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant, in effect, refused to comply with that order and thereby sought to do that which he can not do, namely, determine whether the documents were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Moreover, while appellant does not cite or discuss the case of Olson Rug Company v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir., 291 F.2d 655, we believe it is squarely in point here. The Court of Appeals there had entered an enforcement order against Olson and thereafter the Board filed a petition seeking to have Olson adjudged guilty of contempt of the enforcement order. The court appointed a special master to take testimony and make findings and conclusions. Olson sought to compel the Board, by a subpoena duces tecum, to produce its files and records at the hearing before the master. The master ordered the Board to turn the files and records over to him for his examination in camera, the Board objected and the master certified the question to the Court of Appeals for interlocutory review. The court said that in such situations there must be a balancing of the need for production of the documents claimed to be privileged against the reasons for suppressing them and that where there is a need for them to preclude prejudice and unfairness, i. e., good cause, \u201c * * * an agency regulation or conditional executive privilege cannot stand in the way of necessary discovery.\u201d (291 F.2d at 662.) It was held that the files and records should be turned over to the master for an in camera examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\"> Appellant urges that there is not a sufficient showing of good cause for issuance of the subpoena duces tecum. However, it must be remembered that this is an equitable action in which the maxims of equity are fully applicable and under the express terms of the statute the lower court has discretionary power to issue or deny an injunction. One of the defenses asserted by the appellee union is that the appellant has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in bringing the action. This defense is buttressed by a showing that appellant has not sought relief against two other parties who, it is alleged, engaged in the same illegal conduct as appellee. Thus, the appellant\u2019s good faith is squarely in issue and, obviously, the documents requested by the subpoena may be relevant to that issue. We believe the lower court was justified in concluding that good cause was shown for production of those documents. It may well be that part or all of the documents are privileged or for some other legal reason are not subject to disclosure or would not be admissible into evidence in the case. But that determination must be made by the trial court and not by a litigant in the case. Therefore, when appellant refused to produce the documents in response to the court\u2019s order, the court properly invoked the sanctions provided by the Rules and dismissed the case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\">.
