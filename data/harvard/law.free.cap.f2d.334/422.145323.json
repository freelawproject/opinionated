Andrews, because of injections of certain drugs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>No <em>claim is here made by </em>appellants that they are entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict of the jury. All assignments of error relate to procedural matters occurring in the course of pre-trial procedure, or at the trial on the merits. Tersely stated, errors so claimed are: (1) unjustifiable preclusion of the testimony of two doctors proffered as witnesses by appellants; (2) the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit appellants to read to the jury cross-examination of two witnesses contained in depositions, after waiver of reading parts thereof by appellee; (3) the giving of instructions to the jury; (4) alleged misconduct of one juror for failure to make disclosures on voir dire examination; and, (5) exclusion of ex post facto evidence as to \u201ccause\u201d proffered by appellants. In the light of the errors so claimed, and it appearing that diversity jurisdiction here exists, we only set forth in the course of this opinion such facts as will give proper focus to the error asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">On June 25, 1959, when Julie Andrews was seven and one-half months of age, she became ill and was taken to St. Joseph\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Clinton, Iowa, for treatment of pneumonia, bilateral otitis media, and tonsillitis. Her then attending pediatrician prescribed, over a three-day period, one intramuscular injection of a drug, dicrysticin fortis, and two injections of dicrysticin, manufactured and sold by appellee. Julie was released from the hospital on June 30, 1959. One month later, Julie\u2019s mother noticed that her daughter apparently could not hear. As a consequence she took Julie to the office of her pediatrician. The doctor made an examination of Julie and found the child did not respond to loud noises. Arrangements were then made for the child to be examined by an otolaryngologist who reported Julie had complete and permanent loss of hearing. There was evidence adduced at the trial which related Julie\u2019s loss of hearing to the injections of the appellee\u2019s drugs, <em>ante; </em>i. e., proof was made as to the inherent composition, ingredients, and toxicity of dicrysticin and dicrysticin fortis, such as to warrant a submission of appellee\u2019s liability to the jury for determination. Appellee denied the toxicity of its drugs as claimed by appellants and made proof that Julie\u2019s deafness was congenital, and if not so, then it was the result of other causes for which it was not responsible. As above noted, the jury found \u201call the (factual) issues\u201d submitted to it under the instructions as given by the trial court \u201cin favor of the defendant,\u201d appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error relating to the preclusion of witnesses arose thus: District Judge McManus presided over the pre-trial procedure conducted in the case at bar. Seemingly by pre-trial order, counsel for these parties were directed, among other things, to disclose the names of all their witnesses, as well as the general content of their proposed testimony; and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">\u201cIf the name and address of the witness is not submitted at the time of the final pre-trial conference, the witness shall not be permitted to testify, but this restriction shall not apply to rebuttal witnesses, the necessity of whose testimony cannot reasonably be anticipated prior to trial.\u201d (Applnts. Br., pp. 5, 6.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2c\">Compliance with ~uch pre-trial directive was apparently made by way of a joint written report filed by counsel with the trial court. This is apparently so, since it <em>is only on </em>briefs that reference is made to such matters, and there only in general terms. The record proper is silent as to the pre-trial process pursued in the case at bar. All that appears in the printed record is a final pre-trial order, covering seventeen (17) pages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nowhere, i. e. by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>briefs or record proper, does it appear that appellants at any time objected to any pre-trial proceedings. The final pretrial order was entered of record on February 14, 1963, which directed a trial on the merits to commence March 26, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">However, it appears that on March 21, 1963, \u2014 five days before the date so set for trial \u2014 appellants\u2019 counsel made application to Judge McManus to call four (4) persons as witnesses (a hospital record librarian, and three nurses) not previously disclosed at pre-trial conference. Without' objection of appellee, those witnesses testified at the trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On the date set for commencement of trial, counsel for appellants, in chambers before District Judge Hanson (duly designated as Judge to preside at the trial on the merits), sought permission to call as witnesses two doctors whose names had not previously been disclosed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An objection by appellee to the calling of such witnesses was sustained. It is upon that ruling made on the first day of trial, that appellants premise error as to the \u201cpreclusion of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">As that matter is presented, we are asked to judicially notice plain error appearing on the face of this record. Appellants\u2019 singular premise therefor is \u201cthat the preclusion\u201d order \u201cwas unjust,\u201d in that it puts \u201ctechnical rules and procedures into Federal practice that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were designed to eliminate.\u201d We shall not follow these parties in the presentations they make regarding that subject\u2014 primarily, because we cannot find in the record before us any matter establishing pre-trial procedure ms followed in the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, by rule or otherwise; nor any objection made by appellants'to any action taken or ruling made as to the pretrial procedure followed in the case at bar. All that appears from the record is that Judge Hanson, on the first day of trial, ruled in chambers that appellants\u2019 counsel would not be permitted to call either of the doctors as witnesses in chief, whose identity, was then first disclosed. Appellants\u2019 counsel acquiesced, in part, to the ruling so made as to one such doctor, namely, Dr. Albert Zimmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">As to the other doctor precluded (Dr. Robert E. Dwyer) the only formal offer of proof made was \u201c(t)hat we be allowed to call Dr. Dwyer and that he be allowed to testify from the investigations that he\u2019s made as to the cause of this child\u2019s deafness.\u201d The singular ruling then made by Judge Hanson was, \u201cWell, the offer of proof as indicated is now denied.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 43(c), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A., specifically provides how \u201cexcluded evidence\u201d is to be preserved for judicial review. That appellants were afforded ample opportunity to make any offer of proof as to what testimony these precluded doctors would give if called as witnesses, is made manifest. It is only \u201cin extraordinary situations\u201d that a party may call \u201cupon (us) to act in the interest of judicial administration itself\u201d where matters occurring before a trial court do not appear in the record on appeal. Cf. Hawkins v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 188 F.2d 348 (8 Cir. 1951). The case law is legion that a question not going to the jurisdiction of the court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Cf. Goldie v. Cox, 130 F.2d 695 (8 Cir. 1942); Arkansas Valley Feed Mills, Inc. v. Fox deLuxe Foods, Inc., 273 F.2d 804 (8 Cir. 1960); Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co. v. Mann, 304 F.2d 166 (8 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The only \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d we perceive in the case at bar as to the \u201cpreclusion of witnesses\u201d is that counsel for appellants were \u201claboring under the misapprehension\u201d that \u201cDr. Robert E. Dwyer, the obstetrician who had brought the plaintiff, Julie Andrews, into the world, and who had treated her as a pediatrician for a couple of months following her birth\u201d had moved from the community in which he formerly resided. Counsel apparently continued under that misapprehension from the time the complaint in the case at bar was filed until two or three days before the commencement of the trial on its merits. During that period of time (approximately two years) counsel admittedly \u201cjust assumed\u201d that Dr. Dwyer had moved away. They made no effort to determine his whereabouts. The Doctor, during all such time, was a resident of the same community where he resided when he attended the delivery of Julie. If it is thought that such laxity on the part of appellants\u2019 counsel should not be held against appellants\u2019 right of action here asserted, then there are other facts appearing in the record which we think must be considered before any equation as to error in the \u201cpreclusion of witnesses\u201d might be judicially noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The record reveals that a pre-trial stipulation of the parties was made that Julie was \u201chealthy and normal at birth, except for her alleged loss of hearing.\u201d Julie\u2019s mother, father, and aunt each testified to facts which, if believed, established Julie was able to hear prior to June 25, 1959. Medical testimony adduced at the trial, hypothetically and otherwise, revealed that Julie\u2019s state of hearing as being normal at birth was taken into consideration by four other doctors who testified on behalf of appellants ; and that such matter was an issue of fact well aired at' the trial. From statements made by counsel at the pretrial conference held on the first day of trial, it appears that if Dr. Dwyer had testified as a witness he would have given medical testimony of like tenor. Under the circumstances, we cannot find reversible error as a matter of law, as appellants would have us do, respecting the preclusion of Dr. Dwyer as a witness in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Although Dr. Zimmer had been precluded as a witness in chief for appellants, they thereafter sought to call him as a rebuttal witness. Appellee objected to Dr. Zimmer\u2019s testifying as a rebuttal witness. It is appellants\u2019 assertion that Dr. Zimmer was not required to be listed as a medical witness because the pre-trial order provided such \u201crestrictions shall not apply to rebuttal witnesses, the necessity of whose testimony cannot reasonably be anticipated prior to trial.\u201d Judge Hanson, out of hearing of the jury, requested appellants to make an offer of proof as to the testimony he would give in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The following colloquy appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cMr. McDonald: We want to make an offer of proof. The plaintiff proposes to call Dr. Albert Zimmer in rebuttal to negate the opinion testimony given by the defendant particularly that testimony dealing with idiosyncrasy or allergy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201cThe Court: Now, I understand that negation is both for your own witnesses, whatever they might have testified to, and for the testimony of the defendant\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201cMr. McDonald: None of my witnesses testified as to allergy, I don\u2019t believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">\u201cThe Court: Well, as to other matters of cause, you\u2019re indicating cause ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">\u201cMr. McDonald: Yes, and I further offer that Dr. Zimmer will testify, if permitted to do so, that' in his opinion neither congenital deafness or deafness caused by disease is a probable cause in this case. He will admit they are possible causes but not a probable cause, and further, Dr. Zimmer will testify, if permitted to do so, that in his opinion the probable cause of Julie Andrews\u2019 deafness is the ototoxicity of dihy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>drostreptomyein. Furthermore, Dr. Zimmer is an otolaryngologist practicing medicine in Moline, Illinois. That he did examine Julie Andrews before the time that she was ever represented by a lawyer and that he is the man responsible for her taking her speech therapy at Augustana College at this time. I further would like to say that Dr. Zimmer was not available because he was out of town during our case in chief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">When counsel for appellants proffered Dr. Zimmer as a witness in chief, they told the Court \u201cthey did not know at the time\u201d pre-trial procedure was conducted in the case at bar that Dr. Zimmer \u201chad any evidence of importance to their cause.\u201d The record does not' reveal when they first gleaned knowledge of what testimony Dr. Zimmer would give.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">An inference to be made from the record is that what counsel for appellants indicated, out of the presence of the jury, the testimony of Dr. Zimmer would be, if they were permitted to call him as a rebuttal witness, was \u201cfurther opinion testimony\u201d as to the cause of the infant appellant\u2019s deafness; and that such proffered testimony was to be related \u201cto matter of probability and possibility\u201d of \u201ccause in this matter.\u201d As to the offer of proof so made, Judge Hanson ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agy\">\u201c * * * it does not indicate that if comes within the terms of true rebuttal. It is an indication that it is supplementary to and (would) be a portion of the main case in this cause. * * * Ample and sufficient opportunity (was) extended to the plaintiff (appellant) in this cause to have offered this type of testimony heretofore. It would appear further that this type of testimony (would) be that kind of testimony which would not necessarily impeach or contradict, but what is indicated in the sphere of other opinion (testimony).\u201d (Par. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">On the record, we cannot reach a conclusion, <em>contra. </em>Therefore, we do not perceive abuse of judicial discretion as a matter of law, as appellants would have us judicially notice, because of the preclusion of Dr. Zimmer as a rebuttal witness\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Appellants\u2019 second contention as to the use of depositions appears thus: In the course of trial appellants introduced and read to the jury the direct testimony of two medical witnesses contained in deposition given by them. After so doing, appellee waived reading the cross-examination of one such witness. Appellants\u2019 objection to such waiver was overruled as to the deposition testimony of Dr. Liarle. On brief, appellants\u2019 counsel assert: \u201cThe plaintiffs then agreed to adopt the cross-examination as their own testimony. In the absence of any authority to support their position, the plaintiffs (appellants) were not allowed to adopt the cross-examinations as their testimony.\u201d As to the deposition of Dr. MaeQueen,\u2014 after counsel for appellants read the whole of that doctor\u2019s direct testimony, appellee only read certain portions of the cross-examination, taken out of context, to establish that he never personally attended a case of deafness caused by administering the drugs here considered, or that he ever knew about deafness arising from short-term use of such drug; and \u201cwhen asked if he had any personal opinion as to the cause of Julie\u2019s deafness\u201d he answered in his deposition, \u201cI did not commit' myself in the record.\u201d \u201cQ. And you are not prepared to commit yourself now? A. No.\u201d Appellants assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cThe plaintiffs then moved the court to read the entire deposition of the doctor. The court then sustained an objection to the reading of any part of this deposition unless it was relevant to the part introduced by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">It is the above ruling which is a part of the assignment of error, <em>ante. </em>On brief, appellants state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cMany of the objections made by the defendants to the plaintiffs reading certain portions of (these) deposition (s) were made at the bench, out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of hearing of the jury and the court reporter, and consequently no record was made of them.\u201d (Par. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Regardless of the flexibility of the Rules of Civil Procedure and how loose some schools of thought may be as to how those rules should be applied, one thing is certain * * * error cannot be claimed as to trial court procedure, nor rulings made as to the admission of evidence, absent some showing of the character and circumstances under which such a ruling has been made. It is a well-established axiom, universally recognized, that' the scope of review only deals with cases upon the basis of facts disclosed by the record, not with non-existent or assumed circumstances. Fort Worth and Denver R. Co. v. Harris, 230 F.2d 680 (5 Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Neither on the face of this record nor on briefs are we informed as to the specific testimony, or the evidentiary proof appellants desired to proffer by reading all the cross-examination of either Dr. Liarle or Dr. MacQueen, that was excluded by the rulings of which they here make complaints. Prejudicial error is not presumed to exist. Danaher v. United States, 184 F.2d 673 (8 Cir. 1950). It is the burden of an appellant to establish that matter as an existing fact on appeal. Plain error of course we will consider, though not assigned by a party. Adams Dairy Co. v. St. Louis Dairy Co., 260 F.2d 46 (8 Cir. 1958). The underlying purpose therefor is to prevent a miscarriage of justice. Agee v. Lofton, 287 F.2d 709 (8 Cir. 1961). However, the practice of noticing such error will not be extended by us beyond the purpose for such rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Here, the District Court restricted appellants\u2019 reading of deposition to such portions of the cross-examination waived by appellees as were relevant to the cross-examination which had been introduced. Rule 26(d) (4) F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A., could hardly be clearer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cIf only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced * * (Emp. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">We can find no error as to abuse of use of depositions as claimed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">Appellants next complain of two instructions given to the jury: * * * one defining negligence as \u201cordinary care\u201d, and the other covering \u201cintervening agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">Prior to the giving of his instructions to the jury, Judge Hanson struck from appellants\u2019 complaint all specifications of negligence except one relating to failure to warn. Appellants\u2019 remaining legal theories based on breach of warranties, expressed and implied, were duly submitted to the jury. The instructions covering the issues of \u201ctoxicity and safety\u201d of the drugs in question were responsive to the agreed statement of facts as made at pre-trial conference and proof adduced at the trial. The instruction covering \u201cfailure to warn\u201d as to the side effects of the drugs * * * the only issue of negligence submitted * * * told the jury that if it found and believed that appellee failed to warn the public or physicians of the severity of the side effects of its drugs \u201cof which it did know, or should have known by the use of reasonable diligence, prior to the administration of this drug to\u201d Julie, would constitute negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">The instruction on \u201cintervening cause\u201d was apparently given as a result of testimony adduced from Julie\u2019s pediatrician, called as a witness by appellants. From her testimony, an inference might be made that she may have administered too large a dose of the drugs to the infant child. Appellee did not seek to avoid liability in this case on the theory of intervening cause. Aside from denial of appellants\u2019 theories of liability, appellee affirmatively alleged .\u201ccongenital\u201d deafness, and if not that * * * and her deafness \u201cbe attributable to the proper administration\u201d of its product * * * \u201cthen her condition was caused by a personal idiosyncrasy, sensitivity or al-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Iergy\u201d for which it was not liable. No contention is here made as to the proper submission of matters to the jury except as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"AWh\">Appellants having made no objection to giving of any instructions before the jury retired, as required by Rule 51 F.R.Civ.P. 28 U.S.C.A. they are in no position to have us review the error they now claim. Errors as to the giving of instructions not brought to the attention of the trial court will not be considered on appeal. A trial court is entitled to an opportunity to pass upon objections lodged to its instructions, so that it may correct any possible error therein, and must be shown as having failed so to do, before we are called upon to review error so claimed. Siegfried v. The Kansas City Star, 298 F.2d 1 (8 Cir. 1962); Honebein v. McDonald, 299 F.2d 493 (8 Cir. 1962); Carver v. Tanner, 252 F.2d 26, 31 (8 Cir. 1958.)</p>\n<p id=\"AQU\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"A2z\">Appellants claim prejudice at the trial, because of misconduct on the part of a juror for concealing and failing to disclose his true occupation. They ask us to take judicial notice of that matter, presumably because the record is silent as to any facts in support of such contention, except reference made thereto in appellants' motion for new trial. So far as we can ascertain, the factual matters there stated were not submitted to, nor adjudicated by, the District Court, &lt;On brief, appellants state \u201caffidavits to The motion for new trial\u201d disclose the -facts of which they here complain. The printed record reveals no such affidavits, All that' appears is that during voir dire examination Juror Webster responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG5\">\u201cAnd Mr. Webster, my record indi\u25a0cates you are an accountant. Are .you in business for yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahh-dedup-1\">\u201cMr. Webster: I\u2019m with the Nagel Lumber Company in Iowa City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ays-dedup-0\">^ \u201cMr. McDonald (appellants\u2019 coun.sel): Nagel Lumber Company in Iowa City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOkG\">Such is the extent of that juror\u2019s voir dire examination.</p>\n<p id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">jn their unverified motion for new trial, appellants state that the occupation Gordon S. Webster, of Iowa City, listed as an accountant in the list of jurors furnished to them by the District Court, was in truth and fact that an. insurance agent and a director an insurance company and has been such for many years past.\u201d They ask us . ^uke judicial notice of the fact that insurance agents, representatives, or adjusters, and in particular members ^he k\u00b0ar(l of directors of an insurance company, are almost unanimously denied right to sit on a jury in a personal injury action and Juror Webster\u2019s failure disclose his full occupation in response to questions directly directed to him \u201d is manifest error. _ No affidavits appear in the record of this case to sustain the factual matter appellants would have us so notice.</p>\n<p id=\"AuqJ\">The only answer to be made to the above assignment of error is that there is nothing in this record revealing false, misleading, or any concealed matter by Juror Webster as to any question propounded to him on voir dire examination. The only query that was propounded to that juror does not warrant the conclusions appellants reach. The record does not reveal that appellants made any offer to prove, by affidavit or witness, what they now say was the true occupation of Juror Webster. Any irregularity in the qualification of a juror after return of a verdict, absent specific showing of injury or prejudice, will not be considered for the first time on appeal. International Boxing Club of N. Y., Inc. v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 79 S.Ct. 245, 3 L.Ed.2d 270, Morgan v. Sun Oil Co., 109 F.2d 178 (5 Cir. 1940) cert. den. 10 U.S. 640, 60 S.Ct. 1086, 84 L.Ed. 1408.</p>\n<p id=\"aso-dedup-0\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"a1m-dedup-0\">The final contention made by appellants is the District Court erred in ex-eluding evidence offered by them, that \u201cdrugs containing a combination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>' streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin were taken off the market by the Commissioner of the U.S. Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in January 1960, some six months after (the infant) plaintiff was injected with such drugs.\u201d It is most difficult for us to follow the argument appellants make in respect to the above issue. On brief, they assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">\u201cThe court admonished counsel for plaintiffs not to mention (that) fact in the opening statement, * * * that he would not permit any interrogatories to any of the witnesses (relating) to (that) fact. * * * Just how the court knew in the first' place that this was one of the factors in the case is unknown to the plaintiff. Nothing was said in the pleadings, or in the pretrial conferences that the Administrator of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act had ruled this drug so toxic that it was removed from the market. Nevertheless the court anticipated that this matter would come up and ruled upon it before it was ever mentioned by the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The error which appellants assert flows from the pretrial rulings made by Judge Hanson, <em>ante, </em>is stated by them as follows: They were not \u201callowed to ask the drug nurse of St. Joseph\u2019s Mercy Hospital if she still dispensed this particular medication\u201d; that they were not allowed to ask Dr. Rockwell, the attending physician, \u201cwhat her thinking about the drug was at this time\u201d; and that' they \u201cwere not even allowed to ask, on cross-examination of Dr. Hobson, a direct employee of the (appellee), if there had not been a serious dispute in relation to these drugs before the Administrator of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act before the injection of this drug into the (infant) plaintiff.\u201d Further, appellants state they \u201cwere not allowed to impeach the credibility\u201d of five doctors called as expert witnesses by ap-pellee, \u201cby showing this drug was so toxic that it had been taken off the market by the Administrator\u201d <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">On brief, appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\u201cIt might be contended by the (appellee) that at no place in this record is there a duplication of the ruling of the United States Commissioner of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. That is simply because the court never let us put it in. In this respect, however, we wish to point out that the Federal District Court is required to take judicial notice of any Federal laws necessarily brought into operation by the allegations of the complaint, although specific reference to the law has been omitted. (Citing eases.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\u201cNot only must the court take judicial notice of the Federal statutes involved, but likewise must take judicial notice of the Administrative rules and regulations of the Federal, State, Executive Departments, and of well known administrative bodies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Further on, appellants make clear that their contention here is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">\u201cthat the evidence relating to the removal of Dicrysticin and Dicrys-ticin Fortis from the market after its administration to the plaintiff by the Administrator of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was admissible (as evidence) in chief and should have been judicially (noticed by the District Court). It (was) also admissible (they contend) under Rule 44 as proof of an official document. It was relevant to the subject matter. In the alternative it was admissible on cross-examination for the purpose-of impeaching and testing the credibility of the defendant\u2019s doctors, and that it was admissible in rebuttal, and that the restriction imposed by the court upon the plaintiffs in this case constituted a denial of substantial rights and is error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">We have reviewed all that' appears in this record relating to rulings made by Judge Hanson respecting this matter-As appellee aptly points out, it cannot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>be ascertained therefrom where anything was ever \u201csaid in the pleadings or in pretrial conferences that the Administrator of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act\u201d had ever ruled that the drug here considered was \u201ctoxic\u201d or that it was \u201cremoved from the market.\u201d It does not appear before us that any proof was ever proffered which would sustain or warrant appellate review of the above subject matter, notwithstanding the contention made by appellants, <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">What appears to have happened at the trial is that appellants proposed to announce to the jury in their opening statements and bring to its attention that sometime in 1960, after the infant appellant received the injection of the drug <em>ante, </em>the Administrator of the Pure Food and Drug Administration had ordered dierysticin and dicrysticin fortis withdrawn from the market because of their toxicity. That matter was a subject of considerable discussion at pre-trial conference held by Judge Hanson on the first day of trial. At that conference, he told counsel that from his reading of the file it appeared that evidence of action taken by the Administrator might not be admissible at the trial of this case; but the only ruling then made by him related to opening statements, namely: \u201cYou are now to be foreclosed from touching upon that portion of the evidence in your opening statements. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Nowhere does it appear that appellants\u2019 counsel thereafter proffered any evidence as to any directive, ruling or order, made by the Administrator of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act relating to any control of marketing activity as to the above-mentioned drugs, as appellants now assert.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Lh\">Simply stated, there is nothing in this record from which we can ascertain whether there is any merit to the contention appellants now make as to any orders or rulings of the Administrator of the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. From our reading of the record, we are totally lost in the labyrinthine argument appellants proffer in respect to this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">In the course of this opinion, we have undertaken the task of following appellant's in each of their assignments of error. We have culled the record on appeal, to ascertain any probable basis for the assignments of error they make as to sanctions imposed at pre-trial conference * * * notwithstanding the fact that no record citations appear in appellants\u2019- brief as required by our Rule 11 (b), Third, disclosing the matters, evidence, objections, or rulings of which they here complain. We have done so because of the duty that is ours,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the serious nature of the claim appellants assert against appellee. This, notwithstanding the record on appeal and appellants\u2019 brief have been prepared in utter disregard of the Rules of this Court. Our Rule 11(b), Fifth, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">\u201c * * * (This) court will disregard any statement in the argument (in printed briefs) as to what the record contains unless reference is made to the page of the printed record where the statement may be found or verified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">We have not', in times past, hesitated to decline to receive briefs which do not comport with our rules. Cf. Cyc. Fed. Proc., Vol. 14, \u00a7 66.09, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-15\">. The complaint in eight counts alleged claims for damages, separately stated, for negligence or breach of warranty, expressed and implied. The first four counts sought damages on behalf of the infant, Julie T. Andrews. The remaining four counts alleged claims on behalf of the father, William C. Andrews, for loss of services, medical expense, cost of exceptional maintenance, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"alo-dedup-0\">Counts 2 and 6, premised on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, were dismissed by the Court during the course of trial. No error is here claimed as to that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\">. The final pre-trial order contained a statement of agreed facts; the names of \u201call witnesses who (would) testify\u201d at the trial; the factual contentions of the parties; the \u201ctriable issues\u201d; directions given by the Court as to \u201csetlement negotiations\u201d; filing of trial briefs; time for taking of depositions; and a specified trial date on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">. Four of the six doctors named by appellants in the pre-trial order testified at the trial on the merits. The infant appellant\u2019s pediatrician who made the injections of the drugs here considered was not listed by appellants but by appellee. However, she was called as a witness for appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-12\">. The record discloses there was a general discussion in chambers before such offer of proof was made as to why Dr. Zimmer and Dr. Dwyer were not listed as witnesses pursuant to the pre-trial procedure followed, but the above is the only offer of proof made respecting the import of Dr. Dwyer\u2019s proffered testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">.
