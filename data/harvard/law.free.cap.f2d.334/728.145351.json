The Government answered, asserting as a defense and ground for dismissal, that when appel-lee\u2019s injury occurred he was an employee-of the Government and within the coverage of the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 et seq.; that the remedy provided therein is exclusive- and operates to bar this asserted tort claims action. In the alternative, and assuming that appellee\u2019s status was arguable, the Government moved to refer-that matter to the Secretary of Labor-on the ground that the Secretary has primary jurisdiction to adjudicate such status.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-21\">On pre-trial, the Court denied the Government\u2019s motion to refer. On trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u25a0of the ease, the Government renewed its motion and alternatively stood upon its \u2022defense of non-negligence and contributory negligence. Pursuant to trial the Court found that at the time of the injury, appellee was a \u201cvoluntary patient\u201d in the United States Public Health Service Hospital; that his injury was proximately caused by the negligence of the \u25a0Government; and, that he neither knew nor assumed the risk involved and was free of contributory negligence. Judgment was accordingly entered for appel-lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">On appeal, the Government does not \u25a0contest the trial Court\u2019s findings on negligence and contributory negligence, or the amount of the judgment. The contention is that the trial Court erroneously refused to dismiss the action on the ground that appellee was at the time of his injury an employee of the Government and within the exclusive coverage \u25a0of the FECA, or to refer appellee\u2019s arguable status to the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"> If, of course, the appellee was injured in the course of the performance \u2022of his duties as an employee of the Government, the provisions of the FECA are exclusively applicable- to bar this action. And, there is authority to the effect that where a substantial question of coverage under the FECA arises in an FTCA action, that issue should be referred by the Court to the administrative body provided by the Act before adjudicating the merits of the tort claim. See: Somma v. United States, 3 Cir., 283 F.2d 149, and Daniels-Lumley v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 306 F.2d 769. However, these cases recognize and the Government seems to concede that if the claimant\u2019s injuries are clearly not compensable under the FECA, there is nothing to refer for administrative determination and the Court is free to hear and determine the tort claim. In our \u2022case, we do not reach the question whether, in the event of a substantial question of coverage, the Court must first refer the matter for administrative action, for we agree with the trial Court that the claimant was a patient in a Government Hospital and not an \u2018\u2018employee\u201d of the Government at the time of his injury. His claim could not, therefore, come within the exclusive provisions of the FECA. Cf. Underwood v. United States (10 C.A.), 207 F.2d 862, and Daniels-Lumley v. United States, supra.
