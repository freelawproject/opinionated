Frank V. Ariano was appointed defendant\u2019s attorney for the purposes of this appeal and the attorney has filed his motion to withdraw as defendant\u2019s counsel for the reason that the appeal is without merit. In conformity with Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493, 87 S. Ct. 1396, copies of the attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, together with his brief, were served on the defendant August 21, 1973, and the case was continued to October 2, 1973, for defendant to file additional pleas or objections to the motion of couns.el to withdraw. Defendant failed to respond to this notice in any way.</p> <p id=\"b661-12\" pgmap=\"661\">Counsel\u2019s brief filed with his motion to withdraw, as required by Anders, sets forth three points which counsel felt could conveivably be argued on appeal, even though he considers them to be without merit, and we will consider these points in the light of the record in this case.</p> <p id=\"b661-13\" pgmap=\"661\"> The brief filed by counsel suggests first that \u201can argument could conceivably be made\u201d based on the record on appeal, that there was no factual basis for the plea of guilty.' From a thorough and careful reading of the record, however, it is apparent that this contention has no factual basis. The record clearly shows that the defendant was found in possession of stolen property within a few hours after the burglaries in question and that defendant admitted the burglaries to the police. There thus was a clear, factual basis for the plea of guilty.</p> <p id=\"b661-14\" pgmap=\"661(44) 662(57)\"> Secondly, it is suggested by defendant\u2019s counsel that it might conceivably be argued that since the defendant admitted being addicted to heroin and to having slight withdrawal symptoms sometime during his period of confinement in the county jail prior to sentencing that possibly the voluntariness of his plea might be in question. But, there is no suggestion in the record that the defendant\u2019s will was overborne in any way, as is required to render a plea of guilty involuntary by use of drugs, Reck v. Pate (1961), 367 U.S. 433, 6 L. Ed. 2d 948, 81 S. Ct. 1541.</p> <p id=\"b662-3\" pgmap=\"662\">The record here refuted such a suggestion in the following colloquy between the defendant and his accomplice and the court:</p> <blockquote id=\"b662-4\" pgmap=\"662\">\u201cMR. MORELLI [defense counsel]: Your Honor, both men are veterans of the United States Armed Forces. Both served in Viet Nam, and both unfortunately picked up a narcotic habit while in Viet Nam.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-5\" pgmap=\"662\">THE COURT: Hard narcotics?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-6\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. MORELLI: Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-7\" pgmap=\"662\">THE COURT: Heroin?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-8\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. MORELLI: Yes. However, they have been in the Kane County Jail for about two weeks now and I don\u2019t believe they are under the influence of any drugs at this time, is this correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-9\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. OSMAN [another defendant]: Correct.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-10\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. ALLEN: Correct.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-11\" pgmap=\"662\">THE COURT: Have you had any withdrawal problems while you have been in jail?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-12\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. OSMAN: I have, your Honor, slight physical withdrawals.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-13\" pgmap=\"662\">THE COURT: I see. How about you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-14\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. ALLEN: The same trouble.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-15\" pgmap=\"662\">THE COURT: Are you feeling generally physically good, is that right?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-16\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. OSMAN: Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-17\" pgmap=\"662\">THE COURT: The same for you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-18\" pgmap=\"662\">MR. ALLEN: Yes.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b662-19\" pgmap=\"662\">We feel that the fact that the defendant had been in the county jail for 2 weeks prior to his hearing and admitted to slight withdrawal symptoms during that time is not sufficient to suggest the involuntariness of his plea due to the effect of drugs, especially since he answered in the affirmative to the count\u2019s inquiry as to whether he was now feeling generally physically good. This is all the evidence in the record regarding the possible effect of drugs on the plea of guilty and it is far from sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s will was overborne.</p> <p id=\"b662-20\" pgmap=\"662\">Lastly, it is suggested in the brief that it might be conceivably argued that the court was prejudiced by its knowledge of defendant\u2019s narcotic habit, because of the court\u2019s emphasis on the drug habit in the sentencing admonition. We find this suggestion entirely without foundation. The words used by the court in this admonition show sympathy with, rather than hostility toward, the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b663-4\" pgmap=\"663\">We find further from the total record that the defendant was properly admonished as to his waiver of indictment and his plea of guilty; that Supreme Court Rule 402 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 110A, par. 402) was substantially complied with in all areas, and that defendant was competently represented by counsel at all critical points prior to his conviction.</p> <p id=\"b663-5\" pgmap=\"663\">We find no error meriting a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction.</p> <p id=\"b663-6\" pgmap=\"663\"> Accordingly, the motion of counsel to withdraw is granted and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b663-7\" pgmap=\"663\">Motion to withdraw allowed, judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b663-8\" pgmap=\"663\">GUILD, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b663-9\" pgmap=\"663\">Mr. JUSTICE THOMAS J. MORAN,</author> <p id=\"AKd\" pgmap=\"663\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b663-10\" pgmap=\"663\">I respectfully dissent from the majority view for, in my opinion, the j trial court failed to explain the nature of the charge and made no inquiry as to the voluntariness of the plea.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
