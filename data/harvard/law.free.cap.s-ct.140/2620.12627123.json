S. ----, ---- - ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12624912\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/140/1/#p2\">140 S.Ct. 1</extracted-citation>, 2, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12624912,12626074,12626075,12626072\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/204/1170/\">204 L.Ed.2d 1170</extracted-citation> (2019) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part from grant of stay).</p><p id=\"p-8\">Now, the Government has apparently finalized its contracts, avoiding the irreparable harm it claimed in first seeking a stay. The Court's decision to let construction continue nevertheless, I fear, may \"operat[e], in effect, as a final judgment.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12624912,12626074,12626075,12626072\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/204/1170/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> , at ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12624912\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/140/1/#p2\">140 S.Ct., at 1</extracted-citation>.
