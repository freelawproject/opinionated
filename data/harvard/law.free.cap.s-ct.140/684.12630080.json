Virginia,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730243\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/19/264/#p404\">6 Wheat. 264</extracted-citation>, 404, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730243\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/19/264/#p404\">5 L.Ed. 257</extracted-citation> (1821) (Marshall, C.J., for the Court).</attorneys>\n\n\n\n<opinion type=\"majority\"><p id=\"p-5\">The motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied.</p><p id=\"p-6\">Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, dissenting from denial of motion for leave to file complaint.</p><p id=\"p-7\">Today the Court denies Arizona leave to file a complaint against California. Although we have discretion to decline review in other kinds of cases, see <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201254\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254</extracted-citation>(1), 1257(a), we likely do not have discretion to decline review in cases within our original jurisdiction that arise between two or more States.</p><p id=\"p-8\">The Constitution establishes our original jurisdiction in mandatory terms. Article III states that, \"[i]n all Cases ... in which a State shall be [a] Party, the supreme Court <em>shall</em> have original Jurisdiction.\" \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (emphasis added). In this circumstance, \"[w]e have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\"</p><p id=\"p-10\">Our original jurisdiction in suits between two States is also \"exclusive.\" \u00a7 1251(a). As I have previously explained, \"[i]f this Court does not exercise jurisdiction over a controversy between two States, then the complaining State has no judicial forum in which to seek relief.\" <em>Nebraska</em> v. <em>Colorado</em> , 577 U.S. ----, ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594870,12594871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1034/\">136 S.Ct. 1034</extracted-citation>, 1035, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596261,12596262,12596263,12596264,12594871\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/194/545/\">194 L.Ed.2d 545</extracted-citation> (2016) (opinion dissenting from denial of motion for leave to file complaint). Denying leave to file in a case between two or more States is thus not only textually suspect, but also inequitable.</p><p id=\"p-11\">The Court has provided scant justification for reading \"shall\" to mean \"may.\" It has invoked its \"increasing duties with the appellate docket,\" <em>Arizona v. New Mexico</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182647\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/794/#p797\">425 U.S. 794</extracted-citation>, 797, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182647\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/794/#p797\">96 S.Ct. 1845</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182647\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/794/#p797\">48 L.Ed.2d 376</extracted-citation> (1976) (<em>per curiam</em> ) (internal quotation marks omitted), and its \"structur[e] ... as an appellate tribunal,\" <em>Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713414\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/493/#p498\">401 U.S. 493</extracted-citation>, 498, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713414\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/493/#p498\">91 S.Ct. 1005</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11713414\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/493/#p498\">28 L.Ed.2d 256</extracted-citation> (1971). But the Court has failed to provide any analysis of the Constitution's text to justify our discretionary approach.</p><p id=\"p-12\">Although I have applied this Court's precedents in the past, see <em>Wyoming v. Oklahoma</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228362\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/437/#p474\">502 U.S. 437</extracted-citation>, 474, n., <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228362\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/437/#p474\">112 S.Ct. 789</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228362\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/437/#p474\">117 L.Ed.2d 1</extracted-citation> (1992) (dissenting opinion), I have since come to question those decisions, see <em>Nebraska</em> , <em>supra,</em> at ----, 136 S.Ct. at, 1035 (dissenting opinion). Arizona invites us to reconsider our discretionary approach, and I would do so. I respectfully dissent from the denial of leave to file a complaint.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
