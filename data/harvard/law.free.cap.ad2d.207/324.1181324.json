While there, the defendant attempted to escape from custody and was pursued by, among others, the plaintiff. The plaintiff was allegedly injured during that pursuit. The plaintiff then commenced this action to recover damages for injuries caused by the defendant\u2019s attempt to escape. The plaintiff asserted two causes of action, the first sounding in common-law negligence, and the second seeking damages pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>On the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs action, the court granted that branch of the motion which was to dismiss the plaintiffs cause of action sounding in common-law negligence, but denied that branch of the motion which was to dismiss the plaintiffs cause of action under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e, finding that the plaintiff had shown a sufficient nexus between his injuries and the alleged statutory violations. On appeal, the defendant contends that General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e was never intended to cover injuries caused to a police officer in the pursuit of a prisoner and, therefore, the court should have dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action in its entirety. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e now provides that police officers may recover damages when \"at any time or place\u201d during the performance or discharge of their duties, they are injured because of a person\u2019s failure to comply with \"the requirements\u201d, <em>inter alia, </em>of any State Statute. General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e contains no language providing for the exclusion urged by the defendant, and we see no reason to adopt such an interpretation. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s contention that a police officer may not properly recover under General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-e for injuries resulting from the violations of the Penal Law alleged by the plaintiff <em>(see, Matter of Worldwide Ins. Group v Wing, </em>202 AD2d 682; <em>Malsky v Towner, </em>196 AD2d 532; <em>Phalen v Kane, </em>192 AD2d 186).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We have considered the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Thompson, J. P., Balletta, Krausman and Florio, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
