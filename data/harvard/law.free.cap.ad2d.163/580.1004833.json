We disagree. In the absence of a request to submit a lesser included offense to the jury, a court\u2019s failure to do so does not constitute error <em>(see, </em>CPL 300.50 [2]). A review of this record indicates that the defendant failed to request that endangering the welfare of a child be charged as a lesser included offense of sodomy in the first degree.</p><p id=\"b608-7\">The defendant\u2019s further contention that the submission of an allegedly improper verdict sheet to the jury deprived him of a fair trial is not preserved for appellate review <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Braithwaite, </em>154 AD2d 543; <em>People v Weatherly, </em>144 AD2d 509). Moreover, reversal in the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction is not warranted under these circumstances. Thompson, J. P., Lawrence, Harwood and Balletta, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
