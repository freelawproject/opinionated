A trust deed gave power to the trustees to mortgage or sell land to pay a debt of the grantor, and to raise a specified amount to be paid to the grantor, or to O. M., as either might order. The income from the balance of the trust property was to be paid to the grantor, or to said O. M. The <em>corpus </em>was to be conveyed by the trustees to such persons as the grantor might, during life or by will, appoint. If the grantor died intestate, then to hold for O. M. and her children then living, free from the debts or control of the husband of O. M. The grantor died intestate, and without executing the power of appointment. C.

The bill stated the trust deed already in evidence; that Mary Milledge was dead, intestate, and without having appointed any one to take a conveyance of the property, as provided by the deed; that the minor complainants were the only children of the complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Catharine, and her husband, John Milledge, living at the death of the said Mary; that the trustees had sold some of the property and paid the mortgage to Anderson and the $3,000 00 mentioned in the deed, but had made no further sales; that they had afterwards resigned the trust, and John Milledge, the husband of the complainant, Catharine, had been appointed in their stead by the order of the Court; that there was due on the property $1,000 00 to Lamar, and $600 00 to one \"Wylly, for which he had a lien, left unpaid by the resigned trustees; that it was necessary to provide for the education of the two eldest children, but they were without means to procure it, unless means could be raised by a mortgage of the unsold property remaining in the hands of J ohn Milledge, the trustee; that the deed gave power to the trustees and their successors to sell and mortgage the property or any part of it, and that the complainants had applied to J ohn Milledge, as successor in <em>the. </em>trust, to mortgage the property to raise $4,100 00 to pay off the above mentioned incumbrances, and to educate the complainants, but that John Mil-ledge refused to do so, for want of authority, etc.; that all parties in interest were represented and consenting, and there was no question of fact in dispute.

The plaintiff moved for a new trial, upon the following grounds, to~wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-12\">1st. Because the Court did <em>not </em>charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the trust created by the trust deed from Mary Milledge to John W. Anderson and others, became executed upon the death of Mary Milledge; and that the said plaintiff then became the absolute owner, at law as well as in equity, of an undivided fifth of the property, the office of the trustee then ceasing as to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-13\">2d. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the order appointing John Milledge trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>under the said trust deed did not make him, trustee for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">3d. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the said order was void as to him, because he was not a party to the petition on which it. was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">4th. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the said order was void as to him, because he did not consent thereto, he being then an infant and incapable of such consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">5th. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the said order was void, because all parties in interest were not represented and consenting, the Court being without jurisdiction, even in term time, to make such an order in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, except where all parties in interest were represented and consenting, and there was no question of fact in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">6th. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the said order was fundamental to the decree afterwards granted; and the order being void, the decree was also void, at least as to the said plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-9\">7th. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the decree granted at Chambers was void, because the Judge, at Chambers, had no authority to grant such a decree, except with the consent of all parties in interest; it being apparent on the face of the bill that the plaintiff was an infant, and was not consenting because he could not consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">8th. Because the Court did not charge, as requested by the plaintiff, that the decree was void, because the Judge, at Chambers, had no authority to order a sale or mortgage of trust property for any purpose not involving the preservation or reinvestment of the trust fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-11\">9th. Because the Court charged substantially to the' contrary of each of the above propositions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-12\">The motion was overruled, and a new trial refused. To this decision the defendant excepted upon each of the grounds aforesaid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Jackson, Lawton <em>&amp; </em>Bassinger ; B. H. Hill &amp; Son ; Charles N. \"West, for plaintiffs in error, submitted the following brief:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">1st. Under the trust deed, Mrs. Catharine Milledge and her four children, who were living at the time of Mary Mil-ledge\u2019s death (of whom the plaintiff was one) were tenants in common of the property then remaining : 29 Ga., 403 ; 43 <em>Ibid., </em>327. And the trust became at that time executed: 7 Ga., 517 ; 23 <em>Ibid., </em>484; 32 <em>Ibid., </em>264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">2d. Before entering upon a discussion of the validity of the proceedings by means of which the plaintiff\u2019s lessor was deprived of his property, the attention of the Court-is asked to the haste with which they were conducted and some of the circumstances disclosed by the proceedings themselves. These indicate a degree of indifference and carelessness on the part of those who assumed to represent the minors interested, which, if not equivalent to fraud, demand of the Court the closest scrutiny into all that was done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">3d. The effect of the order appointing John Milledge trustee was not to make him trustee for the plaintiff\u2019s lessor : 43 Ga., 327.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">4th. The order was void as to the plaintiff, because he was not a party to the petition or represented therein: 25 Ga., 558 ; 27 <em>Ibid., </em>560 ; 30 <em>Ibid., </em>696 ; 1 Bailey\u2019s Equity Reports, 395; Hill on Trustees, 195. And the Court had no jurisdiction to make such an order in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, unless all parties in interest were represented and consenting: 3 <em>Dan. </em>Ch. Pr., 1801, 2076, 2094; R. M. Charlton, 109; 15 Ga., 319; Hill on Trustees, 194. See, also, Hill <em>vs. </em>Printup, decided in this Court, during its term commencing in January, 1873.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\">5th. If this order was void, the subsequent decree, which was in fact based upon it, must have been void also. For though persons <em>sui juris, </em>not bound by such an order, might possibly be held to accept the appointment as valid by filing a bill in pursuance of it, no such adoption or ratification can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>be predicted of a minor, or result from the use of Ms name by a <em>prochein ami.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-5\">6th. But there are objections to the decree at Chambers, irrespective of the invalidity of the order. The authority of the Chancellor to make it, if he had any, is to be sought in the Act of 1854: Acts 1853-4, pam., 59. This statute gave authority to make such a decree only \u201cwhere all parties in interest were represented and consenting,'\u201d etc. And it was apparent on the face of the bill that four of the parties in interest were minors, and could not consent; 4 Cranch C. C., 499. The consent required by the statute was not an implied, presumed, or inferential consent, but an express consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">7th. The decree was void, because granted for a purpose not within the statute, which gave no authority to order a sale or mortgage of trust property in Chambers, except for division or reinvestment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\">8th. In support of the last two positions we invoke not only the rule that statutory remedies must be exactly pursued, and the other rule that a statute authorizing proceedings by which a party may be deprived of his property must be strictly construed, but also the example of the English Court of Chancery when acting under statutes providing special proceedings : 2 English Law and Equity, 40; 11 <em>Ibid., </em>39-40; <em>IS Ibid., </em>375; 19 <em>Ibid., </em>319 ; 1 Mylne &amp; Keene, 677; 3 Dan. Ch. Pr., 2094.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-8\">Thomas E. Lloyd ; Haetbidge <em>&amp; </em>Chisholm, for defendants, argued as follows:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-9\">1st. The property in dispute was conveyed by Mary Mil-ledge to Anderson, Bartow and Lamar, and their <em>successors. </em>All the powers of the original trustees were given also to the successors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-10\">2d. The powers in that deed were to grant, bargain, sell, lease, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of said lots in whole or in part, and in such manner or upon such terms as the said trustees may seem meet and proper: <em>first, </em>to pay <em>incum</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>bronces; second, </em>to pay $3,000 to Catharine Milledge; and <em>third, </em>to <em>reinvest.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-5\">3d. And these powers vested in John Milledge as soon as he became the successor of Anderson, Bartow and Lamar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-6\">4th. Did John Milledge become such successor?</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\"><em>(a.) </em>On the 17th June, 1857, Anderson, Bartow and Lamar resigned; they could, by the terms of the deed, do this act: Adams\u2019 Eq., (marg. p.) 38, 36; Lewin on Trusts, 24 Law Lib., (marg. p.) 465.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-8\">(5.) By the resignation, the estate being unrepresented, was in charge of Chancellor, and he could appoint trustees on his own motion: Willard\u2019s Eq., 610; Jeremy\u2019s Eq., 173, (\u00ab,;) Adams\u2019 Eq., (marg. p.) 36 ; 5th Paige, 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-9\">(e.) The appointment in Georgia could be made on petition: 15th Ga. (See order and petition, June 17th, 1857.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-10\">5th. As a conclusion from the foregoing propositions, John Milledge had full power to make the mortgage, etc., and the purchaser, at a judicial sale, was not bound to look to the application of the proceeds: 7th John. Chan., 150; 1 Kelly, 324; Code, sec. 2586.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-11\">6th. But it may be argued that John Milledge was not only improperly appointed, but that admitting the legality of the appointment, the trust deed conferred no power to mortgage the property for <em>educational purposes. </em>If such objection be tenable, they are all overcome by the bill, answer and decree of 22d June, 1857.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-12\"><em>(a.) </em>The plaintiff in this case was a complainant in that bill, and though an infant, was properly represented by John C. <em>Sneed,prochein ami: </em>McPherson on Infants, 41 Law Lib., (marg.) 363 ; Cooper\u2019s Eq., 27.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-13\">(6.) The father was the person from whom he was demanding a right to an education, and could not act, and the bill could be filed by any one: <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-14\">(c.) The Court does not appoint the <em>prochein ami </em>of infant complainant: Font. Eq., 474, note; Reeves\u2019 Domestic Rel., 318 ; Cooper\u2019s Eq., 27.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-15\">(d.) The Court of equity has never scrupled to break the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>principal for <em>education: </em>McPherson on Infants, 41 Law Lib., (marg. p.) 253; Font. Eq., 473; 4th John. Chan., 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-5\">(e.) In this bill, answer and decree, there was then an equitable cause, with parties properly represented, and the decree based on the same is good: 41 Law Lib., (marg.) 386; 3 Atk., 626 ; 2 P. W., 519 ; 1 Atk., 631; 26 Ga., 547; 2 School &amp; Lefroy, 577.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\">7 th. If, then, the plaintiff, Gaza way Milledge, in the case at bar\u2019, was a complainant properly before the Court in the said bill, answer and decree of June 22d, 1857, all the admissions in the bill are evidence against him now and also estoppel: 44 N. Y., 158 ; 12 Ga., 52; 32 <em>Ibid., </em>565 ; Code, sections 3731, 3734, 3700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\"><em>(a.) </em>Those admissions are: 1st. That the trust estate was in debt to Wylly and Lamar, in the nature of liens. 2d. That it was necessary to raise money for education. 3d. That John Milledge was the <em>trustee: </em>See bill of June, 22d, 1857.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-8\">(6.) If John Milledge had never been trustee before, that decree authorizing him to act in this particular instance, is good against complainant and all acts under it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-9\">Trippe, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b408-10\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The question in this case which determines it and settles the other issues- presented is, whether the children of Mrs. Catharine Milledge, at the death of Mary Milledge, the grantor, took an equitable or a legal estate in the property mentioned in the deed. Did the trust continue as to them, or was it determined ? Or, in the language generally used in the authorities, was the trust executed at the death of the grantor? If the trust became an executed or determined trust at that time, as to the children, their interest or right, which then first accrued, or rather vested in them, was a-legal interest, and constituted in them a legal estate, subject to those rules of law, and those only, which govern legal estates. We think it is clear, from the instrument creating the estate, that on the death of Mary Milledge, intestate, and without having exercised her power of appointment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the children were let into an immediate right to a share of the property, and that the exclusive right of the grantor, or of Catharine Milledge, to have the income paid to the order of either, was then ended. It could not, of course, have been paid to any order of the grantor after her death, and had it been intended that Catharine Milledge should continue for life to possess that right solely in herself, it would have been so expressed; or, at least, a contrary provision would not have been immediately added. That provision is, that after the contingency of intestacy and non-appointment during life, the property should be held \u201cfor the said Catharine Mil-ledge, wife of the said John, and for the children of the said John and his said wife, living at the death of the party of the first part,\u201d the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In <em>Jackson vs. Coggin, </em>29 <em>Georgia, </em>403, property was given \u201cto Mary Scott and her children, free from the disposition of any future husband.\u201d It was held in a suit by one of the children against the executors of the will and the mother, that \u201cthe mother took as a joint tenant with her children,\u201d and a recovery was had by the child suing. There is nothing in the terms of this instrument, or in any rule of construction, that suspends the interests of the children to the death of Catharine Milledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Was this interest of the children a legal interest or estate? In the case just cited it was recognized as a legal right in the children, although the interest in the mother was the subject matter of a trust. In <em>Jordan vs. Thornton, 7 Georgia, </em>517, the bequest was to a trustee for the use of the mother for life, and at her death, to the use of her children. It was held that at the death of the mother, the children were the absolute owners of the property and could recover in their own right. The point was made that it was a continuing trust, under the terms of the will. But it was adjudged to be an <em>executed </em>trust. In <em>Pope and wife vs. Tucker, </em>23 <em>Georgia, </em>76, the decision was, that a gift to a father in trust for his children is not an executory, but an <em>executed trust, </em>and' that the children took a vested legal interest, and were entitled to recover in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>their own right. So in <em>Bowman vs. Long, </em>26 <em>Georgia, </em>142, where the bequest was to a trustee for the use of an infant grandson. The grandson had a guardian, and it was held that the child took both the legal and equitable estate, and that the guardian was entitled to the possession of the <em>corpus, </em>and further, that \u201cthe attempt to vest the title in a trustee was a failure.\u201d Again, in <em>Walker </em>vs. <em>Watson, </em>32 <em>Georgia, </em>264, the conveyance was to a trustee for the use of an orphan minoi\u2019, who had a guardian. The decision was, that the guardian was entitled to the possessioxx of the property as against the trustee, the trust being <em>exeeuted </em>and the possession following the use. The case of <em>Loyless vs. Blackshear et al., </em>43 <em>Georgia, </em>327, is more like the one under consideration, in the terms used in the conveyance specifying the beneficiaries, etc. That was a deed conveying certain, lands to the' husbland as trustee for his wife and children. It was held that the mother and her children then ixx life, took an estate as tenants in common, in fee simple, and that the chilclx\u2019en were entitled to a partition, in a proceeding in their own right, of the lands thus conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">These decisions, which ai\u2019e in accordance with all the authorities since the statute of uses, fully settle, we think, that the children of Mrs. Catharine Milledge took, at the death of Mary Milledge, an estate, as tenants in common with their mother, in the property remaining at the grantor\u2019s death, and that it was a legal estate in them, unaffected by any trust, the trust, except as to their mother\u2019s interest, being determined by the death of the grantor. The statute of uses declares, that \u201cwhen any person shall be seized of lands to the use, confidence or trust of another person,\u201d that person shall \u201cstand and be seized or possessed of the land, of and in like estates as they have in the use, trust or confidence, and that the estate of the person so seized to uses shall be declared to be in him or them that have the use in such quality, manner, form and condition as they had before in the use2 Bl. Com., 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The deed was executed by Mary Milledge, and the orders were passed by the Judge, in Chambers, seyei\u2019al yeai\u2019S before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the Code went into operation. The only authority that could be-claimed for the power exercised by the Judge was the Act of 20th February, 1854. Prior'to that Act, it was held, in <em>Arrington vs. </em>Cherry, 10 <em>Georgia, </em>429, that a Judge, at Chambers, had no power to order the sale of trust property; that chancery jurisdiction was conferred upon the <em>Superior Courts </em>and not upon the <em>Judges </em>thereof. It was never claimed in any case that the Judge, at Chambers, had power to order the sale of the legal estate of minors, or of any other person. There was another mode specially pointed out by law to effect the sale of the property of minor children, or of other wards, such.as lunatics, etc. The general rule was by an application to the Court of Ordinary. Whenever jurisdiction was exercised by a Chancery Court for that purpose before the Act of 1854, it was upon a <em>regular proceeding in equity, </em>and upon special cause shown. The Act of 1854, giving power to a Judge in Chambers to appoint and remove trustees, and to order the sale of property under certain conditions, applied only to cases of trust estates; such estates as should be in the hands of trustees, and perhaps to such property or assets as might be within equity jurisdiction by reason of some pending litigation in her Courts. In the case under consideration, where the estate in the children of Mrs. Catharine Milledge was a legal estate, there was no place for a trustee to fill, so far as they were concerned \u2014 no power to appoint to such an office, and of legal necessity \u2014 no authority to invest such a person with the right and control over the whole property. All the proceedings as to the appointment of the successor to the former trustees who resigned, and as to the order empowering the successor to incumber by mortgage the whole property, were founded on the assumption that the trust continued for the whole, the children as well as the mother. This not being true, to the extent of the children\u2019s interest, such proceedings were without authority of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
