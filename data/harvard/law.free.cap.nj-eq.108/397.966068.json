I granted the motion to strike out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-8\">\u201cIt appears that John Pinto and Carmela Pinto, on or .about December 1st, 1926, paid $2,000 to complainants, .according to a contract, and entered into possession of a property on Eoseville avenue, Newark. They took possession of the premises and have been in possession thereof ever .since and have been collecting the rents, issues and profits. It was arranged that the title should be closed on January 2d, 192?. Although retaining possession of the property, defendants refused to pay the taxes,'the interest and installments of the principal on the mortgage specified in the contract of sale, and refused to accept the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">\u201cThe answer says that complainants did not perform the .terms and conditions of the agreement, in that they did not .complete the inside work of the building and failed to do .some work on the outside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-10\">\u201cIt seems to me that having been in possession of the property for nearly three years they are not entitled now to set up any such defense. I, therefore, will advise a decree .dismissing the answer.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Mr. Ferdinand D. </em>Masucci, for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-4\"><em>Mr. Frederick E. </em>Pilch, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The order appealed from will be affirmed, for the reasons-, stated in 'the memorandum filed in the court below by Vice-Chancellor Church.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-7\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014The Chief-Justice, Teen chard, Campbell, Lloyd, Case, Bodine, Daly, Donges, Van Buskirk,, McGlennon, Kays, Hetfield, Dear, Wells, JJ. 14.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b436-8\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014None.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
