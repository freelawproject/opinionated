The time draft was to be security for the performance of Sharp\u2019s obligations under the trust receipt. The time draft was drawn to the order of the securities company, to mature June 20th, 1924, and recited that it was security for Sharp\u2019s obligation under the trust receipt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-4\">\u201cSharp took the car to Plainfield, put it in a warehouse, and on April 11th, borrowed $950 from defendant Brunson, giving Brunson the warehouse receipt as security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">\u201cOn May 10th, Sharp sold the car to complainant on a conditional sales agreement. Complainant paid part cash and agreed to pay the balance of $801 in twelve monthly installments, evidenced by his promissory note (payable at the office of the securities company), attached to the conditional sales agreement. Sharp endorsed the note in blank, executed an assignment of his interest in the conditional sales agreement and note and delivered the assignment, agreement and note to Brunson; Brunson surrendered the warehouse receipt and the car was delivered to complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-6\">\u201cBrunson sent the conditional sales agreement and note to the securities company, with a letter signed by Sharp and written on Sharp\u2019s letterhead, asking them to \u2018draw your check for the proceeds due us made payable to A. J. Brunson and mail it to 105 East Front street, Plainfield, New Jersey\u2019 (Brunson\u2019s address), but saying nothing about the assignment to Brunson, which assignment was retained by Brunson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-7\">\u201cThe securities company, having a balance due them from Sharp of $950.48 (more than the entire face of the note), figured that there was nothing \u2018clue\u2019 Sharp, and sent no check to Brunson. Brunson and the securities company knew nothing of each others claims in the matter until June, when there was some correspondence between them. Complainant has paid to the securities company three installments on the note, and paid the balance into court and obtained decree of interpleader against the two claimants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cThe securities company had no prior claim over Brunson by reason of the so-called \u2018trust receipt.\u2019 It is contended on behalf of that company that it was the purchaser and owner of the car\u2014not Sharp; but the proofs contradict this. It is true that the securities company gave its check to the Newark Flint Company for the full purchase price of the car, but Sharp contemporaneously gave the securities company his check for twenty per cent, of that amount (together with the time draft for the balance and the \u2018trust receipt\u2019). Markey, the officer of the securities company who handled the transaction admitted, when questioned by the court, that the securities company advanced the money to Sharp so that he might purchase the car. The evidence also shows that Sharp, not the securities company, got the manufacturer\u2019s invoice for the car. The securities company was in the business of financing the purchase of cars for others, not buying cars for its own account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-4\">\u201cIt is quite clear that Sharp bought the car and was the owner thereof, not the securities company. It follows that the so-called \u2018trust agreement\u2019 was in fact and essence a chattel mortgage. <em>Commonwealth Finance Corp. </em>v. Schutt, <em>97 N. J. Law 225. </em>It was not verified or recorded, and was invalid as against Brunson, who had no notice. Since Sharp was the owner of the car, he received the proceeds of his subsequent sale of the car not as bailee or trustee for the securities company, but for himself, as his own property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">\u201cThe conditional sale agreement is not particularly material in the present case. It was simply security for the payment of the note given by Karkuff to Sharp\u2014and that note has been paid by Karkuff by the payment into court of the balance due thereon\u2014this suit being as to the ownership of such balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">\u201cThe proofs show that when Sharp sold the car to Karkuff and took the latter\u2019s note, he (Sharp) endorsed the note in blank and delivered it (together with an assignment of the conditional sale agreement) to Brunson, in exchange for Brunson\u2019s delivery of the warehouse receipt. Title to the note thus passed to Brunson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201cBrunson, having title to the note, sent it (and the conditional sale agreement) to the securities company, with the letter from Sharp to the securities company hereinbefore referred to, not disclosing himself (Brunson) as having title to the note or conditional sale agreement, or any interest therein\u2014hut in such way as to appear that Sharp had title and was himself endorsing and sending the papers as his (Sharp\u2019s) own transaction with the securities company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">\u201cThe securities company had no other knowledge' or notice of Brunson\u2019s claim or interest, and acted on their belief of Sharp\u2019s ownership\u2014a belief caused by Brunson\u2014so that instead of sending to Brunson, as Sharp requested, the balance apparently due to Sharp after deduction of its own charges for collection and other services, the securities company kept that balance and credited the amount upon the indebtedness which Sharp owed on his original note. This it would have had a perfect right to do, so far as the arrangements between it and Sharp were concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">\u201cBrunson contends that the securities company had notice of his claim or interest by reason of prior dealings between himself and Sharp and the securities company. This contention is without basis, for the proofs show that there had not been a prior transaction similar to this (where Sharp sold a car on which the securities company had a trust receipt), and also show that there had been no prior transaction in which Brunson was involved bjr name\u2014the prior transactions had been with a bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">\u201cThe situation then, reduced to its simple and material elements, is this:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">\u201cB. (Brunson) sends C. (the securities company) a promissory note made by K., payable to bearer, at the same time causing C. to believe that it is S. who is sending it. C. receives it as coming from S., discounts it, and credits the proceeds on a prior indebtedness due from S. to O. A'number of weeks elapse before B. discloses the facts to C. and asserts claim of ownership of the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">\u201cIn this situation it seems clear that Brunson is estopped from asserting his ownership of the note. In reliance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>his representation the securities company changed its position, by crediting Sharp with payment of about seventy-five per cent, of his debt instead of suing him or otherwise enforcing the collection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-4\">\u201cThe securities company is entitled to the fund in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-5\"><em>Mr. Robert Newton </em>Grane, for the defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-6\"><em>Mr. Andrew J. </em>Whinery, for the complainant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The decree appealed from will be affirmed, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed in the court below by Vice-Chancellor Buchanan.</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-9\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014The Chiee-Justicb, Parker, Kalisch, Black, Campbell, Lloyd, Case, Bodine, White, Van Bus-kirk, McG-lennon, Kays, Heteield, Dear, JJ. 14.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b170-10\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014None.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
