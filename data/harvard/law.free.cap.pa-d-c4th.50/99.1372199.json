The first, from that denial itself, was docketed by the Superior Court at number 2464 EDA 2000. Judge MassiahJackson has already filed an opinion in support of her decision, which I mention only for the sake of completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The second appeal \u2014 which was taken from my June 21, 1999 order,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thus necessitating this opinion \u2014 was docketed by the Superior Court at number 2466 EDA 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The third appeal, docketed by the Superior Court at number 2467 EDA 2000, was taken from an order entered on March 31, 1999 by the Honorable Jacqueline Allen, denying the defendants\u2019 motion to compel discovery, specifically certain documents for which the attorney-client privilege was asserted. Similarly, Judge Allen has already issued an opinion in support of her decision, and I therefore mention the third appeal only for the sake of clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Because the <em>defendants </em>have appealed, and the plaintiffs have not, I will also briefly discuss why I <em>denied </em>the remainder of the defendants\u2019 motion, though \u2014 from a practical standpoint \u2014 the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff at trial strongly (if not conclusively) indicates that my decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On August 14, 1992, plaintiff Janice Rota delivered her first child, by caesarean section, at Methodist Hospital. Shortly thereafter, she began to complain of pain in her lower back, heavy bleeding, diarrhea and fever, but she was nevertheless discharged from Methodist on August 18, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">On August 24, 1992, Ms. Rota \u2014 who was still experiencing those symptoms \u2014 visited the defendants\u2019 office, and was examined by Dr. Jenofsky, who discovered a large pelvic abscess behind her uterus. She was readmitted to Methodist Hospital on that same day; a pelviscopy was performed on August 31,1992, and a JP drain was installed to drain the abscess, and the plaintiff was discharged from Methodist on September 7, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 suit was filed on August 6,1997, nearly five years after the treatment described above; the statute of limitations for tort claims is, of course, <em>two </em>years.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>I granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising from the treatment rendered to Ms. Rota in 1992, because it is clear from the face of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that the existence of those claims was \u2014 or should have become \u2014 clear to the plaintiffs at or about the time that Ms. Rota experienced the symptoms described above, or at the absolute latest, in August, 1993 when she met with counsel to discuss the filing of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">There is thus no basis to apply a \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to toll the statute of limitations as to those claims, and\u2014 because they are clearly time-barred \u2014 my decision to dismiss them was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">By the same token, it was <em>not </em>clear from the record (as it existed at the time that I considered the motion) that Ms. Rota <em>knew </em>(or should have known), at any time before October, 1996 (when, the parties agree, Dr. Gocial so advised her) that she would be unable to again conceive naturally.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In short, the defendants\u2019 argument turns on their contention that the abscess and infection suffered by Ms. Rota in 1992 (for which the statute of limitations was <em>not </em>tolled) placed her on notice of <em>all </em>claims possibly arising from her August, 1992 treatment, and that if the statute of limitations expired as to <em>some </em>of those claims, it must be treated as having expired as to <em>all </em>of those claims, thus barring the infertility claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Summary judgment is reserved for the clearest of cases, in which reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion. Based upon the parties\u2019 submissions, I felt that the nature and extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge regarding the infertility claims presented a factual dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>pute that could only properly be resolved by a jury, and in such instances, summary judgment is inappropriate,</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">Because I had no further role in the disposition of this case, I will defer to my colleagues, Judges Allen and Massiah-Jackson, on the remaining issues raised in post-trial motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-10\">. At the time that I considered this motion, defendant Methodist Hospital had been stipulated out of the case; all of the remaining defendants had joined in the motion, but because I did not dismiss <em>all claims </em>as to <em>all defendants, </em>my order only became appealable after the remainder of the case was tried to a verdict, and post-trial motions were disposed of. Thus measured, the notice of appeal from my order was timely, even though it was filed more than a year after its entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
