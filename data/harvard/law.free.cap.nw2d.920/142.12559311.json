On remand, while retaining jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals shall remand this case to the Wayne Circuit Court for further consideration. The trial court shall determine: (1) whether the trial court ordered a DNA test at Department of Health and Human Services expense, as stated by the referee, and, if so, whether the testing occurred; (2) whether the trial court extended the time for the putative father to establish paternity; and (3) whether the putative father was able to speak at the termination trial by speakerphone and whether he waived any issue regarding the DNA test or the establishment of paternity by not requesting an adjournment. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court shall forward the record and its findings to the Court of Appeals, which shall then reconsider these issues and the issues raised by the appellant in his brief on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
