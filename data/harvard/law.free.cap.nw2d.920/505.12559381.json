The referee considered Attorney Parks'\n   objection to costs and recommends we impose the full costs of this proceeding on Attorney Parks. The\n   OLR did not seek restitution and the referee did not recommend a restitution award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In his appeal, Attorney Parks argues that the evidence was insufficient to support many of the referee's factual findings and all of the referee's conclusions determining misconduct. Attorney Parks argues further that even if the referee's conclusions are upheld, the violations only support a license suspension of, at most, less than six months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Upon careful review of this matter, we uphold all of the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law and conclude that a 14-month suspension of Attorney Parks' license to practice law is an appropriate sanction for his misconduct. We also deny Attorney Parks' objection to costs. We see no reason to deviate from our usual custom, which is to require an attorney who has committed misconduct to pay the full costs of the proceeding, which are $42,226.26 as of July 6, 2018. The OLR did not seek restitution and no restitution is ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Attorney Parks was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1991. He has not previously been disciplined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The allegations giving rise to this complaint stem from the time Attorney Parks was employed at the firm of Zacherl, O'Malley &amp; Endejan (the firm), from 1995 until May 2013. He worked in the Ripon office. In April 2013, Attorney Parks announced he was leaving the firm. Following Attorney Parks' departure, the firm filed a grievance with the OLR, stating, among other things, that it had discovered that Attorney Parks had performed unauthorized legal work \"on the side\" (\"non-firm work\") while employed by the firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On January 12, 2016, the OLR filed a complaint against Attorney Parks. Initially, the OLR alleged 19 counts of misconduct. As the case proceeded, the OLR's complaint was twice amended, ultimately alleging 14 counts of misconduct. The first four counts involve allegations of unauthorized fee reductions and non-firm work. Counts five through 13 allege misconduct related to Attorney Parks' handling of several matters related to C.D. and her relatives. Count 14 alleged noncooperation with the OLR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Attorney Parks filed an answer refuting most of the allegations. The parties engaged in extensive discovery. Prior to the evidentiary hearing, the parties filed stipulated facts. The referee conducted a three day evidentiary hearing in October 2017 at which some 18 witnesses testified. The referee issued a report on February 7, 2018, concluding that Attorney Parks committed eight of the 14 alleged counts of misconduct, that OLR had failed to prove six counts, and recommending a 14-month license suspension. Attorney Parks objected to costs. The referee issued a separate ruling, concluding that full costs were warranted. Attorney Parks appeals. The OLR did not cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 On appeal, we consider whether the referee's findings are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Carroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402316\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/248/662/\">\n    2001 WI 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402316\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/248/662/\">\n    248 Wis. 2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402316\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/248/662/\">\n    636 N.W.2d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He contends that L.E. \"is resentful over her own tumultuous relationship with her mother\" and that Attorney Z. resents that Attorney Parks left the firm to start his own competing practice. This record is replete with accusations of lying; many of the issues turn on credibility assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Credibility issues are left to the discretion of the trial court, or, in the case of a disciplinary proceeding, the referee.\n   <em>\n    Gehr v.

In this matter, the referee's credibility determinations are intertwined with his findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Charlton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8666813\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/174/844/\">\n    174 Wis. 2d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8666813\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/174/844/\">\n    498 N.W.2d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Many of the referee's conclusions rest on implicit findings about the relative credibility of witnesses. When a court does not make an explicit finding, an implicit finding may suffice, but only if the facts of record support it.\n   <em>\n    State v. Echols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8666768\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/175/653/#p672\">\n    175 Wis. 2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8666768\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/175/653/#p672\">\n    499 N.W.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Non-firm work and fee reductions (Counts One-Four)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The OLR alleged that that by engaging in self-dealing and misappropriating fees from the firm by performing and privately billing for non-firm legal work while employed by the firm, Attorney Parks violated SCR 20:8.4(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count One).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The referee concluded that the OLR established this allegation. Attorney Parks admits in the stipulated facts that he performed legal work for approximately 30 clients \"on the side,\" collected at least $13,875 in fees, and deposited the fees into his personal account. Attorney Parks also admits he did not run conflicts of interest checks through the firm's client management software. The referee acknowledged but was clearly unpersuaded by Attorney Parks' assertion that one of the firm's partners gave him permission to handle some estate work \"off the books.\" The referee noted that \"files found on the firm's computer involved, among other things, small claims cases, contract and traffic cases, and custody disputes in addition to wills, that Parks handled and [Attorney Z.] denies giving any such permission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Attorney Parks attacks several aspects of the referee's findings and his legal conclusion that Attorney Parks violated SCR 20:8.4(c). As he argued to the referee, Attorney Parks maintains that one of the firm's partners, Attorney Z., was well aware of Attorney Parks' non-firm work and, indeed, approved it. Attorney Parks claims this practice began in 2005, when one of Attorney Z's own clients could not pay a large legal bill so an arrangement was made whereby the client did remodeling work on Attorney Parks' home and Attorney Parks, in turn, paid the firm to reduce the client's outstanding legal balance. Attorney Parks claims this bartering plan went awry, and Attorney Parks took out a home equity loan to complete the project, which Attorney Z. co-signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Attorney Parks claims that over time, Attorney Z. regretted having co-signed the loan and that Attorney Z. encouraged Attorney Parks to conduct non-firm estate planning work so that Attorney Parks\n   could earn extra money with which\n   to accelerate his efforts to refinance the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Attorney Z. flatly denied that he authorized Attorney Parks to engage in non-firm work. The firm's other partner, Attorney O., also denied authorizing any non-firm work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Attorney Parks says that the referee's finding that files pertaining to outside work were found \"on the firm's computer\" is clearly erroneous. He maintains that all such files were kept on a computer belonging to Attorney Parks' acquaintance, C.D., so there would have been no such files on the firm's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Post-briefing, the referee advised the court and the parties in writing that his reference to files on \"the firm's computer\" was indeed a \"minor factual error\" and that the report should be amended to clarify that the documents in question were found on C.D.'s computer, not the firm's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 As corrected, the referee's finding of fact is not clearly erroneous. Moreover, we are of the opinion that in making this finding, the referee was focused less on where files were found (although that is relevant to other allegations) and more on noting that even if Attorney Z. had authorized Attorney Parks to engage in some non-firm estate work, Attorney Parks clearly engaged in other non-firm work that exceeded the scope of any authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Attorney Parks also complains that the referee made only an \"implicit\" credibility determination and says the facts of record do not support it. He maintains that Attorney Z. is engaged in \"serial dissembling\" and points to evidence he believes supports this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 For example, Attorney Parks notes that Attorney Z. initially told the OLR that Attorney Parks made a deal with a client, M.W., to reduce M.W.'s legal fees in exchange for M.W. creating a legal website for Attorney Parks. The OLR's first complaint alleged misconduct related to this incident but dropped the charge when the complaint was amended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21 The referee noted that both partners denied giving Attorney Parks permission to engage in non-firm work. Although Attorney Parks argues that the referee failed to give adequate weight to his evidence, the referee clearly weighed the credibility of Attorney Parks' testimony and found it wanting. We will not reassess Attorney Parks' credibility. We conclude that the record supports the referee's findings and conclusion pertaining to count one and we accept them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    2004 WI 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    269 Wis. 2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9221653\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/269/43/\">\n    675 N.W.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 22 Turning to count two, the referee concluded, based primarily on Attorney Parks' own stipulated admission, that by earning fees from non-firm legal work, Attorney Parks violated a standard of conduct set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Shea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8665459\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/190/560/\">\n    190 Wis. 2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8665459\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/190/560/\">\n    527 N.W.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), actionable via SCR 20:8.4(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count Two).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 Attorney Parks disputes the referee's conclusion that he violated SCR 20:8.4(f) for the same reasons he disputes that he committed the misconduct alleged in count one; he maintains that Attorney Z. authorized him to perform non-firm work. Again, this turned on a credibility determination, albeit an implicit one, that we will not disturb. It is sufficiently supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 Counts three and four of the second amended complaint allege that Attorney Parks made unauthorized fee reductions, and/or accepted services that benefitted him personally in exchange for a reduction of legal fees, at the firm's expense. Specifically, the OLR alleged that: (1) in 2012, Attorney Parks reduced client M.W.'s legal fee by $3,122.70 without firm approval; (2) Attorney Parks agreed to reduce client R.C.'s attorney fees in exchange for R.C. performing remodeling work on Attorney Parks' home; and (3) Attorney Parks agreed to credit legal fees owed by client H.W. in exchange for H.W. doing body work on Attorney Parks' car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 The referee concluded, based specifically on the testimony of R.C. and H.W., that Attorney Parks engaged in self-dealing in violation of SCR 20:8.4(c) (Count Three) by collaborating with R.C. and H.W. for them to perform remodeling and auto work in exchange for a reduction of legal fees owed to the firm. The referee also concluded that Attorney Parks violated the standard of conduct set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Shea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8665459\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/190/560/\">\n    190 Wis. 2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8665459\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/190/560/\">\n    527 N.W.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , actionable via SCR 20:8.4(f) (Count Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26 In alleging count four the OLR referenced three incidents: the write down of M.W.'s fee, exchanging fees for remodeling services with R.C., and exchanging fees for auto body work with H.W. In reaching his conclusion regarding count four, the referee focused only on the write down of M.W.'s fee. The referee acknowledged Attorney Parks' version of events but clearly found credible and relied on the testimony of both Attorneys Z. and O., that Attorney Parks did not have authority to write down a substantial amount of legal fees, and concluded that Attorney Parks thus violated SCR 20:8.4(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 27 Attorney Parks refutes these conclusions and says the referee's implicit determination that these witnesses are credible is belied by other record evidence. Attorney Parks admits that he reduced M.W.'s fee, but maintains he was authorized to do so\n   and was transparent about it. He says the fee reduction was recorded in\n   the firm's billing system so there was no \"concealment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 28 Attorney Parks contends that although he was not a partner, the firm was run-to quote Attorney Parks' former legal secretary-like \"a group of solo practitioners all housed under the same roof.\" As such, he says that he had discretion over the cases he accepted and over fees, and that he had authority to authorize fee reductions. He says there was no firm policy prohibiting fee reductions. He cites corroborating testimony from other firm staff members who also reported reducing fees without permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 29 Moreover, he says that, as a factual matter, he did not reduce R.C. or H.W.'s fees in exchange for services. He says R.C.'s affidavit is \"preposterous\" \"incoherent and incredible\" and that the record evidence, namely cancelled checks and the testimony of his former wife, shows he paid R.C. for the work performed on his home. He alleges that both R.C. and H.W. lied in their affidavits, in exchange for fee reductions that were offered by the firm, not by him. Again, he says that his evidence is more credible than the opposition and that the referee improperly focused on whether he had permission to write down fees rather than the alleged misconduct, which turned on whether he traded fee discounts for personal work which, again, he asserts he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 30 The referee's findings implicitly accept, as credible, the testimony of Attorney Z. and Attorney O. and the testimony of the two clients, each of whom contradicted Attorney Parks' account of what transpired. The record evidence indicates that Attorney Parks was an associate, the firm paid the overhead, he was paid a percentage of his billings, and he needed\n   approval to authorize a significant fee reduction. We accept the referee's findings and conclusions of law regarding counts three and four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Counts Five-13: Interactions with C.D. and her relatives\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 31 The OLR alleged nine counts of misconduct relating to Attorney Parks' interactions with C.D. and her relatives. The referee concluded that Attorney Parks committed the misconduct alleged in four of the nine counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 32 Attorney Parks and C.D. became acquainted in the early 1990s. Their lives were interconnected until her death in May 2013. Attorney Parks represented C.D. in a divorce in 1996 and in a personal injury claim in 2008. He reviewed documents regarding a loan C.D. made to her daughter, and answered her legal questions on occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 33 Attorney Parks also occasionally used C.D.'s computer for his own work and, although he disputes it, there is record evidence that C.D. did some secretarial work for Attorney Parks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney Parks was a landlord and rented a home to C.D. beginning in 2008 until her death. In 2010, Attorney Parks and his then-wife borrowed $35,000 as an unsecured loan from C.D. Attorney Parks says that as C.D. became ill, he served as C.D.'s Power of Attorney, took her to medical appointments, and visited her at home and after she moved to a nursing home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 34 Attorney Parks was also close friends with C.D.'s daughter, L.E., and her husband, T.E. Attorney Parks represented T.E. in a personal injury case, wrote two wills for the couple, and was the best man at their wedding. Attorney Parks says that\n   the relationship between mother (C.D.) and daughter (L.E.) was characterized by ongoing conflict and tension, in part because of a failed trucking business. Attorney Parks was also acquainted with C.D.'s sister, G.S., who is L.E.'s aunt. Attorney Parks represented G.S. in a divorce proceeding in 2011 and 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The $5,000 \"Bonus\" (Counts Five and Six)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 35 Attorney Parks represented T.E. in a personal injury case. The firm's standard contingency fee agreement provided that the firm would receive 33 percent of any recovery for attorney fees. The OLR alleged that at the time of settlement, without authorization from the firm, Attorney Parks unilaterally reduced the attorney fees from 33 percent to 25 percent, a $12,000 fee reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 36 T.E. and L.E. claim that thereafter, Attorney Parks mentioned, on some three occasions, that clients sometimes gave him a bonus. Then, during the meeting to obtain their settlement money, Attorney Parks asked about \"his $5,000 bonus.\" There was testimony that the couple had little money at this time, but felt compelled to give him the requested bonus. L.E. said that she wrote a $5,000 check and handed it to Attorney Parks. He handed it back and asked that she write \"gift\" on the memo line, which she did. The fee reduction and \"gift\" meant the firm received $33,000 in legal fees instead of $45,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 37 The referee concluded that Attorney Parks violated SCR 20:8.4(c) by unilaterally and without authorization reducing the firm's attorney fees, and by seeking and accepting an unauthorized $5,000 \"gift\" from L.E. and T.E. (Count Five). The referee concluded further that by engaging in self-dealing after seeking and accepting a \"gift\" from L.E. and T.E. in exchange for a reduction of legal fees owed to the firm, Attorney Parks violated a standard of conduct set forth in\n   <em>\n    Shea\n   </em>\n   , actionable via SCR 20:8.4(f) (Count Six).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 38 Attorney Parks appeals these findings and conclusions. He reiterates that he had authority to unilaterally reduce legal fees especially where, as here, he thought it was necessary to facilitate the settlement. He points to an anecdote from a legal assistant who once suggested to a partner that Attorney Parks should reduce a fee for another client and the partner said he would not \"force the reduction of fees.\" Attorney Parks says this confirms that he had fee setting authority. He insists that the check was an unsolicited gift, as evidenced by his own testimony and that of his former wife, who thanked the couple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 39 With respect to count six, Attorney Parks suggests that unlike the lawyer in\n   <em>\n    Shea\n   </em>\n   , he was not a partner at the firm and there was no firm policy to violate, so his only duty to the firm was a duty of loyalty. He says he did not violate that duty by making a reasonable judgment call to reduce a fee in order to facilitate a settlement that might otherwise have failed. Attorney Parks maintains that there is no evidence that he arranged the gift in exchange or as a quid pro quo for the fee reduction. So, Attorney Parks contends that the referee's conclusion, that he violated SCR 20:8.4(f), is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 40 A review of the record demonstrates that in this instance, the referee clearly believed the testimony of L.E. and T.E., noting that they were in \"dire financial straits\" when they received their settlement and that both testified that the \"gift\" was not their idea, they did not offer it, and felt they needed to pay it to receive their settlement. Both of the firm's partners testified that the fee reduction was not authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 41 The referee also rejected Attorney Parks' suggestion that counts five and six are duplicative, explaining that count five addresses Attorney Parks' misconduct vis a vis his client, while count six pertains to his misconduct vis a vis his duty of loyalty to his firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 42 We adopt the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to these two counts. Although mindful of Attorney Parks' defense, we cannot conclude that the referee's findings, particularly since they rely heavily on the credibility of the witnesses, are clearly erroneous. The findings indicate that Attorney Parks unilaterally and without authority reduced the legal fees that would be paid to the firm then essentially recouped his own portion of that reduction by persuading the clients to pay him a bonus.

The OLR focused on the statement of C.D.'s physician that \"it is more likely than not that C.D. was not competent\" when she signed the vehicle title.

Relying in part on the expert testimony of Attorney Mark Munson regarding the appropriate conduct of a power of attorney, the referee was persuaded that on this record, although the conduct was \"questionable,\" there was no showing that Attorney Parks' action adversely affected anyone's interests. C.D.'s belongings remained in the rental property during June and July and T.E. and L.E. stayed in the property during that\n   time. This finding has not been shown to be clearly erroneous and we accept the referee's conclusion; count 11 is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Release (Count 12)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 51 The OLR alleged and the referee agreed that Attorney Parks committed fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in violation of SCR 20:8.4(c) by the manner in which he obtained the signatures of L.E. and G.S. on a \"release,\" and the terms of the release he drafted relating to C.D.'s will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 52 C.D. designated her sister, G.S., and Attorney Parks as the primary beneficiaries of her will. C.D.'s will provided that Attorney Parks was to receive 40 percent of her payable on death accounts and 40 percent forgiveness of the balance of the $35,000 loan from C.D. She also left Attorney Parks her \"rifle, outdoor furniture, tools, air compressor, John Deere tractor, push mower, chain saw, and rototiller.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 53 The will provided that G.S. was to receive 60 percent of C.D.'s payable on death accounts, C.D.'s vehicle, and what was left on Attorney Parks' loan (after the partial forgiveness) which was then about $21,351. The will forgave a loan to L.E. but otherwise excluded her daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 54 C.D. died in May 2013. A few weeks later, G.S. and L.E. met with Attorney Parks to discuss C.D.'s estate. Both G.S. and L.E. testified that they thought Attorney Parks represented them in connection with the estate. Attorney Parks testified that he told them both, verbally, that he was not acting as their attorney, but \"regrettably I didn't send them a letter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 55 On May 24, 2013, the three met at a bank to finalize distribution of C.D.'s bank accounts. There, Attorney Parks asked them each to sign, and both G.S. and L.E. did sign, a document entitled \"Full and Final Settlement &amp; Release of All Claims.\" Both testified that they believed the document was necessary to close out the bank accounts. The \"release\" which was drafted by Attorney Parks provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 G.S. and L.E. both released and discharged all claims and liabilities against Attorney Parks that may exist now or in the future regarding all sums that he (and his wife, etc.) may have owed to C.D. or her estate in any form known or unknown, including, but not limited to, contractual or due to his role as power of attorney for C.D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 They agreed that no probate would be initiated by any of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 They agreed that they had divided the personal property and that they were satisfied with the division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 G.S. would receive Attorney Parks' share of C.D.'s payable-on-death accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 G.S. had to pay the funeral bill and any other of C.D.'s debts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 56 Essentially, this document released Attorney Parks from all liability, permitted him to keep whatever personal property he had received from C.D., and excused him from repaying the balance of his loan which was at least $21,351. In exchange,\n   G.S. received all of the payable on death money, which was some $28,872.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 57 The OLR alleged that as a result of this document, G.S. received $1,261.72 less than she was entitled to receive and she did not receive C.D.'s\n   vehicle because that had been sold-by Attorney Parks to himself-shortly before C.D. died.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 58 The referee found that Attorney Parks failed to tell L.E. that he did not represent her or G.S., and failed to tell them that they should seek the advice of another attorney because he had an interest in the estate. The referee concluded that Attorney Parks' conduct pertaining to the release constituted misconduct that violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 59 Attorney Parks appeals. He maintains that the release reflected the three beneficiaries' agreement among themselves. He explained that G.S. wanted a car but did not want C.D.'s car so there was no conflict over his purchase of the vehicle. He adds that G.S. wanted a lump sum of cash, not years of modest monthly loan payments from Attorney Parks, hence the decision to forgive his loan but give G.S. all the payable on death accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 60 As evidence that G.S. and L.E. acceded to this agreement, Attorney Parks notes that L.E. brought a death certificate to the bank and that he wrote \"per agreement\" on a check he signed over to G.S. He says he did not threaten or force anyone and says that he did not tell L.E. she had to sign. He claims the fact he gave them copies of the release reflects his transparency. He claims that no one suffered any ill effect as a result of this document, but concedes that, because he was a beneficiary, it was a \"poor decision.\" However, he says that there was no deceit, so there was no violation of SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 61 We are not persuaded. The referee clearly accepted the testimony of the two women that they neither fully understood what the \"release\" provided nor understood why they were signing it. Inducing G.S. and L.E., in the immediate aftermath of the death of their sister and mother, to sign a patently self-serving document designed to insulate himself from liability at the potential expense of G.S. was more than a \"poor decision.\" We wholly agree with the referee's conclusion that \"Parks' conduct in this regard involved 'dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation' within the meaning of the Rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conflict (Count 13)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 62 The referee concluded that the OLR failed to prove that Attorney Parks violated\n   SCR 20:1.7(a)(2) based on the theory that he was representing G.S. and L.E. in May 2013 when they were finalizing C.D.'s estate. While the two women may have thought Attorney Parks was representing their interests as related to C.D.'s estate, the referee found that there was no evidence that Attorney Parks was providing legal services to G.S. at that time, and L.E.'s own testimony indicated she did not consider him her lawyer at that time. These findings have not been shown to be clearly erroneous and we accept the referee's conclusion. Count 13 is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Non-cooperation (Count 14)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 63 The referee also concluded that the OLR failed to prove that Attorney Parks violated SCR 22.03(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   SCR 22.03(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   by failing to cooperate with the OLR (Count 14). The OLR pointed to certain issues, such as Attorney Parks' failure to provide certain client names or a list of non-firm files on which he worked. The referee disagreed, finding that at most \"Parks was guilty of some inconsistencies in his responses to the committee's inquiries....\" This finding has not been shown to be clearly erroneous and we accept the referee's conclusion. Count 14 is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 64 We accept the referee's factual findings and conclusions of law and agree that Attorney Parks committed the professional misconduct alleged in counts one through six, eight, and 12 of the OLR's second amended complaint. We dismiss counts seven, nine, 10-11, and 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Recommended Discipline\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 65 Attorney Parks contends that the recommended discipline-a 14-month license suspension-is excessive, even if the referee's conclusions relating to misconduct are upheld. Attorney Parks argues that his misconduct is not so serious that he should be required to petition for reinstatement and prove his moral character and fitness to practice law. Attorney Parks argues that a license suspension of less than six months is sufficient. The OLR maintains that \"Parks' pervasively dishonest conduct merits a lengthy suspension, whether that be the two-year suspension it had recommended, [or] the 14 month suspension recommended by the referee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 66 Ultimately, it is this court's responsibility to determine appropriate discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Reitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006373\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/279/550/\">\n    2005 WI 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006373\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/279/550/\">\n    279 Wis. 2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006373\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/279/550/\">\n    694 N.W.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See SCR 22.24(1m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 75 Applying these factors, we are not persuaded that a reduction in fees is warranted here. We acknowledge that, after more than 25 years in practice, Attorney Parks has no prior discipline. We consider that the OLR alleged but failed to prove that Attorney Parks was uncooperative with the OLR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 76 The other factors do not weigh in support of a cost reduction. The OLR alleged 14 counts of misconduct. Attorney Parks contested them all. The referee ultimately concluded, and we agree, that Attorney Parks committed eight counts of misconduct. The OLR sought a two-year suspension while Attorney Parks argued that a suspension of less than six months was\n   appropriate. The referee recommended and we accept a 14-month license suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 77 In the\n   <em>\n    Arellano\n   </em>\n   case, we observed that the ultimate misconduct found and discipline imposed were not only much less than initially sought, but were also of a materially different nature. Here, although Attorney Parks was exonerated on a number of claims pertaining to his dealings with C.D., he was nonetheless deemed to have committed four separate violations of SCR 20:8.4(c), involving fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 78 Attorney Parks litigated this case vigorously as is his right. That, more than any strategy on the part of the OLR, is the reason for the high costs. The referee concluded and we agree that Attorney Parks has not established that the amounts included for counsel and referee fees, reporting and transcript costs, copying, and medical records fees, were either \"unreasonable,\" or \"unnecessary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   We thus find no reason to depart from our general practice of imposing full costs on attorneys deemed to have committed misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SCR 22.24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 79 IT IS ORDERED that the license of Daniel Parks to practice law in Wisconsin is suspended for a period of 14 months, effective January 24, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 80 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within 60 days of the date of this order, Daniel Parks shall pay to the Office of Lawyer Regulation the costs of this proceeding, which are $42,226.26, as of July 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 81 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Daniel Parks shall comply with the provisions of SCR 22.26 concerning the duties of a person whose license to practice law in Wisconsin has been suspended.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    A suspension of less than six months does not require the lawyer to undergo a formal reinstatement proceeding, which includes a character and fitness inquiry.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SCR 22.28.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    SCR 20:8.4(c) provides: \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The website came to the firm's attention when it tried to collect outstanding legal fees from M.W.

Attorney Shea then represented to his firm that the (apparently) unbilled fees should be discounted, implying that the client was unhappy with an associate's performance.
