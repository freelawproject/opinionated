At the hearing in magistrate court, Wegner appeared pro se, and Siemers was represented by counsel. After considering both parties' testimony, the court found Siemers \"[w]illfully, maliciously, or\n   repeatedly harassed [Wegner] by means of any verbal, electronic, digital media, mechanical, telegraphic, or written communication.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDCL 22-19A-1(3) (defining stalking). The court issued an order of protection effective for three years. Thereafter, counsel asked, \"I would assume, since this is in magistrate court, that the appeal chain is circuit court and then up the line?\" The court replied, \"Correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3.] Siemers did not appeal the magistrate court's decision to the circuit court; he has appealed to this Court. He contends the magistrate court clearly erred and abused its discretion in granting the protection order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4.] \"This Court has only such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by the legislature. The right to appeal is statutory and therefore does not exist in the absence of a statute permitting it.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

SDCL 15-26A-60 requires the jurisdictional statement in an appellant's brief to show \"that the order sought to be reviewed is appealable.\" Siemers does not identify any authority upon which this Court has appellate jurisdiction to consider his direct appeal from magistrate court. If a question of appellate jurisdiction exists, we are required to take notice of the question regardless of a party's failure to raise it.\n   <em>\n    Schwaller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8436699\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/712/869/\">\n    2006 S.D. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8436699\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/712/869/\">\n    712 N.W.2d at 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5.] \"A magistrate court with a magistrate judge presiding has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts to try and determine any action for a protective or restraining order or injunctive relief pursuant to chapter 22-19A, 25-10, or 21-65.\" SDCL 16-12B-13. There is also a limited right to appeal. \"Unless appeal is denied by law, there is a right of appeal\n   <em>\n    to the circuit court\n   </em>\n   from any final order or judgment of the magistrate court with a magistrate judge presiding[.]\" SDCL 16-12B-16 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   SDCL 16-12A-27.1. Accordingly, Siemers had a right to appeal the magistrate court's order to the circuit court, but we see no statutory authority to appeal directly to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6.] We have previously recognized that appellate jurisdiction from a magistrate court's decision is limited to the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Dale v.
