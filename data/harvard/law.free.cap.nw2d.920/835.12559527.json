R. Civ. P. 6.05 (adding 3 days \"to the prescribed period\" when a party is served with a document by mail), or, her late filing should be excused due to circumstances outside her control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \"A notice of appeal must be timely filed ... to give the [WCCA] jurisdiction of the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Bjerga v. Maislin Transport &amp; Carriers Ins.

A party must file a notice of appeal with the chief administrative law judge and the Commissioner of Labor and Industry within 30 days after the party was served with the compensation judge's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.421\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subds. 1, 4 (2018). Absent a timely appeal, the WCCA does \"not have discretion to consider the merits of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Hemmesch v. Molitor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10674735\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/328/445/#p447\">\n    328 N.W.2d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (Minn. 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It is well-established that \"filed\" as used in section 176.421 requires that the notice of appeal be actually\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   by the filing deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.275\">\n    Minn.

R. 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .0700, subp. 4(A) (2017) (\"A document is filed upon its receipt by the division or the office by 4:30 p.m. on a state business day.\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%209800\">\n    Minn.

Even accepting Rogers's version of events, the notice of appeal was not received by the filing deadline and, thus, the WCCA did not err in deciding that the appeal by Rogers was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition, the Rules of Civil Procedure \"govern the procedure\n   <em>\n    in the district courts\n   </em>\n   of the State of Minnesota in all suits of a civil nature.\" Minn. R. Civ. P. 1 (emphasis added). Proceedings before the compensation judge or the WCCA are not district court proceedings, and, thus, the 3-day extension provided by Rule 6.05 does not apply here and did not extend the filing deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finally, we do not have the authority to create exceptions to statutory deadlines for appeals.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.
