Husband also challenges the district court's conclusions that a home jointly owned by the parties is marital property, and that an increase in the value of husband's interest in a business was attributable to his marital effort and is therefore marital property. Finally, husband argues that the district court erred when it awarded wife need-based attorney fees. In a related appeal, wife challenges the district court's determination that she is not entitled to spousal maintenance. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Husband and wife signed a document purporting to be an antenuptial agreement, dated May 3, 2012. They were married on May 6, 2012. The May 3 document was notarized but not witnessed, despite\n   signature lines on the document for two witnesses for each party. Shortly after their marriage, husband sold his premarital home, title to which had been held by a spousal maintenance trust before the sale. The money received by the trust from the sale was used to purchase a homestead for the parties in Elk River, titled in the names of both parties as joint tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before and during the marriage, husband owned shares in Precise Metalcraft Inc. (Precise), a family business he started with his first wife. Although his business responsibilities were reduced following his first wife's cancer diagnosis (and subsequent death), husband has continued his involvement with Precise. Husband's three children from his first marriage work for Precise. During the parties' marriage, husband regularly went to work at Precise and received a salary. Wife also received a salary from the business, but she never worked there or contributed money to the business. Over the course of the marriage, the value of husband's interest in Precise increased by $172,921.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 10, 2016, husband petitioned to dissolve the marriage. Husband initially indicated that he agreed with wife's position that the May 3, 2012 document signed by the parties was not a valid antenuptial agreement. Later, husband changed his mind and argued that the document is a valid and enforceable antenuptial agreement. The district court determined that the document is not a valid and enforceable antenuptial agreement because it was not witnessed as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20519.11\">\n    Minn.

It concluded that, although nonmarital funds were used to purchase the property, husband had intended to make a gift to wife of an interest in the homestead as marital property. The district court found as persuasive evidence of husband's donative intent that husband arranged for the Elk River home to be purchased by and titled in the name of the parties as joint tenants, whereas a trust had held title to husband's premarital home. The district court credited wife's trial testimony in determining husband's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court further found that the increase in the value of husband's equity interest in Precise during this marriage was a result of husband's marital efforts. It expressly assessed the credibility of the trial witnesses in making this determination, and found that husband \"had ongoing, active involvement in the operation of\" his family business during the parties' marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court denied wife's request for spousal maintenance. It found that wife has sufficient property to provide for her reasonable needs and sufficient funds to meet her reasonable monthly living expenses through employment. The district court further found that wife has significant nonmarital assets, that she has beneficial experience in the work force, that there are full-time employment opportunities available to her currently, and that she\n   did not engage in a good-faith effort to find employment during the divorce litigation. It also found that wife \"minimally contributed to the parties' marital estate during the marriage,\" and that her nonmarital assets, which she kept separate from marital assets, had increased in value during the marriage. It noted that wife did not lose earnings or retirement benefits during their marriage. The district court identified two factors that favor an award of maintenance: that wife is 62 years old, an age at which reentering the work force will be \"more difficult\"; and that husband \"has sufficient resources and income to meet his own needs while meeting those of wife.\" Ultimately, it concluded that wife has sufficient property to provide for her reasonable needs and is not in need of spousal maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court also awarded wife need-based attorney fees. It concluded that wife would need to spend the majority of the marital property awarded to her to purchase a new home and that her remaining liquid assets will be insufficient for her to pay her attorney fees. The district court noted that husband's litigation conduct had greatly increased the time and expense of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.

The terms of the spousal-maintenance trust provide that wife would have use of the parties' primary residence upon husband's death, but would have no ownership interest in the house. Wife further testified that husband told her that they \"would get [the Elk River] home and that it would be my home. It would be our home. And that is why, when we closed on the house, it was placed in joint tenancy because that would be, then, my home.\" She further testified that husband told her that her name should appear first on the deed to the house because \"it was going to be, in essence, my home but our home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The district court made credibility findings based on the testimony and other record evidence concerning husband's donative intent, and applied the clear-and-convincing evidence standard, citing\n   <em>\n    Oehler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348262\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/273/453/\">\n    142 N.W.2d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It implicitly found a causal connection between husband's involvement with the business and the increase in value. This implicit finding is supported by the record. The district court was presented with testimony that husband regularly went to work every day during this marriage. Husband's business valuation expert testified that \"any increase [in equity] was related to market conditions and not the marital efforts of [husband].\" However, the expert's report indicated that husband had a defined role and \"[a]ssists with technical questions and job quotes.\" Wife testified that husband stayed in contact with his children concerning the business when they were on vacation and that husband had told her that he wished he could retire but \"was concerned that the business would falter.\" Another witness, who was familiar with husband's business, testified that she had asked husband on one occasion if he was ever going to retire and that husband responded that he could not retire.

The district court further noted that wife had spent most of her savings in the dissolution litigation and observed that the costs of litigation had been increased by husband's indecision about whether to litigate the validity of the purported antenuptial agreement. The district court stated that it made its award \"based on wife's need for an award of fees, in consideration of her inability to sustain the costs of litigation and represent her interests in this proceeding, and, in part, on the basis of husband's varying positions regarding the validity of the unwitnessed Antenuptial Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The factors analyzed in the district court's order support a need-based award. Although the district court observed that husband's change of heart concerning whether to litigate the validity of the antenuptial agreement increased the cost of the trial, it did not expressly identify any portion of the fee award as a conduct-based award. Neither did the district court find that husband had unreasonably contributed to the expense of the litigation, a finding which would be a prerequisite to a conduct-based fee award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20518.14\">\n    Minn.
