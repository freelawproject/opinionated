KENNEDY, a Minnesota Attorney,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%200055128\">\n   Registration No. 0055128\n  </extracted-citation>\n  .\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  A17-1448\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Supreme Court of Minnesota.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  December 20, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  ORDER\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   On October 13, 2017, we suspended respondent Duane A. Kennedy from the practice of law for a minimum of 30 days, effective October 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    In re Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12337936\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/902/633/#p633\">\n    902 N.W.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633-34 (Minn. 2017) (order). We conditionally reinstated Kennedy on December 1, 2017, subject to the requirement that Kennedy file proof of his successful completion of the written examination required for admission to the practice of law by the State Board of Law Examiners on the subject of professional responsibility by October 13, 2018.\n   <em>\n    In re Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12336534\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/904/222/#p222\">\n    904 N.W.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222-23 (Minn. 2017) (order). The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) is the required professional-responsibility examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 4.A(5), Rules for Admission to the Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Kennedy did not file proof of successful completion of the MPRE by October 13, 2018. Instead, on October 5, 2018, Kennedy filed a motion seeking additional time to provide proof of successful completion of the MPRE. We denied the motion and revoked Kennedy's conditional reinstatement, effective November 11, 2018.\n   <em>\n    In re Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12558745\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/919/332/#p333\">\n    919 N.W.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 (Minn. 2018) (order). Kennedy has now filed proof that he has successfully completed the MPRE. The Director of the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility does not oppose Kennedy's request to be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that respondent Duane A.
