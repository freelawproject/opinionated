Gary Fenrich was killed and his wife, appellant JeanAnn Fenrich, was severely injured. She brought a negligence action against respondent The Blake School (\"the school\"). The district court granted the school's motion for summary judgment, concluding that, as a matter of law, the school did not owe a duty of care to members of the general public. The court of appeals affirmed, but on a different ground, holding that the school's conduct did not create a foreseeable risk of injury to a foreseeable plaintiff. Because summary judgment was not proper in the circumstances of this case, we reverse the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 12, 2011, shortly before 11:00 a.m., Gary Fenrich was driving northbound on Minnesota Highway 15 in Watonwan County. His wife, JeanAnn Fenrich, was in the front seat on the passenger side. An oncoming car crossed over the centerline and collided with the Fenrichs. Gary was killed and JeanAnn suffered serious injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The car that crossed the centerline was driven by T.M., a 16-year-old boy. T.M. was a member of the school's cross-country team. He was driving himself, two other members of the team, and the team's volunteer coach as part of a team trip to Sioux Falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The team had participated in the interscholastic Minnesota State High School League (\"the League\") season, which had just ended. But T.M. and his teammates were going to the Nike Cross Nationals Heartland Regional meet in Sioux Falls. The Nike meet was not a League-sponsored event and, because it occurred after the League's official season had ended, the team's coaches were not allowed to help prepare the team for it. Nevertheless, both the head coach and the assistant coach assisted the team as the Nike meet approached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Nike meet was listed on the team's official schedule, which was posted on the team website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At least four posts were made on the website referencing the upcoming Nike meet. For example, during the League season, the head coach sent an email to the team members and parents stating: \"Sunday, November 13th, the Nike Heartland Regional meet in Sioux Falls. All varsity and top JV runners encouraged to participate. Talk to [the assistant coach] for details.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Team members were instructed to tell the coaches in writing if they were planning to attend the Nike meet. Fourteen members of the team signed up, and the assistant coach paid the team's $300 bulk meet-participation fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the official League season had ended, and in an effort to comply with League rules, the assistant coach arranged\n   for a volunteer coach-a recent graduate of the school-to run practices the week before the Nike meet. The assistant coach emailed the team: \"All practices are run by Captains, (and [the volunteer coach] ) this week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the team members were nominally responsible for arranging their own lodging and transportation to the Nike meet, the team's coaches helped coordinate the arrangements. On November 7, the assistant coach sent out the following email to a team parent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I am stopping by the school before practice to make sure everyone has coordinated rides and rooms for this weekend. If [your son] gets a chance, it would be nice if he could get [in] an easy run before dinner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We are very excited with the number of runners that signed up for the meet (officially completed as well, as I submitted/paid early this morning). This will be a lot of fun and a great way to end the sea[s]on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two days later, the coaches received an email from T.M.'s mother that read, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [T.M.], his dad and I just finished a conversation about transportation for the race this weekend. It sounds like [T.M.] (and the boys) would like to have a caravan down and back with you. We are very comfortable with [T.M.'s] driving skills and he's legal now to have passengers, and we are fine with him taking our car. Given the long distance though, we would like to know that he is following you, and won't be venturing to Sioux Falls and back without an adult at least in [the] rear view mirro[r]s. All we would need is you to confirm that is the plan .... Please know that [T.M.'s father] is willing to drive as well, if you would prefer that, but we understand also that 'Coach plus kids' sounds like a more fun venture for [T.M.] and the boy team runners ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The assistant coach called the head coach to ask whether he was comfortable with T.M. driving. The head coach replied that he did not get involved with those decisions. The assistant coach then replied to the email stating: \"That works, we will drive in a caravan at a safe speed!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the morning of November 12, the students met at the assistant coach's house in Chanhassen for the two-car \"caravan\" to Sioux Falls. The assistant coach estimated that they would be on the road for about five hours. The majority of the team rode with the assistant coach, including the assistant coach's own son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Three people rode with T.M.: two students and the volunteer coach, who was located in the back seat behind T.M. Although T.M.'s mother stated that T.M. could legally drive multiple passengers, this assertion is not supported by the record. T.M. obtained his driver's license on June 17, 2011, and all three of his passengers, including the volunteer coach, were under the age of 20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20171.055\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 171.055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(c) (2016) (\"For the first six months of provisional licensure, a provisional license holder may not operate a motor vehicle carrying more than one passenger under the age of 20 years who is not a member of the holder's immediate family.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before departing, the assistant coach gave no driving instructions to either T.M. or the volunteer coach. Nor did the volunteer coach give T.M. any instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   T.M. followed the assistant coach's car. During a brief stop outside of Mankato, the assistant coach reminded T.M. to \"make sure we keep it safe and keep rolling.\" He provided no specific instructions as to how \"we keep it safe.\" Thereafter,\n   the vehicles turned southbound onto Highway 15, a two-lane highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the vehicles approached Lewisville, in Watonwan County, the volunteer coach was in the back seat using his phone. According to the volunteer coach, T.M. was probably distracted by his own phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, T.M. swerved over the centerline of the highway, into oncoming traffic, and his car collided with the Fenrichs' vehicle. JeanAnn was severely injured, and Gary was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After the accident, police interviewed the assistant coach and the volunteer coach. The volunteer coach described himself as \"an assistant coach with the Blake Cross Country Team\" and told police that \"we all drove down as a team.\" The assistant coach told police that he had already talked to the school and told them that any future trips would need to be by bus. He also said: \"[W]hy would [T.M.] even be driving that far .... I don't know why I didn't just say ... what are we doing with a 16 year old driving this distance?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In November 2014, Fenrich, in her individual capacity and as her husband's trustee, brought an action in Watonwan County against the school, the head coach, the assistant coach, and the volunteer coach. She pleaded claims of wrongful death, negligence, and negligence per se against all defendants, and also asserted negligent supervision and vicarious liability claims against the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In April 2015, the district court dismissed Fenrich's claim of negligence per se. The court also dismissed all claims against the head coach and assistant coach, concluding that the applicable statute of limitations had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In May 2016, the school and the volunteer coach each moved for summary judgment, arguing that they owed no legal duty to members of the general public and that T.M. was not acting as an agent of the school or the volunteer coach. In August 2016, the district court denied the motion because (1) \"a reasonable person [could] draw a conclusion that The Blake School assumed control and supervision over the cross country team's transportation to and from and participation in the Nike Meet,\" and (2) there were sufficient facts \"for a reasonable person to find that [T.M.] was acting as an agent of the school and/or [the volunteer coach].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In October 2016, the district court issued an order dismissing Fenrich's claims of negligence and negligent supervision, concluding that, although the school may have owed a duty to its students, neither the school nor its volunteer coach owed any duty of care to non-student third parties such as Fenrich. The court observed that Fenrich's only remaining claim was for wrongful death on a vicarious liability theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In November 2016, following the school's request for reconsideration, the district court dismissed the volunteer coach from the lawsuit because no direct claims remained against him. The district court also dismissed Fenrich's vicarious liability claim because a June 2014 settlement agreement between Fenrich and T.M.'s family (and insurers) released T.M., T.M.'s father, and their principals from all claims. With no claims remaining, final judgment was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fenrich appealed, arguing that the district court erred by determining as a matter of law that the school owed no duty of care. The court of appeals affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment, but on different grounds. The court\n   first concluded that \"a school may have a duty of reasonable care to prevent harm caused by a student who drives a private vehicle in connection with a school-sponsored extra-curricular activity,\" and that the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to Fenrich, \"is capable of proving that the school assumed control and supervision over [the team's] transportation to and from the Nike meet and, thus, is capable of proving that this is a case of misfeasance.\"\n   <em>\n    Fenrich v.

App. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Having concluded that a school\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   \"have a duty to protect the general public from injury caused by a student,\" the court then considered whether \"the risk of a collision between T.M.'s vehicle and the Fenrichs' vehicle was foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335088\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/223/#p230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335088\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/223/#p230\">\n    at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that, as a matter of law, \"the summary-judgment record does not contain evidence that is capable of proving that the probability that T.M. would cause an automobile accident was high enough to make [it] foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335088\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/223/#p230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335088\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/223/#p230\">\n    at 232-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court held that \"[t]he district court did not err by granting the school's motion for summary judgment with respect to Fenrich's claim that the school was negligent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335088\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/223/#p230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335088\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/901/223/#p230\">\n    at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We granted Fenrich's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fenrich appeals from an order granting summary judgment in favor of the school on her claim of negligence.

These decisions require that we consider what duty, if any, a school has to the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the threshold, the school urges us to adopt a categorical rule that, as a matter of law, a school never owes a duty of care to non-student third parties for injuries resulting from student conduct. We recognize the obvious-schools are important for our civilized society-but, having no precedent that creates this exception, we see no good reason to carve out schools from basic principles of tort law. Like any other Minnesota person or entity, a school does not owe a duty of care to the general public if the harm is caused by a third party's conduct. But this rule is subject to two exceptions: (1) if there is a special relationship between the plaintiff and the school and the harm to the plaintiff is foreseeable; or (2) if the school's own conduct creates a foreseeable risk of injury to a foreseeable plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe 169\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946857\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/845/174/#p177\">\n    845 N.W.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In arguing for a categorical exception, the school directs us to\n   <em>\n    Gylten v.

Here, the school assumed responsibility over the activity of the team members. The head coach strongly encouraged the entire team to participate in the Nike meet and 14 team members registered. The assistant coach paid the bulk registration fee. The coaches were active in preparation for the meet, including the assistant coach attending one of the practices and recruiting a volunteer coach to run them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The assistant coach also took active responsibility for coordinating transportation to, and lodging at, the Nike meet. As he put it, \"we all drove down as a team.\" He expressly approved the plan to have T.M.-and not T.M.'s father or another adult-drive team members and the volunteer coach more than 200 miles to Sioux Falls. The assistant coach decided that the volunteer coach, a teenager, would ride with T.M. But he did not give the volunteer coach any safety instructions-such as to sit in the front seat, to pay attention (rather than be distracted by electronic devices), and to make sure that T.M. drove responsibly. Nor did the assistant coach give any instructions to T.M., except, during a break, to \"keep it safe and keep rolling.\" Based on these facts, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the school's own conduct was misfeasant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The school, though, asserts that the assistant coach was acting solely in his capacity as a parent, and not as an agent-a coach-of the school. This assertion merely creates an issue of fact. On the one hand, League rules barred the assistant coach from acting in his coaching capacity in the lead-up to the Nike meet, and on at least one occasion he expressly told a team parent that he (and the head coach) were not involved in preparing the team for the meet. On the other hand, there are facts and reasonable inferences suggesting that he was acting as a coach. Among other things, he posted on the team website that the Nike meet would be \"a great way to end the season\"; he paid the registration fee for the team; he expressly agreed that T.M. would drive other students; and he told police that he had talked to the school about providing safer transportation to future team events. These facts suggest that the assistant coach was acting on behalf of the school in connection with the team's trip to Sioux Falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The dissent attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Verhel\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the victim was a student, and the Fenrichs were not students. But a fair reading of\n   <em>\n    Verhel\n   </em>\n   shows\n   that the school's duty was based on conduct that created a foreseeable risk of injury to a foreseeable plaintiff, not on the status of the victim.

According to the court, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that \"the school's own conduct was misfeasant,\" in part, because \"the assistant coach decided that the volunteer coach would ride with [the student],\" and \"did not give the volunteer coach any safety instructions-such as to sit in the front seat, to pay attention (rather than be distracted by electronic devices), and to make sure that [the student] drove responsibly.\" But we have previously held that \"a passenger has no duty to members of the public to control the operation of a motor vehicle ....\"\n   <em>\n    Olson v.

In his treatise on torts, Thomas Cooley remarked that some courts considered the duty to guard against certain injuries to be a question of fact. Thomas M. Cooley,\n   <em>\n    A Treatise on the Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   669 (1879);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.

But\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   is really about whether the railroad owed a duty to passengers who used the windows of a railcar for their desired purpose, to allow passengers some reprieve from the hot and stuffy confines of the railcar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Wis.%20503\">\n    17 Wis. at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Cooley,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 699.

The facts of that case show that while attempting to board a train, a man dropped his package carrying fireworks, thereby causing an explosion and injuring Palsgraf, who was standing on the train platform at the time.

In his words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   If the guard had thrown [the package] down knowingly and willfully, he would not have threatened the plaintiff's safety, so far as appearances could warn him. His conduct would not have involved, even then, an unreasonable probability of invasion of her bodily security.

Here, the court concludes that this case is a \"close case\" because the student was only recently licensed, he was \"unsupervised,\" and he was driving a significant distance. Further, the court cites the general inexperience of teenage drivers and the modern peril of distracted driving. I disagree. This is not a close case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It is useful to view this dispute through the lenses of\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Palsgraf\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Unlike the knowledge of the hotel in\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"339205\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/254/373/\">\n    95 N.W.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the school here had no affirmative notice that the student was a poor or negligent driver. In other words, whereas the hotel had notice that its guests were rowdy, the school had no notice of any unreasonable risk posed by the student driver and therefore had no duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Just like the lack of notice regarding the contents of the package in\n   <em>\n    Palsgraf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20N.E.%2099\">\n    162 N.E. at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the circumstances here did not indicate any reasonably foreseeable danger to anyone. In fact, the student's mother had vouched for her son's driving skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Further, we considered the characteristics of the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   -hotel operators engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquor-but we did not solely rely on those characteristics.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"339205\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/254/373/\">\n    95 N.W.2d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The hotel knew that the young men attending the convention had engaged in extensive partying.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 665. Moreover, we noted that it was common sense that intoxication would increase disorderly behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, in the end, in concluding that the negligent act was \"within the range of foreseeability,\" we relied on evidence that the hotel had notice of the misconduct of the hotel's guests-specifically, \"the indiscriminate throwing of glasses, bottles, and other objects in and about the hotel ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unlike our decision in\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   , the court here relies almost exclusively on a supposition, without any evidence in the record, that teenage drivers are more likely to become distracted and have a heightened risk of causing an accident. Even if we grant the court these assumptions, there is nothing else in the record to indicate that the school should have realized that it had a duty to protect the general public from the driving conduct of\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   A hypothetical helpfully illustrates what would make this case more like\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   and less like\n   <em>\n    Palsgraf\n   </em>\n   . Suppose, as was suggested at oral argument, that a school official observed that a student's behavior indicated that he or she was intoxicated before that student drove to a school event. Then, just as in\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   , the school would have notice of misconduct that might give rise to a duty to try to prevent the student from driving. The absence of that kind of notice here demonstrates how far removed this case is from\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   I recognize, as the court emphasizes, that the court's decision allows a jury to determine whether a duty exists but does not mandate this determination. But that observation obscures the significant consequences that flow from this expansion of duty. Those consequences come from the mere fact that any third-party injury derived from student driving conduct is now a \"close case\" against the student's school that a jury must resolve based on the specific factors identified by the court for jury consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As noted at the beginning of this dissent, we deal here not with traditional motor vehicle negligence analysis. No one disputes that a driver, a high school student or otherwise, owes a duty to other drivers. But now a school must consider whether it has a duty to remote individuals based on actions taken by students in almost any context. All extracurricular, and co-curricular, activities, are now guaranteed a gimlet-eyed review by the school's lawyers. Schools have beneficial relationships with all manner of groups and individuals that support school activities, including parent-teacher organizations, athletic associations, booster clubs, and alumni. For purposes of limiting liability, do schools now need to consider whether these organizations should be disbanded or at least officially disaffiliated from the school?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   My concerns are magnified by the fact-specific approach dictated by the court's analysis. In discussing the duty that might be imposed on the school, the court identifies at least nine distinct factors upon which a reasonable jury could conclude that the circumstances of this case \"created an objectively reasonable expectation of danger to the public\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   [The student] was [1] not an adult, but was a teenager, [2] who had been licensed for less than 6 months. He was [3] driving a lengthy distance [4] with no adults-only other teenagers-in the car. [5] He could not legally drive multiple passengers who were under the age of 20. [6] [The student's] parents had asked that an adult drive ahead of [the student]. In preparation for the drive, [7] the assistant coach provided no instructions to [the student], except, shortly before the accident, to \"keep it safe and keep rolling.\" [8] The assistant coach told the volunteer coach to ride in the car with [the student], but gave no specific instructions to the volunteer coach to monitor [the student's] driving, or to ensure that [the student] did not become distracted while driving. [9] Nor did the assistant coach tell the volunteer coach to sit in the front passenger seat, where the volunteer coach could have better supervised [the student's] driving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Are all nine factors necessary to impose a duty on a school? Are some factors more important than others? Are there other factors that might be important to the analysis? Is the mere fact that a school allows students and parents the opportunity to publicize an event to which students might drive enough to impose a duty on the school? The court's decision leaves schools with a lack of guidance on the scope of their duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The court's ruling that the school may owe a duty to members of the general public under the circumstances of this case-an accident that took place over 100 miles from the school when a student drove to a post-season weekend athletic event at the suggestion, and with the express written permission, of his parents-represents a major expansion of school liability with troubling policy implications. There is no apparent limiting principle if the school here faces liability simply because the coaches helped coordinate some aspects of the trip and encouraged team members to participate. Because the court believes that \"[t]he possibility that teen drivers may be distracted by other teens and electronics is not in any way remote or attenuated,\" Minnesota schools, both private and public, now risk liability to members of the general public whenever students drive themselves to or from a school activity, even when the school has no notice of any history of negligent or reckless driving. In\n   <em>\n    Verhel\n   </em>\n   , we made clear that we were not holding that a school is \"liable for the safety of all students while in transit to or from a school activity ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10669512\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/359/579/\">\n    359 N.W.2d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, with more attenuated relationships than in\n   <em>\n    Verhel,\n   </em>\n   the court essentially holds that a school may be liable for the safety of members of the general public when students drive to or from a school-encouraged activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Because there is no way to tell from the court's opinion what might be enough to trigger the imposition of a duty, the response from schools will necessarily be to ratchet back on school activities and relationships in order to limit financial exposure. While schools can require parents to sign releases of liability for the schools' students, as the school did here in connection with cross-country events during the official season, it is obviously not possible for schools to obtain releases of liability from individual members of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   When making a duty determination, courts typically consider policy factors, such as \"the burden to the defendant and community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Domagala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7069768,7069811\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/805/14/\">\n    805 N.W.2d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in a prior case, we held that a municipality did not assume a duty to protect individual members of the public with respect to the negligent inspection of the conduct of third persons for fire code violations where the plaintiffs already had a right of recovery against other defendants, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   We are being asked to add another defendant; namely, the municipality involved. If such an expansion and change of the law is to occur, it is better that the legislature act in this field where extensive hearings can be conducted to consider the extent of the financial impact of such a basic change. It is quite apparent that we are unable to comprehend the ramifications of imposing a duty to enforce the law with reasonable care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Cracraft v. City of St. Louis Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10686902\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/279/801/#p808\">\n    279 N.W.2d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808 (Minn. 1979). But the court here dispenses with policy considerations and does not consider the ramifications of imposing an expansive duty on schools. Under the court's decision, a jury's determination on foreseeability often will be determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   All of this is unnecessary. The district court and the court of appeals correctly concluded that this unprecedented imposition of a duty on the school was not a close case. I agree and would affirm the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    There is no evidence that the school's coaches ever communicated directly with the student driver before the weekend of the meet about his transportation arrangements. While acknowledging that the runners were supposed to be \"responsible for arranging their own lodging and transportation to the meet,\" the court cites an e-mail from the assistant coach (who also was a parent of one of the students travelling to the meet) to a parent of one of the other runners, indicating that the assistant coach was \"stopping by the school before practice to make sure everyone has coordinated rides and rooms for this weekend.\" The student driver was not at practice that day. It was the mother of the driver who suggested the driving arrangements in an e-mail to the assistant coach. She merely asked the assistant coach to \"confirm that is the plan\"; the assistant coach responded by stating, \"That works.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    As the court notes, the \"adult\" supervision in this case was provided by a volunteer coach who was 19 years old at the time, a \"teenager,\" and a former student at the school.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The developments in our \"close cases\" jurisprudence have sparked some academic commentary.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Mike Steenson,\n    <em>\n     Duty, Foreseeability, and\n    </em>\n    Montemayor v.
