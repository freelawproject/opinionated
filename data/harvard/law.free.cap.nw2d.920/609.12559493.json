I do not address at this time whether knowledge of the CPS reports should be imputed to the prosecutor for the purposes of the first\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   component, see\n   <em>\n    Kyles v. Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n    514 U.S. 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (explaining that \"the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor do I address whether the CPS reports were \"favorable to the accused,\" because for the reasons thoroughly explained by Judge O'BRIEN , the third component, the requirement of materiality, was not satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Concerning the 2010 CPS report, which indicates that the victim failed to inform CPS during that investigation that she had been abused by defendant, I fail to discern how defendant would have been acquitted had defense counsel been in possession of this report largely because the information therein is cumulative to the information presented at trial given that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   witnesses, including the victim herself, agreed that she never disclosed such abuse to anyone at the time. Furthermore, the victim's sister testified at trial that she had filed a complaint with CPS around 2010 regarding defendant and that nothing resulted from her complaint. Indeed, during closing arguments, defense counsel observed that if\n   a complaint had been filed with CPS by the victim's sister, defendant was presumably vindicated. Given these circumstances, the jury likely inferred that CPS interviewed the victim around 2010 and she did not disclose that defendant was abusing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In concluding that possession of the 2010 CPS report would have aided the defense, the Court of Appeals reasoned that defense counsel \"likely would have\" presented a witness \"to educate the jury regarding the techniques routinely employed to elicit truthful information in similar circumstances\" and that such a witness \"could have\" been used by defense counsel to illustrate for the jury \"the general accuracy and reliability of forensic interviews and interviewing techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    Butsinas\n   </em>\n   , unpub. op. at 11. However, as defendant himself acknowledges in his answer to the prosecutor's application for leave to appeal, \"[t]he defense [in fact] presented Katherine Okra as an expert in forensic interview protocol,\" and Dr. Okra testified at length about that protocol. And as explained previously, the jury likely inferred that the victim had been interviewed by CPS in 2010, but that she did not disclose the abuse to CPS at that time. That is, the jury likely inferred that the victim did not disclose the abuse despite the forensic interview protocol. Consequently, the hypothetical offered by the Court of Appeals actually occurred at trial-a witness apprised the jury concerning forensic interview protocol-and it is thus unwarranted to grant a new trial in large part so that defendant can present the same evidence once more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Concerning the 2013 CPS report, that report would likely have been even less helpful to the defense than the 2010 CPS report. First, the 2013 CPS report contradicted a police officer's testimony concerning the reason why the victim was not interviewed at Care House in 2013, but I fail to discern the significance of this contradiction in assessing whether defendant was guilty of the charged offenses. Second, the report indicated that the victim told the police that she had been sexually abused during the day, whereas she testified at trial that she was sexually abused at night. In my judgment, this is a relatively minor detail that would not have been given significant weight by the jury, given that the sexual assaults occurred both repeatedly and several years earlier. Third, the report indicated that the victim's sister disliked defendant, but this fact was also minimally relevant because the entire case was predicated on the\n   <em>\n    victim's\n   </em>\n   allegations. Put simply, as Judge O'BRIEN observed, the 2013 CPS report only includes \"inconsequential pieces of impeachment evidence, which do not, in any conceivable way, undermine confidence in the jury verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Butsinas\n   </em>\n   , unpub. op. at 3 ( O'BRIEN , J.,\n   <em>\n    concurring in part and dissenting in part\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To summarize, the CPS reports here were not \"material\" under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and the Court of Appeals erred by concluding otherwise. Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals' ruling that defendant was entitled to a new trial on the basis of the alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation and remand to that court to address defendant's remaining arguments that have not yet been addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Zahra and Wilder, JJ., join the statement of Markman, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Caselaw from other jurisdictions suggests that it is far from settled that CPS is an agent of the prosecutor for the purposes of\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    .
