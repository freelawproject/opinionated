We also conclude that Union failed to make a prima facie claim of retaliation because it did not prove a causal connection between the protected speech and restructuring of the fire\n   department. Thus, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to City on Counts III and IV of Union's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   City is a home-rule charter city. It is located in Crow Wing County and has a population of 13,590. City was founded in 1870 and incorporated by a city charter in 1873. The charter authorizes City to establish and operate a \"paid fire department.\" Brainerd, Minn., City Charter ch. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67 (1991) (the city charter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Union, an affiliate of the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF), is a labor union representing the paid, full-time firefighters, known as Fire Equipment Operators (FEOs), previously employed by City. Turner, a former FEO for City, is Union president.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   City's fire department offers protection from fires to City and the surrounding communities. Brainerd Fire Service Area (BFSA) is a group of cities and townships, including City, that pay \"yearly fees to receive services from\" City's fire department. City's fire department historically consisted of five to seven FEOs; approximately 40 paid, on-call personnel, known as Paid-on-Call employees (POCs); a fire chief; and an administrative specialist. The FEOs were union members and city employees, and received full employee benefits. The POCs, however, are not full-time employees or members of Union, do not have benefits, and are paid a \"nominal sum.\" City operates two fire stations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   City has two major sources of revenue: property taxes and local government aid (LGA) provided to City by the State of Minnesota. City asserted that it has struggled financially for the \"past eight years or so\" due to decreased property tax values and decreases in LGA funding. In 2010, to decrease its budget and spending, City took steps to restructure the fire department. According to the city administrator in 2010, staffing the fire department entirely with POCs would have resulted in savings of $90,000 in 2010, and in the range of $500,000 in each subsequent year. The 2010 plan would have resulted in laying off all of the FEOs and hiring a full-time deputy fire chief. In March 2010, the city council voted to adopt the restructuring plan. Union and FEOs opposed the restructuring plan and argued that the restructuring would lower fire-department response times and put public safety at risk. As a result, in April 2010, the city council rescinded its vote to restructure the fire department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2015, the fire department consisted of five FEOs, a fire chief, and approximately 36 POCs. In March 2015, City and Union negotiated and signed a new collective bargaining agreement with a three-year duration, running from January 2015 to December 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Four months later, in July 2015, the city administrator informed Union by letter that City was again considering the \"possible restructuring of the Fire Department to eliminate full-time [FEOs] for solely paid on-call firefighters as a cost-saving measure.\" In response to City's letter, Union \"vigorously advocated resistance to the proposed elimination of the full-time department and [was] critical of the City and its administrators.\" Turner made several comments to local media and was \"very vocal in Facebook postings\" in opposition to the restructuring of the fire department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September 2015, the city council adopted, and the mayor approved, Resolution No. 45:15 (the resolution). The resolution reorganized the fire department to \"eliminate all Fire Equipment Operator positions,\" \"utilize Paid On-Call Firefighters for the provision of fire services,\" and\n   create a \"new Assistant Fire Chief position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The resolution went into effect on October 21, 2015; after the restructuring, the fire department consisted of a fire chief, a fire marshal/deputy fire chief, POCs, and an administrative specialist. As a result of the resolution, the FEOs were laid off and Union was dissolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Union sued City in January 2016. Union's complaint had four counts. In Count I, Union asserted that City engaged in unfair labor practices, in violation of PELRA, Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 179A.01 -.25 (2016 &amp; Supp. 2017). Count II asserted that the fire department restructuring was not permitted under City's charter and, thus, violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20410.12\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 410.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which requires that a city charter be amended through a specific process and not by a resolution passed by the city council. In Count III, Union asserted that City violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it enacted the resolution in retaliation against Union for making critical statements regarding the restructuring. Finally, Count IV asserted that City violated article I, section 3, of the Minnesota Constitution by laying off the FEOs because they made critical statements regarding the restructuring and city administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both parties filed for summary judgment. City argued that the district court should dismiss the entire case because Union \"improperly styled\" its challenge to City's restructuring plan as a claim under PELRA; the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over some of Union's claims asserted in Count I; Count II should be dismissed because City complied with the collective-bargaining agreement and the Civil Service Rules when it restructured the fire department; and Counts III and IV should be dismissed because Union could not \"make a prima facie showing of retaliation for protected speech.\" Union requested a partial summary judgment of liability on Counts I and II, arguing that City's restructuring of the fire department (1) violated PELRA, and (2) violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20410.12\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 410.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"which establishes specific procedures for amending a municipal home rule charter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court granted City's motion for summary judgment in part and denied Union's motion. The district court granted summary judgment to City on Count II, determining that the \"Resolution was authorized by the existing Charter, [and] there was no need to amend the Charter and thus no violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20410.12\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 410.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Next, the district court granted summary judgment to City on Counts III and IV, after concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to whether City violated Union's free-speech rights. After finding that Union did not improperly style their challenge to City's action as a PELRA claim, the district court determined that City had the \"inherent managerial right\" to \"contract out\" firefighting work. But the district court did not grant summary judgment on the PELRA claim entirely for two reasons: it determined that there were fact issues as to whether City (1) violated PELRA by improperly altering Union's \"work jurisdiction\"; and (2) negotiated the effects of the restructuring of the fire department with Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   City filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that Union did not raise the issues of \"work jurisdiction or whether City had negotiated the effects of restructuring until they filed their reply brief in support of their motion for summary judgment.\" City also argued that work jurisdiction was not implicated in this case. City asserted that the district court's summary-judgment order was \"internally inconsistent\" because it determined \"on one hand that the decision\n   to restructure the fire department was an exercise of inherent managerial rights that need not be negotiated with Union, but on the other hand that the decision to restructure was the subject of mandatory bargaining because it altered\" Union's work jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted City's motion for reconsideration. The district court dismissed Union's remaining PELRA claims and concluded that Union did not \"properly raise the issue of 'work jurisdiction' \" because the issue was raised in \"reply to [Union's] own motion for summary judgment\" rather than in response to City's motion. The district court granted City's \"motion for summary judgment in total,\" and entered final judgment for City. Union appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

City responds that the district court appropriately rejected Union's claim that the restructuring was a \"per se violation of PELRA\" and determined that the restructuring was \"an exercise of inherent managerial policy.\" City asks this court to affirm the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   PELRA governs the relationship between public employers and their employees. PELRA's purpose is to promote \"orderly and constructive relationships\n   between all public employers and their employees.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 179A.01(a). In its complaint, Union alleged that City had engaged in unfair labor practices. Unfair labor practices are defined in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 179A.13, subd. 2.

The plain language of PELRA provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to \"interfer[e] with the formation, existence, or administration of any employee organization.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 179A.13, subd. 2(2). The parties do not appear to dispute the material facts: (1) City restructured the fire department; (2) eliminated the FEO positions; and (3) City's unilateral action resulted in the dissolution of Union.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, city officials acknowledged that the resolution resulted in the dissolution of Union. For example, the fire chief testified that after the \"five full-time equipment operator positions [were] eliminated\" Union \"no longer exist[ed].\" The city administrator testified similarly, stating that the restructure \"eliminate[ed] the existence of the Union.\" Once Union was eliminated, its members were not able to participate in or administer their employee organization. Therefore, we conclude that City violated Minn. Stat. \u00a7 179A.13, subd. 2(2), when, during the midst of an operating bargaining agreement, it unilaterally eliminated all FEO positions, effectively dissolving Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   City argues, however, that caselaw supports its argument that the reorganization of a department, which \"decreases the membership or eliminates a bargaining unit,\" is an act of inherent managerial policy, and thus, is not an unfair labor practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn.

Second, City had made clear, since 2010, that the restructuring of the fire department would be a cost-saving measure. City provided significant detail regarding its financial struggles, and has \"remained consistent\" that its decision to restructure the fire department was solely motivated by budget problems. Although there is evidence that the fire chief and city administrator were frustrated by Turner's statements, we agree with the district court that these statements did not create a fact issue, regarding whether there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the fire department restructuring, in light of the overwhelming evidence and statements by city officials that the restructuring was based on budget problems.
