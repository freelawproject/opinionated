In a published and split decision, the Court of Appeals held that MCL 769.25a(6), pertaining to good-time and disciplinary credits, was unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Court of Appeals held that MCL 769.25a(6) violates the federal and state Ex Post Facto Clauses because\n   Michigan's statutory scheme allowed defendants to earn good-time and disciplinary credits at the time defendants' crimes were committed and the elimination of such credits in MCL 769.25a(6) increased defendants' punishments. The dissenting judge, however, concluded that the ex post facto issue was not properly before the Court of Appeals because \"the sole issue raised is whether a nonparty (the Parole Board or the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) ) may-\n   <em>\n    in the future\n   </em>\n   -constitutionally apply MCL 769.25a(6) to the unchallenged sentences imposed by the trial court\" and that as a result defendants are not \"aggrieved parties\" under MCR 7.203(A) because they are not seeking relief from their sentences as imposed by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    People v.

In other words, defendants are not arguing that they have been aggrieved by the trial court's sentencing orders; instead, they are concerned that they might be aggrieved in the future by the MDOC or the Parole Board if they apply MCL 769.25a(6). Accordingly, the issue is simply not ripe and defendants were not in any way aggrieved by the trial court orders. See\n   <em>\n    Federated Ins. Co. v. Oakland Co. Rd. Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451043\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/475/286/#p292\">\n    475 Mich. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20N.W.2d%20846\">\n    715 N.W.2d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (\"[A] litigant on appeal must demonstrate an injury arising from either the actions of the trial court or the appellate court judgment rather than an injury arising from the underlying facts of the case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Indeed, both parties recognized this truism at one point or another while this case was pending in the Court of Appeals. In response to defendants' appeals in the Court of Appeals, the prosecutor argued that the issue was not ripe. And in response to the prosecutor's briefs on appeal, both defendants moved to voluntarily dismiss their appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, when the Attorney General took over representation on behalf of the prosecutor, he opposed defendants' motions, contending that defendants had moved to dismiss their appeals only because of the pendency of a related class action challenge in federal court. The Court of Appeals then denied these motions. Furthermore, at oral arguments in that court, counsel for defendants agreed with the prosecutor's initial argument that the issue was not ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because I agree with the Court of Appeals dissent that the ex post facto issue is not ripe and that defendants were not aggrieved parties in the Court of Appeals, i.e., they were not aggrieved or harmed by\n   the trial court's sentencing orders, I would vacate the part of the Court of Appeals opinion addressing the ex post facto issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, if the ex post facto issue\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   properly before this Court, I would grant leave to appeal rather than simply deny leave. The Court of Appeals has struck down a Michigan statute on the grounds that it violates both the federal and state Constitutions. When a lower court strikes down an enactment of the Legislature as unconstitutional, this Court, the highest court of our state, should as a general proposition carefully review that decision because \"[s]tatutes are presumed to be constitutional, and we have a duty to construe a statute as constitutional unless its unconstitutionality is clearly apparent.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293668\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/495/394/#p404\">\n    495 Mich. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20N.W.2d%20524\">\n    852 N.W.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Zahra and Wilder, JJ., join the statement of Markman, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    MCL 769.25a(6) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    A defendant who is resentenced under subsection (4) shall be given credit for time already served, but shall not receive any good time credits, special good time credits, disciplinary credits, or any other credits that reduce the defendant's minimum or maximum sentence.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Judge Boonstra concurred in the majority's decision to the extent it held that defendant Rucker's resentencing did not violate the Sixth Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
