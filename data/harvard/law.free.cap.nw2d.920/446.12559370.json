As the above cases show, inadequate findings are a recurring issue in commitment hearings. Here, the district court order included only a conclusory statement that Kulink met the two elements in question. The presence of three sentences as both the findings of fact and conclusions of law for two separate elements is not sufficient for this Court to conduct appellate review. Because these three sentences are insufficiently detailed, they are not findings sufficient to support the district court's conclusion that Kulink remains a sexually dangerous individual. We do not reach Kulink's other argument regarding the State meeting its burden because there is not enough for this Court to review. It is for the district court in the first instance to assess credibility, resolve conflicts in testimony, draw inferences, and synthesize these determinations in findings of fact. Our review of the record suggests the evidence in support of elements three and four is not overwhelming. It is not within our appellate function to make findings in the first instance or to infer from the district court's conclusions and the record the factual findings it might have made in support of that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 10] We conclude the district court did not make findings of fact sufficient to permit appellate review.

VandeWalle, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The majority opinion is well written and provides an appropriate analysis for this case. Although I have signed the majority opinion, I write separately to urge the legislature or this Court to take action to address what I perceive to be a significant injustice created by the length of time it takes to complete the annual discharge petition proceedings provided by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 25-03.3-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 13] In 2007, at age 15, Kulink was adjudicated as a delinquent child on one\n   count of gross sexual imposition. Kulink was subsequently determined to be a sexually dangerous individual and assigned to sex offender treatment at the North Dakota State Hospital (\"NDSH\"). In September 2016, Kulink consented to civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual at the NDSH and was assigned to community placement. Kulink has remained in community placement status since the civil commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Section 25-03.3-18, N.D.C.C., provides a committed individual with an annual opportunity to petition for discharge from the civil commitment. On August 3, 2017, Kulink filed an application seeking discharge from the civil commitment. Approximately six months later, on February 9, 2018, a hearing was held to determine whether Kulink should be discharged from the civil commitment. The district court issued an order denying Kulink's application on February 15, 2018, and Kulink filed an appeal on March 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 15] This Court heard oral argument on October 25, 2018 and has issued an opinion in less than sixty days following the argument. Unfortunately, the opinion concludes that it is necessary to remand this case to the district court for further findings. Regardless of the outcome on remand, because another year of commitment has come and gone, N.D.C.C. \u00a7 25-03.3-18 requires that Kulink be provided with another opportunity to request a discharge from the civil commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 16] This case is not unique in the length of the delays. Paragraph 9 of the majority opinion provides several examples of annual discharge proceedings that extended beyond a year and overlapped into the next review period. A particularly egregious example of the injustice caused by delay is provided by our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Interest of Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882688\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/861/484/\">\n    2015 ND 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882688\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/861/484/\">\n    861 N.W.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Interest of Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817183\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/25/\">\n    2016 ND 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817183\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/25/\">\n    876 N.W.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , two cases involving the same committed individual and the same petition for discharge. In the 2015 appeal, this Court remanded an order denying the committed individual's petition for a discharge from civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual. On remand, the district court again denied the petition for discharge. Following the second appeal, this Court reversed the district court's denial of the petition for discharge. In summary, the committed individual was held for over two years from the submission of the petition for discharge until finally discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Some delays in these proceedings are necessary. For example, the committed individual is provided with an opportunity to undergo an independent examination. N.D.C.C. \u00a7 25-03.3-12. Significant delay is often encountered in setting the time for the independent examination, providing the independent examiner an opportunity to review the committed individual's records and the preparation of a report following the examination. Additionally, our current schedule for the preparation of the transcript and submission of briefs on appeal adds to the delay. Despite the challenges, I urge the legislature and this Court to find a way to provide committed individuals an opportunity to have a timely review of their commitments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Kulink argues this Court should adopt a de novo standard of review on appeal to reduce the amount of delay. We have previously recognized the outcome of a sexually dangerous individual proceeding is often dependent upon the district court's credibility determinations of expert witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.\n   <em>\n    Matter of J.T.N.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7074974\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/807/570/\">\n    2011 ND 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7074974\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/807/570/\">\n    807 N.W.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court is in a better position to weigh the credibility of the expert witnesses, and I would decline to replace the modified clearly erroneous\n   standard with a de novo standard of review. Under our current standard of review, the insufficient findings compel this case to be remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Jon J.
