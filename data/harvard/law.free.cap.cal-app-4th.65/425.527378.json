In lay terms, section 20001, subdivision (a) describes the crime of hit-and-run.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The penalties for violating subdivision (a) are set forth in section 20001, subdivision (b). Subdivision (b)(1) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (2), any violation of subdivision (a) shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison, or in the county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both fine and imprisonment.\u201d Subdivision (b)(2) prescribes more severe penalties under certain limited circumstances: \u201cAny violation of subdivision (a) <em>which results in death or permanent, serious injury </em>shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years, or in the county jail for not less than 90 days nor more than one year, or by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both fine and imprisonment. However, the court may, in the interests of justice and for reasons stated in the record, reduce or eliminate the minimum imprisonment required by this paragraph.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The appellant in this case, Kristen Leigh Braz, was the driver of a pickup truck that was involved in an accident in which Gloria Washington was seriously injured. A jury found appellant guilty of a felony violation of section 20001, subdivision (a). The jury also found true a special allegation that Washington suffered permanent, serious injuries within the meaning of subdivision (b)(2). Based on that finding, the trial court placed appellant on three years probation pursuant to subdivision (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">On appeal, appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the charge of violating section 20001, subdivision (a). She instead raises several instructional errors that we conclude lack merit. We therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Appellant also contends, however, that the trial court erred by denying her motion to dismiss the aforementioned special allegation because there was no substantial evidence that appellant\u2019s violation of section 20001, subdivision (a) proximately caused Washington\u2019s injuries to be permanent and serious. We agree and conclude that the trial court erred by imposing punishment on appellant pursuant to subdivision (b)(2). We therefore vacate the trial court\u2019s imposition of probation and remand for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion. In addition, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that we should reduce her offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. On remand, appellant may renew her motion before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The accident which resulted in appellant\u2019s conviction and Washington\u2019s injuries occurred on October 4, 1996. On that day, appellant and Washington were drawn into a domestic dispute between appellant\u2019s friend, Stacy Williams, and Stacy\u2019s estranged husband, Randy Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Randy has custody of the couple\u2019s two daughters, Ashley and Amber. On the afternoon of October 4, 1996, the girls were at the home of Annette Sandford, Randy\u2019s mother, in Vacaville, California. Randy\u2019s stepfather, Jeffrey Sandford, Randy\u2019s brother, Aric Downs, and Aric\u2019s girlfriend, Rickshella Harrison, were also at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Appellant had driven Stacy to Annette\u2019s home in appellant\u2019s pickup truck because Stacy wanted her children for the weekend. When they arrived, Stacy knocked on the door and Ashley answered. Ashley went outside with Stacy and Amber followed them. Both girls got into the cab of appellant\u2019s truck, which had extra seats behind the main seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Annette and Aric called Randy on the telephone and told him that Stacy was there and that he should come over. When Randy arrived, he saw his daughters in appellant\u2019s truck. He and Stacy began arguing over whether Stacy could take the girls with her. Randy told his daughters to get out of appellant\u2019s truck, but Stacy walked back to the passenger side of the truck, pushed the seat back so the girls could not leave, and sat down on the seat. Appellant had been sitting in the truck all this time. Randy, sensing that appellant and Stacy were about to leave, leaned in and \u201ckind of sat\u201d on Stacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Washington was Randy\u2019s girlfriend at the time of this incident. She had arrived at Annette\u2019s home before the argument began and had gone inside. Washington and Annette, who was also inside, had decided to try to get Ashley and Amber back in the house. When they went outside, however, Randy was already arguing with Stacy. They walked down the driveway and stood near appellant\u2019s truck. When Randy and Stacy began fighting inside the truck, Annette threatened to call the police. In response, appellant started the truck. Randy jumped out.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As the truck pulled away, Washington grabbed the still-open passenger-side door. She began running alongside the truck but lost her balance. She fell but kept her grip on the truck and was dragged along the ground. Aric testified that he heard Washington say \u201cNo,\u201d then she lost her grip on the truck. Both Jeffrey and Aric saw Washington fall to the ground. The right rear tire of appellant\u2019s truck ran over or struck Washington\u2019s head so that the truck bounced in the air. Appellant continued driving away.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Aric testified that he saw Stacy, Ashley, and Amber looking out the rear window of appellant\u2019s truck as this was happening, but did not see appellant turn around. Mary Willis, a neighbor of Annette\u2019s, testified that she saw appellant looking in her rear view mirror as she sped down the street. Willis testified that as the truck left, she looked up the street and could see a body lying in the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Ashley testified that she saw Washington grab on to appellant\u2019s truck and then get run over. She testified that she felt a bump right after Washington lost her grip on the truck. She also testified that after the truck bounced appellant said in a loud voice, \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Appellant testified that when she drove away from Annette\u2019s house, the children and Stacy were all yelling at her to go. At that point she could see Randy but no one else. She did not feel a bump or the wheels of her truck leave the road. She did not see anyone trying to catch her attention to stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>She did not hear Washington yell \u201cNo.\u201d She testified that she may have said \u201cOh my God,\u201d but that she was only reacting to the situation in general and not to anything that happened to Washington. She also testified that she did not look in her rear view mirror as she drove away but only did so when she reached a stop sign further down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Appellant claimed she did not know what happened to Washington at the time she left Annette\u2019s house, and that she first learned of the accident after she and Stacy had driven all the way to El Dorado County and called Stacy\u2019s mother, who told them what had happened. She testified that she became so distraught she was unfit to drive and could not return to Vacaville. She also testified that she did not call the police because she did not know what to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On cross-examination, appellant testified that she stopped once before reaching El Dorado County to buy a soda. She never spoke with Ashley or Stacy about the incident along the way. When they reached El Dorado County, and after learning what had happened, they all went to the home of appellant\u2019s nearest friends where, appellant testified, she \u201cbroke down\u201d and \u201cfell apart.\u201d They stayed the night, and the next morning appellant called the Vacaville police. On October 6, 1996, appellant turned herself in to the police along with her truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On November 4, 1996, appellant was charged by information with a felony violation of section 20001, subdivision (a). The information contained a special allegation that in committing this offense appellant had personally inflicted great bodily injury upon Washington within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7, subdivision (a), and that the offense was therefore a serious felony within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8). Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charged offense and denied the special allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">During the trial, after the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, appellant moved pursuant to Penal Code section 1118.1 to dismiss the special allegation. Appellant also moved to dismiss the \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d alleged pursuant to section 20001, subdivision (b)(2), even though the information did not contain such an allegation. The district attorney responded by moving to dismiss the original special allegation and to amend the special allegation to conform to the proof, i.e., to allege that Washington had suffered permanent, serious injuries within the meaning of section 20001, subdivision (b)(2). The trial court resolved the matter by dismissing the Penal Code allegation, and ruling that the available evidence justified asking the jury to determine whether it was true or not that appellant\u2019s violation of section 20001, subdivision (a) caused permanent, serious injury to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The jury ultimately found appellant guilty of the charged offense, and that Washington had suffered permanent, serious injury within the meaning of section 20001, subdivision (b)(2). The trial court thereafter denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and to reduce the charged offense to a misdemeanor. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court suspended imposition of judgment and sentence and placed appellant on three years\u2019 probation on the condition, among other things, that appellant serve 365 days in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">I. <em>The Trial Court Erred by Denying Appellant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Special Allegation That Washington Suffered Permanent, Serious Injury Within the Meaning of Section 20001, Subdivision (b)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Appellant contends on appeal, as she did below, that section 20001, subdivision (b)(2) does not apply unless the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with subdivision (a) proximately causes permanent, serious injury to another person, and that there was no evidence that appellant\u2019s failure to comply with subdivision (a) proximately caused Washington\u2019s permanent, serious injuries. Appellant therefore contends the trial court erred by denying her motion to dismiss that allegation. We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A. <em>Under section 20001, subdivision (b)(2), a defendant\u2019s violation of section 20001, subdivision (a) must cause permanent, serious injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We quote here again the pertinent language of section 20001, subdivision (b)(2): \u201cAny violation of subdivision (a) <em>which results </em>in death or permanent, serious injury shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years, or in the county jail for not less than 90 days nor more than one year, or by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both fine and imprisonment.\u201d (Italics added.) This language is clear and unambiguous and requires no interpretation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bechler </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 373, 377 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 532] [\u201c[w]here statutory language is clear and unambiguous and serves a rational purpose, there is no need for statutory construction \u201cand courts should not indulge in it.\u201d . . .\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.)].) It plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>provides that any permanent, serious injury must be caused by a violation of subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Section 20001, subdivision (a) describes a standard of conduct for drivers who are involved in accidents causing injury to other persons, whether or not the drivers are responsible for the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jimenez </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1625-1626 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 268], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kobrin </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 416, 428, fn. 7 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 895, 903 P.2d 1027].) \u201cThe gravamen of a section 20001 offense ... is not the initial injury of the victim, <em>but leaving the scene without presenting identification or rendering aid.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Escobar </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1504, 1509 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 579], italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Corners </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139, 148 [221 Cal.Rptr. 387] [\u201cAlthough a violation of section 20001 is popularly denominated \u2018hit-and-run,\u2019 the act made criminal thereunder is not the \u2018hitting\u2019 but the \u2018running.\u2019 \u201d].) It thus follows that a court may not impose the penalties set forth in subdivision (b)(2) unless the defendant\u2019s failure to stop and present identification and render aid causes permanent, serious injury to the accident victim. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Corners, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 148.[\u201c[commission of the crime gives rise to civil liability for damages only if the act of leaving the scene proximately causes <em>further </em>injury or death\u201d], quoting <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>E.J. Willig Truck Transp. Co. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 669, 679 [255 P.2d 802], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We reject respondent\u2019s suggestion that any <em>accident </em>that results in permanent, serious, injury triggers section 20001, subdivision (b)(2). That suggestion contradicts the plain meaning of that provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, respondent\u2019s interpretation would malee the degree of punishment for violating section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>20001, subdivision (a) entirely dependent on the degree of injury suffered by a person <em>in the initial accident, </em>and, in effect, would allow a defendant to be held liable for the severity of the accident even if the defendant did not cause the accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This interpretation not only ignores but directly contradicts the decisional law that unequivocally holds that the purpose of section 20001, subdivision (a) is to punish \u201cnot the \u2018hitting\u2019 but the \u2018running.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Corners, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 148.) Respondent\u2019s citation to <em>Comers </em>for the proposition that section 20001 was intended to punish persons attempting to avoid civil or criminal liability for an accident is likewise unavailing. Even if this were true, it does not allow us to interpret subdivision (b)(2) contrary to its plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">B. <em>The trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss because no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s violation of section 20001, subdivision (a) proximately caused permanent, serious </em>injury<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">II. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Commit Any Instructional </em>Errors*</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">HI. <em>This Matter Must Be Remanded to the Trial Court for Further Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Since appellant\u2019s challenges to her conviction all lack merit, we must affirm her conviction. However, our conclusion that the trial court should have dismissed the special allegation under section 20001, subdivision (b)(2) requires us to vacate the trial court\u2019s imposition of three years\u2019 probation on appellant and to remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In doing so, we reject appellant\u2019s final contention that we should reduce her offense from a felony to a misdemeanor.  We note that the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for similar relief below, that appellant does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>not challenge that decision on appeal, and that appellant has therefore waived her right to challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling. (See <em>Eureka Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 353, 369 [244 Cal.Rptr. 240].) In addition, appellant fails to cite any authority, and we are unaware of any, that even suggests an appellate court has the power, independent of the trial court\u2019s power, to declare an offense to be a felony or misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Nevertheless, when a criminal statute does not define a particular offense as a felony or a misdemeanor, as in this case (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 17; \u00a7 20001, subd. (b)(1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 637]), the test of whether the offense should be deemed a felony or a misdemeanor is the actual penalty imposed <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bury </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1873, 1875-1876 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 682]; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 133, 137 [55 Cal.Rptr. 350]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walters </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 98, 101 [11 Cal.Rptr. 597]). Thus, whether appellant\u2019s offense will be deemed a misdemeanor or felony will depend on the punishment imposed by the trial court on remand. Appellant may, therefore, renew her motion to reduce her offense to a misdemeanor before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We vacate the trial court\u2019s imposition of three years\u2019 probation on appellant, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion. On remand, appellant may renew her motion to have her offense reduced to a misdemeanor. Our remand is not meant as an indication of our view of how the trial court should rule on such a motion. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 17, 1998. The petitions of both respondent and appellant for review by the Supreme Court were denied October 21, 1998. Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., and Brown, J., were of the opinion that the petitions should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\">All further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code except where otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-11\"> Although the trial court had stated that the verdict form would ask the jury whether it was true or not that appellant\u2019s violation of section 20001, subdivision (a) caused permanent, serious injury to Washington, the actual verdict form only asked whether it was true or not that Washington suffered permanent, serious injury within the meaning of section 20001, subdivision (b)(2). On appeal, appellant does not contend this was error. Even if appellant had raised the issue, however, we would not reach it because, as we shall explain, the causation question should not have gone to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Section 20003 requires a driver to furnish identifying information to \u201cthe person struck or the driver or occupants of any vehicle collided with, and ... to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident,\u201d (\u00a7 20003, subds.

(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Section 20004 provides: \u201cIn the event of death of any person resulting from an accident, the driver of any vehicle involved after fulfilling the requirements of this division, and if there be no traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident to whom to give the information required by Section 20003, shall, without delay, report the accident to the nearest office of the Department of the California Highway Patrol or office of a duly authorized police authority and submit with the report the information required by Section 20003.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The summary digest of the Senate bill that added subdivision (b)(2) to section 20001 states: \u201cThis bill would make it punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years, or in the county jail for not to exceed one year, or by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both, to fail to comply with the requirements of existing law, <em>if the accident results in death or permanent, serious injury, </em>as defined, thereby imposing a state-mandated local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>program.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 2374, 4 Stats. 1988 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 402, italics added.) Notwithstanding the import of the italicized language, we may not look to legislative history to create an ambiguity in the otherwise clear and unambiguous language of subdivision (b)(2). (See <em>Teachers Management &amp; Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 438, 446 [134 Cal.Rptr. 523].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\">We note that if the defendant did in fact cause the accident, then there are other criminal statutes which could apply.

In addition, a civil tort action would presumably be available to the victim or, if the victim is deceased, the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 425.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
