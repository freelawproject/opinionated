J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARk\">A jury convicted Steven Eric Craig of threatening the life of or threatening to do serious bodily harm to a deputy public defender. (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 76.) In bifurcated proceedings, the trial court found that Craig had suffered two \u201cstrike\u201d priors. (\u00a7 667, subds. (c), (e).) He was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life and appeals, claiming his motion to dismiss was erroneously denied and prosecutorial misconduct and jury instruction and sentencing errors occurred. We reject his contentions and affirm. In a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which we consolidated with the appeal for purposes of determining if an order to show cause should issue, he contends that his trial counsel was incompetent. We reject this contention and therefore deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Craig, who had previously been convicted of, inter alia, murder, attempted murder and threatening the President of the United States, was convicted in September 1995 of misdemeanor assault and a misdemeanor drug offense, for which he received probation. The public defender who represented Craig during the latter case (hereafter, the victim) felt that the disposition in that case was \u201cmore than fair.\u201d Craig did not agree. In February 1996, Craig sent the following letter to the deputy district attorney who was in charge of the prosecutor\u2019s office of the trial court where the disposition had been reached:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-12\">\u201cDear Sir,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>\u201cI don\u2019t know your name but, if you have some disagreement with this, you can take it up with the federal government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-4\">\u201cMy name is Steven Eric Craig and I want to be legal and I do mean downright actual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-5\">\u201cI was arrested unlawfully by Hemet Police Dept, on 7-11-95, for which I received 3 yrs. probation fr-om as a result of a crooked deal hammered out by [my pjublic [djefender ... on 8-30-95.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">\u201cThe Secret Service tells me you are the man to go to and who must overturn the conviction and let me be actual as a result of this so-called deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">\u201c[My pjublic [djefender told me that I couldn\u2019t be legal at my charges and also told me that Sheriff\u2019s Officers would be marching in, in a number of minutes to arrest me and to quote him \u2018haul me off for 18 mos.\u2019 So, I took the deal out of fear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">\u201cI do not like to be told that I am not legal when I am. He has obviously never been shot as a professional, yet. His day is coming if he will not defend me to my satisfaction! I mean business, sir! I suggest you get some-thing done about this before I decide to show you just how legal I really am! Make an app[oin]t[ment] ... if you need anything explained any further!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-9\">\u201cThank You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-10\">\u201cSteven Eric Craig ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-11\">\u201cP.S. [Tjhis is no threat, this is a promise!\u201d (Strikethrough in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">The victim, who was shown the letter by the deputy district attorney who received it, testified that after he discovered information about Craig\u2019s past criminal convictions, which indicated that Craig was far more dangerous than he had originally thought, he took the statements in the letter as a threat. He also said that his fear of Craig was greater at the time of trial than it had been when he was first shown the letter by the deputy district attorney. Further facts concerning the crime are discussed elsewhere in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>Issues and Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">1. <em>Motion to Dismiss</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">\n<em>2. Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">a. <em>CAUIC No. 7.40</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Section 76 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who knowingly and willingly threatens the life of, or threatens serious bodily harm to, any . . . county public defender . . . , with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat, and the apparent ability to carry out the threat by any means, is guilty of a public offense. . . . [10 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [1D (c) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 (1) \u2018Apparent ability to carry out the threat\u2019 includes the ability to fulfill the threat at some future date when the person making the threat is an incarcerated prisoner with a stated release date. [10 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [U3 (5) \u2018Threat\u2019 means a verbal or written threat or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of verbal or written statements and conduct made with the intent and the apparent ability to carry out the threat so as to cause the person who is the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her immediate family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Two somewhat contradictory things in section 76 are worthy of note: First, by its express inclusion in the term \u201capparent ability to carry out the threat\u201d the ability of an incarcerated person to fulfill the threat at some future date, it <em>implies </em>that for nonincarcerated defendants, the ability to fulfill the threat must be present. However, it is also logical to assume that the statute is impliedly equating \u201capparent ability\u201d with \u201cpresent ability\u201d; second, nowhere in the statute does the word \u201cpresent\u201d appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">CALJIC No. 7.40 duplicates the above provisions and adds another, not expressly provided for in section 76, which is the subject of this contention by Craig. CALJIC No. 7.40 states that an element of the offense is that the defendant \u201chad the present ability to carry out the threat by any means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The comment to CALJIC No. 7.40 refers only to section 76 and to 2 Witkin and Epstein, California Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Crime Against Governmental Authority, section 1135, page 1315, which make no reference whatsoever to a present ability to carry out the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Over defense objection, the trial court here changed the word \u201cpresent\u201d in the last paragraph of CALJIC No. 7.40 to \u201capparent.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Craig here contends that <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 705, 707 [89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664], <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelner </em>(2d Cir. 1976) 534 F.2d 1020, 34 A.L.R.Fed. 767 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gudger </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 310 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 510] \u201ccompel the conclusion that the only threats which may constitutionally be proscribed are those which are immediate and which have the immediate prospect of execution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks, boldface &amp; underlining omitted.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Other than paying homage to the concept of a \u201ctrue threat,\u201d without discussion of what constitutes such a threat, <em>Watts </em>is really of little assistance to the issue before us. In <em>Watts, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that the political hyperbole engaged in by th\u00e9 defendant did not meet the requirements of a federal statute aimed at prohibiting threats to public officials.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Of much greater applicability, however, is <em>Kelner, </em>which, unlike <em>Watts, </em>does not bind us. (See <em>In re Tyrell J. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 68, 79 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 876 P.2d 519].) However, in any discussion of the extent to which we should be persuaded by language in <em>Kelner, </em>we cannot ignore the California Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Kelner </em>in <em>In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 698, which, of course, binds us.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number><em>In re M.S. </em>dealt with the constitutionality of California\u2019s hate crimes statutes, sections 422.6 and 422.7.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At this juncture, it is worthy of note that at the relevant time, section 422.6, like section 76, expressly referred to \u201cthe <em>apparent </em>ability to carry out the threat[,]\u201d (italics added) but contained no language about the defendant\u2019s <em>present </em>ability. Section 422.7, on the other hand, specifically addressed the defendant\u2019s present ability. Of this, the California Supreme Court said, \u201cSections 422.6 and 422.7 each contain the element of present or apparent ability to carry out the threat, and are thus consistent with <em>Kelner.\u2019\u2019 (In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 712.) Thus, the California Supreme Court declared apparent ability to be tantamount to present ability, and either to be satisfactory of whatever requirement was created by <em>Kelner.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Now, on to that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">. The hate crimes provisions were challenged in <em>In re M.S. </em>on the basis that they punished speech which did not qualify as a true threat. Specifically, \u201cThe minors . . . suggest the requirement in . . . [section] 422.6, that the offender have the \u2018apparent ability to carry out the threat,\u2019 fails to satisfy the requirement of imminence. <em>The minors err, however, in assuming the First Amendment always requires the threatened harm be imminent for the threat to be constitutionally punishable. It does not. </em>flO The error stems from an overly expansive reading of . . . <em>Kelner . . . . </em>ft]] The minors read <em>Kelner </em>as requiring any constitutionally valid statute punishing the making of threats to contain the element of immediacy or imminence. They purport to derive this requirement from the doctrines governing speech likely to incite imminent lawless action [citation] and \u2018fighting words,\u2019 i.e., words that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace [citation]. <em>Kelner, </em>however, is distinguishable from the authorities pertaining to either incitement or fighting words, as it construed a statute lacking any requirement of specific intent. ... In order to restrict the statute\u2019s application to true threats, as <em>Watts </em>[v. <em>United States, supra, </em>394 U.S. 705] made clear the [United States] Constitution mandates, <em>Kelner </em>imposed the immediacy requirement quoted above. [Citation.] Moreover, Kelner\u2019s requirement of imminence or immediacy must be read in light of the facts of that case. When the defendant made the threat, his victim had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>yet even set foot in the United States, and there was no evidence he was aware of the threat. [Citation.] Yet the <em>Kelner </em>court found the requisite immediacy in the fact the defendant professed the present ability to carry out the threat .... Sections 422.6 and 422.7 each contain the element of <em>present or apparent ability </em>to carry out the threat, and are thus consistent with <em>Kelner. </em>[f] Furthermore, in contrast to the federal statute at issue in <em>Kelner, </em>subdivision (a) of section 422.6 expressly requires that a punishable threat be \u2018wilful.\u2019 In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lashley </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 938, 949 . . . , the Court of Appeal held that, to violate the statute, one must specifically intend, by means of threats of violence to another person, to invade interests protected by constitutional authority. ... [1] Given, therefore, the specific intent requirements in the two . . . statutes [section 422.6 required the threat to be willful and section 422.7 required the crime be committed \u201cfor the purpose of intimidating or interfering\u201d], the concerns are absent that motivated the <em>Kelner </em>court to insist on evidence of the threat\u2019s imminence or immediacy, in prosecutions under a federal statute lacking such a mens rea requirement, and we decline to infer such a requirement. HQ . . . [ID \u2022 \u2022 - As long as the threat reasonably appears to be a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm [citation], and its circumstances are such that there is a reasonable tendency to produce in the victim a fear the threat will be carried out [citation], the fact the threat may be contingent on some future event (e.g., \u2018If you don\u2019t move out of the neighborhood by Sunday, I\u2019ll kill you\u2019) does not cloak it in constitutional protection. [Citation.] Section 422.6, therefore, is not unconstitutional for lacking a requirement of immediacy or imminence.\u201d <em>(In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 711-714, italics added.) As is clear from this language, the United States Constitution does not create a requirement of present ability where, as here, the threat is willingly made, with the specific intent that it be taken as a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Finally, we turn to <em>People </em>v. <em>Gudger, supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.4th 310, where the issue was the constitutionality of section 76. <em>Gudger </em>predated <em>In re M.S. </em>and may, in light of the latter decision, have been worded differently if decided today. Be that as it may, <em>Gudger </em>concluded that even under a more expansive interpretation of <em>Kelner </em>than the California Supreme Court permitted in <em>In re M.S., </em>section 76, <em>minus CALJIC\u2019s addition of the \u201cpresent </em>ability\u201d <em>requirement, </em>was sufficient to pass constitutional muster. <em>Gudger </em>held: \u201cThe language in section 76 contains two critical elements which combine to satisfy the requirement that only true threats, and not political hyperbole, joking expressions of frustration, or other innocuous and constitutionally protected speech, are punished. The language of section 76 requires, in pertinent part, (1) \u2018the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat\u2019 and (2) \u2018the apparent ability to carry out that threat by any means.\u2019 [f] Although there is no requirement in section 76 of specific intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>to execute the threat, the statute requires the defendant to have the specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat and also to have the apparent ability to carry it out, requirements which convey a sense of immediacy and the reality of potential danger and sufficiently proscribe only true threats, meaning threats which \u2018convincingly express an intention of being carried out.\u2019 [Citation.] Section 76 is therefore worded in a manner which satisfies what decisions subsequent to <em>Watts </em>and <em>Kelner </em>have viewed as a guideline for determining whether there is a true threat: \u2018whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] HD Thus, section 76, while not a verbatim duplication of the unconditional language of the <em>Kelner </em>decision, adequately expresses the notion that the threats proscribed are only those \u2018so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.'[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] [Citation.] Accordingly, section 76 is not constitutionally over-broad, and appellant\u2019s attack on the statute is without merit.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gudger, supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 320-321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>It is interesting to note that other provisions of the Penal Code which punish threats refer only to specific intent and/or apparent ability, and not to present ability (see \u00a7\u00a7 95.1, 422.6, 646.9) and those that have been challenged similarly to Craig\u2019s challenge here have passed constitutional muster. (See <em>In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 698; <em>People </em>v. <em>Halgren </em>(1996) 52 Cal.App.4th 1223 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 176]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Falck, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 287.) Whatever the provisions of CALJIC No. 7.40, when, as here, some are not backed by precedent, they do not bind the trial courts. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Glover </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 496 [217 Cal.Rptr. 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Section 76 requires an apparent ability to carry out the threat. CALJIC No. 7.40\u2019s engrafting of an additional requirement of present ability is neither supported by the language of the statute, nor is it required by law in order for section 76 to pass constitutional muster. In our view, that provision should be deleted from CALJIC No. 7.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">b. <em>Defense Requested Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Craig unsuccessfully sought to graft onto section 76 the requirement of <em>Kelner </em>and section 422, that the threat be \u201cso unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution.\u201d (\u00a7 422.) As <em>Gudger </em>held, such a requirement does not apply to section 76, either by its express terms or in order for it to pass constitutional muster.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">c. <em>Threat Communicated to Third Person</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Over defense objection, the trial court gave the following instruction, which had been proffered by the prosecution: \u201cIn order to constitute a \u25a1threat\u2019 it is not necessary that the threat be made directly to the intended victim. It is sufficient that the threat be made through a third party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The trial court refused to give the following instruction, proffered by the defense: \u201cWhether the threat is made to the person threatened[] is a factor to be considered in determining the specific intent of the person making the statement and his apparent ability to carry out the threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Without citing authority holding that the first instruction was an incorrect statement of the law and that the second was correct, Craig here asserts that it was error to give the former and refuse to give the latter. However, neither <em>Kelner </em>nor <em>Gudger </em>nor either of the other two cases cited by Craig in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>of his assertion even discusses this aspect of section 76. Craig\u2019s point has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">d. <em>CALJIC No. 2.90</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Craig repeats the often asserted argument that CALJIC No. 2.90, the standard jury instruction on reasonable doubt, is defective because of its omission of the term \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d A number of other courts have rejected the same argument (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Godwin </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1562, 1571-1572 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 545]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barillas </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1022 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 166]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Honig </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 289, 342 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 555]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carroll </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 892, 895-896 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 868]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 805, 815-816 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 853]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tran </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 253, 263 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 650]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Light </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 879, 886-889 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 218]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1078 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 77]), and we agree with their reasoning. In light of the statement by the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 504 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249, 31 A.L.R.5th 888], that the inclusion of the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> adds nothing to the jury\u2019s understanding of reasonable doubt, we cannot agree with Craig that omission of it from the instruction was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">3., 4.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">5. <em>Writ of Habeas Corpus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">As Craig acknowledges, in order to persuade us that an order to show cause should issue due to incompetency of counsel, he carries the burden of proving that counsel was inadequate and there is a reasonable probability that, but for the inadequacy, a result more favorable to him would have occurred. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674].) A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number><em>Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 215 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710].) A strong presumption of adequacy attaches <em>(In re Fields </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1063, 1069 [275 Cal.Rptr. 384, 800 P.2d 862]), and the appellate court is even more deferential in matters involving trial tactics. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fairbank </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1223, 1243 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 784, 947 P.2d 1321].) \u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 697 [104 S.Ct. at p. 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">First, Craig contends that his trial counsel was inadequate for refusing to permit him to testify at trial that he did not mean to threaten the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, in light of Craig\u2019s assertion, <em>following his conviction, </em>that when he wrote the letter he was angry at the victim in the letter, he was \u201cclarifying the law, you can shoot a professional, if the attorney or doctor does not do what you want them to do\u201d and \u201che felt ... it was his constitutional right to shoot a professional who fails to do his job. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> along with the impeachment he would have subjected himself to due to the existence of his prior convictions for threatening, assaultive and murderous conduct, there was a sound tactical basis for not permitting Craig to testify at trial. Added to this is the fact, as the People point out, that Craig\u2019s postarrest statement that he did not mean to threaten the victim was introduced at trial. In light of all these facts, Craig cannot possibly persuade us that there is a reasonable probability that he would have enjoyed a different outcome had he taken the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">At trial, the parties stipulated that, following his arrest, Craig was given his Miranda<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> rights and he waived them and agreed to talk. The sergeant who interviewed Craig testified that Craig admitted authoring the letter, saying it was directed at the victim. When asked what he meant in the letter by the word, \u201cshot,\u201d Craig put his hand in the form of a gun, which he pointed at the sergeant\u2019s chest, and said, \u201cBang,\u201d five times. Craig also said that he had a constitutional right to shoot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">In his declaration in support of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Craig asserts that he was prepared to testify that he \u201cwas never advised of [his] <em>Miranda </em>rights, . . . never admitted authoring [the letter], . . . never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>said \u2018Bang\u2019. . . , never positioned [his] hands in the form of a gun or pointed them towards anyone\u2019s chest . . . , and at the inception of the interview . . . [he] advised [the sergeant] that [he] wanted to \u2018stand on the 5th\u2019 and preferred an attorney before questioning.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He now contends that his trial counsel was incompetent for failing to move to suppress Craig\u2019s statements on the basis that they were obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Of course, had he successfully done so, the only evidence admitted at trial that he did not intend for the letter to be taken as a threat by the victim would not have been introduced, as Craig made this statement during the interview. Had trial counsel for Craig moved for suppression, and Craig testified then in accord with his statements in the declaration, it would have been his word against the sergeant\u2019s. Craig fails to persuade us that there is a reasonable probability that he would have been successful in his motion. Therefore, he fails to carry his burden of showing inadequacy or prejudice. (See <em>In re Avena </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 694 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 909 P.2d 1017]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Next, Craig faults his trial counsel for failing to object to any of the exhibits offered at trial by the prosecution, which comprise the letter and its envelope, pictures of how the victim\u2019s office is situated in relation to the district attorney\u2019s office, pictures of the room in which Craig was interviewed following his arrest, his prison packet and his fingerprint exemplar. Craig suggests no basis upon which any such objection might have been advanced. Therefore, Craig fails to demonstrate that there was any possibility that such an objection would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Craig also faults his trial attorney for failing to make an opening statement or introduce evidence. Other than a letter which Craig wrote to the victim <em>after his arrest, </em>in which he disclaimed any intent to threaten the victim,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Craig does not even suggest what the content of an opening statement or the nature of other evidence might have been. He thus fails to persuade us that there is a reasonable possibility that he would have enjoyed a better outcome had an opening statement been made or other evidence, if any existed, had been introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">During his direct examination, the deputy district attorney who received the letter testified that \u201c[a]nything that was at all unusual came across my desk.\u201d The following colloquy then occurred between the prosecutor, the witness and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>\u201c[The prosecutor:] With regard to this letter you received, why specifically did you consider it to be unusual?[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-4\">\u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection, relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-6\">\u201cThe Witness: Because it made a direct threat against a lawyer who worked in the Hemet court, [the victim]. It was addressed to me in my capacity as the District Attorney of Hemet. Wasn\u2019t addressed to me by name, but it was addressed to me in my capacity as the supervising D.A. of the Hemet office, and it made a direct threat that I interpreted to be on [the victim]\u2019s life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">\u201c[The prosecutor:] And as a result of that direct threat on [the victim]\u2019s life, and is . . . [the victim] from the Hemet office, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-8\">\u201c[The witness:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-9\">\u201c[The prosecutor:] As a result of that direct threat on his life, what specifically did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-10\">\u201c[Defense counsel:] I would object. I believe she is misstating the evidence. I believe she is assuming facts not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-11\">\u201c[The prosecutor:] I was repeating his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-12\">\u201cThe Court: After you received the letter . . . , what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-13\">\u201cThe Witness: After I read the letter, I called up [the victim]\u2019s office within a few minutes, and he wasn\u2019t there, and I left a message for him to call me right away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">Craig now criticizes his trial counsel for failing to object to the witness\u2019s characterization of the letter as containing a \u201cdirect threat.\u201d While counsel may have been successful in making an objection based on the fact that the witness\u2019s testimony was conclusionary, the prejudicial impact to Craig of the letter itself and of the victim\u2019s testimony that he interpreted Craig\u2019s words as a threat, which he took seriously, was far more significant than this witness\u2019s brief statement. Thus, we are not persuaded that there is a reasonable probability that had Craig successfully objected to the testimony, a different outcome would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">As a result of the prosecutor\u2019s representation that she would prove the reasonableness of the victim\u2019s fear of Craig by introducing evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Craig\u2019s violent past, defense counsel entered into a stipulation that based on his knowledge of Craig\u2019s prior criminal history, the victim reasonably feared for his safety and that of his immediate family. Craig now contends that his attorney was incompetent for entering into this stipulation. Faced with such a dilemma, however, we cannot fault counsel\u2019s tactical decision and we must be differential in such matters. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fairbank, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 1243.). Moreover, we are not persuaded that there is a reasonable possibility that had counsel not entered into the stipulation, and the prosecutor paraded Craig\u2019s prior convictions for violent crimes before the jury, a more favorable result for Craig would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Without any citation to the record, Craig asserts that there was evidence that he was mentally incompetent, and his trial attorney was inadequate for failing to have him examined or to enter a not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI) plea.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Without a factual basis for Craig\u2019s assertion, we cannot address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Finally, Craig faults his trial counsel for failing to move for a reduction of his conviction to a misdemeanor, pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b). However, in light of the trial court\u2019s remarks when denying his motion to dismiss his strike priors, Craig cannot possibly persuade us that such a motion had any chance for success. Therefore, the failure to bring it cannot amount to incompetency. (See <em>In re Avena, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 694; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Neither singularly, nor together, do any of the criticisms Craig voices concerning his trial counsel justify an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The judgment is affirmed. The petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Richli, J., and Gaut, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 4, 1998.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1082.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The trial court, over defense objection, also deleted from the definition of \u201capparent ability to carry out that threat\u201d the provision related to incarcerated prisoners. Thus, that provision, as given to the jury, read, \u201c \u2018Apparent ability to carry out that threat\u2019 includes the ability to fulfill the threat at some future date[.]\u201d Although Craig here notes this, the crux of his argument deals with the other amendment to CALJIC No. 7.40. Aside from the comments we make in connection with that, we note that there was not an issue here as to Craig\u2019s ability to carry out his threat at some future date. If there had been, we would discuss this issue more in depth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b912-7\">During oral argument, Craig urged us to adopt the view that <em>Watts </em>requires all statutes like section 76 to require present ability in order to pass constitutional muster. Craig misreads <em>Watts. </em>In dicta, <em>Watts </em>said of the federal law there at issue, which required the threat to be \u201cknowingly and willfully made,\u201d \u201cSome early cases found the willfullness requirement met if the speaker voluntarily uttered the charged words with \u2018an <em>apparent </em>determination to carry them into execution.\u2019 [Citations.] . . . Perhaps this interpretation is correct, although we have grave doubts about it.\u201d <em>(Watts </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>394 U.S. at pp. 707-708 [89 S.Ct. at p. 1401], italics in original.) The court went on to say, \u201cBut whatever the \u2018willfullness\u2019 requirement implies, ... the Government [must] prove a true \u2018threat\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 708 [89 S.Ct. at p. 1401]) which the court concluded did not include the political hyperbole there at issue. By no stretch of the imagination does <em>Watts </em>stand for the proposition Craig claims it does. Additionally, contrary to Craig\u2019s claim at oral argument, nothing in <em>Watts </em>supports the position inferentially taken in <em>In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365] that apparent ability is tantamount to present ability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Craig\u2019s attempt, during oral argument, to distinguish <em>In re M.S. </em>on the basis that section 76 has no specific intent requirement that the defendant execute the threat is meritless. Neither section 422.6 nor 427.7, at the time relevant to the decision, had such a requirement. The specific intent requirements they have, as explained in <em>In re M.S., </em>relate to the intent to invade the victim\u2019s interests which are protected by the Constitution or provided for by statute. This is a far cry from specific intent to execute the threat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">A commonsense reading of the version of CALJIC No. 7.40 given here, absent the reference to the ability to fulfill the threat at some future date, implies that the ability to carry out the threat be present. As already stated, had this been a case where there was evidence of no present ability to carry out the threat, but evidence of a future ability, we might conclude otherwise; however, it was not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Falck </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 287, 295 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 624], which Craig cites as supportive of <em>Gudger, </em>the Court of Appeal dealt with the constitutionality of the antistalking law. Specifically addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that the law was overly broad because it did not contain Kelner\u2019s limiting language that the threat be \u201cso unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to . . . convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution[,]\u201d the court said, \u201cThere is . . . nothing magic about these words. A similar challenge was made and rejected in . . . <em>Gudger </em>.... The <em>Gudger </em>court held . . . that it was not necessary that the statute contain the [language] if the statute makes it clear that it prohibits only threats that are so unambiguous and have such immediacy that they convincingly express an intention of being carried out. [Citation.] The court concluded that section 76 met this requirement . . . [by containing the requirements of a] . . . * \u201c specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat\u201d and . . . \u201cthe apparent ability to carry out that threat by any means.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (52 Cal.App.4th at p. 296 italics omitted.) The <em>Falck </em>court went on to hold: \u201cThe language of section 646.9 requires, in pertinent part, (1) the intent to place the victim in reasonable fear of his or her safety, and (2) the making of a \u2018credible threat.\u2019 The intent element of the section is a specific intent element, requiring that the actor embark upon a \u2018course of conduct <em>intended </em>to cause someone to fear.\u2019 [Fn. omitted.] . . . [A]t the time of appellant\u2019s communications to the victim, a \u2018credible threat\u2019 was defined as \u2018a verbal or written threat or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of verbal or written statements and conduct made with the intent and the <em>apparent ability </em>to carry out the threat so as to cause the person who is the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her immediate family.\u2019 By these requirements section 646.9 limited its application to only such threats as pose a danger to society and thus are unprotected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Falck, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 296-297, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"ALB\">Thus, by no stretch of the imagination does <em>Falck </em>support Craig\u2019s interpretation of <em>Gudger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbW\">Craig also claims that <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanfield </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1152 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 328] supports his interpretation of <em>Gudger. </em>Again, he is incorrect.
