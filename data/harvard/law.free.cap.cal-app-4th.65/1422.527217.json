(Tudor) stipulated to judgment in favor of State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) in order to seek immediate appellate review of numerous <em>in limine </em>rulings. While we conclude the judgment is appealable, on the record before us we cannot conclude the court abused its discretion in making the rulings. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-11\">A. <em>Nature of the Present Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-12\">SCIF is a public enterprise fund created for the purpose of transacting workers\u2019 compensation insurance. (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11770, 11773.) It was established to ensure that affordable workers\u2019 compensation insurance would be available to employers when coverage became mandatory. <em>(Courtesy Ambulance Service </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1504, 1511 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-13\">SCIF \u201cmay transact workers\u2019 compensation insurance required or authorized by law of this state to the same extent as any other insurer.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11778.) It is directed by statute to be \u201cfairly competitive with other insurers,\u201d and ultimately to become \u201cneither more nor less than self-supporting.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11775.) If SCIF accumulates an excess of assets over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>liabilities, necessary reserves, and a reasonable surplus for a given year, it may declare a dividend or credit to each employer whom it insures. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Tudor is a California corporation which grows and ships grapes and citrus fruit. From 1970 through 1991, Tudor purchased workers\u2019 compensation insurance from SCIF. In 1991, Tudor brought this action against SCIF for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, interference with contractual relations, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, accounting, declaratory relief, and breach of contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   In essence, Tudor contends SCIF established excessive reserves on, and otherwise mismanaged, Tudor\u2019s claims files, so that SCIF would receive higher premiums from and pay lower dividends to Tudor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">B. <em>Lower Court Rulings Sought to Be Reviewed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Prior to trial, Tudor filed nine motions <em>in </em>limine, and SCIF filed fourteen. Most of the parties\u2019 motions sought to exclude various items of evidence. The lower court granted some of Tudor\u2019s motions and denied others. It granted, in whole or in part, all of SCIF\u2019s motions, though, as noted, <em>post, </em>it stated all of its rulings were subject to reconsideration. Tudor challenges the following rulings on SCIF\u2019s motions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-7\">1. Restricting the parties to the language of the relevant Insurance Code sections in describing SCIF (Motion No. 1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-8\">2. Excluding testimony of Tudor\u2019s claims expert that SCIF\u2019s method of setting reserves was not standard in the industry, unless the expert produced the manuals of other companies he used for comparison (Motion No. 2);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-9\">3. Excluding or deferring evidence of SCIF\u2019s reserving practices with respect to insureds other than Tudor (Motion No. 5);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-10\">4. Excluding reference to the Unfair Insurance Practices Act (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 790-790.10) (Motion No. 6);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-11\">5. Excluding or deferring evidence of attorney fees and consultants\u2019 costs incurred by Tudor (Motion No. 7);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>6. Excluding evidence of SCIF\u2019s practices in administering workers\u2019 compensation insurance for public employers, absent a showing that SCIF followed the same practices with respect to Tudor (Motion No. 8);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-4\">7. Excluding evidence of alleged misreporting by SCIF of medical/legal costs (Motion No. 10);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-5\">8. Excluding reference to a trade journal article concerning SCIF\u2019s reserving practices, unless a hearsay exception was established (Motion No. ID;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-7\">9. Excluding reference to an SCIF internal memorandum concerning sales techniques, absent a sufficient foundation (Motion No. 12);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-8\">10. Excluding evidence of nonfinal judgments against SCIF in other cases involving similar claims by insureds (Motion No. 13); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-9\">11. Excluding reference to an internal SCIF memorandum concerning requests by insureds to examine claim files, absent a sufficient foundation (Motion No. 14).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">C. <em>The Parties\u2019 Stipulation for Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">After the court made its rulings, counsel for Tudor proposed to enter into a stipulation for judgment in favor of SCIF so that Tudor could file an immediate appeal. Counsel asserted that, due to the court\u2019s rulings, \u201cwe can\u2019t put into evidence and present the kind of trial that we feel we need to and that we believe the law allows us to.\u201d It appears one or both parties then prepared a stipulation for entry of judgment in favor of SCIF and against Tudor on Tudor\u2019s claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligence, and breach of contract. The stipulation stated Tudor\u2019s remaining claims had been dismissed voluntarily, without prejudice, and the parties had stipulated to toll the statute of limitations on those claims pending an appeal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">Before the court signed the judgment, however, the stipulation and judgment were modified by interlineation. As modified, the stipulation stated the parties had stipulated on the record to entry of a judgment in the form attached. The attached form of judgment awarded judgment in favor of SCIF and against Tudor on Tudor\u2019s claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, breach of contract, and spoliation of evidence. It further recited that Tudor\u2019s remaining claims \u201chave been dismissed,\u201d and deleted the provision that the dismissal was without prejudice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>The court signed the modified document, entitled \u201cFinal Judgment,\u201d and Tudor appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">A. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">As a preliminary matter, SCIF argues the appeal should be dismissed because the judgment from which Tudor appeals is not appealable. Ordinarily, a judgment entered pursuant to a stipulation is not appealable. <em>(Adoption of Matthew B. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1239, 1267 [284 Cal.Rptr. 18].) In <em>Building Industry Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Camarillo </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 810 [226 Cal.Rptr. 81, 718 P.2d 68] (cited hereafter as <em>Building Industry), </em>however, the Supreme Court stated, \u201c. . . there is an exception to the rule that a party may not appeal a consent judgment. If consent was merely given to facilitate an appeal following adverse determination of a critical issue, the party will not lose his right to be heard on appeal.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">The court reiterated the exception in a subsequent opinion <em>(Connolly </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1105, 1111 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 857, 824 P.2d 663]), and numerous Court of Appeal decisions have cited and relied on it. (See, e.g., <em>County of San Bernardino </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 666, 678, fn. 7 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 657]; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Centex Real Estate Corp. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 26, fn. 6 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 518]; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 931, 934, fn. 1 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 315]; <em>Boothby </em>v. <em>Atlas Mechanical, Inc. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1595, 1598 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 600].) The justification offered for the exception is that it would be \u201c \u2018wasteful of trial court time\u2019 to require the plaintiff to undergo a probably unsuccessful court trial merely to obtain an appealable judgment.\u201d <em>(Building Industry, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">Tudor argues the <em>Building Industry </em>exception authorizes its appeal in this case. In response, SCIF first suggests the exception is no longer viable after <em>Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143]. Second, SCIF argues the exception does not apply here because the rulings Tudor seeks to have reviewed were not adverse final determinations. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">1. <em>Viability of Building Industry Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-11\">In <em>Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th 725, <em>(Morehart) </em>the Supreme Court, disapproving a line of Court of Appeal authority, held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>that, under the \u201cone final judgment\u201d rule, \u201c. . . an appeal cannot be taken from a judgment that fails to complete the disposition of all the causes of action between the parties even if the causes of action disposed of by the judgment have been ordered to be tried separately, or may be characterized as \u2018separate and independent\u2019 from those remaining.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 743.) As SCIF notes, the Court of Appeal in <em>Four Point Entertainment, Inc. </em>v. <em>New World Entertainment, Ltd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 79 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 82] <em>(Four Point), </em>read <em>Morehart </em>as \u201cimplicitly overruling\u201d <em>Building Industry's </em>conclusion that an appeal from a consent judgment following adverse determination of a critical issue is proper. <em>(Four Point, supra, </em>at p. 83, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">The statement of the court in <em>Four Point, </em>however, should be considered in light of the context in which the appealability issue was raised in that case. In <em>Four Point, </em>the trial court summarily adjudicated some, but not all, of the plaintiff\u2019s claims in favor of the defendant. The parties then stipulated to the entry of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d which recited their intent that the remaining claims be dismissed <em>without prejudice </em>to their later prosecution. The court concluded the judgment was nonappealable because it did not dispose of all claims between the parties as required by <em>Morehart. (Four Point, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 83; see also <em>Don Jose\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 115 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 370]; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 240 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 679]; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>City of Clovis </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 434 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 638].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">We agree with the <em>Four Point </em>court that, notwithstanding <em>Building Industry, Morehart </em>precludes a party from obtaining immediate review of an adverse ruling on some of its claims by dismissing the remaining claims <em>without prejudice. </em>However, it is not apparent to us that <em>Morehart </em>precludes a party from stipulating to an adverse judgment <em>with prejudice </em>on <em>all </em>of its claims, in order to appeal from that judgment. In such a case, there would be no claims left unresolved and, hence, no violation of <em>Morehart. </em>Indeed, one of the decisions on which the <em>Four Point </em>court relied stated, albeit in dictum, that a stipulation for a judgment dismissing all remaining causes of action with prejudice \u201cwould have solved the appealability problem.\u201d <em>(Don Jose\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 118, fn. 3.) We also note that at least two decisions after <em>Morehart </em>have applied the <em>Building Industry </em>exception to allow appeals from stipulated judgments which (apparently) did dispose of all of the claims between the parties. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Centex Real Estate Corp., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th 15, 26, fn. 6; <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 753, 755 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 358].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">In the absence of further guidance from the Supreme Court, we construe <em>Morehart </em>as abrogating the <em>Building Industry </em>exception only to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>that exception might be applied to permit an appeal from a stipulated judgment which does not dispose of all claims between the parties. We therefore must determine whether the judgment in this case did dispose of all of Tudor\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">The judgment as signed by the court stated the unadjudicated claims had been dismissed but did not specify whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. We recently concluded that a dismissal which failed to specify whether it was with or without prejudice should be deemed to be with prejudice absent a contrary contention by the plaintiff. <em>(Arciniega </em>v. <em>Bank of San Bernardino </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 213, 216, fn. 1 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 495].) Tudor makes no contention here that the dismissal was without prejudice. Rather, Tudor states in arguing the judgment is appeal-able: \u201cThe remaining five causes of action were completely dismissed. There is no provision that the dismissal was \u2018without prejudice.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Moreover, even a judgment that ordinarily would not be appealable will support an appeal where the appellant waives its right to litigate any unresolved cause of action. <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 288, 309 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 935 P.2d 781].) By taking the position that the stipulated judgment was a final, appealable disposition of all of its claims, Tudor unequivocally confirmed its consent to the dismissal of the unadjudicated claims with prejudice. Thus, the judgment, both on its face and in practical effect, constituted a final disposition of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">2. <em>Applicability of Building Industry to In Limine Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">SCIF points out that the <em>Building Industry </em>exception, as stated by the Supreme Court, contemplates an appeal from a consent judgment \u201cfollowing adverse determination of a critical issue.\u201d SCIF asserts the judgment in this case was not an <em>adverse </em>determination because the court specified that \u201c[a]ll of these [rulings] ... are without prejudice and subject to renewal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\"><em>In limine </em>rulings are by their nature tentative. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Tosco Corp. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 123, 141 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 747].) However, no decision of which we are aware has held that a stipulated final judgment was not appealable because it followed an <em>in limine </em>ruling. To the contrary, at least four decisions have permitted appeals under <em>Building Industry </em>from stipulated judgments following <em>in limine </em>rulings. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Centex Real Estate Corp., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 26, fn. 6 <em>[in limine </em>ruling excluding all evidence of oral and written communications leading to execution of settlement and releases appellants sought to challenge]; <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Foster, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 755 <em>[in limine </em>ruling precluding treating physicians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>from testifying as experts]; <em>Esbensen </em>v. <em>Userware Internat., Inc. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 631, 635 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 93] <em>[in limine </em>ruling excluding evidence of implied \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement for termination of employment]; <em>Dong </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1572, 1576-1577 [236 Cal.Rptr. 912] <em>[in limine </em>ruling excluding documentary evidence].) None of these decisions states or implies a requirement that an <em>in limine </em>ruling not be subject to further consideration before the parties may stipulate to an appeal-able final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">We recognize that, without some limitation on the <em>Building Industry </em>exception, a party theoretically could obtain immediate appellate review of any <em>in limine </em>ruling, no matter how inconsequential, provided both parties were willing to stipulate to a judgment finally disposing of all claims. It might be argued that an appeal under <em>Building Industry </em>should be allowed only where the ruling at issue truly makes it impossible as a practical matter for the plaintiff to proceed with the case. However, we are unaware of any authority imposing such a requirement, and to do so would require the reviewing court to make an assessment of the feasibility of the plaintiff\u2019s case without the benefit of a trial record. Without guidance from precedent, we conclude that, if the <em>Building Industry </em>exception is to be thus limited, the limitation should come from the Supreme Court. Since the judgment in this case met the criteria for finality as stated by the court in <em>Morehart, </em>we will consider the appeal on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">B. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">The parties disagree sharply as to the appropriate standard of review. Because of the importance of that issue to our determination of Tudor\u2019s claims of error, we discuss it in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">The trial court is \u201cvested with broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 503, 519 [241 Cal.Rptr. 916].) \u201c[T]he court\u2019s ruling will be upset only if there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 520.) \u201c \u2018The appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. When two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 272 [279 Cal.Rptr. 576, 807 P.2d 418].) Moreover, even where evidence is improperly excluded, the error is not reversible unless \u201c \u2018it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>would have been reached absent the error. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Vorse </em>v. <em>Sarasy </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 998, 1013 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 164]; accord, <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Bornstein </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1818, 1830 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Tudor acknowledges these general principles but argues different standards should apply here. Tudor first cites <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704] for the proposition that, where the trial court \u201cis mistaken about the scope of its discretion,\u201d the error is one of law. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1297-1298.) Tudor notes that, at one point during the hearing on the <em>in limine </em>motions, the lower court stated: \u201cWhat you\u2019re required to show and what\u2019s permissible by the evidence and relevant in this trial may be two different things. And just because you\u2019re required to show it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to allow you to put it on.\u201d According to Tudor, the court\u2019s suggestion that it could exclude \u201cevidence that a party is required by law to establish\u201d shows it used an erroneous legal standard which is subject to de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">We read the court\u2019s comment differently than Tudor does. In our view, the court merely observed that, even though the law might require Tudor to prove a given matter, Tudor still had to do so with admissible evidence. In other words, Tudor could not establish admissibility merely by showing the evidence might be helpful in proving its case. Nothing in this unremarkable observation, nor anything else in the record, indicates the court misunderstood the extent of its discretion. We therefore reject Tudor\u2019s argument for de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">Tudor also contends the lower court\u2019s rulings, if erroneous, are reversible per se. Tudor cites <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>New West Federal Savings </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 803] <em>(Kelly), </em>in which the court held that, where the effect of the trial court\u2019s abuse of its discretion in granting <em>in limine </em>motions \u201cwas to prevent plaintiffs from offering evidence to establish their case,\u201d the error was reversible per se. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 677.) In <em>Kelly, </em>however, the trial court completely foreclosed the plaintiffs from pursuing the only factual theory of liability supported by the evidence. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 667-668, 675.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">In contrast, none of the challenged rulings in this case foreclosed Tudor\u2019s essential theory of liability. The great majority of the rulings simply precluded certain arguments or discrete items of evidence (e.g., Motions No. 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). The remaining rulings merely precluded Tudor\u2019s claims- expert from testifying to industry standards <em>unless </em>the materials on which he had relied were produced (Motion No. 2), and excluded evidence of SCIF\u2019s reserving standards with respect to other insureds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>(Motion No. 5). Tudor\u2019s essential theory of liability was that SCIF had mishandled claims <em>against Tudor. </em>The court did nothing to interfere with Tudor\u2019s ability to pursue that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">Moreover, <em>Kelly's </em>application \u00f3f a standard of reversibility per se was based on its observation that, in many cases, a court cannot intelligently rule on admissibility at the <em>in limine </em>stage because the record is not sufficiently developed to determine relevance, probative value, and potential for prejudice. (49 Cal.App.4th at p. 671.) In such cases, it cannot reasonably be determined on appeal what the outcome would have been absent the erroneous ruling, and reversal should be automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In <em>Kelly, </em>however, the court, not the plaintiffs, was responsible for the undeveloped evidentiary record, because, after the court excluded the bulk of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, it granted a nonsuit based on the remaining evidence. (49 Cal.App.4th at p. 669.) Here, the lower court not only did not grant a nonsuit, it expressly invited Tudor to present its evidence to the jury and to request reconsideration at that time of any <em>in limine </em>rulings with which it was dissatisfied. Instead, Tudor made a tactical decision to force immediate review by <em>stipulating </em>to an adverse judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">By appealing, Tudor assumed \u201cthe burden of showing reversible error by an adequate record.\u201d <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Uribe </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 564, 574 [224 Cal.Rptr. 664, 715 P.2d 624].) One aspect of that burden requires that the appellant develop the fullest possible evidentiary record <em>before </em>seeking review. Thus, an appellant must make an offer of proof in the trial court in order to claim on appeal that evidence was wrongly excluded. <em>(Castaneda </em>v. <em>Bornstein, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th 1818, 1827.) Similarly, if an appellant wishes to argue a point on appeal, it must first make a record by raising the point in the trial court. <em>(North Coast Business Park </em>v. <em>Nielsen Construction Co. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 28-29 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 104]; <em>In re Marriage of Moschetta </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1227 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">If Tudor believed, as it now argues, that the record when the court ruled was not sufficiently developed to permit meaningful consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>the issues, it had at least two alternatives. First, it could have requested a hearing, pursuant to Evidence Code section 402, at which it could have presented foundational evidence to establish the admissibility of the evidence SCIF sought to exclude. Second, it could have proceeded to trial, presented the appropriate foundational evidence there, and asked the court to reconsider its exclusionary rulings in light of the more complete record. It did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">An analogous situation exists where a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend and the plaintiff elects to appeal immediately rather than amend. In that case, the reviewing court will \u201cpresume the plaintiff has stated as strong a case as he can\u201d and \u201cresolve all ambiguities and uncertainties raised by the demurrer against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Setliff v. E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1533 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 763]; accord, <em>Casella </em>v. <em>City of Morgan Hill </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 43, 48 [280 Cal.Rptr. 876].)  Similarly, where a plaintiff elects to stipulate to an adverse judgment after evidence is excluded at a preliminary stage, it should be presumed the plaintiff made the strongest foundational showing it was prepared to make, and any uncertainty in the record should be resolved in favor of the court\u2019s ruling. It would be ironic indeed to hold that a plaintiff, after deliberately forcing review on an incomplete record, may invoke a standard of reversibility per se on the basis that the record was not sufficiently developed when the court made its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">2.-12.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">The judgment in favor of SCIF on Tudor\u2019s first, fifth, eighth and ninth causes of action, and dismissing Tudor\u2019s remaining causes of action with prejudice, is affirmed. Costs to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">Ramirez, P. J., and Hollenhorst, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1188-12\">Apparently, Tudor amended its complaint in late 1994 or early 1995 to add a claim for spoliation of evidence, but the record does not contain a copy of the amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">Reserves are estimates of the amounts required to pay claims for which the insurer may be liable. <em>(Lipton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1613 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 341].) In the workers\u2019 compensation context, reserve levels directly affect the insured\u2019s premiums and dividends. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1614, fn. 16.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">At oral argument, Tudor asserted that, even if the court was willing to reconsider its rulings during the evidence phase, it effectively prevented Tudor from presenting its case by precluding reference to the disputed evidence in its opening statement. We do not deny the importance of a party\u2019s opening statement in its trial presentation. But it is neither uncommon nor unreasonable for a court to exclude evidence from an opening statement where its ultimate admissibility is uncertain. As we have said, the excluded evidence was not so vital to Tudor\u2019s case as to preclude it from proceeding on its essential theory of liability, and there is no reason to believe the court would have granted a nonsuit had Tudor presented its opening statement without the evidence. Had the court done so, of course, Tudor could have appealed <em>that </em>ruling and would have been entitled to de novo review and the benefit of every legitimate factual inference. (See <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1802, 1809 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 59].) But we will not apply that standard of review to discretionary <em>in limine </em>rulings which, at most, may have unduly restricted Tudor\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1196-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1422.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
