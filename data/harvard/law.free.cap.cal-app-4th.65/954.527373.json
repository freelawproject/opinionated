Code, \u00a7 23110), assaulted four people, drove a vehicle unlawfully, and possessed a stolen car. Joseph complains (1) the trial court\u2019s order in the rock-throwing case was tainted by the admission of a statement he made without benefit of Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings\u2014which he insists were required because the police had \u201cfocused suspicion\u201d on him\u2014 and (2) the evidence in the car theft case failed to demonstrate he knew the car he was driving was stolen. Neither claim has merit, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">At Joseph\u2019s jurisdictional hearing, the prosecutor was permitted to elicit a statement Joseph made to a police officer admitting he threw a rock at a passing bus. Joseph objected to admission of the statement, insisting, as he does here, it was inadmissible in the prosecutor\u2019s case-in-chief because the officer neglected to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before commencing his interrogation. The trial judge concluded <em>Miranda </em>was inapplicable because Joseph was not subject to custodial restraint when the questions were asked. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Early one evening, Joseph and Michael H. picked some rocks up off the ground and decided to use the passenger windows of a passing public bus for sport. Another youngster saw the two boys throw the rocks and then run into Michael\u2019s home. The witness told Santa Ana Police Officer James Tavenner one of the boys was wearing a plaid shirt, and then he pointed the officer to the house they entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">As Tavenner approached the residence, he spied both boys through a window\u2014one wearing a plaid shirt\u2014and recognized Michael as a probationer he had contacted before. When Michael\u2019s mother met him at the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>door, Tavenner advised her of his suspicions and asked to speak with the boys, who then came out onto the porch. Tavenner received their consent to pat them down for weapons, then told them they did not have to talk to him, but he wanted to ask a few questions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Michael refused to cooperate, he turned his attention to Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">According to Joseph, the officer informed him a witness had seen him throw a rock at a bus, but Joseph told the officer he had no idea what he was talking about. Tavenner then placed Joseph in handcuffs and told him to have a seat in the back of his patrol car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The officer left him sitting in the car for about five minutes. When Tavenner returned, he took Joseph out of the car, removed the handcuffs, and began asking questions about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Early on in the conversation, he suggested it was \u201ca pretty stupid thing\u201d to throw rocks at a bus, and Joseph conceded, \u201cYeah, it was a pretty dumb thing for us to do.\u201d The prosecutor used that admission against Joseph at his jurisdictional hearing, over Joseph\u2019s objection. Joseph now contends the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous, but we find the statement was properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">While the questions posed by Officer Tavenner were not preceded by any of the warnings or waivers required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, they were only put to Joseph <em>after </em>he was released from the police car and the handcuffs were removed. Moreover, the restraints were applied only briefly\u2014for five minutes\u2014before questioning began. Never, during his contact with the officer, was Joseph told he was under arrest or that he would be placed under arrest unless he cooperated with the officer\u2019s investigation. On the contrary, he was told he was under no obligation to answer any of the officer\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Even at the point Joseph was cuffed and placed in the back seat of the patrol car, the record reveals no evidence to indicate he was ever told he was going to be taken to the station house or, for that matter, taken anywhere at all. Rather, because the time during which Joseph was restrained was extremely short, it seems likely he was handcuffed and placed in the police car merely so the officer could maintain control of the minor while he carried on another portion of his investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 143, 146 [92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612] [a detention for the purpose of maintaining the status quo may be reasonable depending on the circumstances]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Purry </em>(D.C. Cir. 1976) 545 F.2d 217, 220 [178 App.D.C. 139] [handcuffing a reasonable procedure to maintain status quo while further investigation performed].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Joseph recognizes that <em>Miranda </em>only applies to <em>custodial </em>interrogation. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at pp. 444-445 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1612]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1310 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259].) However, he insists <em>Miranda </em>warnings should have preceded the officer\u2019s questions since, at the time they were asked, he <em>was </em>in custody\u2014because Officer Tavenner had focused suspicion on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">To support his argument, Joseph cites <em>In re Pablo C. </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 984 [181 Cal.Rptr. 468]. The <em>Pablo C. </em>court reversed an order declaring a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not read to him when he was detained on a bridge for questioning after a motorist reported someone had been dropping pieces of concrete on passing cars. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 987.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">According to <em>Pablo C.,\u201c. . </em>.a <em>Miranda </em>warning must be given as soon as probable cause to arrest has been established [citation] or as soon as the suspect is physically deprived of his action in any significant way or reasonably believes so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 438, 448 [58 Cal.Rptr. 115, 426 P.2d 515]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Herdan </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 300, 306-310 [116 Cal.Rptr. 641].) Factors which may be considered to determine whether custody has attached include \u2018(1) the site of the interrogation; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>whether the investigation has focused on the subject; (3) whether the objective indicia of arrest are present; and (4) the length and form of questioning.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Herdan, supra, </em>at p. 307, fns. omitted.)\u201d <em>(In re Pablo C., supra, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at pp. 988-989.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Were <em>Pablo C. </em>the law, Joseph would have himself more of a case. But, as a consequence of Proposition 8, the test set out in <em>Pablo C. </em>has not been controlling law in California for more than 15 years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stansbury </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 824, 830, fn. 1 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 394, 889 P.2d 588]; <em>People </em>v. <em>May </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 309, 318 [243 Cal.Rptr. 369, 748 P.2d 307]; <em>In re Lance </em>W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More than two decades ago, the United States Supreme Court made it clear that custody, as that term is used in connection with <em>Miranda, </em>does not occur simply because an officer focuses suspicion on the suspect and is not at all dependent on the situs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>interrogation. <em>(Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 492, 495 [97 S.Ct. 711, 714, 50 L.Ed.2d 714].) When the defendant argued the <em>Herdan </em>rule in <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1121 [103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275]), the United States Supreme Court unceremoniously rejected it and explained that \u201ca suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection\u201d only if \u201cthere is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1125 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">When the California Supreme Court relied upon the <em>Herdan </em>factors yet again in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stansbury </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1017, 1050 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 174, 846 P.2d 756],<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court reversed its judgment in a unanimous per curiam opinion, emphasizing that an officer\u2019s focus of suspicion is \u201cnot relevant\u201d to determining whether a suspect is in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. (Stansbury </em>v. <em>California </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 318, 326 [114 S.Ct. 1526, 1530, 128 L.Ed.2d 293, 301].) The court\u2019s message could hardly have been put with greater lucidity: \u201cOur decisions make clear that . . . custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 323 [114 S.Ct. at p. 1529, 128 L.Ed.2d at p. 298].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201c[A]n officer\u2019s views concerning the nature of an interrogation, or beliefs concerning the potential culpability of the individual being questioned, may be one among many factors that bear upon the assessment whether that individual was in custody, but only if the officer\u2019s views or beliefs were somehow manifested to the individual under interrogation and would have affected how a reasonable person in that position would perceive his or her freedom to leave.\u201d <em>(Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p. 325 [114 S.Ct. at p. 1530, 128 L.Ed.2d at p. 300].) \u201cEven a clear statement from an officer that the person under interrogation is a prime suspect is not, in itself, dispositive of the custody issue . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">As the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 217 [223 Cal.Rptr. 638] explained in a similar context, \u201cFor <em>Miranda </em>purposes, we think the crucial consideration is the degree of coercive restraint to which a reasonable [person] believes he is subject <em>at the time of questioning. </em>Police officers may sufficiently attenuate an initial display of force, used to effect an investigative stop, so that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>questions are asked. Thus, for example, a police officer may well act reasonably in drawing his gun while he approaches a [person] in an uncertain situation. However, . . . the officer may also reholster it. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harley </em>(2d Cir. 1982) 682 F.2d 398, 400.) Assuming the [person] is subject to no other restraints, the officer\u2019s initial display of his reholstered weapon does not require him to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking the [person] questions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at p. 230, italics in original; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 629, 679.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Here, when Officer Tavenner began questioning Joseph, Joseph had been released from the temporary restraints he experienced while the officer tended to another aspect of his investigation. By the minor\u2019s own admission, he was never told he was going to be arrested, but he <em>was </em>told he need not answer the officer\u2019s questions. The entire encounter lasted only about 15 or 20 minutes. After the interrogation was completed, the officers left the scene alone. Joseph was, in fact, not arrested for another six weeks. Under these circumstances, we conclude the trial court was correct in determining the warnings and waivers required by <em>Miranda </em>did not apply. Therefore, the trial court did not err by admitting Joseph\u2019s statement acknowledging his involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ABL\">Sills, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-11\"><em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\">While Joseph insists in his opening brief that Tavenner never told him he was free to disregard his questions, he recognizes the officer testified that he did, in fact, impart that information elsewhere in his brief. The trial court accepted the officer\u2019s testimony in this regard, and we are obliged to accept the court\u2019s finding. \u201cAlthough we must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, nonetheless it is the exclusive province of the trial judge ... to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The officer could not recall ever having Joseph cuffed or in the police car, but the trial court specifically found the minor credible when he testified to these facts. On the other hand, contrary to the implication raised by our concurring and dissenting colleague, the court did <em>not </em>express belief in the minor\u2019s other assertions, including the minor\u2019s speculation that he was handcuffed and placed in the police car because the officer was mad at him. There is, thus, <em>no support </em>in the record for our colleague\u2019s assertion that Officer Tavenner decided to \u201cturn up the heat\u201d on Joseph by engaging in \u201chardball tactics\u201d to coerce a confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The officer knew Michael from a prior contact and, since he was at Michael\u2019s house, he knew where Michael could be reached. But he \u201cknew not Joseph.\u201d Therefore, he had cause to detain him, pending questioning, while he tended to other details of his investigation, to make sure the 14-year-old did not do something stupid like fleeing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">This is not to say that the minor would not have been in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>had he been questioned while he was still in the car and under the officer\u2019s control. In that case, the interrogation would have been accompanied by restraints that are normally associated with an arrest, thereby requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings be administered. <em>(Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 420, 440 [104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 732 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 679 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], a majority of the United States Supreme Court found a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel when the police questioned an uncharged suspect who had become the focus of their suspicions without warning him of his right to remain silent. Soon after <em>Escobedo </em>was filed, however, the court realized dissenting Justice Stewart was right (378 U.S. at pp. 493-495 [84 S.Ct. at pp. 1766-1767] (dis. opn. of Stewart, J.)). Its analysis was leading it down a blind alley, since the Sixth Amendment\u2014by its own terms\u2014only applies when there is an \u201caccused\u201d in a \u201ccriminal prosecution.\u201d By 1966, the court jettisoned its focus of suspicion test and Escobedo\u2019s Sixth Amendment analysis, limited <em>Escobedo </em>to its facts <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 719, 734-735 [86 S.Ct. 1772, 1781, 16 L.Ed.2d 882]) and, in its place, the court created <em>Miranda. </em>Ever since that day, the court has been working to undo the repercussions of its <em>Escobedo </em>miscue. The court has not only limited <em>Escobedo </em>to its facts, it has found it necessary to expressly and repeatedly disavow its analysis. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gouveia </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 180, 188-189 [104 S.Ct. 2292, 2298, 81 L.Ed.2d 146]; <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 341, 345 [96 S.Ct. 1612, 1615, 48 L.Ed.2d 1]; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 682, 688-690 [92 S.Ct. 1877, 1881-1882, 32 L.Ed.2d 411].) Still, the tentacles of the case have penetrated deep into the sinew of California law, and its vestiges have been difficult to excise. Witness the four-factor formulation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Herdan </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 300 [116 Cal.Rptr. 641], which looks in part to whether an officer has focused suspicion on the suspect to determine whether custody has occurred and the police have a duty to advise a suspect of his or her rights. The formulation finds its roots in <em>Escobedo, </em>which is no longer the law. Unfortunately, California cases continued, uncritically, to repeat it for years after its foundation was jettisoned by the court that invented it in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\"><em>Pablo C. </em>was published in March 1982, nearly three months before the passage of Proposition 8.

Joseph, age 14, was visiting Michael H., age 13, when uniformed Police Officer James Tavenner and his partner arrived to investigate a recent rock-throwing incident. After speaking with Michael\u2019s mother, Tavenner had the minors come out on the porch, telling them he had received information they were involved in a crime. He searched the boys but told them they did not have to answer questions. Michael declined to talk, but Joseph was willing to speak with the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">On the sidewalk in front of Michael\u2019s house, Tavenner told Joseph that witnesses had seen him throwing rocks at a bus. As Joseph put it, Tavenner \u201cjust kept saying, trying to say that it was me [because] there is a witness[.]\u201d When Joseph denied the allegation, Tavenner \u201cgot mad,\u201d handcuffed Joseph and placed him in the back of his police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Five minutes passed before Tavenner told Joseph to get out of the car. At that point, Tavenner removed Joseph\u2019s cuffs, but he did not tell him he was free to leave. Instead, Tavenner resumed his interrogation until Joseph finally confessed to throwing the rocks. Tavenner never <em>Mirandized </em>Joseph during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, the United States Supreme Court established procedural safeguards to protect a suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights during custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These safeguards, commonly known as <em>Miranda </em>warnings, were created to offset the inherently coercive effects of police questioning \u201cafter a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his [or her] freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 444 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1612], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">In deciding whether a person was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, we must examine all of the circumstances, including the scene of the interview, the age and experience of the person questioned, the length and manner of questioning, and, to the extent it is conveyed, to the person under questioning, the officer\u2019s subjective belief the person is a suspect. (See <em>Stansbury </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number><em>California </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 318 [114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rorex </em>(8th Cir. 1984) 737 F.2d 753, 755-756; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 197 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(1997) 130 Idaho 811 [948 P.2d 166].) After considering these criteria, we must then determine whether there was \u201c \u2018 \u201ca formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u201d of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p. 322 [114 S.Ct. at p. 1529].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">There can be little doubt Joseph was subjected to the functional equivalent of a formal arrest. Although the encounter transpired at his friend\u2019s house, Joseph was isolated by Tavenner and interrogated on the sidewalk, near two police vehicles. For several minutes, Tavenner asked Joseph pointed questions about the rock-throwing incident, telling Joseph witnesses had implicated him and directly accusing him of the crime. Such intense questioning likely communicated to Joseph he was not free to leave. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bellomo </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 195, 199 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 782].) But even if that was insufficient to trigger <em>Miranda, </em>surely, as the majority shyly concedes in a footnote (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 958, fn. 5), Joseph was in custody when Tavenner slapped on the cuffs and whisked him into the police car. Indeed, such intimidating treatment would be considered coercive for the average adult, let alone a 14-year-old. (See generally, 1 LaFave, Criminal Procedure (1984) Interrogations and Confessions, \u00a7 6.6(f), p. 498 [courts are likely to find custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes if the suspect is handcuffed or put into a police vehicle].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Nonetheless, the majority finds no <em>Miranda </em>violation because Joseph did not confess until <em>after </em>he was released from the police car and his handcuffs were removed. The majority views Tavenner\u2019s hardball tactics in cuffing and detaining Joseph as merely attempts to \u201cmaintain control of the minor while he carried on another portion of his investigation.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 958.) This assumption, however, finds no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">What the record does indicate is Tavenner became increasingly irritated with Joseph\u2019s denials and decided to turn up the heat by giving Joseph a taste of physical custody. After letting Joseph ponder his predicament for several minutes, Tavenner unshackled the minor and unabashedly resumed his interrogation. By this time, some 30 minutes into the encounter by the minor\u2019s estimate, Joseph had enough and went along with Tavenner\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Under these circumstances, I fail to see how Joseph\u2019s status was miraculously changed from \u201ccustodial\u201d to \u201cnoncustodial\u201d when Tavenner removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>his handcuffs and released him from the police car. In fact, courts have been skeptical any such transformation can so readily occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guarino </em>(D.Conn. 1986) 629 F.Supp. 320, the defendant was handcuffed for about 12 minutes while FBI agents raided his home as part of a narcotics investigation. After removing the cuffs, the agents stayed in the house, ultimately asking defendant what was inside a black bag. Defendant replied the bag contained cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Although defendant\u2019s handcuffs were removed 20 minutes before he made the incriminating statement, the court found the statement was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights: \u201cClearly, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s situation, handcuffed with his hands behind his back and surrounded by armed agents, would have understood he was \u2018in custody.\u2019 <em>The restraint on defendant\u2019s freedom of movement or his otherwise custodial situation, however, did not end when his handcuffs were later removed.\u201d (United States </em>v. <em>Guarino, supra, </em>629 F.Supp. at p. 324, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Likewise here, Joseph\u2019s custodial situation did not end when his handcuffs were removed, because Tavenner continued to press him until he made an incriminating statement. In other words, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>was violated because the People failed to carry their burden of showing that the considerable force used initially to detain [Joseph] was attenuated . . . before he was questioned.\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 217, 230 [223 Cal.Rptr. 638].) Therefore, I would reverse the judgment with respect to the counts arising out of the rock-throwing incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Petitions for a rehearing were denied August 27, 1998, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
