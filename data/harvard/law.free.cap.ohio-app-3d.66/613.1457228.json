(\u201cBrookpark News\u201d) is appealing the decision of the trial court finding city of Cleveland Ordinances 343.01 and 343.11, which regulate the location of adult businesses, constitutional against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>first and fourteenth amendment challenges. Because appellee, city of Cleveland, failed to show that the effect of the ordinances did not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication, we reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">On December 2, 1983, Brookpark News received a use permit for the retail sales of news and books at 16700 Brookpark. On December 28, 1983, an application was made by Brookpark News to change the use to an adult bookstore and an adult mini-motion picture theater. The request was denied on the basis that the operation was within one thousand feet of an existing adult bookstore and a mini-motion picture theater both located at 16500 Brookpark. Those operations were housed in separate buildings on that lot. The proposed use was located within two hundred eighty feet of the existing bookstore and three hundred feet from the mini-motion picture theater. An appeal was filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals which was denied. That decision was affirmed by the trial court and Brookpark News appealed contending the court erred (1) in denying the appeal where the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals (the \u201cboard\u201d) was contrary to law; (2) in denying the appeal where the decision of the board was unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable; (3) in denying the appeal where the board\u2019s decision was unsupported by the evidence; and (4) in not conducting a trial de novo of appellants\u2019 request for a variance and permit because appellants raised constitutional issues in their appeal from the board\u2019s decision. This court overruled Brookpark News\u2019 first and third contentions, and remanded the case for a hearing on the constitutional issues. <em>Brookpark News &amp; Books, Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(June 2, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50651, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">At the hearing which began on September 20, 1988, in addition to exhibits introduced into evidence, Dennis Hadick, a builder in the construction business, testified there were only 3.6 acres out of 48,384 acres within the city of Cleveland where an adult bookstore could be located. His conclusions were based on the city\u2019s then most current zoning maps, 1987, but said his testimony would be virtually the same using 1983 criteria. Cleveland Detective Margaret Alick of the Vice Squad testified for the city that \u201cadult\u201d operations were scattered throughout Cleveland. On Brookpark Road there were four adult bookstores and movie theaters and a couple of topless bars. She testified prostitution, soliciting and other related crimes were prevalent around \u201cadult\u201d operations and were aggravated upon congestion of the \u201cadult\u201d operations. Street prostitution was occurring now on Brookpark Road. Alick also testified that traffic around \u201cadult\u201d operations occurred at all hours because the establishments were open twenty-four hours per day seven days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Following the hearing the parties filed post-trial briefs. On January 4, 1989, the court issued its opinion declaring Sections 343.01 and 343.11 of Cleveland\u2019s Zoning Code constitutional. Brookpark News timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Appellant\u2019s first, second, third and fifth assigned errors, which challenge the constitutionality of the city\u2019s adult activities ordinances, will be addressed collectively. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in not finding that Sections 343.01 and 343.11 of the Code of the city of Cleveland abridge freedom of speech and of the press and deny equal protection in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The trial court erred in not finding that the adult use zoning ordinance is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201c3. The trial court erred in failing to find that the adult use ordinances unconstitutionally regulate and restrict competition in the marketplace and are thus improperly enacted zoning ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\"><em>\u201c5. </em>The trial court erred by applying incorrect legal standards to assess the validity of the adult use zoning ordinance by presuming it constitutional, when in fact, no presumption of validity attaches, and by imposing the burden of proving the ordinance unconstitutional upon appellant when the burden rests upon the city to justify the ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The two ordinances under attack, Sections 343.01<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 343.11,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> govern the local and general retail business districts, respectively. Adult book stores in local retail business districts are prohibited from locating within one thousand feet from another adult book store or any church, hospital, school, library, playground or other institutional occupancy use and, absent a waiver, any residential district. The same restrictions apply to adult book stores and adult mini-motion picture theaters in general retail business districts. In addition, no adult book store or adult mini-motion picture theater may locate within one thousand feet of any other adult book store, adult motion picture theater, adult mini-motion picture theater, adult entertainment cabaret, pool or billiard halls, or premises where pinball machines are used substantially. Appellant contends these restrictions are vague, amount to prior restraints, control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>competition, were not demonstrated to serve a substantial governmental interest and were not narrowly drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">A city may regulate the location of adult businesses within a comprehensive zoning scheme as long as the regulations are designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not limit unreasonably alternative avenues of communication. <em>Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29; see <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc. </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310. The substantial governmental interest involved here is the preservation of the quality of urban life. At the time the original adult usage regulation was enacted in 1975, the preamble provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cWhereas, the presence, establishment and concentration of \u2018Adult' movie theatres and adult \u2018Book\u2019 Stores, as defined herein, in various areas throughout the City of Cleveland has certain adverse effects in the neighborhoods in which such businesses are situated which tend to contribute to the blighting and downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods, of causing said surrounding neighborhoods to give the appearance of decline, both economically and residentially; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201cWhereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property and safety * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Although no evidence, if available, was presented at the 1988 hearing concerning the original enactment, it is apparent that adverse secondary effects may and do occur around these adult businesses. See, <em>e.g., Renton, supra. </em>Testimony at the hearing in the trial court concerning prostitution and related crimes and testimony at appellant\u2019s change of use hearing before the board concerning the appearance of the area on Brookpark Road confirms these problems exist. The United States Supreme Court reaffirmed its recognition of a substantial governmental interest in a city\u2019s attempt to preserve the quality of urban life, <em>Renton, supra, </em>475 U.S. at 50, 106 S.Ct. at 930, 89 L.Ed.2d at 39, and stated that \u201c[c]ities may regulate adult theaters by dispersing them, as in Detroit, or by effectively concentrating them, as in Renton.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 106 S.Ct. at 931, 89 L.Ed.2d at 41. Thus, it is no longer open to debate whether a substantial governmental interest exists in the regulation of the location of adult businesses to prevent urban blight. See, <em>e.g., Alexander v. Minneapolis </em>(D.Minn.1989), 713 F.Supp. 1296, 1301-1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In order to pass constitutional muster, Cleveland Ordinances 343.01 and 343.11 must also be narrowly tailored to meet the city\u2019s objectives leaving open adequate channels of communication. Although appellee has not prohibited the operation of adult establishments within its boundaries, but has set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>one-thousand-foot limitations analogous to the one-thousand-foot restrictions upheld in <em>Renton </em>and <em>Young, </em>the effect of these restrictions, according to Brookpark News\u2019 evidence, is to limit the availability of adult bookstores to three areas constituting 3.6 acres, which is only seven one-hundred-thousandths of one percent (.00007) of the 48,384 acres comprising the city of Cleveland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s evidence was unrebutted. This percentage of available adult usage in a city the size of Cleveland on its face is unduly restrictive and significantly curtails freedom of expression and access to protected speech. In <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>where the court upheld one-thousand-foot restrictions between any two regulated uses, in a note to the plurality opinion, Justice Stevens stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201cThe situation would be quite different if the ordinance had the effect of suppressing, or greatly restricting access to, lawful speech. Here, however, the District Court specifically found that \u2018[t]he Ordinances do not affect the operation of existing establishments but only the location of new ones. There are myriad locations in the City of Detroit which must be over 1000 feet from existing regulated establishments. This burden on First Amendment rights is slight.\u2019 <em>[Nortown Theatre Inc. v. </em>Gribbs] 373 F.Supp. [363], at 370 [ (E.D.Mich.1974) ].\u201d <em>Young, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 71, 96 S.Ct. at 2453, 49 L.Ed.2d at 327, fn. 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The fact that a new adult operation has to compete with existing adult operations for space to locate within Cleveland does not render the city\u2019s ordinances unconstitutional. See <em>Renton, supra, </em>475 U.S. at 53-56, 106 S.Ct. at 931-934, 89 L.Ed.2d at 41-44. It is the fact that only 3.6 acres out of nearly fifty thousand acres are available for adult expression which renders the ordinances unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While this court is hesitant to enter the realm of calculating what amount of zoned adult usage is actually necessary to meet constitutional standards for fear of becoming a supreme zoning board of municipalities, appellee has presented no authority where restrictions having the effect of those herein have been upheld, and we decline to do so on the record before us. Accordingly, Brookpark News\u2019 First Amendment constitutional challenge is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Appellant\u2019s remaining assigned error is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201c4. The trial court erred in not finding that appellant was entitled to prevail on non-constitutional arguments arising out of its vagueness challenges to the adult use zoning laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The substance of this assignment of error was raised and addressed previously by this court, see <em>Brookpark News &amp; Books, Inc. v. City of Cleveland </em>(May 22, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50651, unreported, 1986 WL 5952, or could have been. The only issues remanded to the trial court for resolution were the constitutional questions and those are the only issues we will address in this appeal. Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b651-7\">Dyke, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b651-8\">Patton, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Section 343.01, effective April 14, 1988, provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">\u201c343.01 Local Retail Business District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">\u201c(a) Definitions.
