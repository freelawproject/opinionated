The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. A bench trial was conducted and the defendant was found guilty as charged. She was sentenced as appears of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-17\">In her sole assignment of error, the defendant alleges the trial court erred in finding her guilty of disorderly conduct when the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-18\">The defendant was charged with a violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(2), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-19\">\u201cNo person shall recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another, by doing any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-20\"><em>(\u00cd </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201c(2) Making unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture, or display, or communicating unwarranted and grossly abusive language to any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In reviewing this part of the statute, the Ohio Supreme Court asserted in <em>State v. Hoffman </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 129, 11 O.O.3d 298, 387 N.E.2d 239, paragraph one of the syllabus, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u201cA person may not be punished under R.C. 2917.11(A)(2) for \u2018recklessly causpng] inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another,\u2019 by making an \u2018offensively coarse utterance\u2019 or \u2018communicating unwarranted and grossly abusive language to any person,\u2019 <em>unless </em>the words spoken are likely, by their very utterance, to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">After reviewing the record, we are persuaded that the evidence presented at trial failed to establish that the words uttered by the defendant were, in the words of <em>Hoffman, </em>likely \u201cto inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.\u201d Accordingly, the trial judge erred as a matter of law in holding that all the elements of the offense had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the defendant is discharged from further prosecution concerning the charge lodged against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-9\">Utz, P.J., Doan and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-21\">. The police officer alleged the defendant approached him and said, \"just because you\u2019ve got a f-badge you think you can f\u2014 with people\u201d and continued with \"f\u2014 you and your gun, money talks so I'll walk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
