After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of kidnapping and two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>rape. Defendant was found not guilty on the remaining two counts. On October 14, 1988, defendant was sentenced to a term of nine to twenty-five years on count one and a term of five to twenty-five years on each count of rape. The sentences for the rape counts are to run concurrently to each other, but consecutively to the sentence for kidnapping. This court granted defendant leave for a delayed appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The relevant facts follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">On April 8, 1988, at approximately midnight, Lolita Patrick, the victim, walked from her sister\u2019s apartment to use a pay phone a few blocks away. Patrick then went to the Blue Moon Lounge to look for her mother and another friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">As she arrived at the bar, four men, including defendant, were being ejected from the bar for fighting. Upon not finding her mother or her friend in the bar, Patrick began walking back to her sister\u2019s apartment. As she was walking, Patrick was approached by a vehicle containing the four men who had been ejected from the bar. The men inside the vehicle were shouting rude and suggestive insults at Patrick. Defendant then jumped out of the automobile and grabbed Patrick, forcing her into the automobile. She was driven to the apartment of Daniel Ridgeway, approximately fifteen to twenty minutes away, which she was forced to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Inside the apartment, defendant struck Patrick and removed her clothing. She was forced to perform oral sex on defendant. When she resisted, by biting defendant on the penis, defendant held a knife to her throat. She was forced to have intercourse with defendant and other members of the group. Finally, Patrick was able to escape when she was left alone in a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">After realizing Patrick had escaped, defendant went to the apartment building\u2019s security office, where he reported the apartment had been burglarized. While he was in the security office, Patrick also arrived at the security office and indicated she had been raped and identified defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">At the close of evidence, defendant was found guilty of two counts of rape and one count of kidnapping. Before sentencing, a plea bargain was reached which would allow the court to combine the case <em>sub judice </em>with case No. 57948, in which defendant had been indicted on twelve counts of rape and robbery. The plea would have allowed defendant to serve sentences in both cases concurrently. However, defendant maintained his innocence in case No. 57948, claiming he was pleading guilty only to avoid doing time. The court was unwilling to accept the plea and sentenced defendant on case No. 226,888 alone. The state then dismissed case No. 57948.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred by refusing to admit evidence that the victim had gonorrhea at the time of the rape thus violating R.C. Sec. 2907.02(D) and appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Defendant contends the court erred by refusing to admit evidence that Patrick had gonorrhea at the time of the rape. Defendant argues he also could have presented evidence that he did not have gonorrhea, but that David Ridgeway did. This, defendant argues, would tend to prove defendant did not rape the victim. Defendant also contends he would have introduced medical evidence establishing the probability of contracting gonorrhea from intercourse. Defendant\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">R.C. 2907.02(D) provides ini pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cEvidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual activity, opinion evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, <em>or disease, </em>or the victim\u2019s past sexual activity with the offender, and <em>only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">This court has previously held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201cThe purpose of R.C. 2907.02(D), the so-called rape shield law, is to prevent introduction of evidence intended to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Gardner </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 14 [13 O.O.3d 8, 391 N.E.2d 337]. As such, a trial court must exercise its discretion in balancing the two factors. <em>Davis v. Alaska </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 308 [94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347]; <em>State v. Gardner, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201cIn <em>Gardner, </em>the supreme court expressly rejected the \u2018supposed relevancy\u2019 that the victim\u2019s prior unchastity indicates the likelihood of her having given consent. In fact, the court indicated that evidence of past sexual conduct has no bearing at all on either her credibility or the issue of consent. <em>State v. Gardner, supra </em>[59 Ohio St.2d], at 18 [13 O.O.3d at 10, 391 N.E.2d at 341].\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(Oct. 2, 1980), Cuyahoga App. No. 41773, unreported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>defendant claims the absence of gonorrhea in him indicates he did not rape the victim. However, the Court of Appeals for Summit County has previously examined this claim and found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">\u201cWe have examined the article appended to [defendant\u2019s] petition and do not find that the facts contained therein support [defendant\u2019s] theory. The article states that, on the basis of a single study, the researcher estimates that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>male engaging in a single act of sexual intercourse with a gonorrhea infected female has a 20 to 25% chance of becoming similarly infected during the single contact. Conversely, the same estimated statistics indicate that a male having a single sexual contact with an infected female has a 75 to 80% chance of remaining disease free. The article also states that the percentage of infection can be greatly reduced by taking adequate precautionary measures following intercourse. Thus, we question the probative value of the proffered evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Logan </em>(Nov. 9, 1983), Summit App. No. 11203, unreported, 1983 WL 3912.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Therefore, since testimony concerning the existence of a venereal disease is highly inflammatory and of low probative value, the court did not err in refusing to allow the existence of gonorrhea into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Additionally, R.C. 2907.02(E) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u201cPrior to taking testimony or receiving evidence of any sexual activity of the victim or the defendant in a proceeding under this section, the court shall resolve the admissibility of the proposed evidence in a hearing in chambers, which shall be held at or before preliminary hearing and <em>not less than three days before trial, </em>or for good cause shown during the trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Defendant did not raise the issue until the middle of trial at a sidebar conference. Defendant did not attempt to address why he was raising the issue in an untimely fashion. Therefore, the court was under no obligation to admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred by convicting appellant of rape and kidnapping in violation of R.C. Sec. 2941.25.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">Defendant contends the counts of kidnapping and rape were committed with a single animus and defendant may not be convicted of both crimes. Defendant argues the kidnapping was merely incidental to the rape. Defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">\u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court has set forth the standard for determining whether kidnapping and another offense are subject to separate convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">\u201c \u2018In establishing whether kidnapping and another offense of the same or similar kind are committed with a separate animus as to each pursuant to R.C. 2941.25(B), this court adopts the following guidelines:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201c \u2018(a) Where the restraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a separate underlying crime, there exists no separate animus sufficient to sustain separate convictions; however, where the restraint is prolonged, the confinement is secretive, or the movement is substantial so as to demonstrate a significance independent of the other offense, there exists a separate animus as to each offense sufficient to support separate convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201c \u2018(b) Where the asportation or restraint of the victim subjects the victim to a substantial increase in risk of harm separate and apart from that involved in the underlying crime, there exists a separate animus as to each offense sufficient to support separate convictions.\u2019 <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, at the syllabus.\u201d <em>State v. Henry </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 3, 9, 523 N.E.2d 877, 883-884.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cThe issue, therefore, as discussed in <em>Logan </em>in the context of animus, rather than separate commission, is whether \u2018the movement is substantial so as to demonstrate a significant independence of the other offense.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cIn this regard, a distinction must be made as to whether the kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) is committed by removing the victim from the place where he is found or is committed by restraining him of his liberty. The former is committed separately if the asportation is of a significant distance prior to the arrival at the place of the intended rape; whereas, the latter has relevance only if the restraint of liberty is for a significant period of time prior to the commission of the intended rape.\u201d <em>State v. Moore </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 226, 228, 13 OBR 278, 279, 468 N.E.2d 920, 922.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Patrick was forcibly taken against her will while she was walking on a sidewalk and forced into an automobile. The vehicle was driven across town to an apartment fifteen or twenty minutes away. She was then forced into the apartment. It was not until then that the rapes occurred. Finally, she was still not let go, but rather left in a bedroom of the apartment where subsequently she engineered her escape. The kidnapping began long before the rape and continued after the rape had concluded. The trial court correctly found a separate animus for each crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in not complying with the negotiated plea agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Defendant contends the court erred by refusing to accept a plea bargain negotiated between defendant and the prosecutor. Defendant argues the court abused its discretion by refusing to accept the plea despite the fact defendant maintained his innocence. Defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u201cPlea bargaining is a recognized fact of life in today\u2019s criminal justice system. It is accepted and approved as a method of disposing of criminal cases. <em>State v. Griffey </em>(1972), 29 Ohio App.2d 246, 250 [58 O.O.2d 450, 452, 281 N.E.2d 32, 35], reversed on other grounds [ (1973) ] 35 Ohio St.2d 101 [64 O.O.2d 62, 298 N.E.2d 603]. The A.B.A. Standards, Pleas of Guilty, Section[s] 3.1 and 3.3 (approved draft, 1968) declare that a prosecuting attorney may engage in plea negotiations \u2018where it appears that the interest of the public in the fair administration of criminal justice would be served.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u201cWe recognize the need and thereby approve of the prosecution entering into meaningful and good faith plea negotiations with defense counsel. Our query is, however, who shall be the final arbiter of what is in the best \u2018interest of the public in the fair administration of criminal justice,\u2019 the prosecutor or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201cWe agree with the defendant that <em>the prosecution\u2019s recommendations ought not to be summarily rejected and that the trial judge ought to exercise a sound discretion before refusing to accept or departing from such recommendations. Nevertheless, we believe the final judgment on whether a plea bargain shall be accepted must rest with the trial judge. </em>We recognize that such judgment may be exercised erroneously and the defendant has cited authority to that effect. See, <em>United States v. Ammidown </em>(C.A.D.C.1974), 497 F.2d 615; <em>United States v. Hastings </em>(E.D.Ark.1977), 447 F.Supp. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\"><em>\u201cWhen a recommended plea bargain is rejected, the court ought to state reasons for his rejection. </em>In some cases, however, the facts themselves speak so eloquently that no statement by the judge is required.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Akron v. Ragsdale </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 107, 109, 15 O.O.3d 107, 108, 399 N.E.2d 119, 120-121. See, also, <em>State v. Menucci </em>(1986), 33 Ohio Misc.2d 15, 20, 514 N.E.2d 758, 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Crim.R. 11(C) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">\u201c(2) In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept such plea without first addressing the defendant personally * * *[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Ridgeway, do you have anything to say on your behalf before I proceed to sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cDEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor. I didn\u2019t plead. I pled guilty to avoid time. I\u2019m innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry. Mr. Stanley, I\u2019m thinking I had already read \u2014 I have not taken the plea, but your client just told me he\u2019s pleading guilty because of the time, not that he is guilty, excuse me, he\u2019s pleading guilty but he\u2019s innocent. I don\u2019t want to hear that. He\u2019s either going to plead guilty or he\u2019s not. You better discuss this with your client before I take this plea. I don\u2019t take that kind of a plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cMR. STANLEY: Well, Judge, I\u2019ll talk to him about it. It\u2019s been our position all along he was innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not going to accept the plea. Either he\u2019s going to plead or not going to plea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The court was not required to accept the plea. The judge clearly explained his reasons for not accepting the plea. The court did not want to allow defendant to later appeal the plea as involuntary. Defendant stated he was making the plea to avoid doing time. It was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion not to accept the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Defendant had already been found guilty. Since defendant would not plead his guilt in the other case, the court properly sentenced defendant in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In addition, the state subsequently dismissed case No. 57948, making error, if any, harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-12\">Dyke, P.J., and Francis E.
