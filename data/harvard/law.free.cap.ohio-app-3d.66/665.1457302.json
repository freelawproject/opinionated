Appellants assign the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it determined that the return of the appellee from his Mental Health Administrator 5 position in the unclassified service to the Administrative Assistant 3 position in the classified service was a removal for which the appellants were required to demonstrate just cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APu\">Appellee assigns the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by not reinstating Terry Veney to the Mental Health Administrator 5 position retroactive to January 23, 1990.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY\">Appellee began his employment with the state as an Administrative Assistant 3, a classified civil service position, on July 31, 1978. On June 30, 1980, appellee accepted a promotion in an unclassified civil service position within the classification of Mental Health Administrator 3. In 1986, appellee accepted another promotion in an unclassified civil service position within the classification of Mental Health Administrator 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of this last promotion, appellee signed a document entitled \u201cEmployees Agreement to be Appointed to the Unclassified Service,\u201d which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201cBeing fully advised that an unclassified employee serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority and that the provisions of Section 124.34 of the Revised Code are not applicable to an unclassified employee, I hereby voluntarily agree to be appointed to the position of Men. Health Adm. 4 which I am fully advised is an unclassified position per Division (A)(13) or (A)(14) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Section 124.11 of the Revised Code. I further understand that any continuing service in this position is subject to the requirements of Division (C) of Section 5119.071 of the Revised Code and Rule 5122-7-11 of the Administrative Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Also at this time, appellee signed a document entitled \u201cStatement of Options \u2014 Unclassified Employees,\u201d that contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cAs an unclassified employee, you serve at the pleasure of your appointing authority. Your appointment to the unclassified service may therefore be revoked at any time without a showing of cause as to why this action is being taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In July 1988, the Department of Mental Health began a reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">On November 13, 1989, appellee was advised by the appointing authority of appellant Massillon Psychiatric Center, Frank Fleisher, Chief Executive Officer of that institution, that his unclassified position as a Mental Health Administrator 5 may possibly be \u201crevoked.\u201d At that time, appellant Fleisher gave appellee a copy of a document entitled \u201cStatement of Options \u2014 Unclassified Employees,\u201d which included options for appellee to request a written statement of reasons for the revocation, and an opportunity to request an informal meeting to discuss the matter. Appellee exercised these options.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">On December 11, 1989, appellant Fleisher gave appellee a memorandum entitled \u201cStatement of Reasons\u201d for the revocation of appellee\u2019s position as Mental Health Administrator 5 at the Massillon Psychiatric Center. The memorandum set forth the reason for appellee\u2019s revocation as economy, efficiency, and span of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">On December 20, 1989, an informal meeting between appellee, appellee\u2019s attorney, appellant Fleisher, and Personnel Director of appellant Massillon Psychiatric Center, was held in accordance with the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Rule 5122-7-ll(F). On December 26, 1989, appellant Fleisher revoked appellee\u2019s appointment, and effective January 22, 1990, appellee\u2019s unclassified status was changed to the classified status within the classification of Administrative Assistant 3, the original classified position appellant held.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Appellee timely appealed appellant Fleisher\u2019s decision to the State Personnel Board of Review, which appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because appellee was in the unclassified service.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Appellee filed a timely appeal to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, where the court determined that appellee had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of removal for cause, and that appellants failed to follow the mandatory procedures under R.C. 124.34. The court ordered that appellee be reinstated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>to the unclassified civil service position within the classification of Mental Health Administrator 5, effective January 1, 1991, and that appellee be paid benefits and salary for that position effective that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Through their sole assignment, appellants claim the <em>revocation </em>of appellee\u2019s appointment to the unclassified state civil service was not a <em>removal </em>of appellee and the appointing officer may <em>revoke </em>appellee\u2019s appointment for no reason or for any non-discriminatory reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Accordingly, the issue before us is whether appellee\u2019s unclassified civil service position was revoked by appellant Fleisher or whether appellee was removed for cause from that position by appellant Fleisher. Appellants assert that they properly followed the administrative scheme prescribed by Rule 5122-7-ll(F) in revoking appellee\u2019s unclassified civil service position, whereas appellee contends that appellants should have instead followed the administrative scheme prescribed by Rule 5122-7-ll(G). As noted above, the trial court found in favor of appellee\u2019s contention, and for the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and find in favor of appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Rule 5122-7-11 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\u201c(A) The purpose of this rule shall be to establish procedures governing placement of employees in the unclassified service, revocation of an unclassified employee\u2019s appointment, and removal or suspension of unclassified employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">\u201c(C) The following definitions shall apply to this rule in addition to or in place of those appearing in Rule 5119-1-01 of the Administrative Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-13\">\u201c(7) \u2018Removal\u2019 means a dismissal from duty for reasons specified in Section 124.34 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-14\">\u201c(8) \u2018Revocation of appointment\u2019 means the withdrawal of an employee\u2019s appointment to the unclassified service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-15\"><em>(( </em>&gt;Jc # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-16\">\u201c(F) The following procedure shall apply when the appointing authority determines that revocation of an unclassified employee\u2019s appointment may be necessary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-17\">\u201c(1) The appointing authority shall meet with the employee to inform him that revocation of his unclassified appointment is being considered. The employee shall be given a statement of options (see \u2018appendix FFF\u2019) and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>copy, noting the employee\u2019s receipt of same, shall be retained by the appointing authority. At this time the employee shall be requested to resign his unclassified appointment to eliminate the need for further consideration of a revocation action. If the employee is entitled to and the appointing authority does not wish to retain him in a backup position, the employee may also be requested to waive his backup position in the classified service. If the employee is willing to voluntarily resign his unclassified appointment and waive his right to a backup position, his resignation should state this fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201c(G) When in the opinion of the appointing authority an employee appointed to an unclassified position from the classified service would be removed for cause sufficient to remove a classified employee under Section 124.34 of the Revised Code then the appointing authority shall follow the procedures used to remove a classified employee. Employees appointed directly to the unclassified service without first having served in the classified service need not be removed for cause. Their services may be terminated at any time by using the procedures in paragraph (F) of this rule which does not constitute a removal under Section 124.34 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">From the above, it is clear that \u201cremoval\u201d contemplates a complete termination of all employment, while \u201crevocation of appointment\u201d contemplates that the unclassified employee reserves the right to return to his original position in the classified service that he held prior to accepting the unclassified appointment. Revocation of appointment does not sever total employment, but merely reverts the unclassified employee to his prior status. Finally, \u201cremoval,\u201d as opposed to \u201crevocation of appointment,\u201d involves the complete termination of an unclassified employee for cause which is sufficient to terminate a classified employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The facts in this case conclusively demonstrate appellant Fleisher revoked appellee\u2019s appointment and returned him to his original classified service, rather than completely terminating or removing appellee\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Therefore, appellants did comply with the provisions of Rule 5122-7-11 in revoking appellee\u2019s appointment, and, it follows appellants were not required to provide appellee a hearing pursuant to R.C. 124.34 because appellee was not removed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding appellee was removed for cause and that appellant failed to follow the mandatory procedures under R.C. 124.34. The trial court thereby erred in reinstating appellee to the position of Mental Health Administrator 5, in the unclassified civil service, and ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>appellee be paid back benefits and salary for the position. Therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and order that appellee be returned to his classified civil service position as an Administrative Assistant 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">For the reasons previously stated, the sole assignment of error raised in appellee\u2019s cross-appeal is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment entered in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-9\">Putman, P.J., and Milligan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-11\">. Appellee\u2019s unclassified civil service position within the classification of Mental Health Administrator 4, was subsequently changed to the classification of Mental Health Administrator 5, which change had no effect as to appellee's salary and job description.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
