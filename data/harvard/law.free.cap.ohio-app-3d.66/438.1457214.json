When the three men were leaving after the game they met three teenage girls and decided to give the girls a ride home in Granger\u2019s car. The girls were all freshmen at Independence High School who had attended the basketball game. Before taking the girls home, the group stopped at a drive-through and bought beer. While in the car, everyone smoked marijuana and drank, after which Granger took two of the girls home. According to the testimony of Cox and Granger at trial, the third girl, Nichole Jones (\u201cNichole\u201d), did not want to go home because she did not want her parents to see her drunk. Granger testified at trial that he then stopped at defendant\u2019s house so that defendant could go in and get some money. After defendant came back, they stopped by a bar, but did not go in. Granger said that Cox and defendant then grabbed Nichole and threw her into the back seat. Granger drove off with defendant and Nichole in the back seat. Granger testified that, as he was driving, he looked in the back seat and saw that defendant \u201chad both his hands around her neck, and he beat her head against the rear door four times. I was looking at that.\u201d Granger then pulled off into a construction site beside the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Cox did not testify that they had stopped at a bar. He testified that \u201call three of us grabbed Nichole,\u201d apparently while still parked near defendant\u2019s house. After arriving at the construction site, defendant grabbed Nichole and \u201ctied something around her mouth\u201d and pushed her head against the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Granger testified that he and Cox got out of the car at the construction site and that he saw defendant having sex with Nichole in the back seat. Defendant then got out of the back seat and Cox got in. In contrast, Cox testified that he and Granger were sitting in the front seats of the car while defendant was with Nichole. The three men then got out of the car, and Cox got in the back seat. Cox said he saw that Nichole was not moving, so he did not have sex with her. Granger then had sex with Nichole, but only after defendant threatened to \u201cbeat him up\u201d if he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Granger later pulled Nichole, who was not moving, out of the car and left her in an alley, where a passerby discovered Nichole\u2019s dead body the next day. At trial, a pathologist from the Franklin County Coroner\u2019s office testified that Nichole had died of strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Defendant, Cox, and Granger were later charged with aggravated murder. Granger was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and kidnapping before defendant\u2019s trial, and Cox pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, attempted rape, and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The grand jury indicted defendant on one count of aggravated murder and one count of rape. On May 10, 1989, a jury found defendant guilty of rape and guilty of involuntary manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder. On appeal, defendant assigns the following four errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">\u201c1. Appellant\u2019s conviction for rape was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the victim was dead at the time of the alleged rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">\u201c2. The trial court\u2019s allowance of testimony by a police officer of an out of court identification by Appellant\u2019s mother and girlfriend of photographs of a red coat that allegedly belonged to Appellant which was found underneath the murder victim and which police said was the key evidence which linked Appellant to the murder victim together with admission of photographs of the red coat which had the signature of Appellant\u2019s mother and girlfriend on the back violated the rule against hearsay, had a substantial impact upon Appellant\u2019s cause, and warranted reversal for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">\u201c3. The trial court erred in refusing to give Appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction that Appellant cannot be found guilty of attempted rape if he did not engage in sexual conduct with the body of the murder victim until after her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u201c4. The trial court erred in allowing a police officer to state his opinion about the amount or type of evidence there was against Appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that his conviction for rape was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the crime of rape requires that the victim be alive when sexual conduct occurs. The state makes two arguments in response: (1) sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find that the victim was alive at the time of the sexual conduct; and (2) even if the victim was not alive, the jury could have convicted defendant of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The state first contends that evidence in the transcript shows that the victim was alive at the time of the alleged rape. However, the state does not cite anything substantial from the transcript to buttress its contention; instead, the state asserts that the jury could discount Cox\u2019s and Granger\u2019s testimony and infer that Nichole was alive when the incident occurred from the lack of any other evidence to indicate that she was already dead. Granger testified that defendant attacked Nichole before the car reached the construction site, after which Nichole \u201cdid not move again.\u201d He also testified that, after defendant and Cox had each been alone with Nichole in the back seat, \u201cI was more than sure that at this point Nichole was dead * * *. So I got in the car with Nichole, and I checked her pulse to see if I was right or if I was \u2014 if possibly I could have been wrong. When I checked her pulse, she didn\u2019t show any vital signs.\u201d Granger later testified that he had had some emergency medical training. Cox\u2019s testimony somewhat contradicted Granger\u2019s in that he did not say defendant attacked Nichole on the way to the construction site. However, he did testify that, after the car had stopped, defendant pushed Nichole\u2019s head against an inside window of the car. He also testified that Nichole had stopped moving before anyone had sex with her. In addition, he said that he and defendant talked while Granger was in the back seat and concluded that Nichole was dead \u201cbecause she wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d The only other testimony at trial on this issue was that of the pathologist from the Franklin County Coroner\u2019s office, who testified that he could not determine the victim\u2019s \u201chour of death.\u201d Due to the lack of evidence presented by the state, we conclude that if we were to assume that the state must prove, as an element of the offense of rape, that the victim is alive at the time of the sexual conduct, then the manifest weight of the evidence showed that, in this instance, the state did not meet its burden of proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In regard to the state\u2019s second argument, apparently no reported Ohio cases have addressed the issue of whether the crime of rape requires a living victim. The state cites <em>State v. Booker </em>(Feb. 19, 1986), Hamilton App. No. C-850376, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>unreported, 1986 WL 2209, in which the court found that the crime of aggravated robbery does not require a living victim. However, we find <em>Booker </em>inapposite, not only because the case involved a different crime, but because the <em>Booker </em>court\u2019s opinion does not make clear the basis for its determination. Defendant cites <em>State v. Limle </em>(Aug. 30, 1983), Franklin App. No. 83AP-50, unreported, 1983 WL 3663. However, <em>Limle </em>merely indicates that the defendant in that case contended the trial court should not have convicted him of attempted rape because the victim was dead when the incident occurred. The <em>Limle </em>court, though, did not reach that issue, since \u201c[sufficient evidence was presented by the prosecution to support the conclusion\u201d that the victim was alive. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Defendant cites cases from other jurisdictions that do support his position. See <em>Commonwealth v. Sudler </em>(1981), 496 Pa. 295, 303, 436 A.2d 1376, 1379-1380 (prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that victim was alive); <em>People v. Stanworth </em>(1974), 11 Cal.3d 588, 604, 114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 262, 522 P.2d 1058, 1070, fn. 15. Other cases from outside Ohio support the state\u2019s position. See <em>State v. Brobeck </em>(Tenn.1988), 751 S.W.2d 828, 832; <em>Lipham v. State </em>(1988), 257 Ga. 808, 809-810, 364 S.E.2d 840, 842-843, certiorari denied (1988), 488 U.S. 873, 109 S.Ct. 191, 102 L.Ed.2d 160. Cf. <em>State v. Usry </em>(1987), 205 Conn. 298, 317-318, 533 A.2d 212, 221-222 (sexual assault in the first degree).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Apart from the case law, defendant\u2019s argument relies primarily upon the Committee Comment to R.C. 2927.01 (abuse of a corpse). In contrast to rape, which is an aggravated felony of the first degree, R.C. 2907.02(B), abuse of a corpse, is a misdemeanor of the second degree. R.C. 2927.01(C). The comment to R.C. 2927.01 states that the legislature intended the statute to cover \u201cconduct formerly prohibited by specific prohibitions against grave robbing and unlawful dissection of a corpse. It also includes other kinds of conduct, such as <em>copulating with or otherwise mistreating a corpse.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Defendant argues that the inclusion of sexual abuse of a corpse under R.C. 2927.01 demonstrates that the legislature considered the sexual abuse of a dead body, no matter how bizarre or offensive, to be a lesser crime than \u201cindignities to the living.\u201d <em>Sudler, supra, </em>496 Pa. at 303, 436 A.2d at 1379. See, also, <em>Stanworth, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at 605, 114 Cal.Rptr. at 262, 522 P.2d at 1070, fn. 15 (\u201csection 263 states that \u2018[t]he essential guilt of rape consists in the outrage to the person and feelings of the female * * * * * It is manifest that the \u2018feelings\u2019 of a female cannot be offended nor does the victim suffer \u2018outrage\u2019 where she is dead when sexual penetration has occurred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>We find defendant\u2019s argument unpersuasive. As a starting point, we note that the rape statute does not explicitly require a living victim. R.C. 2907.-02(A)(2) merely states, \u201c[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d More important, we conclude that the existence of the abuse of corpse statute does not indicate that the legislature intended conduct like defendant\u2019s and his companions\u2019 to fall outside the scope of the rape statute. Even though the victim died during the incident in the present case, defendant\u2019s conduct, when viewed in its entirety, involved \u201cindignities to the living,\u201d unlike the conduct that R.C. 2927.01 contemplates. In the present case, defendant \u201cengage[d] in sexual conduct\u201d with the victim only after he had \u201cpurposely compelled]\u201d the still living victim \u201cto submit by force.\u201d R.C. 2907.02. The fact that the force was sufficient to kill the victim does not lessen the seriousness of defendant\u2019s actions. We therefore substantially agree with the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Lipham, supra, </em>that \u201c[t]he facts here differ fundamentally from a case in which one happens upon the corpse of a female and engaged in sexual intercourse with it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>257 Ga. at 810, 364 S.E.2d at 842. See, also, <em>Brobeck, supra, </em>751 S.W.2d at 832 (\u201cwe are likewise unable to embrace the notion that the fortuitous circumstance, for the rapist, that death may have preceded penetration by an instant, negates commission of the crime of aggravated rape and reduces it to a relatively minor offense associated with erotic attraction to dead bodies\u201d). Cf. <em>Usry, supra, </em>205 Conn, at 317-318, 533 A.2d at 222 (\u201csexual assault in the fourth degree occurs when an assailant commits a sexual assault on a dead body, but the assailant is not involved in causing the victim\u2019s death. When, however, the assailant kills the victim in order to commit a sexual assault, he has committed sexual assault in the first degree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We conclude that, although defendant may raise the possibility that his actual crime was abuse of a corpse, the fact that the victim may have been dead when the sexual conduct occurred does not, in itself, lessen defendant\u2019s culpability herein, nor does the state have to prove in this case, as an element of the offense of rape, that the victim was alive when sexual conduct occurred. In the present case, we find that the manifest weight of the evidence supported defendant\u2019s conviction for rape. We therefore overrule defendant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We next address defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, in which defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on attempted rape were erroneous. The court, in its instructions, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cBefore you may find the defendant guilty of rape, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged victim was alive at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>sexual conduct occurred. However, if you find that the state has failed to prove that the alleged victim was alive at the time of the sexual conduct by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, you will continue your deliberations and consider the lesser of \u2014 the lesser offense of attempted rape, which I will next define for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Defendant argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that a defendant cannot be convicted of attempted rape if the victim was dead at the time of the sexual conduct. We need not decide, though, whether the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous, since \u201ca conviction should be affirmed unless an incorrect instruction prejudiced the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(May 12, 1988), Franklin App. No. 87AP-300, unreported, 1988 WL 48024 (citing <em>Porello v. State </em>[1929], 121 Ohio St. 280, 289-290, 168 N.E. 135, 138). The error was nonprejudicial in the present case because the jury did not convict defendant of attempted rape. Moreover, the instruction on attempted rape did not taint the rape instruction, since, as the previously quoted passage from the instruction indicates, the trial court clearly told the jury to apply a standard to the rape charge that differed from the standard relevant to an attempted rape charge. Accordingly, we overrule defendant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting hearsay testimony regarding a red jacket and by admitting photographs of the jacket that involved a hearsay identification. The police had found the red jacket under Nichole\u2019s body. Detective Richard Sheasby testified at trial that defendant\u2019s mother and girlfriend identified the jacket as defendant\u2019s after looking at photographs of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The state argues that the evidence of the out-of-court identifications did not fall within the definition of \u201chearsay\u201d in Evid.R. 801(C). Evid.R. 801(C) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Here, the state contends that the prosecution did not introduce the evidence \u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Specifically, the state contends that it introduced Sheasby\u2019s testimony to refute the implication that the prosecution had initially dropped aggravated murder charges against Cox and Granger as part of an arrangement for their testimony. Since the identification of the jacket was the only evidence against Cox, Granger, or defendant, the identification, the state argues, provided an objective, plausible reason for holding defendant and releasing the other two. In other words, the state introduced the testimony to show how the statements affected the prosecution\u2019s behavior, not whether the identifications would ultimately prove to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The state\u2019s argument is well taken. Since the state apparently did not introduce the statements to prove the truth of the matter asserted, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled defendant\u2019s hearsay objection. See <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus (the admission of relevant evidence is within a trial court\u2019s discretion). Moreover, even if we assume that the statements also had some hearsay effect, defendant waived any error by not requesting a limiting instruction. Evid.R. 105 Staff Note, citing <em>Agler v. Schine Theatrical Co. </em>(1938), 59 Ohio App. 68, 12 O.O. 371, 17 N.E.2d 118. Furthermore, any error was not prejudicial, since identity was largely undisputed at trial. Defendant had admitted in a statement to the police that he had been with Cox and Granger when they had picked up Nichole. We therefore overrule defendant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In his fourth assignment of error, defendant argues that Sheasby\u2019s testimony regarding the jacket was an improper statement of Sheasby\u2019s opinion of the amount or type of evidence against defendant. At trial, defendant objected to the following testimony of Sheasby:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cQ. What happened to the charges that you had filed concerning Lee Granger and Anthony Collins \u2014 Anthony Cox? Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>They were dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cQ. And what happened with Lee Granger and Anthony Cox?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cA. They were released from the Franklin County jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">\u201cQ. What was the reason that those charges were dismissed, the charges that you had filed were dismissed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">\u201cA. At that time and point in the investigation, it was determined that there was not enough physical evidence at that point to continue with the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">\u201cQ. How about the charges concerning Lewis Collins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He was still charged and being held in the Franklin County jail. They were not dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">\u201cQ. You indicated that there was not enough physical evidence at that point in time concerning Lee Granger and Anthony Cox.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">\u201cWas there additional physical evidence, something different between those cases, Anthony Cox and Lee Granger and Floyd Collins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">\u201cMr. Boda: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-17\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-18\">\u201cA. The jacket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In support of his argument, defendant cites Evid.R. 701, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkY\">\u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArF\">However, we conclude that the trial court could have found that Sheasby\u2019s testimony fell within the range of acceptable lay opinion testimony under Evid.R. 701. The opinion seems to have been rationally based on the witness\u2019s perception and helpful in determining the prosecution\u2019s motive in dropping the charges against Cox and Granger, as we have previously noted in our discussion of the second assignment of error. In addition, as we have also previously mentioned, the identification testimony did not prejudice defendant; the state, in closing argument at trial, conceded in regard to the jacket that \u201cthis was pretty thin evidence against Mr. Collins.\u201d In short, we find that the trial court did not prejudicially err when it permitted Sheasby\u2019s testimony. We overrule defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">Strausbaugh, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b478-8\">Keefe, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b478-9\">John W. Keefe, J., retired, of the First Appellate District, was assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b478-10\">Keefe, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AxV\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">I am in agreement with Judge Bryant\u2019s conclusions, but I prefer to predicate the affirmance of the rape conviction upon the fact that from the criminal scenario which occurred it was reasonable for the jury to infer and to find that Nichole Jones was alive when the defendant-appellant raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">The majority opinion suggests that conviction of defendant for the crime of rape could have been had even if Jones were dead at the time. I have a problem with this. A conviction of rape requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim is compelled to submit to sexual conduct. To be compelled to do some act connotes actions or activity by a perpetrator firmly against the will of the victim. I have difficulty with the idea of a dead person having capability to will, decide, submit, or intend anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Whether an unconscious person can be the victim of a rape seems to raise a question not directly before us in this appeal and thus I am not treating that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A striking disparity exists in this state between penalties for the crime of rape, <em>viz., </em>R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), and for abuse of a corpse, R.C. 2927.01. Rape is an aggravated felony of the first degree while abuse of a corpse can be either a misdemeanor of the second degree or a felony of the fourth degree. The wrongdoing is a misdemeanor when \u201creasonable family sensibilities\u201d only are outraged; the crime is a felony when \u201creasonable community sensibilities\u201d are outraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Given the facts of this incident, it was a mistake not to have provided the jury with a conviction alternative between rape and abuse of a corpse. Probably the indictment should have included counts for both rape and abuse of a corpse. However, I note supererogatorily that the crime of abuse of corpse <em>might </em>be a lesser-included offense of rape in a proper case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As hereinabove stated, I find that the jury did have sufficient evidence to find that the victim was alive at the time of the sexual conduct, and that it is my basis for electing to affirm the rape conviction. Insofar as other portions of Judge Bryant\u2019s opinion are concerned, I have no disagreement. I elect to affirm the convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
