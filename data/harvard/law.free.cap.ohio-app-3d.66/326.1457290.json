Cooley, was injured on March 15,1986, apparently in the course of her employment with appellant, Lawson Milk Company (now, Dairy Mart Corporation). While appellee\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund was granted, a number of issues relating to her claim were not addressed in the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">On November 9, 1988, the Industrial Commission of Ohio issued an opinion in which appellee\u2019s average weekly wage was set at $310.38 per week. At the time of this opinion, appellee\u2019s claim was held in abeyance pending the resolution of psychiatric testing and the presentation of evidence concerning appellee\u2019s thoracic strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Appellant appealed the November 9, 1988 ruling of the Industrial Commission to the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519. This statute reads, in pertinent part, \u201c[t]he claimant or the employer may appeal a decision of the industrial commission or its staff * * * <em>other than a decision as to the extent of disability, </em>to the court of common pleas * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal, claiming that the appeal pertained to a decision as to the extent of disability. This issue was briefed by both parties, and then the motion was granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Appellant now timely raises this appeal and asserts the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss defendant-appellant\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error, containing two subparts, argues that a final order of the Industrial Commission, which does not involve the right to participate, is appealable to the common pleas court as long as it does not involve the issue of the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability. Appellant further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>contends that an order of the Industrial Commission setting the average weekly wage does not involve the issue of the extent of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The essence of appellant\u2019s argument lies in the delineation of a new trend of thought which appellant perceives as existing in recent Ohio Supreme Court cases on the subject of R.C. 4128.519 appeals to the trial court. The fact that appellant and appellee, construing essentially the same case law, should reach such diametrically opposite conclusions as to what the state of the law is, does not cause consternation in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u201cDespite its apparently straightforward language, R.C. 4123.519 has been the source of considerable discussion by * * * [the Ohio Supreme Court] as well as by trial and appellate courts. \u2018Clear though the * * * language [in R.C. 4123.519] may have seemed to the drafters thereof, the myriad complications of industrial injury, and legislative and administrative efforts to justly cope therewith, have resulted in diffuse efforts by litigants and courts to resolve ensuing conflicts and uncertainties. * * * <em>Cook v. Mayfield </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 200, 202, 543 N.E.2d 787, 790, quoting <em>State, ex rel. Campbell, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 154, 155, 57 O.O.2d 397, 397-398, 277 N.E.2d 219, 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The starting point for both appellant\u2019s and appellee\u2019s analysis of R.C. 4123.519 is <em>Zavatsky v. Stringer </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 386, 10 O.O.3d 503, 384 N.E.2d 693. <em>Zavatsky, supra, </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cThe decision of the Industrial Commission as to \u2018extent of disability\u2019 constitutes a determination of the basis for the computation of the compensation or benefits payable under the provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law * * <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cA determination of \u2018extent of disability\u2019 under R.C. 4123.519 presupposes that claimant has been allowed the \u2018right to participate\u2019 in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund * * <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Similarly, four years later, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201cOnce a claimant\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for an injury * * * has been determined, any further determination of the Industrial Commission pertaining to the computation of compensation payable under the workers\u2019 compensation law * * * is as to \u2018extent of disability,\u2019 and is not appealable pursuant to R.C. 4123.519.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State, ex rel. Bosch, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 94, 1 OBR 130, 438 N.E.2d 415, at the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Appellant acknowledges the continued validity of these holdings, yet urges that the Ohio Supreme Court has moved away from an absolutist position. As support for this position, appellant directs this court\u2019s attention to a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>of recent Ohio Supreme Court cases. In <em>State, ex rel. O.M. Scott &amp; Sons Co., v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 341, 28 OBR 406, 503 N.E.2d 1032, the court held that an order dictating that a self-insurer, rather than the state fund, pay the benefits to the claimant was appealable despite not involving the right to participate in the fund. \u201cA decision in an injury * * * case which does not involve the right to participate is nevertheless appealable as long as it does not involve the extent of disability.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>at 344, 28 OBR at 409, 503 N.E.2d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The rationale expressed in <em>Scott </em>was reaffirmed in <em>Seabloom Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 108, 519 N.E.2d 358. In <em>Seabloom, supra, </em>the court held that a question of whether employer\u2019s counsel received notice of a workers\u2019 compensation hearing, and could consequently vacate the order which derived from the hearing, pursuant to R.C. 4123.522, was not one which went to the extent of the claimant\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The Ohio Supreme Court has further allowed for the commencement of R.C. 4123.519 appeals in scenarios in which the issue was which party would be responsible for reimbursing self-insured employers who have paid claims stemming from injuries suffered by handicapped persons in their employ at the time of the accident. Under Ohio law, R.C. 4123.343, such employers were to be reimbursed for any such payments, ostensibly as a method of encouraging the hiring of handicapped persons. When disputes arise as to which entity is to reimburse these funds to the employer, the conflicts are appealable under R.C. 4123.519, as they do not address issues of the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability. <em>State, ex rel. Wean United, Inc., v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 203, 524 N.E.2d 896; <em>State, ex rel. Y &amp; O Coal Co., v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 165, 532 N.E.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention, that <em>Scott </em>and its progeny have enlarged the scope of appeals which may be commenced under R.C. 4123.519, is correct. However, examination of appellant\u2019s authority does not persuade that the exceptions to <em>Zavatsky </em>and <em>Bosch, supra, </em>encompass the factual scenario in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">A close reading of <em>Scott </em>indicates that the case both recognizes and endorses the holding in <em>Zavatsky, </em>which indicated that \u201c * * * \u2018decisions] * * * as to \u201cextent of disability\u201d constitute a determination of the basis of the computation of the compensation or benefits payable * * * to the claimant. <em>Scott, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 343, 28 OBR at 408, 503 N.E.2d at 1034, quoting <em>Zavatsky </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Further, cases such as <em>Scott </em>et al., are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. <em>Scott, Wean United, </em>and <em>Y &amp; O Coal Co., supra, </em>are all cases in which the question is not \u201cto what extent is the claimant injured?\u201d but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201cwho will pay the claimant?\u201d As the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized, these cases in no way challenge the extent of the claimant\u2019s injury and, as such, are properly cognizable under R.C. 4123.519. Similarly, <em>Seabloom </em>concerns itself, not with an issue pertaining to the claimant\u2019s disability, but rather to a due-process question of whether the employer\u2019s attorney received notice of a hearing. R.C. 4123.519 does not act as a bar to that type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Examination of recent Ohio Supreme Court cases which construe R.C. 4123.519 demonstrate the continued validity of the <em>Bosch </em>doctrine. In <em>Cook, supra, </em>the court examined a scenario in which a claimant was attempting to receive additional monies as a result of an intervening incident. The court stated that, if the claimant was merely requesting additional compensation, the commission\u2019s decision would be as to the extent of disability, and hence not appealable under R.C. 4123.519. If the claimant was requesting compensation for a new injury, a denial of benefits by the Industrial Commission would be appealable because it would involve the right to participate in the fund. <em>Cook, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 205-206, 543 N.E.2d at 792-793, citing <em>Bosch. </em>As <em>Cook </em>lucidly demonstrates, in cases relating to the amount of compensation a claimant receives for his/her injury, the rule enunciated in <em>Bosch </em>remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">This court also notes that there are strong underlying public policy rationales that support the <em>Zavatsky/Bosch </em>line of cases and the <em>Scott </em>exceptions. Under the workers\u2019 compensation system presently in place in Ohio, \u201c[t]he [industrial] commission has \u2018sole and final jurisdiction to determine extent of disability, and thus the * \u25a0* * amount of compensation to which a claimant is entitled to under the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cook </em>at 201, 543 N.E.2d at 789, citing <em>Rummel v. Flowers </em>(1972), 28 Ohio St.2d 230, 233, 57 O.O.2d 467, 469, 277 N.E.2d 422, 424. While there are legitimate countervailing public policy motives, such as encouraging the hiring of the handicapped or providing for fair resolution of the procedural issues, which account for the recently enunciated exceptions to the <em>Zavatsky/Bosch </em>doctrine, expansion of these exceptions to include this case could release a flood of litigation into the trial courts which might well result in an unintended onus on the judicial system, and would also undermine the purposes for which the workers\u2019 compensation system was created. Further, acceptance of appellant\u2019s arguments would be tantamount to issuing an invitation to employers and employees alike to use the judicial system to stall decisions rendered by the Industrial Commission until a more favorable outcome could be achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">This court is cognizant, as <em>Cook </em>states, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\u201cThe only right to appeal a decision of the Industrial Commission is that which is granted by statute. \u2018 \u201cThe jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>over claims * * * is wholly statutory, and is not included within its general jurisdiction. The Courts of Common Pleas do not have inherent jurisdiction in workmen\u2019s compensation cases but only such as is bestowed upon them under the provisions of the act.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Cook, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 201, 543 N.E.2d at 789-790, citing <em>Jenkins v. Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 122, 126, 35 O.O.2d 147, 149, 216 N.E.2d 379, 382.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Moreover, one of the controlling principles of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act [is that it] was so structured by the General Assembly to repose in the commission sole and final jurisdiction to determine extent of disability, and thus the amount of compensation to which a claimant is entitled to under the Act.\u201d <em>Rummel, supra, </em>28 Ohio St.2d at 233, 57 O.O.2d at 469, 277 N.E.2d at 424; <em>Brecount v. Procter &amp; Gamble </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 477, 2 O.O.2d 494, 144 N.E.2d 189, at paragraph two of the syllabus. This principle illustrates the legislative intention to allow for expeditious administrative treatment of claims with attendant expertise made under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act without the parties having to undergo time-consuming and potentially vexatious litigation. Because of the strong statutory case law and public policy considerations present in this case, the trial court held, and this court agrees, that the setting of the average weekly wage involves the compensation due under the workers\u2019 compensation law, which, as <em>Zavatsky </em>notes, is inextricably bound up with considerations of the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s appeal to the common pleas court, was uncognizable under R.C. 4123.519 and its assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-8\">Christley, P.J., and John J. Lynch, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b363-9\">John J. Lynch, J., retired, of the Seventh Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
