Jackson, plaintiff below and appellee herein, against Republic-Franklin Insurance Company, defendant below and appellant herein, and overruling a summary judgment motion filed by appellant in a declaratory judgment action instituted by appellee. The following error is assigned:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying Republic-Franklin\u2019s motion for summary judgment; in granting Nancy Jackson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court based it upon an erroneous interpretation of the rule of law to be followed in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u201cIf an insured, in good faith, prosecutes a lawsuit against an underinsured motorist with the knowledge of the insured\u2019s insurance company, generally <em>both </em>the insured and his insurance company are bound by any final judgment rendered as a result of such lawsuit that determines the liability of the underinsured motorist to the insured. <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Handlovic </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 179 [23 OBR 343, 492 N.E.2d 417].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows. On October 10, 1985, appellee was injured in an automobile accident which occurred as a result of the negligence of a certain Jeannie M. Hart. On October 26, 1986, appellee commenced an action against the said Jeannie M. Hart for damages incurred as a result of the accident. Subsequently appellee gave notice to appellant that she was asserting a claim for underinsured motorist coverage on a policy of insurance issued by appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfL\">The aforesaid policy of insurance provided, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">\u201cPART C \u2014 UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>&lt;&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cAny judgment for damages arising out of a suit brought without our written consent is not binding on us. If we and you do not agree as to whether or not a vehicle is actually uninsured, the burden of proof as to that issue shall be on us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On November 11, 1987, appellee gave notice to appellant that a trial in her action against the said Jeannie M. Hart would commence on December 7, 1987. At that time, appellee requested a determination of whether appellant would \u201cconsent\u201d to be bound by the jury verdict rendered in that case. While appellant made a response to such request, the parties are in disagreement over the legal effect of such response. Appellant\u2019s response, in pertinent part, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cIn the event the verdict is in excess of the tortfeasor\u2019s limits, then we\u2019ll either agree with the verdict as presented or submit to arbitration under the terms of the policy contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Appellee argues that such language \u201cconclusively operates as an additional agreement of [appellant] * * * that it would not be bound by the verdict.\u201d Appellant argues to the contrary and states that after the verdict was rendered, it agreed to be bound by such amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Following trial, the jury returned a verdict of $53,812 in favor of appellee. Although the limit on the liability policy covering Jeannie M. Hart was $50,000, it appears from the summary judgment materials before us that the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier did, in fact, pay the full amount of the verdict, $53,812. On December 27, 1987, appellee made a formal demand for arbitration to appellant. Such demand was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">On March 14, 1988, appellee commenced the present action below seeking both a declaratory judgment, and order, that appellant comply with the arbitration provisions set forth in the aforementioned policy and that appellant pay to appellee whatever arbitration award is made by the arbitration panel in excess of $53,812 up to the policy limit of $100,000. Appellant filed its answer denying any duty to arbitrate and filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that appellee was bound by the previous jury award. Contemporaneously, appellant filed its motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim. Appellee, apparently without making a reply to appellant\u2019s counterclaim pursuant to Civ.R. 7(A), filed her own motion for summary judgment. Neither motion was supported by affidavit, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">A decision was rendered on these cross-motions and a judgment entry filed on August 25, 1989, granting judgment to appellee as a matter of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ordering appellant to comply with the arbitration provisions and to pay appellee any arbitration award made in excess of $53,812 up to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The issue presented for review herein is whether the parties are bound by the final judgment rendered for appellee against the uninsured motorist, Jeannie M. Hart. For the following reasons, we hold that both parties are so bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In <em>Motorist Mut. Ins. Co. v. Handlovic </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 179, 23 OBR 343, 492 N.E.2d 417, the Ohio Supreme Court held, in the syllabus, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cIf an insured, in good faith, prosecutes a lawsuit against an underinsured motorist <em>with the knowledge of the insured\u2019s insurance company, </em>generally <em>both the insured and his insurance company are bound by any final judgment rendered </em>as a result of such lawsuit that determines the liability of the underinsured motorist to the insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The issue in <em>Handlovic </em>was whether an insurance carrier could refuse to arbitrate an underinsured motorist claim, asserted by its insured, subsequent to a final judgment of liability and damages being entered against the tortfeasor in a separate action. The court found that the insurance carrier could refuse to arbitrate the claim. This ruling was predicated on the rule of law set forth in the syllabus of <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Shuff </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 172, 21 O.O.3d 108, 423 N.E.2d 417, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cAn insured who seeks to recover damages from his insurer under an uninsured motorist policy and is unsuccessful after a trial on the merits and a jury verdict, may not thereafter submit to arbitration the issue of the liability of the uninsured motorist.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In <em>Shuff, </em>the court ruled that an insured could not seek recovery under the underinsured motorist provision of a policy from his insurance carrier by virtue of the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The cause <em>sub judice </em>is legally indistinguishable from <em>Handlovic. </em>As in that case, the appellee herein has already had a final judgment entered in her favor against the negligent party. Both appellant herein and the insurance carrier in <em>Handlovic </em>had knowledge of the impending trial. Therefore, we conclude that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>similarly applies herein and that appellant may refuse to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Appellee argues that <em>Handlovic </em>is distinguishable from the cause <em>sub judice </em>and that the proper standard to apply was that set forth in <em>Bogan v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 22, 521 N.E.2d 447. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Appellee asserts that <em>Handlovic </em>must be read as \u201cmerely reaffirming\u201d the <em>Shuff </em>decision which stands for the proposition that a jury verdict would be binding on both parties herein only if recovery was for less than the policy limit of the tortfeasor. Appellee would buttress this contention by further arguing that the portion of <em>Handlovic </em>previously cited in this opinion, and contained in the Supreme Court syllabus of that opinion, is mere <em>dicta </em>and should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It is well established that the syllabus of a Supreme Court opinion states the controlling points of law arising from the case. Rule 1(B) of the Supreme Court Rules for the Reporting of Opinions; <em>Palmer v. Zeigler </em>(1907), 76 Ohio St. 210, 227, 81 N.E. 234, 238 (citing Rule VI of the Rules of Court adopted in 1858, 5 Ohio St. v). An exception to this rule occurs where \u201cthe controlling facts are totally different from those in the case wherein the syllabus was announced.\u201d <em>Troy v. Schnell </em>(1933), 48 Ohio App. 325, 331, 1 O.O. 508, 511, 193 N.E. 782, 785. Accordingly, the syllabus from <em>Handlovic </em>is the controlling point of law from the case unless the \u201ccontrolling facts\u201d of the cause <em>sub judice </em>are totally different from those of <em>Handlovic. </em>As stated above, the controlling facts in both cases are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Appellee urges that <em>Handlovic </em>is distinguishable for the reason that, unlike <em>Handlovic, </em>the judgment herein against the tortfeasor exceeded the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limit by $3,812 and such fact entitles appellee to arbitration under the underinsured provisions of her policy up to the $100,000 limit therein. In short, appellee contends she is not bound by the jury determination of her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Appellee\u2019s argument ignores the rationale upon which <em>Handlovic </em>is based. As stated in <em>Handlovic, </em>23 Ohio St.3d at 183, 23 OBR at 346, 492 N.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>420, because the judgment against the tortfeasor therein \u201cconclusively determined the full extent of appellant\u2019s legal entitlement to damages, no purpose is served by requiring Motorists to comply with the appellants\u2019 demand for arbitration in this case.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) The same conclusion follows herein irrespective that the judgment exceeded the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Because both appellant and appellee were bound by the judgment of the jury and under the underinsured policy provision that \u201c[w]e will pay damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover for bodily injury,\u201d but for the fact that the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance paid the full amount of the judgment of $53,812, appellee would have been entitled to be paid $3,812 under her policy even though she was not entitled to arbitration. Moreover, appellee cites <em>Bogan, supra, </em>for the proposition that an underinsured motorist claim is \u201cripe for arbitration\u201d if there has been an \u201cexhaustion\u201d of the policy limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance. However, the insurance policy in <em>Bogan </em>directly provided that the underinsured coverage would not make payment for any injury until <em>after the limits of liability </em>under all * * * insurance policies * * * have been <em>exhausted by payments of judgments or settlements. Bogan, supra, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 23, 521 N.E.2d at 449.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Bogan </em>turned, in part, on construction of the language contained in the insurance policy at issue therein and did not create a general doctrine of \u201cexhaustion\u201d of a tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy limits as a test for determining whether there exists a valid claim for underinsured motorist coverage. Accordingly, we find appellee\u2019s arguments to be without merit. Finally, <em>Bogan </em>is distinguishable for the reason that the primary issues adjudicated therein related to the right of the insured to settle with the tortfeasor as opposed to proceeding to judgment at trial against the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">As aforesaid, the syllabus in <em>Handlovic </em>is the controlling principle to be applied herein. Because it is undisputed among the pleadings filed below that appellant had knowledge of the lawsuit prior to trial and after the trial a final judgment was entered therein on the issue of liability and damages, the parties herein are bound by such judgment. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and final judgment is entered in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Harsha, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b397-5\">Grey, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\">. The subject policy contained underinsured motorist coverage up to a limit of $100,000 per person for a period of coverage from August 27, 1985 to February 27, 1986, to the named insured, Lucy K. Abrams. It is unclear what relationship there is between the named insured and appellee herein, but, in any event, coverage of appellee is not disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\">. The court noted that while the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>would not be directly applicable therein, the doctrine would dictate the same results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\"Customarily, arbitrators decide issues without judicial review. A court may, however, vacate an arbitration result when the arbitrators rule contrary to law, or make \u2018such manifest mistake as naturally works a fraud.\u2019 That is, even if appellees compelled appellant to arbitrate this matter and received a damage award, that result would clearly be erroneous and contrary to law under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Universal would then be entitled to undertake another proceeding to reinstate the jury verdict. After all this, the parties would be exactly where the jury left them. Arbitration, in this case, would be a 'vain thing,\u2019 and the well-settled policy of caution is expressed by the maxim, \u2018equity will not decree a vain thing.\u2019 Therefore, under the terms of this insurance policy, Universal may refuse to arbitrate.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Shubb, </em>67 Ohio St.2d 172 at 174, 21 O.O.3d 108 at 109, 423 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>N.E.2d 417 at 418; See, also, <em>Handlovic, supra, </em>23 Ohio St.3d at 183, 23 OBR at 346, 492 N.E.2d at 420, which applies the facts therein to the same analysis and reaches the same result.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">.

Jackson.\u201d She presented this estoppel argument at the hearing on the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions and also offers this argument on appeal. The trial court\u2019s August 25, 1988 judgment entry of the trial court does not expressly indicate the basis for its decision; accordingly, if appellee\u2019s estoppel argument were meritorious, we would be required to affirm the trial court judgment. See, <em>e.g., Karches v. Cincinnati </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 12, 19, 526 N.E.2d 1350, 1357, for the proposition that every reasonable presumption must be made in favor of the trial court judgment. Therefore, an examination of this argument is necessary to the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">If an insured, in good faith, prosecutes a lawsuit against an underinsured motorist with knowledge of the insured\u2019s insurance company, generally <em>both </em>the insured and his insurance company are bound by any final judgment rendered as a result of such lawsuit that determines the liability of the underinsured motorist to the insured. <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Handlovic </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 179, 23 OBR 343, 492 N.E.2d 417, syllabus. The key word in the <em>Handlovic </em>holding is \u201cgenerally.\u201d The <em>Handlovic </em>decision did not expressly exclude estoppel as a viable exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that estoppel provides an exception to the <em>Handlovic </em>holding, I am persuaded that the elements of estoppel are not applicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>uneontroverted facts herein. In order for equitable estoppel to apply, four <em>prima facie </em>elements which the plaintiff must set forth are: (1) that the party knowingly made a false representation or concealment of a material fact (or at least took a position contrary to that now taken); (2) that the representation must be made in a misleading manner with the intention or expectation that another would rely on it to act; (3) that the plaintiff actually relied on the representation; and (4) that plaintiff relied to his detriment so much that unless the party is estopped from asserting the truth or a contrary position, plaintiff would suffer loss. <em>Andres v. Perrysburg </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 51, 56, 546 N.E.2d 1377, 1383. Additionally, there can be no equitable estoppel where the party claiming it is chargeable with knowledge of the facts, as where he either knows the facts or is in a position to know them or the circumstances are such that he should know them. <em>Pedler v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 7, 11, 23 OBR 6, 9, 490 N.E.2d 605, 608. Alternatively, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, a promise reasonably expected to induce and which does induce action is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement. <em>Blackwell v. Internatl. Union U.A.W. </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 179, 9 OBR 289, 458 N.E.2d 1272; Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981) 242, Section 90(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In the case at bar, construing the evidence most strongly in favor of appellee, appellant made a promise through its contractual language as well as its agent\u2019s letter that it would not be bound by the jury verdict in appellee\u2019s action against the tortfeasor. However, there is no evidence of detrimental reliance on the part of appellee, <em>i.e., </em>no indication that but for appellant\u2019s promise, she would not have proceeded in her case against the tortfeasor. Moreover, appellee\u2019s counsel should have been aware that the refusal of appellee to consent to be bound was not a controlling factor pursuant to <em>Handlovic. </em>Accordingly, although the representations by appellant were arguably deceptive and reprehensible, the holding of <em>Handlovic </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In essence, we are asked to make bad law in an attempt to punish the appellant insurance company for its lack of good faith in dealing with its insureds. Given the facts that Republic-Franklin Insurance Company both included provisions within its policy that are in contravention of the law under <em>Handlovic, supra, </em>and further took the formal written position that it would not be bound by the jury\u2019s verdict, it is indeed tempting to allow appellee a \u201csecond bite of the apple\u201d through arbitration. However, since our duty is to interpret the law within the framework of <em>stare decisis </em>rather than simply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>hand down sanctions against wayward insurance companies,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I somewhat reluctantly concur in the judgment and opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-16\">. In so holding, one assumes that there are independent remedies, including administrative action and/or bad faith litigation, available to appellee and similarly situated insureds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
