Supreme Court properly determined that respondent\u2019s designating petition contains signatures that are invalid because the signers listed the village, and not the requisite town, where they reside <em>(see </em>Election Law \u00a7 6-130). Respondent attempted to cure the defect pursuant to section 6-134 (12) by submitting unsworn statements signed by the Clerk of the Village of Depew and a United States postal worker stating that certain streets are located within the Town of Cheektowaga. In our view, that section does not afford a cure for the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>town or city, but only for the use of a post office address. Even assuming, arguendo, that each of the contested signatures could be cured by \u201cproof that such address is the accepted address of such signer\u201d <em>(id.), </em>we conclude that the unsworn statements submitted by respondent do not substantially comply with the requirements of section 6-134 (12) <em>(see Matter of Ligammari v Norris, </em>275 AD2d 884 [2000]), and thus the contested signatures are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">In light of our determination, we do not address petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions. Present \u2014 Pigott, Jr., P.J., Hurlbutt, Scudder, Gorski and Hayes, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
