Group, </em>96 NY2d 398 [2001]). The defendant third-party plaintiff\u2019s admissions in its reply papers and on appeal that the plaintiff has some movement in his arm defeat its claim that the plaintiff sustained a permanent and total loss of use of that arm as required under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 <em>(see Meis v ELO Org., </em>97 NY2d 714 [2002]). Altman, J.P., Goldstein, McGinity and Mastro, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
