Somers, 71 Texas, 700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-9\">Plaintiff was bound to take notice of all obstructions that were obvious and plain to view, absolutely, and irrespective of whether a man of ordinary prudence and caution, in the judgment of the jury, ought to have discovered them. In other words, the terms obvious and plain to view express a definite condition and a limitation and qualification that it must be so obvious and plain to view that a reasonably prudent man would have observed the same, is not warranted by law.

Rep., 458.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-11\">Even if the plaintiff had not known of the particular defect in the track which caused his injury, or could not under the law be said to be charged with notice of such particular defect, yet if the defendant was in the habit of requiring its brakemen to couple cars in its yards over and across crossings and on tracks where there were as many and as great obstructions to foot travel, equally as liable to cause brakemen to stumble or fall as was the plank in this case, and such conditions were usual, and such as brakemen in the employ of the defendant were expected to meet, then the plaintiff by continuing in the employ of the defendant assumed the risk of this particular obstruction and defect, whether he knew of the same or not.

Second-\u2014-If injured as alleged by plaintiff, he, by his own negligence, contributed to the injury, in that he attempted to make a coupling between a ear and the engine when the drawhead of one was three to five inches higher than the drawhead of the other; that he attempted to make the coupling without the use of a crooked link when he well knew that the coupling could not be made with safety without such crooked link; that he attempted to make it with a glove on his hand, when he well knew that was more dangerous and hazardous to so attempt to make the coupling; that he made it in a careless and indifferent manner, without noticing for obstructions in the way of his feet liable to cause him to stumble, and without noticing where he was walking, what he was doing, or keeping a careful watch-out for the approaching car or engine which he was to couple to, and when he knew, or ought to have known, that just beyond the car to which he was going to couple there was another car on the track likely to come in contact with the car to which he was going to couple, and without looking out for such car and guarding against it striking the car to which he was attempting to couple, and by his failure to use ordinary care under the circumstances, he contributed to his own injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The Honey Grove Cotton Oil Company, by original answer, urged general and special exceptions to plaintiff\u2019s petition as against it, and pleaded general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">August 25, 1893, the demurrers of the Honey Grove Cotton Oil Company were sustained and that company dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The first amended original petition having been filed subsequent to the action on the demurrers of the Honey Grove Cotton Oil Company, to-wit, February 23, 1894, thereupon came on to be heard the motion of the defendant tne Honey Grove Cotton Oil Company to strike out such parts of said amended petition as pertained to said defendant, which motion was sustained, to which the plaintiff and the defendant \u25a0the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Trial was had August 30, 1894, and judgment for plaintiff for $3500 against the appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\"><em>Conclusions of Fact and </em>Daw.\u2014We find that the appellee was injured substantially as alleged in his petition at the time and place there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>charged, and that he was injured by reason of his foot being caught on a plank which was a part of the platform scales used by appellant on its track for the purpose of weighing cars. This plank projected in part above the platform scales close to the track, and, so situated, was an obstruction that was dangerous in the manner and under the circumstances alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">That the appellee was a brakeman in the employ of appellant at the time he was injured, and while in the performance of his duties as brakeman, in attempting to couple cars, his foot came in contact with this plank and he stumbled over it, and by reason of this fact he was injured in the manner alleged. His injury, in the main, was caused by stumbling over the plank. At the time of his injury he was in the performance of his duty as a brakeman and he was in the exercise of reasonable care and caution and did not know of the defect in the platform scales caused by the plank in question projecting above it, nor was the existence of such defect so plain and obvious that he could and should in the nature of things have seen it, nor did he exhibit in failing to discover the faulty condition of the platform or defect therein resulting from the raised plank a want of caution and care, because we find that at the time of his inj ury and before, his attention was properly directed to coupling the cars, the duty he was then engaged in. The exercise of diligence in performing this duty, in the main, deprived him of the power of discovering the defect in the plank.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We find that the appellant, by a proper inspection, could have discovered the condition of the plank and could have and should have discovered its dangerous condition, and that the appellant was guilty of negligence in permitting the plank and the platform to remain in this condition; and we find that appellee was not guilty of negligence that contributed to his injuries, but he was injured by reason of the negligence of appellant, as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The evidence, in the light of the case made by the plaintiff, warrants, these findings, and as this was the view of the j ury that tried the case, in deference to their verdict and the judgment rendered thereon, we find the facts as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The charge of the court presents fully all of the law of the case raised by the pleadings and applicable to the facts. Therefore, we hold that there was no error in the charge, and there was no error in refusing the charges requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The ninth assignment of error complains of the refusal of the court to permit the witness Campbell to testify that the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railroad kept and maintained its track at points on its road in a similar condition to the track of appellant at Honey Grove. There was no error in this ruling. The condition of the track of another road has nothing to do with the condition of the track of the appellant. It is a matter foreign, and could not be considered as shedding any light upon the negligence of appellant or its care and caution in keeping its track in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>good condition and repair, nor would such testimony be useful in explaining the conduct of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">It was further attempted to be proved by the witness Campbell that it was a well-settled rule among railroad men that a brakeman must look where he goes to couple cars. This testimony was irrelevant. It is a question of fact for the jury to determine, with the rulings of law bearing upon the question, the duty of a brakeman when engaged in the service of his master, and a witness has not the right to determine this fact for the jury. The witness can testify as to rules promulgated by the company for the guidance of the bralcemen, if he knows them, but the character of evidence offered was not to this effect. It was to the point that among railroad men it was well settled as a rule that a brakeman must look where he goes, otherwise he is guilty of negligence. This character of testimony was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The testimony of the plaintiff complained of in the tenth assignment of error was admissible, and is justified by the ruling made in Railway v. Somers, 71 Texas, 700. The plaintiff, after having testified in response to questions asked by appellant to the effect that he had on rubber boots at the time of his injury, and that it was muddy and slippery where he was injured, was asked the question by his counsel if the muddy boots caused him to fall. He answered \u201cNo.\u201d This testimony Was objected to by the appellant upon the ground that it was a question of fact for the jury to determine what caused the appellee to fall. As to what caused the appellee to fall is a question of fact, and if the appellee knew that his fall was attributable to a certain fact, or if he knew that his fall was not occasioned by a certain condition of things, he could so state. It was testimony concerning a fact, and one which evidently he was more familiar with than any one else, and if he knew the fact there could be no serious objection to his testifying to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The objections to the remarks of counsel complained of in the first, second, third and fourth assignments of error should not cause a reversal of the case. There is no complaint here that the verdict of the jury is excessive, nor does it appear that they were influenced by passion or prejudice aroused by these remarks in finding a verdict. But a serin is objection exists in the manner in which these points were preserved in the trial below. No objection was made to these remarks at the time they were delivered in the trial court, nor was the court then requested that counsel should be admonished, nor was any exception taken to these remarks at that time, but some time after the trial a bill of exception was presented objecting to the language complained of. Although appellant may have labored under some embarrassment in calling the attention of the trial court to these remarks at the time they were made, it is believed that the proper rule to govern in matters of this kind, in order to preserve the point, is to make the exception at the time the remarks are made, and thereby call the court\u2019s attention to the impropriety of the language used. This was not done in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>We find that there was no reversible error shown in the record, and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
