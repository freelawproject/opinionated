Stats., art. 2395) it was error to charge that, to be exempt, it must be \u201cnecessary for home consumption.\u201d The exemption is not limited to what is indispensable, but embraces the supply reserved for the purpose, if not unreasonably excessive.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-10\"><em>2. </em>Same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-11\">It seems that the exemption does not extend to property not reserved for home consumption, but held for sale, though it might have been exempt if so reserved; and that the fact that it was intended to be sold for the purpose of supplying other necessaries for family consumption will not entitle it to exemption.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b172-12\">Appeal from the County Court of Fannin County.

Conner v. Hawkins, 66 Texas, 639.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">[No briefs for appellee have reached the Reporter.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b173-8\">KEY, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AUt-\">Opinion.\u2014Appellant sued appellee, T. J. Hobbs, and the sureties on his bond as constable, for damages for seizing under execution and selling certain cotton seed claimed by appellant to be exempt from forced sale under the provision of the statute exempting to families \u201call provisions and forage on hand for home consumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The court below charged the jury, in effect, that in order for the cotton seed to be exempt they must find from the evidence that they were necessary for home consumption; and this phase of the charge is complained of by appellant, and we think justly so. The word \u201cnecessary\u201d signifies essential, indispensable, requisite (Webster\u2019s Dictionary). How it is not required that a particular kind of forage be indispensable in order to bring it within the purview of the exemption statute. If it be suitable for feeding stock, and the supply reserved for home consumption be not unreasonably excessive, it is exempt, although some of it may not, in view of other forage on hand, be absolutely indispensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The testimony tended to show that appellant had a considerable quantity of corn; and therefore, under the charge referred to, the jury may have concluded that he was not entitled to any exemption on cotton seed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Assignments of error presenting other questions are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">For the error indicated the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">\n<em>Reversed and, remanded,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
