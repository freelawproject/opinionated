Held, that such estimates were properly admitted in evidence in connection with other proof of their correctness, though such provision of the contract should be held not authorized by the power. (In the opinion of Justice Collard, the power to contract for grading authorized the agent to so provide for ascertaining the amount to be paid, and made the certificate at least prima facie proof of the work done.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b136-15\">4.

Miller, 24 S. W. Rep., 819. Certified questions on this appeal, as to the construction of the power of attorney, were answered by the Supreme Court. Sullivan v. Miller, 86 Texas, 677. The judgment was then reversed. Upon the rendition of the first opinion upon this appeal, and pending the motion of appellees for a rehearing and their offer to remit and to dismiss the case as to Mrs. Cross, the question as to the power of the court to then permit such dismissal was certified to the Supreme Court and there answered in the affirmative. Miller v. Sullivan, 89 Texas, 480. The judgment of the lower court having been reformed and affirmed upon entering such remittitur and dismissal, a motion for i-ehearing was made by appellants, and was overruled.

Inhabitants, 22 Me., 133.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">The court erred in refusing the fourth special charge requested by defendants, that for the purpose of determining the amount and value of the work they were not permitted to consider that part of the testimony of the witness Hardeman in which he states the result of the estimates made by him which were based on the profile work done by House, or on work done or estimates made by Scarnell, unless it has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence that such profile work done by House and such work and estimates done and made by said Scarnell were correct and true.

The certificate of the engineer ascertaining what work had been done thereunder and what should be paid therefor was proper evidence to be admitted to prove plaintiff\u2019s demand presumptively, subject to rebuttal by the adverse party, and the trial court did not err in admitting such certificates for such purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">The charge asked if given would have resulted in taking away from the jury the right to consider a very slight portion of Hardeman\u2019s testimony, and if the court erred in refusing to give such a charge such refusal was harmless error, for the verdict of the jury is authorized by other facts in the case not embraced in Hardeman\u2019s evidence, and the justice of the case having been attained, a judgment rendered on such a verdict will not be reversed on account of an erroneous charge or refusal to give a charge asked, though correct as a matter of law.

Beason, after the commencement of the suit at a former term of the court, was made after the case had been called for trial and trial commenced; the husband of said defendant was then present and opportunity given to make him a party defendant, which was not taken advantage of. Mrs. Beason had answered, and her answer was on file at the trial of this case, resulting in the judgment herein appealed from. She did not then except to the action of the court in rendering judgment against her, nor such was the matter made a ground for new trial, wherefore we maintain that judgment, if defective as to said defendant, cannot now be questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">Counsel for appellees filed a motion for rehearing, based upon the propositions maintained in their original brief and accompanied by an offer to remit the amount of \u00a71579.50, recovered on account of clearing and grubbing, and to dismiss the case as to Mrs. Cross.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>COLLARD, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar3d\">This is an action by the appellees against appellants for $20,004.09 balance due on a contract alleged to have been made by W. A. H. Miller for himself and as attorney in fact for his codefendants, by which they agreed to pay appellees for grading a certain part of a railroad, the Llano extension of the San Antonio <em>&amp; </em>Aransas Pass Railway, from Fredericksburg to Sandies, a distance of about 30 miles. The petition also claims that defendants in the contract agreed to pay plaintiffs for the clearing and grubbing necessary to complete the road-bed. The suit is brought on the contract, for completing the work of ten miles of the road, for the amount stipulated in the contract,\u2014the certificate of the railroad engineer in charge as provided by the contract showing that such part of the road has been completed and accepted by the company. The statement of the case by appellees correctly sets out the pleadings of the parties. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiffs for the amount sued for, $20,004.09, without interest, but to bear legal interest from the date of the judgment, the 13th day of December, 1894, from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>Findings of </em>Fact.\u2014We find the facts as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Defendants executed to W.

Scarnell of the railway company, made a final estimate of the work done by plaintiffs under their contract, which was approved by T. J. Hardeman the railway company\u2019s civil engineer in charge, which shows the work done by plaintiffs and the amount due therefor at the prices fixed by the contracts, the total amount due, including clearing and grubbing, being, as so certified, $22,704.04, which, credited by the amount paid by defendants, leaves the balance due of $20,004.09, the amount sued for and for which judgment was rendered. It was shown that the estimate of the work so certified by the engineer in charge was correct according to measurements made, the value of which at the prices stipulated in the contract amounted to the sum as before stated, which credited by the amount paid left the amount duo $20,004.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The contract required plaintiff to clear and grub \u201call timber and brush within fifty feet of the center line\u201d the timber and brush to be removed and burnt when required, except such as the engineer might deem of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The amount claimed in the petition for clearing and grubbing, shown in the final estimate made by the \u201cengineer in charge\u201d and the amount recovered therefor was \u00a71579.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Opinion.\u2014The court instructed the jury that defendants were bound - by the contract made by Miller, if they executed the power of attorney and if Miller signed the contract in their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Appellants contend that this charge is erroneous, because the power limited Miller to the making of but one contract for grading for the entire distance, from the initial point to the terminus of the extension, a distance of 75 miles, and because the power only authorized him to make such contract with the railway company.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The Supreme Court in speaking of this power, on the former appeal of this case (86 Texas 677) analyzed it and declared that it empowered Miller to contract first with the railway company to extend and operate the road to Llano, and \u201cto make any contract for grading the road between the points named which the makers of the instrument themselves could make.\u201d Id., 679. The language of the power is \u201cto enter into a contract for grading of said railway from said point on said railway to said town of Llano.\u201d Appellants contend that as used in the power \u201ca contract\u201d means only one contract, and that the context shows that this contract must be made with the railway company. There is another part of the power which we think determines both of these questions against appellants\u2019 contention. In providing for security in part in favor of the persons or person who would undertake the contract for grading the road,' the instrument says: \u201cAnd in consideration of the premises and the contract for the grading of said road to be entered into by our said attorney we hereby agree and obligate ourselves respectively to secure our subscriptions heretofore or hereafter made for the extension of the aforesaid road by good sufficient bankable security, to be approved and made payable to Moore, Foster <em>&amp; </em>Co., bankers, of Llano, Texas, to be held in trust and to enable them to guarantee the payment to such contractors for the grading of said road.\u201d This clause of the power shows the intent of the makers in granting the power to contract for the grading; that .it was contemplated that there would be more contractors than one and more than one contract for the grading, and that the railway company was not to be the sole contractor. Evidently the power intended to empower Miller to contract with as many persons as required, or as were necessary to grade the entire length of the extension of the road to Llano, and that he could make such contracts at his discretion and with persons of his election.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The fact that plaintiffs\u2019 contract did not cover the initial point of the extension, or that it covers a part of the line between its terminal points is of no consequence. The initial point was covered by another contract, and the attorney had the power to contract as he did for the construction of the middle part of the line of road, as well as the terminal points. The power provides for such a contract and no doubt it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>intended and expected that he would cover the entire distance with several contracts, some or one of which would necessarily apply to parts between the termini.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The contract executed by Miller with plaintiffs bound them to do all the clearing, grubbing and grading necessary to complete the roadbed. \u201cClearing and grubbing,\u201d as the contract specifies, meant that \u201call timber and brush within fifty feet of the center line shall be removed and burned when required, except such as the engineer may deem of value.\u201d The court instructed the jury that defendants would be liable for the clearing and grubbing as contracted for at the contract price, which was 815 per acre. The value of this work, as declared in exhibit to the petition, as shown by the proof, and as recovered by plaintiffs was 81579.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Appellants say it was error to allow, by charge of the court, a recovery for the clearing and grubbing, as the power of attorney did not authorize a contract for it, but allowed only a contract for grading. We think this contention of appellants is correct. The power only warranted a contract for grading. This would include all clearing and grubbing necessary to the grading but no more,\u2014not necessarily fifty feet on each side of the center line of the roadbed. The testimony does not show that fifty feet on each side of the center of the road was necessary to the proper grading authorized and done under the contract. It was a question of fact, and if there had been testimony to the point it should have been left to the jury by appropriate instruction. It was not correct for the court to assume the necessity of so much clearing and grubbing as provided for in the contract. The evidence should have discriminated between the amount of the clearing and grubbing that was necessary to the proper grading of the road and that which was not so necessary, or have shown that so much was necessary. Plaintiffs could recover for all work done including such clearing and grubbing as was required to carry out the contract for grading at the contract price, as this would be included in the power to contract for the grading. We cannot say, nor could the court, below, that the fifty feet on each side of the center of the road as contracted for was required to complete the grading. Skaggs v. Murchison, 63 Texas, 353; Frost v. Erath Cattle Co., 81 Texas, 508; McAlpin v. Cassidy, 17 Texas, 463; Railway v. McKinney, 55 Texas, 183, 184. The clearing and grubbing not necessary to the grading was not such an incident to the grading as authorized the agent to contract for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">3. The court admitted in evidence, over objection of defendants, the classification and value of the work done by plaintiffs under the contract sued on, under the final estimate made by R. F. Soarnell, division engineer of the railway company, certified to or \u201cO. K\u2019d.\u201d by T. J. Hardeman, engineer in charge, as presumptive evidence of the amount of work and value thereof done by plaintiffs under their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The contract sued on stipulated that defendants should pay the contractors \u201con completion of each continuous ten miles of the grade\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the same is received and cost price certified to by the engineer in charge. The contract also contained the following: \u201cAnd it is mutually agreed and distinctly understood that the decision of the chief engineer shall be final and conclusive in any dispute which may arise between the parties to this agreement relative to or touching the same; and each and every one of the said parties do hereby waive any right, action, suit or suits \u00bbr other remedy in law or otherwise by virtue of said covenants, so that the decision of said engineer shall in the nature of an award, be final and conclusive on the rights and claims of said parties. The testimony of Scarnell shows that the final estimate of the amount and value of the work at the contract prices was correct, according to actual-measurements made by him. The testimony of Hardeman the engineer in charge for the railway company is not so definite, but taken with that of Scarnell, which is not disputed, it may be said that the final estimate was proved to be correct. We think the final estimate was admissible along with the testimony of Scarnell and Hardeman, and that there was no error in allowing it to be placed before the jury. The court did not instruct the jury that the final estimate certified to by Hardeman was conclusive or presumptive evidence, but admitted it in evidence with the testimony of the two engineers. As before said it was admissible in this manner. The individual opinion of the writer is that Miller, under the power of attorney, was empowered to bind the principals to pay the contractors for the work at stipulated prices, according to the final estimate of the engineer in charge. The power to contract for the grading included the power to make the certificate of the engineer at least prima facie proof of the amount of work done. It was an incident of the power to make the contract a complete contract, which would be implied from the main object of the power. The contract could under the power provide for the ascertainment of the amount to be paid. \u201cEvery agency carries with it or includes in it as an incident all the powers which are necessary or proper or usual as a means to effectuate the purposes for which it was created and none other.\u201d McAlpin v. Cassidy, 17 Texas, 463, and \u201cIn this respect there is no distinction whether the authority given to an agent is general or special, express or implied.\u201d Id.; Railway v. McKinney, 55 Texas, 183; Ryan <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Railway, 66 Texas, 15; 63 Texas, 348; 74 Texas, 40; 1 White &amp; W. C. C., 1124; 55 Texas, 155; Mechem on Agency, secs. 282-311. On this point I speak only my individual opinion, the majority of the court deeming it sufficient under the assignment to say that the final estimate was admissible in connection with the testimony of the two engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">4. It would have been proper for the court to instruct the jury in case of finding for plaintiffs to find only such amount as was shown to be done at the contract prices, not including the clearing and grubbing not necessary to the grading. It was not error to refuse the charge asked by defendants upon this subject because it was in some parts of it upon the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>5. Appellants insist that the court erred in repeating at plaintiffs\u2019 request an instruction as to the necessity of notice to plaintiffs of an understanding between defendants who signed the power in regard to others signing it before it should be delivered or acted upon, the court having correctly charged upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The court should be careful not to repeat a correct charge so as to give it undue prominence. Having once stated the principle clearly, as should be done, a repetition of it might unduly influence the finding of the jury by making it too prominent, thus indicating to the jury that the court entertained this view of the case. But we do not find that the court repeated the charge \u201cat the request of plaintiffs\u201d as assigned, though we do find a repetition of the principle once charged in the court\u2019s general charge. The assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">6. There was no error in instructing the jury that the failure or refusal of the defendants to pay plaintiffs for the ten miles of work completed (if it was completed)' would excuse them from completing the other twenty miles of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The contract obligated defendants to pay for the work on the completion of each ten miles of the grading at the prices stipulated, on certificate of the engineer in charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The refusal of defendants to comply with their contract, and to recognize their obligations under it authorized plaintiff to treat it as rescinded for the remainder, and sue for the work done at the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">7. Mrs. Beeson, a feme sole, was an original party defendant, but pending the suit she intermarried with one G. B. Cross. It was error to proceed with the trial without making Cross a party, the fact of marriage having been made known to the court after the parties announced, but before the trial in fact had commenced, and it was error to render judgment against her as a feme sole. Reed v. Cavitt, 30 S. W. Rep., 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Opinion delivered January 15, 1896.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\">ON MOTION OF APPELLEES FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b154-13\">COLLARD, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AWn\">In our opinion the motion for rehearing presents no good reason requiring us to recede from any part of our former opinion in this cause. Appellees propose to enter a remittitur in this court to the amount of \u00a71579.50, the value of the clearing and grubbing sued for, and recovered, and also ask us to dismiss the case as to Mrs. Beeson, who was shown to have intermarried with G. B. Cross, but against whom judgment was rendered as a feme sole.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">The remittitur and the dismissal asked, will relieve the judgment of all the error found and determined by this court and the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>having decided that such proceeding can be had in this court, it is therefore ordered that the suit be dismissed as to Mrs. Cross, and that the remittitur be entered as requested, and the judgment of the lower reformed accordingly, affirming the same as reformed. In other respects the motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Remittitur </em>entered, <em>case dismissed as to Defendant Gross and judgment reformed and affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Opinion delivered June 3, 1896.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">ON MOTION OF APPELLANTS FOR A REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b155-9\">COLLARD, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">Opinion.\u2014The motion of appellants for a rehearing, in our opinion, must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">It is earnestly insisted by counsel for appellants that we should have sustained the seventh assignment of error, which is that the court below committed error in charging the jury that the failure of defendants to pay plaintiffs for the ten miles of work completed excused plaintiffs from completing the other twenty miles of grading, and that, though plaintiffs abandoned the further performance of the contract, they were entitled to recover against the defendants for the work done at the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The contract made by Miller with plaintiffs stipulated: \u201cThe parties of the second part agree to pay the party of the first part, on the conqiletion of each continuous ten miles of the grade, as the same is received and cost price certified to by the engineer in charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">Appellants\u2019 position is that the power of attorney to Miller by appellants limited the agent, and that he exceeded his powers in the stipular tian that his principals agreed to pay for each ten miles of the road as received and certified by the engineer in charge. To support this contention they present the following clause of the power of attorney: \u201cAnd in consideration of the premises and the contract for the grading of said road to be entered into by our said attorney, we hereby agree and obligate ourselves respectively to secure our subscriptions heretofore or hereafter made for the grading and extension of the aforesaid road by good and sufficient bankable security, to be approved by and \u2022made payable to Moore, Foster &amp; Co., bankers, of Llano, Texas', to hold in trust and to enable them to guarantee the payment to such contractors, for the grading of said road, of our respective subscriptions, as follows, viz: That is to say, upon the completion of the grading of each ten miles of said railway, beginning at the town of Fredericksburg, thence to Llano town, to pay upon our said obligations respectively the sum of twenty per cent, and the remainder of such subscription, if any, to be paid upon the completion of said grading of said railroad to said town of Llano, provided said grading of said road be completed to said town of Llano on or before the first day of January. A, D. 1890.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Appellants insist that this clause in the power relates to the payment to be made to the contractors on completion of each ten miles of the grading, and limits the power of the agent to make only such contract. We think it relates to payment to be made on the subscriptions they had made and that should be subsequently made,\u2014a collateral undertaking to secure the amount subscribed in order to enable Moore, Foster <em>&amp; </em>Co., bankers, to guarantee payment to the contractors. This is the construction placed upon the clause in the power by the Supreme Court in answer to question certified to that court. Sullivan v. Miller, 86 Texas, 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\">The defendants below did not pay twenty per cent of the amount for constructing the ten miles of road. They paid $2700. Twenty per cent of the amount of cost of construction of the ten miles would be over $4200.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Appellants say this court erred in allowing remittitur of $1579.50, because the contract the agent undertook to make was not severable and could not be adopted in part and repudiated in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The items for the work were distinct\" and were to be paid for in distinct stated prices; the clearing and grubbing was a separate undertaking, for which appellants, by the terms of the contract, were to pay $15 per acre. The amount remitted by this court was the exact amount sued for for clearing and grubbing, the exact and only amount proved, and \u2022 the exact amount recovered by the judgment of the lower court for that item. The contractors built and completed ten miles of the grading in full compliance with the terms of the contract, from Fredericksburg north, which, at contract price for the various items of work, amounted to $22,704.09, from which deduct the $2700 paid and the $1579.50 for clearing and grubbing, and the amount obtained is the amount for which the judgment of the lower court should have been, and for which we allowed the judgment to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We think the remittitur was properly allowed, it being certainly ascertained from the contract, the proof of performance and the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Other grounds for rehearing need not be noticed, none of them should be sustained, and the motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Opinion delivered November-18, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Chief Justice Fisher did not sit in trial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
