We think, under the circumstances, the court failed to properly charge the jury. When services are performed at the request of a party, the law will imply a promise to pay the reasonable value thereof, unless such request be made, and acceded to, as a gratuitous favor. \u201cThat the service for which plaintiff seeks to recover was done under an implied promise that he should be paid for it, may be rebutted by evidence that the relation between the parties were such as to exclude the inference that they were dealing on a footing of contract.\u201d Carter v. Cobner, 76 N. Y., 157; Moyer\u2019s Appeal, 112 Penn. St., 290; 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In Taylor v. Deseve, 81 Texas, 246, the court says, \u201cIt is a settled principle of law that a promise to pay will not be implied contrary to the intention of the parties.\u201d Citing Lippman v. Tittman, 31 Mo., 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">If at the time the services were performed by plaintiff in error, it was not the intention of the parties that charges should be made for such services, then defendant in error would not be liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">As the law applicable to the facts of the case was not given to the jury in the charge of the court, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
