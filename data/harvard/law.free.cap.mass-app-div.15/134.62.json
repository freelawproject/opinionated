The Court found the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201cThe Court finds that the Plaintiff, Samuel N. Freedman, d.b.a. Pioneer Supply Company, and the Defendant were both engaged in the retail sales of household articles at homes in Western Massachusetts and employ \u2014 agents to solicit business from house to house; that on or about July 24, 1947, the Plaintiff ordered 100 \u2018Mirro-Matic\u2019 pressure cookers from the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company of Wisconsin; and that on or about July 23,1947, 100 \u2018Mirro-Matic\u2019 pressure cookers were shipped by the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company and bill of lading was forwarded to the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">The Court finds that at that time the Plaintiff became the owner of the pressure cookers.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">On or about August 4, 1947, the pressure cookers arrived at the Spring-field Freight Office of the Boston and Maine Railroad and the Railroad delivered the cookers to the Sheldon Transfer Company for delivery. However, instead of delivering the pressure cookers to the Plaintiff, the Sheldon Transfer Company delivered the pressure cookers to the Defendant\u2019s Place of business, where a servant of the Defendant paid the freight bill. Previously, on or about July 15, 1947, the Defendant had placed an order with the aforesaid Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company of Wisconsin for 250 pressure cookers, and when the delivery of 100 pressure cookers was made to the Defendant, the Defendant, in good faith assumed that it was a part of the order which it had placed with the aforesaid Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company. The 100 \u2018Mirro-Matic\u2019 pressure cookers were each wrapped separately in a large, cardboard carton, on the outside of which appeared large advertising of the \u2018Mirro-Matic\u2019 pressure cooker, and on a corner of each was of a white slip of paper bearing the name and address of the Plaintiff. At the time of the delivery of these pressure cookers to the Defendant, about 50 of the cookers were taken by salesmen of the Defendant and disposed of to various customers. The remaining pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>cookers were left in the cartons and placed in the basement of the Defendant\u2019s store, and shortly thereafter were disposed of in the usual course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">On or about August 27, 1947, the Plaintiff learned from the Boston and Maine Railroad that the pressure cookers had been delivered to the Defendant through error, and immediately made a legal demand upon the Defendant for the delivery of the pressure cookers. However, the Defendant had already disposed of the pressure cookers and was unable to comply with the demand. The Alnminnm \u25a0 Goods Manufacturing Company extended a credit to the Plaintiff which was subsequently applied by him to a delivery of 100 pressure cookers which was made to him on or about September 12, 1947. The Defendant paid the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company for the disputed 100 pressure cookers on or about September 2, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Court finds that the use of the property by the Defendant was by mistake and in good faith and is not a conversion of the Plaintiff\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The plaintiff seasonably presented <em>inter alla </em>the following requests, all of which were denied as contrary to the facts found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201c(1) The evidence warrants a finding for the Plaintiff under Count 1 of his amended declaration. (2) The evidence does not warrant a finding for the Defendant under Count 1 of the Plaintiff\u2019s amended declaration. (3) The evidence warrants a finding for the Plaintiff under Count 2 of his amended declaration. (4) The evidence does not warrant a finding for the Defendant under Count 2 of the Plaintiff \u2019s amended declaration. (5) The evidence warrants a finding for the Plaintiff under Count 3 of his amended declaration. (6) The evidence does not warrant a finding for the Defendant under Count 3 of the Plaintiff\u2019s amended, declaration. (7) The evidence warrants a finding for the Plaintiff under Count 4 of his amended declaration. (8) The evidence does not warrant a finding for the Defendant under Count 4 of the Plaintiff\u2019s amended declaration. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The grievances claimed by the plaintiff are the denial of his requests numbered 1 to 8 inclusive, and ruling* by the court that the use of the property by the. defendant is not a conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">The evidence showed, and the Trial Court found, that upon delivery to the carrier by the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company of the shipment of pressure cookers on July 23, 1947, the plaintiff became the owner of those pressure cookers. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 21, 4(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The receiving and sale of the plaintiff\u2019s property by the defendant would usually constitute a conversion. The Trial Court found, or rather ruled, that since the defendant\u2019s use of the pressure cookers was by mistake and in good faith, there was no conversion. This ruling in our opinion was prejudicial error. <em>Row v. Home Savings Bank, </em>306 Mass. 522, 525 and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In its brief the defendant concedes that neither good faith nor mistake by themselves are a defense to a charge of conversion, but it contends that it was induced by the plaintiff into using the pressure cookers, and that this released it from liability. In support of this position the defendant cites the case of <em>Hills v. Suell, </em>104 Mass. 173. That case is undoubtedly good law, but it is easily distinguishable in that there is no evidence reported in the case at bar that the railroad company or the transfer company had any authority to deliver the goods to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We have been unable, also, to find in the report any evidence to sustain the plea of accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Since in our view of the case there must be a new trial, we need not consider the Trial Court\u2019s refusal to give the plaintiff\u2019s first eight requests, all of which are based upon the amended declaration, of which no statement is included in the report. Hew trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
