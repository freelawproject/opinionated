The defendant borrowed the money for the purpose of financing the purchase that day of an automobile for the price of $1,380. To secure the loan the plaintiff on January 5, 1949, took- a chattel mortgage . on the automobile. Pursuant to the. terms of said mortgage the automobile was insured by- the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>against theft and damage. The policy provided that \u201cany loss\u201d thereunder was \u201cpayable as interest may appear\u201d to the defendant and the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\">The defendant\u2019s note, above referred to, in so far as is material, in substance provided that if any installment therein mentioned was not paid when due, then the entire unpaid balance \u2014 at the option of the holder of the note became immediately due and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The evidence reported, further tended to show the defendant failed to pay the first installment Avhich became due and payable on February 5, 1949. On February 12, 1949, the defendant informed the plaintiff\u2019s loan manager that the mortgaged automobile had just been stolen. The plaintiff\u2019s loan manager told the defendant that the first installment on the note was overdue and asked the defendant to pay it. The defendant refused to pay the overdue installment and said that \u201che would not make any payment on the note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On or about March 1, 1949, the said automobile was discovered in a badly damaged condition, in Providence, Rhode Island. On March 11, 1949, the plaintiff notified the defendant that \u201cit had repossessed the automobile and that the defendant could regain possession thereof by paying $859. plus expenses of repossession,\u201d and that \u201cif the full balance were not paid the automobile Avould be sold. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The report further states that there was evidence that shortly after recovery of the automobile the plaintiff entered into negotiations with the insurer on the question of how much the insurer should pay under the terms of the policy above mentioned. \u201cThe estimated cost of repairs to' the automobile was $515.25. Though the plaintiff tried to persuade the insurer to pay as damages an amount which\u2018would approximate the face of the note, the insurer 'refused' to pay'inore than said estimated cost of repairs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>On May 16, 1949, the plaintiff received from the insurer of the automobile a check, payable to the plaintiff, in the sum of $515.25, in settlement of its claim for damages thereto, and applied this sum in reduction of the defendant\u2019s loan. Though his assent to the said settlement had been requested by the insurer prior thereto, the defendant refused to give his approval thereof. On July 8, 1949, the plaintiff sold the automobile for a price of $560. This price was made up of $45. cash, plus cancellation of a bill for repairs on said automobile in the amount of $515. The plaintiff applied the net proceeds in reduction of the balance due on the defendant\u2019s loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">The report further sets forth that there was evidence tending to show that \u201cat the time the automobile was purchased by the defendant on January 5, 1949, for a price of $1,380., it had a market value of $900. At the time of its sale on July 8, 1949, said automobile had a market value of between $500. and $600. Between the dates of such purchase and sale there was a very substantial decline in the market values of all used cars,\u201d that during this period \u201cthe bottom dropped out of the used-car market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">On July 26, 1949, the plaintiff received from the insurer of the automobile a return premium in the amount of $38.22, which it \u201capplied in further reduction of the defendant\u2019s loan,\u201d and this brought the unpaid balance on the note to $312.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">It also appears from the report that the court found specially as follows: \u2014 \u201cI find that the plaintiff did not protect defendant\u2019s interest in making settlement with insurance company. I find that at time defendant\u2019s car was stolen it was worth at least as much as the balance due on the note. I find that under theft policy the plaintiff should have collected value of car when it was stolen. I find that in settling with insuran\u00f3e company for $515., the plaintiff did not protect defendant\u2019s interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>It further appears from the court\u2019s comment in treating the defendant\u2019s request number 4 that it found \u201cthe plaintiff did not use diligence in settling claim with insurance company,\u201d and further, in dealing with the defendant\u2019s request number 5 the court ruled that the plaintiff \u201cwas obliged to use reasonable diligence in protecting defendant\u2019s interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff duly filed fourteen requests for rulings. Seven of these requests were granted and therefore need not be considered. It is familiar law that ordinarily a party cannot complain of rulings granted at his request. <em>Korb v. American Carpet Cleaning Co., </em>301 Mass. 317, 318; <em>Noble v. American Express Company, </em>234 Mass. 536, 539; <em>Deyrmanjian v. Palais, </em>311 Mass. 553, 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The plaintiff claims \u201cto be aggrieved by the refusal of the court to grant its requests for rulings numbered 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14, and by the ruling given by the court in connection with its denial of the fifth request. \u201d It is to the court\u2019s treatment of these requests that our review is confined. We cannot accept the invitation of the parties to consider the case at large. <em>Reid v. Doherty, </em>273 Mass. 388; <em>Armburg v. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>276 Mass. 418, 428; <em>Langdoc v. Gevaert Co. of America, Inc., </em>315 Mass. 8, 11, 12; <em>Sreda v. Kessel, </em>310 Mass. 588,. 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">At the argument before this division the plaintiff conceded, and we think rightly so, that- requests numbered 8, 11, 12 and 13 were rendered immaterial by the special finding that the -sale of the automobile \u201cwas proper.\u201d They were rightly denied. <em>Wilson v. Birkenbush, </em>305 Mass. 173, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">There\" is no error in the court\u2019s treatment of request numbered 4. \" \".This request and the court\u2019s disposition of it Is as follows: \u201cSettlement by the plaintiff of its claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>against the insure]1 and application of the proceeds in reduction of the defendant\u2019s loan did not prejudice or affect any rights of the defendant with respect to the insurer. <em>Disposition: </em>\u2018No. I find that the plaintiff did not use diligence in settling claim with insurance company. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">It is obvious that this request was also rendered immaterial by the special finding relating to its disposition and therefore was rightly denied. <em>Wilson v. Birkenbush, </em>305 Mass. 173, 175. Furthermore, this request deals with only a \u201cfragment\u201d of the evidence, not decisive as matter of law of the case, and for this reason also was properly denied. <em>Barnes v. Berkshire St. Ry., </em>281 Mass. 47, 50, 52; <em>Tookmanian v. Fanning, </em>308 Mass. 162, 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Bequest numbered 5, and its treatment by the court is as follows: \u2014 \u201cIt was not the duty of the plaintiff to commence legal action against the insurer in an effort to obtain a larger settlement of its claim. <em>Disposition: </em>\u2018No. The plaintiff was obliged to use reasonable diligence in protecting defendant\u2019s interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">This request was also rightly denied. It is apparent from the court\u2019s comment in denying this request that it correctly stated the law applicable to all the facts found by the court in its special findings. The trial judge was not required to single out a fragment of the evidence, not decisive as matter of law and deal with it by itself. <em>Barnes v. Berkshire St. Ry., supra; Tookmanian v. Fanning, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The plaintiff has no legal grievance because of the court\u2019s denial of his request numbered 14, which reads as follows: \u201cOn all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d It was possible to make requests containing specifications touching the points argued by the plaintiff, and there was no compliance with Buie 28 of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston (1940). <em>Wainwright v. Jackson, </em>291 Mass. 100, 101, 102; <em>Magrath v. Sheehan, </em>296 Mass. 263, 264; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Duralith Corp. v. Leonard, </em>274 Mass. 397, 400; <em>Dellamano v. Francis, </em>308 Mass. 502, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">What has been said disposes of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged grievances that have been reported by the trial judge. Since no error appears from the court\u2019s treatment of the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings it follows that an order be entered of report dismissed. But it may be useful in passing that order to point out that from what appears in the plaintiff\u2019s brief, its real desire is to have the correctness of the general finding reviewed by this division. Such a review is not permissible on the report which is before us. It is well settled that the correctness of a general finding made upon oral evidence by a judge hearing a case without a jury cannot be brought before an Appellate Court for determination by an exception or claim of report taken after the trial has ended, and this is true although the finding contains an implied ruling that it was warranted on the evidence. There must be a separation of facts from the law in order to determine if a general finding was permissible in accordance with the law on the facts found. Unless the facts are found, or it is agreed as to what they are, and the matter is submitted as- a question of law, the Appellate Court will not review whether a general finding is permissible. <em>Stowell v. H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>288 Mass. 555; <em>Carney v. Cold Spring Brewing Co., </em>304 Mass. 392; <em>Lakeville v. Cambridge, </em>307 Mass. 433; <em>Sreda v. Kessel, </em>310 Mass. <em>588; Langdoc v. Gevaert Co. of America, </em>315 Mass. 8, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The rule is well established that a claim of report to a general finding does not raise the question whether it is warranted upon all the evidence. <em>Baker v. Davis, </em>299 Mass. 345; <em>Looby v. Looby, </em>303 Mass. 391. Where, as here, the alleged grievance is one set up, for the first time, in the plaintiff\u2019s brief, it follows that the question whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>general finding is warranted is not before us. However, despite the fact that the plaintiff saved no rights as to the correctness of the general finding, nevertheless we may point out that we have examined the alleged grievances pertaining to the general finding and have come to the conclusion that even if the alleged errors had been properly saved, the general finding was warranted and no error appears relating thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
