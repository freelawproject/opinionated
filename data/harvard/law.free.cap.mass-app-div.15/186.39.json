J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Alx\">This is an action of contract or tort in which the plaintiff seeks to recover for alleged injury to her person, alleged to have resulted from the negligence on the part of the defendant in his professional treatment of the plaintiff in the course of his practice as a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The report in this case is rather voluminous as to the evidence. It is not necessary for the purpose of this decision to report it in detail. Suffice to state that the plaintiff consulted the defendant in his professional capacity as a physician in order to have her ears perforated so that she might wear earrings. The ears became infected and the Court found that the defendant was negligent in the use of the electric needle. The trial judge made, in part, the following specific findings of fact<em>. </em>\u2018 The defendant undertook to pierce the lobes of both ears. He used an electric needle. He was negligent in the use of the needle and as a result of his negligence the lobes of the plaintiff\u2019s ears were damaged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">While in the usual case, questions of negligence and contributory negligence are primarily questions of fact over which this Division has no right of review, <em>Ashapa v. Reed, </em>280 Mass. 514, yet this case presents features outside the scope of the usual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The defendant has presented certain requests for rulings of law which were denied by the Court, namely, requests Nos. 2 and 3. Request <em>,#2 </em>is as follows: \u201c (2) In the case at bar the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>has np application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">By the denial of this request the Court in effect has ruled that the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>applies in this case, with the result that the burden has been thrown on the defendant to rebut this <em>prima facie </em>case made out by the plaintiff in accordance with this legal principle. The Court has in substance ruled that the mere fact of injury has made out a case of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In the case of <em>Semerjian v. Stetson, </em>284 Mass. 510, an action was brought against a physician for alleged negligence in treating the plaintiff\u2019s eye, the plaintiff subsequently having lost the sight of the eye. The Court at page 514 said, \u201cThe mere fact that pain, inflammation and an ulcer in the plaintiff\u2019s eye followed the operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>did not justify the inference of want of proper care and skill on the part of the doctor or warrant the conclusion that the conditions were the result of the doctor\u2019s negligence.\u201d As the.Court said at page 515, \u201cThe doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>is not applicable where as here the common knowledge or experience of men is not extensive enough to permit it to be said that the plaintiff\u2019s condition would not have existed except for negligence of the persons charged.\u201d See <em>King v. Belmore, </em>248 Mass. 108 at 114; <em>Boston v. Fountain, </em>267 Mass. 196 at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">In <em>Ernen v. Crofwell, </em>272 Mass. 172, which was a case involving a certain hypodermic needle inserted in the plaintiff\u2019s mouth by the defendant, the Court said at page 175, \u201cIt is plain that the mere breaking of the needle inserted in the plaintiff\u2019s jaw was not evidence of neglig-ence.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The trial judge also denied request No. 3, which was as follows: \u201c (3) The mere fact that the plaintiff sustained a bad result as a result of the perforation of her ears is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. <em>Semerjian v. Stetson, </em>284 Mass. 510.\u201d The Court by denying such request has gone so far as to rule that the mere fact that the plaintiff suffered an unsatisfactory result from the operation was evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. Such a ruling would place an intolerable burden upon the medical profession in the treatment of cases. It would in effect, hold that the doctor operated at his peril. If the result were unsatisfactory then he would be to blame. It would not be difficult to imagine the reluctance with which any surgeon would perform an operation if such a rule were followed. The doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>could not be extended so far as a matter of public policy. It would make the physician an insurer of the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In <em>Zarrillo v. Stone, </em>317 Mass. 510 at 511, the Court said, \u201cAnd the mere happening of the accident would not warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Even if we are to assume that there are facts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>would justify a finding of negligence by the Court, the defendant is entitled as of right to know the rules of law which the judge employed in arriving at his conclusion in instructing himself as jury. In a jury case his instructions are a matter of open record for all to examine. However, in a jury-waived case, the only method by which we can determine the principles of law which the judge applied is by his action of requests for rulings of law. See <em>Bangs v. Fair, </em>209 Mass. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">It is clear that the judge erred in the denial of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings of law Nos. 2 and 3. It must be presumed that his action of these requests became the law which he adopted on arriving at his conclusion. Even if the trial judge disbelieved the testimony of the defendant, such disbelief does not furnish affirmative evidence to the contrary. <em>Good v. Lothrop, </em>266 Mass. 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">We are therefore of opinion that the Court erred in its disposition of requests Nos. 2 and 3 of the defendant and it is ordered that the finding for $4000. in favor of the plaintiff be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\">Statement of the ownership, management, circulation, etc., required by the Act of Congress, of August 24, 1912 as amended by the Acts of March 3, 1933 and July 2, 1946, of Massachusetts Appellate Division Reports published bimonthly at Boston, Mass., for October 1, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">State of Massachusetts, County of Suffolk \u2014 ss.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Before me, a Notary Public in and for the State and county aforesaid, personally appeared A.
