He continued to reside there with his family until the 6th of July 1853, when he was arrested for an offence, and, failing to recognize with sureties for his appearance at the ensuing term of the court of common pleas, was committed to the jail in Plymouth.

His wife and some of his children have continued to live upon his place in Rochester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">This case was argued at Taunton at October term 1858.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-9\"><em>L. F. </em>Brigham, (District Attorney,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlFQ\">As the pauper\u2019s family lived upon his freehold estate in Rochester, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>occasional and enforced absences from it did not prevent his acquiring a settlement in that town.

Sts. <em>c. </em>45, \u00a7 1, by having that estate and living on it three years successively ; for he was supported as a pauper before he had lived three years on his estate. It is settled that no part of the time during which a person receives support or aid as a pauper can be computed as part of the three years. <em>East Sudbury </em>v. <em>Sudbury, </em>12 Pick. 1. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>21 Pick. 236. <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>12 Met. 35. <em>Judgment for the defendants for costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
