Holmes, a material witness for the defendant. The verdict was for the plaintiffs, and <em>Mellen, </em>C. J. signed a bill of exceptions, the material part of which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-11\">\u201c Some of the witnesses answered on cross-examination in such a manner as to leave the impression that Holmes\u2019s bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>reputation was confined in part, if not entirely, to his promises to pay his debts. On a reexamination of .one of these witnesses, by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, he proposed questions for the purpose of showing that Holmes\u2019s reputation was not confined to such promises to pay. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to this inquiry; and the court sustained the objection, and refused to allow the questions on the reexamination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">\u201c On the direct examination of the next witness as to character, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel inquired of him, what was the general reputation of said Holmes for truth and veracity ; and the witness answered, it was not good. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then inquired, if such reputation related wholly or in part to sail Holmes\u2019s want of punctuality in the payment of his debts. To this question the defendant\u2019s counsel objected as incompetent ; but the court allowed the question to be put to this and several subsequent witnesses, and the same was answered by the witnesses. To this ruling the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-6\"><em>F. H. Dewey &amp; E.
