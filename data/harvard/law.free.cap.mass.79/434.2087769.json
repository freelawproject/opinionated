That the plaintiffs never \u201c furnished to the defendant sufficient, due and proper preliminary proofs of the death of the said Andrew Taylor, and of the time, circumstances and occasion of his said death, if the same occurred, nor any such as by law and usage in such case are reasonably required and by the terms of said policy provided for.\u201d 2d. That Andrew Taylor had not conformed to and performed the conditions and requirements of the policy, \u201c for that the said Taylor, at the time of his said death, as claimed by the plaintiff, was on board the steamship Sierra Nevada on her passage from San Juan del Sur in the Republic of Nicaragua, Central America, to San Francisco, California, as a steerage passenger, and not as a first class passenger, by reason of which, and the unusual hazards incident to a steerage passage, the defendants are discharged from any liability to the plaintiff on account of the death of said Taylor as claimed by the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">The parties submitted the case to the court upon the following agreed statement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">\u201c Upon the first ground of defence stated in the answer, it is admitted by the plaintiff that no affidavit or certificate of the attending physician, as to the circumstances and occasion of the death of Andrew Taylor, was ever furnished to the defendants ; although the plaintiff was informed, at the time he gave the notice and furnished certain other proofs of such death, that the defendants held such certificate or affidavit to be essential, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>that, until furnished, the proof would not be considered complete, nor the loss payable. It is admitted that the ship\u2019s physician was present and attending during the sickness and at the time of the death of said Taylor; and the plaintiff offers no excuse for not furnishing such certificate, except the inconvenience and expense of sending to the Pacific Coast to obtain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">\u201c The defendants admit that notice and proofs of the fact of the death of said Andrew Taylor were furnished to them by the plaintiff on the 10th of February 1856, which were deficient only by reason of the absence of such certificate or affidavit of the attending physician; and the defendants claim that by the terms and reasonable intendment of the contract, and by the usage and understanding of this and other life insurance companies, such affidavit or certificate is a requisite and essential part of the preliminary proof, to be supplied by parties demanding the \u00e1mount of the policy, under the circumstances aforesaid, and without which no recovery can be had by suit at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Upon the second ground of defence, stated in the answer the plaintiff admits that the said Andrew Taylor was on board the said steamship Sierra Nevada, \u2018 as a steerage passenger.\u2019 And the defendants admit that in no other respect did the said Andrew Taylor fail to conform to and perform the requirements and conditions of said policy and the license thereto attached. But the defendants claim that said license, by its terms and reasonable intendment, and by the understanding and usage of this and other life insurance companies, requires the party whose life is insured, when taking passage in a vessel, such as is indicated by said license, to do so as a first class passenger, and that said requirements are broken and departed from by taking passage as a <em>\u2018 </em>steerage passenger; \u2019 and that if it had been known that he was to go as a steerage passenger, the defendants would, according to such Understanding and usage, have either charged a much higher rate for such license, or declined to give it altogether.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Upon the foregoing statement, it is agreed mat the court shall enter such judgment as either party may be entitled to, and as law and justice require; it being understood and provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>however, that if the court shall be of opinion that proof of such understanding and usage as the defendants allege would be competent and material to the proper decision of the controversy, the case shall be remitted to the proper court for trial of such questions by a jury; and further, that if the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff ought not to recover without furnishing the affidavit or certificate of the physician, he shall be allowed the opportunity to obtain and supply the same, or a sufficient excuse for its absence, with the same effect upon this suit as if furnished originally, except that such equitable adjustment of the costs or interest shall be made upon the final result, as the court may direct.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-5\"><em>J.

By the terms of the policy, the sum insured was payable in ninety days <em>\u201c </em>after due notice and proof of the death \u201d of Andrew Taylor. Such notice and proof were therefore prerequisite to the maintenance of this action. The defendants, in their answer, deny that they were furnished by the plaintiff with such proof. They admit, however, in the statement of facts, that there was no defect in the proof of said Taylor\u2019s death, unless, in order to constitute due proof thereof, it was necessary to produce a sworn certificate, such as is hereinafter mentioned, of the physician who attended the deceased in his last sickness. The ground taken by the defendants is, that such certificate is a requisite and essential part of the pre liminary proof of the death, and made so, not only by the terms and reasonable intendment of the contract contained in the policy, but also by their own usage and understanding, and the usage and understanding of other life insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">To support this ground of defence, the defendants have introduced (the plaintiff\u2019s counsel consenting) a pamphlet issued by them, which they were accustomed to give to claimants on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>policies, and which, it is admitted by the plaintiff, was given to him by the defendants at the time when he presented to them his proof of Andrew Taylor\u2019s death. Under the head of \u201c Proofs of Death Required,\u201d that pamphlet contained, among other required proofs, the following: \u201c 1st. A certificate from the physician who attended the party during his last sickness, stating particularly the nature of the disease, its duration, and the time of death.\u201d It was also a part of said required proof that the certificate <em>\u201c </em>should be sworn to before a magistrate or other officer qualified to administer an oath or affirmation.\u201d As this matter is not contained in the statement of facts, we have taken it into consideration solely upon the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that we might. But, .after adding this to the facts regularly agreed upon, we find no defence to the action. The policy does not embody nor refer to any by-law, requisition, usage or understanding of the defendants as to the kind of proof, which they should require, of the death of Andrew Taylor. Whatever, therefore, might be such by-law, requisition, usage or understanding, the plaintiff would not be bound thereby. He is bound only by the policy itself; that is, to furnish \u201c due proof\u201d of the death. If the defendants would have bound the plaintiff by their by-laws, &amp;c. they should have made the policy, in terms, subject to those by-laws, &amp;c. or in some way have made them a part of the contract contained in the policy. <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>New England Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>8 Cush. 393, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The question, what is due proof, is to be determined by the court, according to the rules of evidence, and not by the defendants nor by any other life insurance companies. We are not informed what proof of death was presented to the defendants, and it is not necessary that we should know; for it is conceded by them that the proof was sufficient, if the physician\u2019s certificate was not a requisite part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The usage of the defendants to require certain specified proof of death has been relied on in argument. In the first place, no such usage is duly shown. In the next place, if it were so shown, there is no pretence that the plaintiff had any notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>it when he took the policy. He therefore, for that reason, if for no other, could not be bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>2 </em>No authority was cited which sustains the position that Andrew Taylor, by taking passage as a steerage passenger, failed to conform to the license given to him by the defendants, to pass by sea in first class decked vessels, of which the steamship in which he took passage is admitted to be one. And the court do not know, judicially or otherwise, that life is less safe in the steerage, than in any other apartment of a vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
