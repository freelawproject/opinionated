The debtor who made the arrangement with the master testified that he did not understand that he was to give notice to said Lamb when the parties were ready, but understood that said Lamb was to be at his office at the appointed time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">The defendant objected to the recognizance, that it did not show any sufficient cause for taking it; and that it did not appear where or before whom the debtors were to deliver themselves up for examination, and that it was otherwise informal and defective; but the court overruled the objection.

He took the examination, administered the oath, and granted the certificate. <em>St. </em>1857, c. 141. The creditor had full and proper opportunity to be heard, having had due notice of the day fixed for the examination, and of the adjournment. His rights have not been' infringed. The debtors acted in good faith. <em>Niles </em>v. Hancock, 3 Met. 568.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\"><em>2. </em>The recognizance is not in conformity with the requirements of law. It does not recite a sufficient cause of its caption. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>9 Mass. 520. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Daggett, 16 Mass. 447. It does not state that the debtors desired to take the oath for the relief of poof debtors. <em>St. </em>1857, <em>c. </em>141, \u00a7\u00a7 4,10.

The debtors were bound to procure a magistrate competent to direct the examination, at the time and place when and where the creditor was cited to appear. <em>St. </em>1857, c. 141, \u00a7\u00a7 7,10. The creditor\u2019s attorney was watching for the appearance of the magistrate, and in repeated attendance at the place appointed, during the whole appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>hour. After that hour, the magistrate, not having appeared, ceased to have jurisdiction of the case. <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>6 Gray, 254. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 Cush. 455. <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>14 N.

The recognizance was properly taken, and in precise conformity with the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQW\">The debtors were bound, under the recognizance, to procure the attendance of a proper magistrate qualified by law to take the examination and grant the discharge, if they would discharge themselves from the obligation they had as- \u25a0 sumed, \u201c that within ninety days from the time of their arrest they will deliver themselves up for examination, giving notice thereof as in the statute is provided, and shall make no default at any time fixed for their examination.\u201d During the period of time at which, by force of the notice, the judgment creditor was bound to appear before the magistrate, neither Mr. Lamb, who gave the notice, nor any substitute, was present to hear the examination. The creditor appeared within the hour, thus mani festing his purpose to oppose the discharge, and having done so, and no magistrate appearing, no further proceedings could properly be had upon that notice, and he may now object to the same as invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">We perceive no objection to the form of the recognizance, and find stated in its recitals the cause of its being taken, and all that is necessary to its validity. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
