A trial was had before the sheriff, who certified to the court of common pleas the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">The record of the mayor and aldermen showed that the easterly line of the location of Orange Street passed under the petitioner\u2019s house in such a way as to cut off the southwest corner of the house to the depth of three feet and ten inches, and running thence to a point in the northwest corner, and contained this provision: \u201cAs a corner of said Willard Brown\u2019s house comes within the location of Orange Street as herein described, the location is made with the understanding that the said Brown is to have the privilege to have his house remain as it is, and not to be required to remove it until he, his heirs or assigns have occasion to rebuild or remove it, and no longer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">The petitioner called James S. Woodworth, a witness qualified to testify on this subject, and asked him \u201c if he had made an estimate of the expense of moving the dwelling-house of Brown eastwardly from off said location, so far as it would be necessary to have it moved in consequence of the laying out of said Orange Street.\u201d But the sheriff, at the request of the respondents, excluded the evidence; on the ground that Brown, by the provision in the location, had the right to have his house remain as it was, and, not being required by law to move it, was not entitled to any damages for removing it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">Orange Street extended from Plymouth Street on the south to Park Street on the north, at the corner of which was the petitioner\u2019s land. The respondents contended that the petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>before the location, had dedicated to the public the land over which the street was located; and also, by certain conveyances of house lots on the east side of the street, \u201c had obligated himself to his grantees to throw out into said Orange Street, as a part of said street, all that portion of his land covered by the location ; \u201d and, to sustain this last position, offered in evidence two deeds from the petitioner; one to James A. Whipple, of a lot of land next south of the petitioner\u2019s land, and on the same side of Orange Street, described as \u201c lying on the southeasterly side of Orange Street,\u201d \u201c with a right of way in said Orange Street; \u201d and the other to Stephen Bartlett, of the lot of land next south of Whipple\u2019s, described as \u201c lying on the southeasterly side of Orange Street,\u201d \u201c with a right of way in said Orange Street to Park Street; said Orange Street to be thirty seven feet wide from Plymouth Street to\u201d the northwesterly corner of Whipple\u2019s land. It was agreed that, at the time of the conveyances to Whipple and Bartlett, Orange Street, which was then and down to the time of this location a private street, was thirty-feet wide at its junction with Park Street, and gradually widened until it reached the north line of the land conveyed to Whipple, and thence continued of the width of thirty seven feet to Plymouth Street. By this location, no part of the land of Whipple and Bartlett was taken; but a strip of land claimed by the petitioner, extending from Whipple\u2019s land to Park Street, of the width of four feet at the south end, and three feet on Park Street, was taken, which strip of land had always been inclosed and occupied by the petitioner. The petitioner objected to the introduction of the deeds to Whipple and Bartlett; but the objection was overruled, and the deeds were read to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">The respondents were permitted, against the petitioner\u2019s objection, to introduce the testimony of Bartlett and Whipple to statements of the petitioner in conversation with them, before and at the time of said conveyances, that he should not throw out this strip of land into the street then, but should \u201c eventually throw it out all the way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">Upon these points, the sheriff instructed the jury \u201c that if they were satisfied that the petitioner, in his deeds to Whipple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and Bartlett, fixed the east line of Orange Street four feet further east than the line was before he made his conveyances to Whipple and Bartlett, they are entitled to have that line extended to Park Street, cutting off four feet of said Brown\u2019s land all the way, and widening the street to that extent, and that under such circumstances said Brown ought not to recover of the city for the land taken by the city, provided that no more than the four feet was taken.\u201d The petitioner excepted to this instruction, and requested that the jury be instructed \u201c that if Brown, in his deeds to Bartlett and Whipple, fixed the east line of Orange Street, in front of their lots, and as the street extended south to Plymouth Street, four feet further east than it was before, it did not follow that they had the right to have the east line fixed four feet further east on that part of Orange Street extending in the other direction towards Park Street; \u201d which instruction the sheriff declined to give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">The respondents also contended that the petitioner had waived all his claim to damages, and offered evidence that at the meetings of the mayor and aldermen, when the subject of locating Orange Street was under consideration, it was stated that the petitioner claimed no damages; but there was conflicting evidence whether the petitioner was present when this statement was made. The respondents also offered the testimony of one of the aldermen, that at these meetings he never heard the petitioner make any claim for damages. The petitioner objected to evidence of any statement made at meetings of the mayor and aldermen, unless it appeared that he was present; but the sheriff admitted the evidence; and ruled that the petitioner was not to be affected by any statements not made in his presence and hearing; and instructed the jury \u201cthat they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a waiver of damages was made by Brown himself, or by some one authorized by him to make it, and that it applied to the location established by the decree, or it could not avail to cut off his claim to damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the respondents, which was accepted by the court of common pleas, and the petitioner appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>This case was argued at Worcester at October term 1858.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-5\"><em>F.

Sts. <em>c. </em>24; <em>St. </em>1848, <em>c. </em>98; to the point that the petitioner, by the terms of his deeds, had bound himself to throw the piece of land in question into the highway, <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>17 Mass. 413 ; and to the point that the declarations of the petitioner to Bartlett and Whipple were admissible to prove a waiver of damages, <em>White </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, 2 </em>Cush. 361.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-7\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfR\">In the opinion of the court this verdict must be set aside, upon various grounds of objection to the rulings of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">1. The order of the county commissioners in making the location, containing the following provision, \u201cAs a corner of said Willard Brown\u2019s house comes within the location of Orange Street as herein described, the location is made with the understanding that the said Brown is to have the privilege to have his house remain as it is, and not to be required to remove it until he, his heirs or assigns have occasion to rebuild or remove it, and no longer,\u201d does not prevent the petitioner from claiming damages for the necessary expense of removing said house, if rendered expedient by reason of such location, or for the injury to the same occasioned by the location of the road. So far as the location of this road embraced any part of this house, it was an absolute location, and might be treated as such by the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tioner, and he was entitled so to act upon it in reference to such house.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">2. The ruling of the sheriff excluding the testimony of Woodworth, as to the expense that would be incurred by a removal of such house from the limits of the newly located road, was also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">3. The deeds to Whipple and Bartlett do not show that, by these conveyances, the petitioner had obligated himself to his grantees to surrender and yield up as a part of Orange Street all that portion of his land covered by the location of this way, or that they are entitled to have a line extended to Park <em>Street, </em>cutting off four feet of Brown\u2019s land, and widening the street to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">4. The testimony of Stephen Bartlett, as to the declaration \u00f3f the petitioner when speaking of the strip of land on the east side of Orange Street, \u201c I shall not now throw it out, but I shall eventually throw it out all the way,\u201d does not show a dedication of this land to the public; nor does the testimony of James A. Whipple establish any such dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">5. As a matter of cross-examination, it was competent for the petitioner to ask a witness called by the respondents to testify to the value of the petitioner\u2019s land, what was the value of the land on the west side of Orange Street, although the jury might not before have had their attention directed to the land on that side of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">It may be proper to add, in reference to the future hearing, that it was competent for the defendants to submit to the jury any proper evidence tending to show that the petitioner had, prior to the location of the road and with a view of securing the same, waived all claim for damages to his land and buildings occasioned by such location. This must be shown affirmatively by those who rely upon it as a bar to all claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\"><em>Verdict set </em>aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
