The answer denied the plaintiff\u2019s property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the conversion; and alleged that the wood was the property of one Benson, and was attached by the defendant, being a deputy sheriff, as Benson\u2019s property, at the suit of Richard D. Rawson; and was also taken by the defendant as the agent and by the direction of Rawson, who was the owner thereof or had a lien thereon for the price.\u201d Trial before <em>Metcalf, </em>J., who signed this bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\">\u201c It appeared that on the 30th of October 1857 Rawson, being the owner of a tract of woodland situate in Douglas in this county, conveyed all the wood thereon standing to Benson by a bill of sale, which stipulated that Benson should have until the 1st of April 1859 to clear the wood and timber from the above described lot. Benson gave therefor his promissory note payable on demand, with interest, for the sum of $400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">\u201c The plaintiff offered to show that on the 17th of November 1857 Benson mortgaged said wood, which was then standing and growing on the land, to the plaintiff, to secure a preexisting debt. Evidence was offered by him that the mortgage was lost, and he then offered a writing certified by the register of deeds for the county of Worcester to be a true copy of the mortgage. It appeared from said copy, and also by the testimony of the plaintiff, that there was a subscribing witness to the mortgage; and also that the same had never been recorded in any town clerk\u2019s office. The plaintiff and Benson were both residents in Connecticut.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The defendant objected that the copy was not admissible in evidence without first calling the subscribing witness ; and further that the certificate of the register of deeds was no evidence of the copy, as the town clerk\u2019s office was the proper place to record the same, and that the plaintiff could not claim title under said mortgage, or give the same in evidence without said record. But the presiding judge admitted the copy in evidence, and ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to hold under the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">\u201c The plaintiff further offered evidence to show that on the 16th of July 1858 Benson sold to him said wood, and hauler! twenty cords of it off the lot for him, and delivered to him on R\u00e1wson\u2019s lot about one hundred cords thereof which then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>remained thereon; and that the defendant afterwards, to wit, on the 2d of September 1858, attached the same as the property <em>of </em>Benson at a suit instituted by Rawson on said note. The plaintiff testified that at time of his purchase he knew that the property was bought of Rawson, and supposed it was not paid for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">\u201c The defendant offered to show that before he took possession of said wood Benson had become insolvent; that he had never paid for the same; that the same had always remained on the land of Rawson; and that he took possession of the same as the agent of Rawson by his direction to assert his vendor\u2019s lien thereon. But the presiding judge rejected the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">\u201c The jury found for the plaintiff.

The wood sold still remaining on land of the vendor, his lien upon it for the price still existed. The enforcement of the lien is not a rescission of the contract, but a proceeding under the contract to obtain the price. <em>Arnold </em>v. Delano, 4 Cush. 33. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>15 Maine, 314. This lien would not be divested even by sale of the wood to a <em>bona fide </em>vendee; he could take no <em>greater title </em>than the seller. <em>Houlditch </em>v. <em>Desanges, </em>2 Stark. R. 337. <em>Craven </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>6 Taunt. 433. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>above cited. The lien on the remainder is not divested by part delivery. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Shadboldt, </em>1 Campb. 427. <em>Bloxam </em>v. Sanders, 4 B. &amp; C. 941. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Gorton, </em>2 Cr. &amp; M. 504. Story on Sales, \u00a7 290. Acceptance of a bill or note does not destroy the seller\u2019s lien, if the note be still in his hands; because there is an implied condition that, while the goods remain in the seller\u2019s hands, the purchaser shall keep his credit good. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Delano </em>and <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Gorton, </em>above cited. Story on Sales, \u00a7 285. In the present case, the note had become due while the property was in the seller\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-9\">2. A sale of standing wood is a sale of personal property only. <em>Claflin </em>v. Carpenter, 4 Met. 580. <em>Nettlelon </em>v. <em>Sikes, </em>8 Met. 34. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>6 Gray, 385. The instrument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>November 17th 1857 therefore could only operate as a mortgage of personal property. Delivery of the property or a record of the mortgage in the proper town clerk\u2019s office is essential, in order that property should pass by a mortgage of personalty. Rev. Sts. c. 74, \u00a7 5. <em>Travis </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>13 Met. 304. <em>Shapleigh </em>v. Wentworth, 13 Met. 358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6-\">The mortgage being improperly recorded in the registry of deeds, the certified copy from the register should not have been admitted as evidence. The principle on which a certified copy is admitted requires that it should be a certificate from an officer whose duty it was to record the original. 1 Greenl.

Bacon &amp; A. Dadmun, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZC\">1. The conveyance of the wood from Rawson to Benson included a lease of the land upon which it was, for the purpose of cutting the trees, for a time which had not exp he d when Benson sold the wood to the plaintiff, and therefore Rawson, not being in possession of the land upon which the wood was, could have no lien thereon The sale and delivery to the plaintiff, in good faith and foi a valuable consideration, before the defendant took possession to arrest Rawson\u2019s lien, would of itself terminate Rawson\u2019s right to hold the wood, if he had any. <em>Arnold </em>v. Delano, 4 Cush. 33. <em>Tansley </em>v. <em>Turner, 2 </em>Bing. N. C. 151. <em>Hurry </em>v <em>Mangles, </em>1 Campb. 452. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Synes, </em>1 Selden, 45.

It was necessary to the protection of the mortgagee, that the mortgage should be recorded in the registry of deeds; for, until severance, the wood was, for many purposes, real estate. The record copy was therefore properly admitted in evidence. As the mortgagor resided out of the Commonwealth, the mortgage could not be recorded in the office of the clerk of the town of his residence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-8\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AME\">1. The evidence offered in support of the defendant\u2019s claim to a lien as vendor of the wood was rightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>rejected. The contract of sale contemplated that the vendee should expend labor and money in felling the trees and preparing the wood for market; and the case finds that the wood had been cut by the vendee, and a portion thereof sold by him and hauled off the land. We think these facts are inconsistent with an existing right of lien in the vendor for the purchase money. We know of no case where such a right has been recognized, after the vendee has, at his own expense, in pursuance of the contract of sale, changed the character of the property, and by his own labor and money added to its value. By these acts the vendor must be deemed to have parted with his possession and control of the property. The vendee, by himself and his agents, had taken it into his actual possession, and incorporated with it the labor bestowed by him in preparing it for sale. There was therefore such a change of possession from the vendor to the vendee as to defeat any right of lien in the vendor. Upon this ground, the case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>4 Cush. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>2. </em>But on another <em>ground we </em>think the verdict must be set aside. A contract for the sale of standing wood, to be cut and carried away by the vendee, is to be construed as passing only an interest in the trees, when they are severed from the freehold. They then pass to the vendee as personal property. <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Carpenter, 4 </em>Met. 580. <em>Nettleton </em>v. <em>Sikes, </em>8 Met. 34. Under the contract in the present case the vendee acquired no interest in the land. He could not therefore convey any to the plaintiff by his mortgage. His conveyance could only operate to pass the interest which he had acquired in the trees as personal chattels. It follows that the mortgage to the plaintiff was recorded in the registry of deeds without warrant of law, and a copy of it, even if otherwise competent, was not authenticated by any officer having authority to certify it. <em>Pitcher </em>v. <em>Barrows, </em>17 Pick. 361. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>23 Pick. 84. It was not therefore competent secondary evidence of the original mortgage which was lost, and should have been excluded at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
