Preston, assistant clerk,\u201d with orders to take the body of Francis Measures named therein, and went to the house of the defendant, where said Francis lived and then actually was; that the plaintiff demanded an entrance, and being refused by the defendant, with threats of violence if he entered, broke open the door and arrested Francis, and while so in the house received from the defendant the injuries complained of; but he admitted that the force used by the defendant was not excessive if the plaintiff was unlawfully in the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-9\">When the <em>copias </em>was issued, the clerk of the court was at Lowell in said county, in attendance upon the supreme judicial court then sitting there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-10\">The defendant contended that upon this evidence the action could not be maintained, and Sanger, J., \u201c for the purpose of the trial,\u201d so ruled.

The assistant clerk of the courts in Middlesex is not elected by the people, but is appointed by this court. <em>St. </em>1851, c. 38, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">2. If the legislature can authorize the performance of such duties by a clerk not elected, they have not done so in this case. The powers conferred upon him are only to \u201c authenticate papers and perform such other duties of the clerk as shall not be performed by him, and, in case of the absence, neglect, removal, resignation or death of the clerk,\u201d to \u201c complete and attest any records remaining unfinished, and act as clerk of the courts until a new clerk be appointed and qualified.\u201d <em>St. </em>1851, <em>c. </em>38, \u00a7 2. This does not authorize him to sign original precepts, at least when the clerk is within the county and acting as clerk. And the right of the assistant to act should appear on the face of the precept.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b85-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_m\">An officer, in the execution of valid criminal process, is justifiable in breaking the outer door of a dwelling-house, after demanding admittance and being refused. This is not questioned by the defendant. The single question in this case therefore is, whether the assistant clerk had authority to sign the process in the service of which the plaintiff broke the defendant\u2019s door. If he had that authority, then that process was lawful on its face, and the plaintiff is entitled to maintain this action. The assistant clerk\u2019s authority is denied by the defendant, for the reason that, by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, \u201c all writs issuing out of the clerk\u2019s office in any of the courts of law shall \u201d (among other things) \u201c be signed by the clerk of such court.\u201d It is contended that an assistant clerk is not \u201c the clerk,\u201d within the meaning of the Constitution. But a majority of the court are of opinion that any person who is lawfully authorized to act as clerk and do the duties of clerk is the clerk \u201d who is authorized to sign writs issuing from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>clerk\u2019s office. Such is the long settled practical construction of this part of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">By <em>St. </em>1782, c. 9, establishing a supreme judicial court, it was enacted that \u201c all wilts and processes \u201d of the court should be (among other things) \u201c signed by the clerk.\u201d There was the same enactment in <em>St. </em>1782, <em>c. </em>11, establishing courts of common pleas. Yet, in the first of these statutes was this direction \u201c The justices of the supreme judicial court shall, from time to time, appoint a clerk, or clerks, to attend said court, and to record the proceedings thereof, and to do all other things which shall be by law their duty to do.\u201d And such has ever since been the statute law, till, by the recent change in the Constitution, clerks were made elective officers. <em>St. </em>1830, <em>c. </em>129. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>88. Whenever the court, by virtue of that statute law, appointed two clerks, each of them was always deemed \u201cthe clerk \u201d authorized to sign all writs and processes, and each did sign them. On the construction of the Constitution, now contended for, we do not see how any processes, so signed, were lawful. For the words \u201cthe clerk,\u201d on that construction, are not applicable to two clerks, or to either one of two rather than the other. Neither could have been \u201c the clerk,\u201d unless each was.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">When we find that, within two years after the Constitution went into operation, the legislature (of which many members had been in the convention which framed that constitution) passed the act of 1782, <em>c. </em>9, copying into it the provision of the Constitution concerning the signing of writs, and then providing for the appointment of more than one clerk, it is manifest that they could not have understood that, by the Constitution, only one person in a county could be \u201c the clerk \u201d of the court, who could rightfully sign writs and processes. The contrary is inevitably to be inferred from their legislation ; and as the construction thus given to the Constitution has been adopted and acted upon for nearly fourscore years without question, it is too late to hold otherwise now, even if we could entertain a doubt as to the construction which we should deem right, were the point now raised for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Within a few years, this court has been authorized to appoint assistant clerks, whose duties and authority are set forth in the statutes authorizing their appointment. By the act-under which the assistant clerk in this county was appointed, <em>(St. </em>1851, <em>c. </em>38,) he is authorized to \u201c authenticate papers, and perform such other duties of the clerk as shall not be performed by him ; and in case of the absence, neglect, removal, resignation or death of the clerk, may complete and attest any records remaining unfinished, and act as clerk of the courts in the said county until a new clerk be appointed and qualified.\u201d This, in our opinion, gave the assistant clerk authority to sign the process which was served by the plaintiff. The signing of it was one of the duties of the clerk, but, for a good reason, \u201c not performed by him.\u201d <em>Exceptions overruled</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
