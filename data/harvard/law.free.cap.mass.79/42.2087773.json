The defendant, upon receiving payment of this subscription, agreed that, if he should fail to erect the hotel according to the contract, he would refund all the money so paid, with interest, and would also pay <em>\u201c </em>full damages to the subscribers for their trouble and disappointment;\u201d provided that in case of his inability, by reason of death, to complete said building, his representatives should pay no damages, by reason of this original provision, beyond the sums so received by him, and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">The agreement for the subscription of $9,000 was made at the same time as the bond declared upon, and was signed by a portion only of the original subscribers and by many other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">The hotel was to have been built on the corner of Main and Pleasant Streets in the southerly part of the city of Worcester, where many of the subscribers owned real estate or transacted business.

Ethan Allen, Esq.: By your bond to me, executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>April 29th 1854, you engaged to erect a hotel on your land, corner of Main and Pleasant Streets, and complete the same on or before October 27th 1856.

Mayne on Damages, 68. The rule of construction applicable to such stipulations is now well settled. Where a party agrees to pay a certain sum in case he fails to perform any one of divers acts which are of different degrees of importance, and which are capable of being estimated and measured in money, the sum named as damages is to be treated as a penalty ; but if the contract consists of several stipulations, the damages for a breach of which cannot be well ascertained and valued, then the parties are deemed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>intended that the sum agreed on shall be treated as liquidated damages, from which there is to be no deduction. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Price, </em>13 M. &amp; W. 701, 702, and 16 M. &amp; W. 346. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Kinnier, </em>4 Exch. 783. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>17 Pick. 513. <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>23 Pick. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The case at bar clearly falls within the latter branch of this rule. The subject matter of the contract is such as to render it quite impossible to form any estimate of the damages occasioned by a breach of its stipulations. No standard by which the damages can be measured is furnished by the contract itself, nor would extrinsic evidence afford any means by which they could be accurately or even approximately ascertained. The persons who subscribed to the fund to aid the defendant in erecting a hotel were prompted to do so by the expected benefit which would thereby accrue to them respectively by enhancing the value of their real estate, and by increasing the business in that part of the city of Worcester. It is obvious that the damages which each would sustain by the loss of this anticipated benefit are peculiarly uncertain and difficult of estimation in money. This is therefore one of those cases where it must be presumed that the parties stipulated for the payment of a fixed sum of money absolutely, from the difficulty of ascertaining any exact amount of damage which would be sustained by a breach of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We have no doubt that the bond declared on was intended as a substitute for the agreement by which the defendant, on receiving the amount of the first subscription, agreed to pay damages to each of the subscribers, in case of a failure to fulfil the contract on his part. The defendant cannot therefore be held liable to the same persons on both agreements. Those only can claim damages in this action who have not settled with the defendant and released their claims, and who shall elect to waive their claims to damages under the first contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\"> Merrick, J. did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
