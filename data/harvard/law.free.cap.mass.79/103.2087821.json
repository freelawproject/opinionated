By a codicil, the testator directed his son, his heirs and assigns, to keep in good repair all that part of the dwelling-house, the improvement of which had been given to the unmarried daughter; and charged his real estate with the- support of said daughter in case the provision already made for her should prove inadequate. <em>Held, </em>that the testator\u2019s son took the estate upon condition that he should keep the house in repair; that, in case of the house being burned down, a failure to rebuild within a reasonable time was a breach of the condition; and that the facts, that the daughter had leased her part of the house to the son, and that a sublessee was in possession at the time of the fire, did not affect her right to have it repaired, nor extend the time within which that should be done.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b113-11\">T.

And if she, the said Sophia, should be brought into circumstances, that with the provision that I have already made for her she cannot support herself, I hereby charge my real estate with her support during her natural life, or with so much as shall be necessary for her comfortable support, in addition to the foregoing provision.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">\u201c The demandant also introduced evidence that the house, which said will gave her the right to occupy, &amp;c. was burned in October 1855, and that a new one had not been built.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">\u201c It was in evidence that after said Wales\u2019s death, namely, in the year 1850, the demandant let her part of said house to Wales Tilden, son of said testator and executor of said will, and that he let the same to the tenant; and that one Cox hired the same of the tenant, and remained in possession under him (the tenant occupying the other part of the house) until the house was burned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">\u201c It was also in evidence that this notice, dated April 5th 1856, was on that day left at the house of said executor:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">\u201cTo Mr. Wales Tilden, Marshfield: You are hereby notified and requested to repair the dwelling-house, the use and improve* ment of which was devised by Wales Tilden, deceased, to me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>and you are further notified that I shall claim and do claim all which said Wales Tilden, deceased, by and under his will and codicil devised and bequeathed to you, to have been forfeited by you, by your failure to comply with what is enjoined upon you under said will and codicil; and I claim my share thereof under the devise thereof to Nabby L.

The manifest intent of the testator by his will was to provide an honorable maintenance for his widow; to give his daughter Sophia an estate in the half house for life or until marriage (with some legacies and a suitable provision for life, subject to an alteration upon marriage); and that his son should provide the maintenance of the widow and this daughter, pay the legacies and take the residue of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-11\">To construe the estate of the son as an estate upon condition subsequent would defeat the testator\u2019s intent, upon a forfeiture of the son\u2019s estate, by cutting off the provision for the widow and this daughter, except half of the estate to the latter, which might be insufficient. It is a mere condition <em>in terrorem. Parsons </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>6 Mass. 178. The will should rather be construed as giving an estate to the son, charged with trusts for the benefit of the widow and daughter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-12\">2. The direction to repair the house is not found in the will, which contains the condition; but is found in the codicil, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>in terms charges the estate with Sophia\u2019s support, and \u201c this is strong, if not conclusive, proof that the testator did not intend that the devise should be defeated by\u201d omission to repair, \u201cbut that it should stand as security only.\u201d <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>4 Met. 526. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>3 Mason, 178, and 12 Wheat. 498. 1 Jarman on Wills, 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">3. If the tenant took an estate upon condition, there has been no breach of condition. The will does not require him to build or provide a house, but only to repair. The demandant, being tenant for life, was herself bound to rebuild, or at least, if she did not, forfeited the house. Co. Lit. 53 <em>b. </em>The house devised, not being in existence, cannot be repaired; and performance of the condition having thus become impossible, the estate becomes absolute. 2 Bl. Com. 157. Co. Lit. 206. 1 Salk. 170.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-8\">4. The demandant has leased the house to the tenant. It does not appear that she has since entered, or has a right of entry. The tenant may rebuild before his lease expires. 3 Kent Com. (6th ed.) 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-9\">5. The notice was insufficient. A demand of payment is necessary before an estate can be forfeited for breach of condition, and for the precise amount due. \u201c If the demand be of a penny more, or penny less, it will be ill.\u201d <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>21 Pick. 396, and cases cited. This notice requires the tenant to rebuild the whole house, when the will only required him to rebuild the demandant\u2019s half of the house.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-10\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab\">1. The original will of the testator, after giving to this demandant pecuniary and specific legacies, devised to her the improvement of the easterly half of his dwelling-house as long as she should remain unmarried, and made his son Wales residuary devisee and legatee, provided he should in all respects comply with what was enjoined upon him in the will; and on his failure so to do, all that was so given to him was given over to the demandant and the testator\u2019s other-daughter, to be equally divided between them. This devise to Wales was clearly on a condition subsequent, by a breach of which he would forfeit the property devised to him, and give to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>two daughters a right to enter upon the real estate and hold it as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">After the will had stood thus during twenty two years, the testator added a codicil, the sole purpose and effect of which were to make further provisions for the demandant. By that codicil, he gave to her the use and improvement, during her life, of land about his dwelling-house, and additional privileges in the house, and directed Wales, and his heirs and assigns, to provide wood for her, and to keep in good repair that part of the house, of which the improvement was devised to her by the original will, so long as she should be entitled to the improvement of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The demandant has entered upon the real estate devised to Wales, claiming it as forfeited by his failure to keep her part of the dwelling-house in good repair, according to the direction in the codicil, and has brought this writ of entry against his grantee to recover an undivided moiety of it. And if the estate is forfeited, the action is rightly brought for a moiety only. For though, by the will, the forfeiture was to be to both daughters, as tenants in common, yet one tenant in common may sue alone for his particular share. Rev. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7 10. The action is also rightly brought against Wales\u2019s grantee, who is in possession. For if Wales had only a defeasible estate, he could convey only an estate subject to be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\"><em>2. </em>Is the estate, which was devised to Wales, subject to forfeiture by the failure to comply with what is enjoined on him by the codicil, as well as by a failure to comply with what was enjoined on him by the original will 1 We think it is. A codicil, duly executed, is an addition or supplement to a will, and is no revocation thereof, except in the precise degree in which it is inconsistent therewith, unless there be words of revocation. And it is an established <em>prima facie </em>rule of construction, that an additional legacy, given by a codicil, is attended with the same incidents and qualities as the original legacy. 4 Dane Ab. 550. 4 Kent Com. (6th ed.) 531. 1 Jarman on Wills, 160. 1 Roper on Leg. (2d Amer. ed.) 873-875. <em>2 </em>Williams on Executors, (4th Amer. ed.) 1403 <em>&amp; seq. Doe </em>v. <em>Latham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Busbee, 365. Upon the same principle, a devise upon condition that the devisee shall \u201ccomply with what is enjoined upon him in this will \u201d must be construed, <em>prima facie, </em>to be upon condition that the devisee shall also comply with what may be enjoined upon him by any codicil. There is nothing in the present case to control this construction. Nothing in the will is tsvoked by the codicil. And we cannot doubt that the testator intended that the additional provision, made for the demandant in the codicil, should have the same incidents which the original provision had, and should give to her the same rights which were by law attached to that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">3. Has Wales broken the condition on which we hold that the devise was made to him, by failure to keep in good repair that part of the dwelling-house, of which the improvement was given to the demandant ? We think he has. If he had undertaken, by contract, to keep it in repair, there can be no doubt that he must have repaired it, after the fire, or have rendered himself liable to an action for breach of his contract. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>16 Mass. 238. 4 Dane Ab. 375, 376. 3 Kent Com. (6th-ed.) 467. Platt on Cov. 274. And we cannot suppose that the obligation imposed on him by the codicil was of less force than his voluntary contract would have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">4. The fact that the demandant had leased her part of the dwelling-house, and that a sublessee was in possession at the time of the fire, cannot affect her right to have it repaired, nor extend the time within which the repair should be made. The law gave a reasonable time for repairing, and such time had elapsed after the fire, and also after demand made, before this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">5. We are of opinion that if any notice and demand were necessary, (which we need not decide,) the notice was rightly given to Wales, and the demand rightly made on him. We are also of opinion that the notice was sufficient in form, inasmuch as Wales could not have failed to understand what it meant <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Culliford, </em>4 D. &amp; R. 249. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
