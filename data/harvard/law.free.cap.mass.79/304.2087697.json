Van Deusen &amp; wife.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b314-6\">Uttering slanderous words in the presence of the person slandered only is not actionable</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">Action of tort for slander. Trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Briggs, </em>J., who signed this bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">\u201c The words claimed to have been slanderous were spoken, if at all, at the dwelling-house of the defendants, and in that part thereof called the bakery, where bread and other articles were sold to customers; and were spoken by Mrs. Van Deusen to Mrs. Sheffill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">\u201c The defendants asked the court to instruct the jury that if the words alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration were spoken to Mrs. Sheffill, and no other person but Mrs. Sheffill and Mrs. Van Deusen were present, there was no such publication of the words as would maintain the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-10\"><em>\u201c </em>The court declined so to instruct, but did instruct the jury that if the words were publicly uttered in the bakery of the defendants, there was a sufficient publication, though the plaintiff has not shown that any other person was present, at the time they were spoken, but Mrs. Sheffill and Mrs. Van Deusen. \u2022 The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendants except.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-11\"><em>M. Wilcox, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-12\"><em>W. K. Peck, </em>(of Connecticut,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auq\">The instructions given were correct and sufficient. The plaintiffs are not bound to prove, as a distinct fact, that some third person heard the words; those who heard them may be absent or dead. The words having been spoken in a public place, and in a public manner, the presumption is that they were heard by other persons, and so the jury must have thought.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-13\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atl1\">Proof of the publication of the defamatory words alleged in the declaration was essential to the maintenance of this action. Slander consists in uttering words to the injury of a person\u2019s reputation. No such injury is done when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the words are uttered only to the person concerning whom they are spoken, no one else being present or within hearing. It is damage done to character in the opinion of other men, and not in a party\u2019s selfestimation, which constitutes the material element in an action for verbal slander. Even in a civil action for libel, evidence that the defendant wrote and sent a sealed letter to the plaintiff, containing defamatory matter, was held insufficient proof of publication; although it would be otherwise in an indictment for libel, because such writings tend directly to a breach of the peace. So too it must be shown that the words were spoken in the presence of some one who understood them. If spoken in a foreign language, which no one present understood, no action will lie therefor. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Wooton, </em>12 Co. 35. <em>Hickes\u2019s case, </em>Pop. 139, and Hob. 215. <em>Wheeler &amp; Appleton\u2019s case, </em>Godb. 340. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Jansen, </em>2 Esp. R. 624. <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Clason, </em>1 Caines, 581. Hammond N. P. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It is quite immaterial, in the present case, that the words were spoken in a public place. The real question for the jury was, were they so spoken as to have been heard by third persons ? The defendants were therefore entitled to the instructions for which they asked. <em>Exceptions sustained</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
