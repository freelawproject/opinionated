It is a general rule that a judgment, obtained against one of several who are jointly liable either for a tort or upon a contract, precludes the plaintiff from afterwards proceeding against the others. 1 Chit.

It is same cause of action, where the action is supported by the same evidence, without regard to the form. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>King, </em>7 Johns. 20. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>2 Penning. 105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\">There are authorities, that where no statute requires a previous suit against the constable, the suit may be brought directly on the bond. <em>Bagby </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>8 Alab. 230. <em>Governor </em>v. <em>White, </em>4 Stew. &amp; Port. 441. <em>Governor </em>v. <em>Perkins, 2 </em>Bibb, 395. The case of <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>10 Met. 309, was founded on the <em>St. </em>of 1838, <em>c. </em>181, \u00a7 3, which required a previous suit against the constable. There is no statute requiring such previous suit in this case. <em>Sts. </em>1845, <em>c. </em>70, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 1851, <em>c. </em>94, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">2. But if the true construction of the statutes requires that there should be a previous suit against the constable, the same construction and analogy require the suit to be commenced in the supreme judicial court, as in <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Parker. </em>Rev. Sts. c. 70, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-8\">3. The attachment of a third person\u2019s goods was <em>extra officium, </em>and not within the condition of the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-9\"><em>S. O. Lamb, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b395-10\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANO\">This action, we think, was rightly commenced in the court of common pleas. We understand that the provision in <em>St. </em>1845, <em>c. </em>70, \u00a7 2, that in actions on constables\u2019 bonds \u201c the like proceedings shall be had as in a suit by a creditor on administration bonds,\u201d was intended merely to direct the form of proceedings in such actions, and not to give to the supreme judicial court exclusive jurisdiction thereof, Ifite its jurisdiction under the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>70, of actions on administration bonds. In <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>10 Met. 309, no question of the jurisdiction of the court was raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">It is also our opinion that an attachment, by a constable, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the property of A. on a process against B. is a breach of the condition of his official bond given for the faithful performance of his duties in the service of civil processes. <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>3 Greenl. 418. <em>Brunott </em>v. <em>M'Kee, </em>6 W. &amp; S. 513. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>4 Ohio State R. 418. Such act is a breach of the condition of a coroner\u2019s and of a sheriff\u2019s official bond. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Hanson, 2 </em>Fairf. 241. <em>Carmack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Binn. 184. <em>People </em>v. <em>Schuyler, </em>4 Comst. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The only other question is, whether the recovery of a judgment by Kenran against Wilson, for the conversion of the rifle, which judgment is unsatisfied, is a bar to this action. And we deem it perfectly clear that it is not. In <em>Carmack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>above cited, this precise point was adjudged. But we need no precedent. Officers are, by the common law, answerable for legal injuries done by their official acts, or acts under color of office. But they may not have pecuniary ability to pay the damages that may be recovered against them; or they may dishonestly avoid payment. Hence the statute requisition that they shall give bonds, with sureties, for the faithful performance of their official duties; thus giving to a party injured by the officer\u2019s acts a cumulative remedy, that is, a remedy in addition to an action against the officer, founded directly on his misdoings.. Undoubtedly such party can have only one satisfaction ; but a judgment, in an action brought against the officer for his misdoings, is not <em>per se </em>a satisfaction for the party\u2019s injury. It may be wholly worthless; and while it is unsatisfied, it can be no bar to an action on the officer\u2019s official bond. Indeed, the Rev. Sts. c. 14, \u00a7 65, provide that no action shall be brought on a sheriff\u2019s bond, until the party bringing it has recovered judgment against the sheriff or his legal representatives, &amp;c.; and that, in a suit on the bond, execution shall issue for the amount of such judgment, or such part thereof as shall be unsatisfied. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
