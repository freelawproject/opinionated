In an equitable action where the question arose our Su' preme Court of Errors held as follows: \u201cThe omission to tax costs either for or against him may fairly be regarded as equivalent to a decision that no such costs ought to be taxed. . . .\u201d <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford Trust Co., </em>72 Conn. 86, 96. Where costs\u2019 are discretionary, an award by the court is a prerequisite to allowance of the same, unless otherwise regulated .by statute or rule of court. 15 C. J. 258, \u00a7 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">From the number of cases cited in the footnotes to this section of Corpus Juris, the weight of authority supports this view and is in accord with our law as per the <em>Union Trust Company </em>case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\"><em>I </em>Tin. view of the foregoing, the motion for the issuance of an execution must be denied. And likewise, from what has been said as to the absence of any award of costs in said judgment, the motion for remittance of costs must be denied as no such costs exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">Both motions are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
