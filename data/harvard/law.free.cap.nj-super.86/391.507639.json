Plaintiffs sued defendant for the loss upon a policy which covered \u201cdirect loss by windstorm.\u201d Defendant contended that the loss was not caused by windstorm but by the storm-tossed sea, or by the combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>action of wind and waves, for which it was not liable under its policy.' The jury returned a verdict for defendant.

Was all of the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 building and household and personal property caused solely and exclusively by the direct force of the wind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">2. Was all of the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 building and household and personal property caused solely and exclusively by flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of the Atlantic Ocean or spray from any of the foregoing, whether driven by wind or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">3. Did all of the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 building and household and personal property result from the combined, joint action of, or was it contributed to or aggravated by flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of the Atlantic Ocean, or spray from any of the foregoing, whether driven by wind or not?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The jury answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 3 and <em>2 </em>and \u201cyes\u201d to question 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The judge charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\u201cIn order for the plaintiffs to recover they have the burden to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the damage to the building and to the household and personal property, or some portion of such damage, was caused solely and exclusively by the direct force of wind, and that such damage was not caused by and did not result from and was not contributed to or aggravated by flood, surface water, waves, tidal water or tidal wave, overflow of the Atlantic Ocean, or spray from any of the foregoing, whether wind driven or not. * * *. * \u00bb * If you find that the plaintiff has established, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the damage to the building and its contents or to some portion thereof was caused by direct force of the wind, but you also find that the plaintiff has not established by a fair preponderance of the evidence that such damage was not caused by or did not result from or was not contributed to or aggravated by flood, surface water, tidal water or tidal wave, overflow of the Atlantic Ocean, or spray from any of them, whether wind driven or not, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover such damage, since as I indicated in the beginning, the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof in this instance is a dual one, the inclusion of the wind and the exclusion of the water. If yon find that the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 building and its contents was caused by or resulted from the combined joint action of the direct force of the wind and of flood, surface water, tidal water or tidal wave, overflow of the Atlantic Ocean, or spray from any of them, whether driven by wind or not, plaintiffs are not entitled to recover for such damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have used the term sole and exclusive, and in submitting to you written interrogatories as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>form in which your verdict will be arrived at, I have also used them. The term sole and exclusive shall be taken in its everyday eonnota,tion or meaning. The term would not include causes which were insignificant or minimal or remote in their effect. I have read certain language in these policies, caused, aggravated by, contributed to, resulting from, and I think that I should define those terms, since as I have indicated they are the contractual bases and form a portion of it. As used in the endorsement forming part of the contract of insurance, the following words have the following meanings. * * :S Windstorm means a storm with an unusually violent wind. Caused by means that which produces an effect or result, that from which a thing proceeds and without which it would not exist. Resulting from means that which proceeded naturally and logically from a state of facts. Contributed to means that a state of facts takes share or part or helped to cause or aided in causing a result. Aggravated by means that a state of facts increased or intensified, or was made worse or more severe, a result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Plaintiffs agree that they had to prove \u201cdirect loss by windstorm.\u201d However, they dispute that they had <em>to </em>prove that the loss was caused \u201csolely and exclusively by the direct force of wind.\u201d The substance of their argument is stated in their brief as follows: \u201cThe plaintiffs are not asking this Court * * * to permit recovery for water damage; they are only asking that * * * recovery may be permitted for wind damage even when water may be a minor and secondary factor, particularly where [as plaintiffs claim was the case here] wind alone is of sufficient velocity to cause the damage unaided by water.\u201d They cite as expressive of their position the following from <em>Anderson v. Connecticut Fire Insurance Co., </em>231 <em>Minn. </em>469, 43 <em>N. W. 2d </em>807, 812 <em>(Minn. Sup. Ct. </em>1950) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cWhere an insurance policy expressly covers the risk of loss to a building from windstorm, liability for such loss is established where it is shown that the windstorm by its own unaided action was of sufficient violence to be the efficient and proximate cause of the damage or where, as the efficient and proximate cause\u2014though not the sole cause\u2014it brings about such a material weakening of the building that it collapses from [other causes], and which collapse would not have taken place had not the structure first been weakened by the wind. It is immaterial that the damage following from the efficient proximate cause may have been indirectly and incidentally enhanced by another cause expressly excluded from coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Plaintiffs requested certain charges which set forth their position rather differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">\u201c5. If you find that waves or windblown water, or water of any sort contributed to or aggravated plaintiffs\u2019 damage, but that their action was remote and not a direct-producing cause, then you may disregard such evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">6. If you find that wind and wind alone was the probable producing cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damage, then you are to find for the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">7. If you find by a preponderance of the evidence that wind, and wind alone was the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damage, then you are to bring in a verdict for the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">8. If you find by a preponderance of the evidence, that wind and wind alone was the sole cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damage at the exact moment of collapse of the house, then you are to bring in a verdict for the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">9. If you find that water or wind-driven water, or other water was not a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damage, but that the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damage was wind, you are justified in bringing in a verdict for the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The judge refused the requests. He said that the substance of some of them had been included in his charge. The remainder he rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Plaintiffs argue that if these endorsements be construed in the manner urged by defendant and charged by the judge, the endorsements are a fraud on the public. They argue that in New Jersey \u201cAny storm accompanied by high winds along the * * * coast * * * is always accompanied by high tides and excess water in the streets,\u201d while inland the damage would rarely exceed the $50 deductible. However, the endorsements must have been approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>17 :36\u20145.22. Under that statute it is the Commissioner\u2019s prerogative to reject an endorsement because it is \u201cunjust, unfair [or] inequitable * * Once he accepts it, we must construe it as any insurance contract prepared by the insurer is construed. <em>Herbert L. Farkas Co. v. New York Fire Insurance Co., 5 N. J. </em>604 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">On the other hand, defendant argues that the language of the endorsements is \u201cplain and unambiguous.\u201d We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>We find the language of the two endorsements complex and ambiguous, and so have courts and insurance commentators elsewhere. See the address by Pinkney Grissom before the Section of Insurance, Negligence and Compensation Law of the American Bar Association, reported in the 1960 Proceedings of the Section, <em>p. </em>71, and reprinted in the October 1960 <em>Insurance Law </em>Journal, <em>p. </em>615. See also \u201cConcurrent Causation In Insurance Contracts,\u201d 59 <em>Mich. L. Rev. </em>1141 (June 1961); Note, 33 <em>N. C. L. Rev. </em>288 (1955); Annotation, 93 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>145 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">However, our problem here is not whether the judge\u2019s charge would be correct under all imaginable circumstances, but whether it was prejudicially inappropriate to the facts at bar. Therefore, we must examine the evidence introduced and determine the issues which that evidence created.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The fact issue tried out by the parties was whether the loss was due to the wind alone or to waves alone or to a combination of both. The case was almost entirely a battle of experts. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Greenberg testified that in his opinion the force of the wind overturned the building. Defendant\u2019s experts testified that the force of the wind was not great enough to do that, and that the only thing that could have caused it was the force of the waves. There was only one person, plaintiffs\u2019 witness Prank, who could be called an eye-witness, and his evidence also was offered to support the proposition that the damage was caused by the wind. Plaintiffs made no effort to distinguish between damage caused by wind and that caused by any other force; they denied that water was a substantial causative factor, and attributed all of the damage to the wind.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">[The court then reviewed the evidence. It analyzed the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Greenberg, and concluded it was properly stricken for the reasons hereafter set forth.]</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Under these circumstances we hold that it was a proper exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion to strike Greenberg\u2019s testimony. <em>Rule </em>4 of the <em>Rules of Evidence </em>adopted by the Supreme Court on September 14, 1964 provides: \u201cThe judge may in his discretion exclude evidence if he finds that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk its admission will * * * create substantial danger of * * * misleading the jury * * Although the <em>Rules of Evidence </em>are not to be effective until July 1965, <em>Rule </em>4 expresses the existing law. It is \u201ca reflection of a discretion already vested in the trial judge which is well accepted in New Jersey law and not subject to controversy.\u201d See <em>Report of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on Evidence, </em>March 1963, <em>p. </em>85. This is especially true as to expert testimony, for \u201cnot every \u2018expert\u2019 is expert.\u201d <em>Polulich v. J. C. Schmidt Tool Die &amp; Stamping Co., </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>135, 149 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1957). See <em>Electric Park Amusement Co. v. Psichos, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>262, 266-268 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1912); <em>cf. Guzzi v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>251, 256 (1953); <em>Mitilenes v. Snead, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>246 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> Greenberg\u2019s opinion was not based on his learning or experience. He merely gave the results of calculations which he said he and others made, based on a formula obtained from a book and against which allowances had to be made for variables. Without disclosure of his computations, especially when they were demanded, there were no means by which the judge or the jury could gauge his veracity or the validity of his conclusions. The mere fact that a witness is an expert in a wide general field, like engineering, does not make everything he says admissible. It must appear that he knows what he is talking about with reference to the facts of the particular case. The opinion of an expert is worthless without underlying facts which support that opinion. <em>Stanley Co. of America v. Hercules Powder Co., </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>295 (1954); <em>Rempfer v. Deerfield Packing Corp., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>135 (1950); <em>Dwyer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>487 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Greenberg was not competent to express an opinion that the wind was strong enough to overturn the house. At best he was competent only to make calculations upon which he could base such an opinion. Since he did not produce those calculations, or verify or make them himself, and since what he said about those calculations was too vague to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>his opinion, the judge was justified in striking his testimony. <em>Cf. Standard Oil Company of California v. </em>Moore, 251 <em>F. 2d </em>188, 221 (9 <em>Cir. </em>1958); <em>Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp., </em>181 <em>F. 2d </em>70, 83 (7 <em>Cir. </em>1950), modified on other grounds 340 <em>U. S. </em>558, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>408, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>534 (1951); <em>Berthold-Jennings Lumber Co. v. St. Louis Iron &amp; S.R.R. Co., </em>80 <em>F. 2d </em>32, 102 <em>A. L. R. </em>688 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">[The court then reviewed the testimony of defendants\u2019 experts and held that plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike that testimony was properly denied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In short, the issue presented by the proofs was not how much damage was caused to plaintiffs\u2019 house by wind and how much by water. Both sides proceeded on the basis that the damage was total and an indivisible unit, and the only question was whether it was caused by the wind alone. Plaintiffs conceded as much in their requests to charge #6, 7 and 9, and they say so in their brief: \u201c* * * The expert testimony in this case of plaintiffs\u2019 expert Seymour Greenberg and that of the defendant-respondent\u2019s experts Joseph Lambert and Prancis Davis went to the very heart of the issue and established the causal factor of plaintiffs\u2019 damage. <em>This was the sole contested factual issue in the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In the light of that issue and that posture of the proofs we turn to examine plaintiffs\u2019 attack upon the charge and the refusal to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Plaintiffs say, \u201cBy Request to Charge 5 to 9 inclusive, plaintiffs attempted to have the Court read into the Water Exclusion Clause the doctrine of proximate cause,\u201d and it was error to refuse the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Plaintiffs do not make it clear what they mean by \u201cthe doctrine of proximate cause\u201d <em>as applied to the facts of this case. </em>They cite cases which involved either facts or policies different than in the case at bar. Pew of these cases are pertinent, for there is no universal principle to guide us in the interpretation of windstorm policies or in their application to all claimed losses. As Grissom, <em>supra, </em>points out, windstorm claims present four different possible fact situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and each must be dealt with differently. Therefore, general statements in the eases are of little use unless they are read in the light of the facts of those cases. <em>Grissom </em>says;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201cThe loss for which recovery is sought under the windstorm section of the extended coverage endorsement seldom results from a single isolated cause, but rather from a combination of causes. Damage to the insured property may have been occasioned by a windstorm operating in conjunction with some cause expressly excluded in the policy as a basis of liability, such as waves, high water or snow. Or the interaction of a non-excluded cause, e. g. rainfall, and a windstorm may have produced the loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">In either event, the initial question posed is simply one of causation \u25a0\u2014i. e., what was the specific manner in which the loss was occasioned? Dour different possibilities exist in this regard, for the damage may have been (a) caused exclusively either by the windstorm or by the particular contributing cause; (b) produced by some other element propelled or driven by the windstorm; (c) occasioned by the contributing causes acting in succession to each other (one element of nature operative first, affording a predicate for later damage by the other) ; or (d) the result of the concurrent and simultaneous effect of the contributing causes. Once this primary question of causation has been resolved, further determination must then be made of the scope of the insurer\u2019s liability in whichever of the four possibilities is found to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">However, courts have often failed to recognize, and to maintain, the distinction between these four basic factual situations. Moreover, divergent positions have been taken concerning the limits of the insurer\u2019s liability in each instance, especially as to the last two named. Accordingly, it may be safely stated that this problem of contributing causes has become the most confused and uncertain area of the law pertaining to the scope of windstorm coverage.\u201d (at <em>pp. </em>87-88)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 brief seems to advance at least three distinct propositions. The first appears to be that, if the windstorm by its own unaided action would have caused the damage, the fact that other elements contributed a surplus of force to cause the damage is no defense even if the other elements are excluded by the terms of the policy. An example of this would be a hurricane accompanied by high tides and waves. If the hurricane wonld have destroyed the building even if there had been no other forces, the insurer is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Ve do not disagree with this proposition, but here there was no basis in the evidence upon which to give such a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The second proposition advanced by plaintiffs appears to be that, if excluded forces did concur with the wind in causing the total damage but their contribution was \u201cminor,\u201d \u201cremote\u201d or \u201cinsignificant,\u201d the insurer is liable for all of the loss, even if the amount of the minor, remote or insignificant damage can not accurately be evaluated. Assuming that proposition is valid, it has no application to the case at bar. In the first place the issue is, as we have said, not minor, remote or insignificant damage, but the cause of the total damage. Second, the judge did charge the jury to ignore \u201ccauses which were insignificant or-minimal or remote in their effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Finally, plaintiffs appear to urge that, even if the proofs showed the damage to be due to- the combined forces- of wind and water, if wind was the \u201cdominant\u201d cause defendant is liable for all of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We are not sure wha/t plaintiffs mean by the \u201cdominant\u201d cause as applied to the facts 'in this case. They .attempt to draw an analogy from health and accident insurance cases, and say that the following excerpt from <em>Mahon v. American Casualty Co., </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>148, 167 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 34 <em>N. J. </em>472 (1961), should govern the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201c* * * the test is whether the accidental injury, as contrasted with the contributing disease or bodily condition is the proximate or predominant cause of the disability or loss, sometimes additionally qualified as the active, eflicient, dominant, originating or direct cause. Pervading such cases is the philosophy that if the accident is a more substantial contributing cause of the resultant disability or death than the disease, the latter being merely a condition thereof, recovery is allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This analogy might be justified in some fact situations- under a windstorm policy, as, for example, in cases in which the building had been weakened by age, improper construction or other causes prior to the windstorm, but it has no pertinence to the facts at bar. When the Supreme Court denied certification in <em>Mahon, supra, </em>it said it did so on the authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Insurance Co., </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>475 (1961). In <em>Kievit </em>the Supreme Court said that even in health and accident insurance cases a distinction may have to be drawn between cases \u201cwhere a patent, active disease was found to have contributed with the accident to the resulting death\u201d and those in which, \u201ca latent, inactive condition or disease which was not accompanied by any symptoms * * * was precipitated or activated by the accident * * See also <em>Linden Motor Freight Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>511 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Here the issue was whether water, a patent, active force excluded by the policy, was the sole or a substantial factor in causing the loss. Therefore a charge based on any idea of a \u201cdominant\u201d cause would have been improper. In fact, as we have said, charges and 7 which plaintiffs themselves requested contemplated proof of the action of \u201cwind and wind alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Plaintiffs argue that it was plain error for the court to charge the jury that the burden was upon them to prove the damage to their house was not caused by the sea. They admit that wo so held in <em>Brindley v. Fireman's Insurance Company of Newark, N. J., </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. 1 (App. Div. </em>1955), but they argue that if <em>Brindley </em>cannot bo distinguished (and we think it cannot) a \u201csound policy dictates a reversal\u201d of <em>Brindley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\"> On the contrary, we adhere to <em>Brindley. </em>To prevail on a policy such as this, the insured must prove a \u201cdirect loss by windstorm.\u201d If the insured introduces evidence of a loss duo to windstorm, the burden is upon the insurer to come forward with evidence that the loss was due to an excluded cause; but if either in the insured\u2019s or the insurer\u2019s case evidence appears which tends to prove that the loss was due to a cause other than windstorm, or to an expressly excepted cause, the burden is upon the plaintiffs to overcome that evidence. In the case at bar the evidence tended to prove not only that the sea contributed substantially to cause the damage but that it was the sole cause of the damage. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>fore, it became plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove that the sea was not the sole or a substantial cause of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Assuming that the burden was upon them, plaintiffs argue that it was prejudicial error to describe that burden as being one to show that the loss was caused \u201csolely and exclusively\u201d by the direct force of the wind. The words \u201csolely and exclusively\u201d do not appear in the policy, and we agree that they should not have been used in the charge. However, in view of the evidence and the issues, we do not think the plaintiffs were prejudiced by their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Finally, plaintiffs argue it was error to refuse the charges which they requested, quoted above. We think the substance of #5, 6, 7 and 9 were given. Under the evidence and the issues in this case, <em>#8 </em>was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
