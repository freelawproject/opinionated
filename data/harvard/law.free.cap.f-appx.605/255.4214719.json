Hollier, V. Hol-lier, on behalf of themselves and their minor children (collectively, \u201cthe- Holli-ers\u201d), appeal: (1) the district court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss filed by Defendants-Appellees, Randy Watson, Cynthia Leon, Carin Barth, all in their official capacities (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), (2) the court\u2019s denial of their motion for reconsideration of that same order, (3) the denial of their motion for leave to amend their complaint, and (4) the striking of their amended complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">Aaron Hollier filed a civil rights complaint in district court, alleging that the Texas Sex Offender registration requirements, as applied to him and his family, violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, the Double Jeopardy Clause, the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, and constituted a failure-to-protect claim. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the Holliers failed to state a claim. Under Western District of Texas Local Rule CV-7(e) the Holliers\u2019 response was due within fourteen days. The Holli-ers did not file any responsive pleading within fourteen days. Because Local Rule CV-7(e) also provides that the court may grant a motion as unopposed if review of the pleading reveals that it fails to state a claim, the court reviewed the complaint and granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss \u2014 eighteen days after it was filed. Three days later \u2014 exactly twenty-one days after the Defendants filed their motion to dismiss and within the time limit prescribed by Federal Rule 15(a)(1) to amend a pleading \u2014 the Holliers filed motions seeking leave to file an amended complaint and requested reconsideration of the order dismissing their original complaint. The court denied both motions. In denying the motion for leave to amend, the district court noted that the amended complaint advanced the same causes of action and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>named the same individual defendants as had the dismissed complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The Holliers timely appealed the district court\u2019s order granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, its order denying their motion for leave to amend and for reconsideration, and the striking of the amended complaint. On appeal, the Holliers assert: (1) The district court prematurely dismissed'their complaint under Federal Rule 15(a)(1) and therefore erred in denying them leave to amend their complaint and their motion for reconsideration; and (2) their original and amended complaint states a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">A. Denial of motion to dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court may not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.\u201d We may affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on any grounds supported by the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Before addressing whether the district court erred in granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under the substantive law, we consider whether the court committed reversible error by granting their motion before passage of the 21 days in which the Holliers were entitled to amend their complaint \u201cas a matter of course\u201d under Federal Rule 15(a)(1). The court applied Local Rule CV-7(e), which provides that a party must file its response to a dispositive motion within 14 days; and, if no response is filed, the district court may grant the motion as unopposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">On its face, Local Rule CV-7(e) is inconsistent with Rule 15(a)(1), which permits a party <em>21 days </em>after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f) in which to amend a complaint. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83(a) and (b) provides that a district court may regulate practice in any manner not inconsistent with federal law, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the local rules of the district;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that any local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that \u201ccauses a party to lose any rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">We have reversed district court judgments resulting from the application of local rules which are inconsistent with the federal rules. In <em>Clark v. Richards, </em>an unpublished opinion, we held that Federal Rule 38(b), which provides that a party may demand a jury trial by way of a written demand in a pleading, preempted a local rule requiring that a party make its jury demand on a paper separate from its complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Hicks v. Miller Brewing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Company, </em>also unpublished, we reversed the district court\u2019s striking and unfiling of a complaint that did not include a certificate of interested persons as required by the local rules.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reasoned that abridging the plaintiffs substantive right to file a lawsuit for failure to comply with a local rule of form ran afoul of Rule 83(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Both cases are distinguishable from the matter before us because the Holliers did not \u201close [their] rights\u201d as a result of the court\u2019s premature grant of Watson\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although it erred in granting Watson\u2019s motion to dismiss before the time allowed for amendment by Federal Rule 15(a)(1) elapsed, the district court had reviewed the amended complaint in connection with the Holliers\u2019 motion for leave to amend and reconsideration. In so doing, the court determined that the amended complaint stated the same causes of action and added back the same individual defendants as the complaint previously dismissed by the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the court reviewed the amended complaint pri- or to dismissing the case, we conclude that the Holliers did not lose any rights as a result of the court\u2019s application of Local Rule CV-7(e) \u2014 wholly separate and apart from the right of the district court to review the complaint under the timeline prescribed by Rule 15(a)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although we do not condone the application of Local Rule CV-7(e) under these circumstances, its application in this case did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Putting aside the timing of its order dismissing the complaint, we further conclude that the district court correctly ruled that the Holliers\u2019 complaints \u2014 both first-filed and as amended \u2014 failed to state a claim as a matter of law. The Holliers\u2019 amended complaint asserted that the enactment, application, and enforcement of the Texas lifetime sex offender registration by the Defendants in their official capacities (1) deprived them of their constitutional rights to procedural due process; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) deprives them of their right to equal protection under the law; (3) violated the Double Jeopardy Clause; (4) violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause; and, (5) constitutes a failure-to-protect claim. Both the United States Supreme Court, and this court, have held that sex offender registration statutes do not violate a citizen\u2019s right to due process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>goes for the Holliers\u2019 <em>ex post facto </em>claim,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> their equal protection claim,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> their Double Jeopardy claim,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and their failure-to-protect claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the district court did not err reversibly in granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">B. Denial of motion for leave to amend and reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We begin with the court\u2019s denial of the Holliers\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which we generally review for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When a district court\u2019s denial for leave to amend is based on futility, however, we apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although it did not explicitly state it was denying the Holliers\u2019 motion for leave to amend on the grounds of futility, the district court reviewed their amended complaint and determined it was essentially the same as the original complaint. We may therefore infer that the court denied the Holliers leave to amend on the ground that amendment would be futile, and we review its order <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">For substantially the same reasons that we affirm its grant of the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the Holliers leave to amend. Again, the court reviewed the amended complaint and found it contained the same causes of action as the dismissed complaint, making denial of leave to amend prudent. The court should have permitted the Holliers leave to amend their complaint under the timeline prescribed in Federal Rule 15(a)(1), but we discern no reversible error in light of the court\u2019s review of the Holli-ers\u2019 amended complaint before it denied their motion for leave to amend. To remand this case to district court for further proceedings would simply \u201cprolong the inevitable,\u201d and we hold the court\u2019s denial does not constitute reversible error under these circumstances.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">The same holds for the district court\u2019s denial of the Holliers\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the complaint, which is governed by the same considerations as its motion for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>amend.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They sought reconsideration of that order only in the event that the district court should deny their motion for leave to amend their complaint. They did not present any grounds for reconsideration other than the submission of their amended complaint. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Holders\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Finally, for the same reasons that we hold the district court did not err in denying the Holders leave to amend and their motion for reconsideration, the court did not err in striking their amended complaint. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
