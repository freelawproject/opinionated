Carcamo-Campos\u2019s application was based on persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group, consisting of the family members of a cousin who had been killed for failing to make monthly \u201crent\u201d payments to the Sal-vatruchas Gang. Whether an alien demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal is a factual determination that we review for substantial evidence. <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517-18 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-22\">To establish membership in a particular social group, an applicant must show that he is a member \u201cof a group of persons that share a common immutable characteristic that they either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is \u2018fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A particular social group is also marked by \u201csocial visibility\u201d and \u201cparticularity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519.' Social visibility or social distinction is determined by the extent that society perceives those with the immutable characteristic as members of a social group, and particularity turns on \u201cwhether the proposed group can accurately be described in a manner sufficiently distinct that the group would be recognized, in the society <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>in question, as a discrete class of persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Carcamo-Campos argues that \u201cthe social distinction which makes his family relationship a particular social group is that a member of his family was killed by the gangs.\u201d The BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a particular social group did not rest solely on a finding regarding the proposed group\u2019s social visibility, and Carcamo-Campos does not question its findings on the issues of immutability or particularity or address any of the administrative cases cited by the BIA in its analysis of those subjects. Thus, Carca-mo-Campos has failed to meaningfully challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish membership in \u201ca particular social group\u201d for withholding of removal. Inadequately briefed arguments are abandoned. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Even if we consider Carcamo-Campos\u2019s argument, it lacks merit. Carcamo-Cam-pos has not demonstrated membership in a particular social group or that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of that term is arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 521. Consequently, he cannot establish that he is statutorily eligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), and we need not reach his remaining arguments. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
