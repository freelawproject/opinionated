Upon review of the record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">On September 23, 2002, a Georgia jury found Viers guilty of one count of aggravated sexual battery, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-6-22.2, and one count of cruelty to children, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-70. On December 16, 2002, the state court merged the offenses and sentenced Viers to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. The victim, HV, was the two-year-old daughter, of Viers and his codefendant wife, Terena Viers (\u201cTerena\u201d). Terena was convicted of cruelty to children and sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, with 15 years to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">A. State\u2019s Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">The evidence showed that, on May 9, 2001, Viers and Terena brought HV to the emergency room. HV, then two years and four months old, was bleeding from a five-to six-centimeter laceration on her perineal area, the area between her vagina and anal opening, and had multiple bruises on her trunk and legs. Ultimately, a pediatric surgeon performed corrective surgery on HVs perineum. The surgeon testified that HV\u2019s injuries were consistent with abuse, and the damage to her perineum was caused by significant force and could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>have been caused by repeated penetration with a stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">A forensic pediatrician who examined HV the day after her surgery testified that he observed lacerations in her anus and that her injuries were consistent with sexual abuse and the insertion of a stick into her anus. The jury additionally heard evidence that Viers gave multiple, inconsistent explanations to the emergency room nurse and law enforcement officers of how HV received her injuries, and that blood matching HV\u2019s DNA was found on her car seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Dr. Nancy Aldridge, who conducted a forensic evaluation of HV, also testified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Aldridge completed her evaluation of HV over the course of six interviews between July 2001 and October 2001, beginning when HV was two years and seven months old. Dr. Aldridge testified that, in interviewing HV, she was careful not to ask leading or suggestive questions or provide positive reinforcement. During the interviews, HV indicated that she had \u201cboo-boos\u201d on various parts of her body, demonstrating on anatomically correct dolls that the injuries were on her arms, abdomen, buttocks, and vaginal and genital areas. HV indicated that the \u201cboo-boos\u201d came from Viers and Terena.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Dr. Aldridge testified that HV also repeatedly changed the dolls\u2019 diapers, stating that they had \u201cdoo-doo\u201d in their diapers. More than once, HV struck a doll, and when Dr. Aldridge asked her why, she explained that the doll had soiled its diaper. According to Dr. Aldridge, HV obsessively demonstrated \u201cthree consistent things\u201d: \u201cthe roughness with the dolls, ... the boo-boos and where they came from, and the baby\u2019s doo-doo and the striking of the babies and the aggressive play with the baby dolls after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">In HV\u2019s fourth or fifth session with Dr. Aldridge, HV told Dr. Aldridge that her \u201cda-da\u201d (her name for Viers) caused the \u201cboo-boo\u201d in her vaginal area. When Dr. Aldridge asked HV what her father had used to hurt her, HV replied that he used a stick from the front yard on one occasion and a bat at another time. HV also pointed to the vaginal area of an anatomically correct doll. HV indicated that her vaginal injury was inflicted after she had a dirty diaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">In the course of her testimony, Dr. Al-dridge also made five statements to which no contemporaneous objection was raised by Viers\u2019s attorney. Viers later maintained that Dr. Aldridge\u2019s statements should have been excluded as improper opinion testimony under Georgia law. Here are the statements. First, on cross-examination, Dr. Aldridge was questioned about the report she prepared on the forensic evaluation and asked whether her \u201cconclusion was that ... the only ... person [HV] had accused [of hurting her] was her father.\u201d Dr. Aldridge responded, \u2018Tes, sir. But if you go up another sentence, I had indicated that it was most likely that she was physically abused by her mother and her father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">Second, Dr. Aldridge testified that HV could show Dr. Aldridge what \u201chappened to the doll because it happened to [HV].\u201d Third, in in responding to a cross-examination question about whether HV could \u201cjust be making up a story about a doll,\u201d Dr. Aldridge stated that HV had \u201cdefinite medical findings,\u201d including evidence of trauma to her vaginal and anal area, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>was not \u201cjust a coincidence.\u201d Fourth, when asked about HV\u2019s statements that other individuals had hurt her, including an individual named \u201cGinger\u201d and a cat, Dr. Aldridge testified, \u201cI think this child was so traumatized that she is concerned that it might happen again and that other individuals could hurt her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Fifth, Dr. Aldridge was asked whether HV\u2019s repeatedly associating soiling her diaper with \u201charm by her parents\u201d could be \u201cconsistent with the fact that she was abused.\u201d Dr. Aldridge replied, \u2018Tes, sir.... It\u2019s very consistent when she has been abused, because ... children usually repeat the core experience that they had.... [HV] continued to react to it and act it out, because it\u2019s confusing, it\u2019s traumatizing to her, and she is trying to figure out what happened to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Aldridge admitted that she did not videotape her interview sessions with HV; that she referred to HV several times in her report as a \u201cvery precious little girl\u201d; and that she picked up HV and carried HV from the waiting room to her office at'the beginning of each session. Dr. Aldridge noted, however, that she generally did not hold HV during the sessions. Dr. Aldridge conceded that, before her first session with HV, HV already had been interviewed by several people, including a caseworker and an investigating officer. Finally, although HV\u2019s foster family reported that HV had a small vocabulary, Dr. Aldridge found her to have a larger vocabulary than was reported, to be very talkative, and to sometimes speak in full sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"AcYZ\">Dennis Abercrombie, HV\u2019s foster father, testified that HV came to five with his family in June 2001 after about a month with another foster family. At that time, HV was \u201cvery frail,\u201d had \u201cquit taking solid food,\u201d and was losing weight and failing to thrive. HV seemed afraid of men and was tentative around women. She had frequent nightmares and would become hysterical after soiling her diaper. On one occasion, in July or August 2001, while looking at photographs of her family, HV said to Abercrombie, without prompting or questioning, \u201cDaddy hurt my boo-boo,\u201d referring to her bottom or back side. On cross-examination, Abercrombie admitted that he and his wife wished to adopt HV if the opportunity arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">B. Defendant\u2019s Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">At trial, attorney Drew Powell represented Viers. After the State rested, attorney Powell called Dr. James Stark, a psychologist, to testify for the defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Based on his extensive experience as a certified forensic examiner, Dr. Stark outlined various mistakes by child forensic interviewers that could undermine the accuracy of an evaluation: (1) losing their objectivity; (2) using anatomical dolls, which studies had shown to be problematic; (3) touching or hugging the child, which could positively \u201creinforce whatever happened just before\u201d the contact; (4) relying on a \u201clittle kid[\u2019s]\u201d ability to think abstractly, as \u201cvery, very young\u201d children tend to think concretely; (5) failing to audiotape or videotape the forensic evaluation, espe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>dally in cases of alleged sexual abuse, so that subsequently it can be determined if the evaluator was encouraging certain responses; and (6) evaluating a child over the course of several sessions, or allowing different people to interview the child, as the child can take on questions and comments as real events.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Dr. Spark also specifically criticized various methods of Dr. Aldridge and aspects of her evaluation of HV, including that Dr. Aldridge evaluated HV over the course of six sessions, which could have some \u201cpractice effects\u201d; that Dr. Aldridge failed to videotape or audiotape the sessions; and that Dr. Aldridge failed to reconcile some inconsistencies in HV\u2019s statements. Based on Dr. Stark\u2019s examination of Dr. Al-dridge\u2019s report, it appeared to Dr. Stark that Dr. Aldridge, from the beginning, \u201cassumed\u201d that Viers caused HV\u2019s injuries and ignored HV\u2019s allegations against other individuals, such as \u201cGinger\u201d or the cat. For example, Dr. Aldridge\u2019s report did not include any history on HV\u2019s first foster family, and it was possible that HV was attempting to communicate \u201csomething\u201d that happened with that family. Dr. Al-dridge also showed a lack of objectivity, referring to HV as \u201cprecious\u201d and \u201ccute\u201d in her report, and may have positively reinforced HV through holding and hugging her. Finally, the fact that HV apparently knew only a few words before starting her sessions with Dr. Aldridge, but demonstrated her large vocabulary as the sessions progressed, suggested that someone was teaching her new words.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In closing argument, attorney Powell argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dr. Stark\u2019s testimony demonstrated the problems with Dr. Al-dridge\u2019s report and methods, including her bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">C. Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">On January 2, 2003, with the assistance of new court-appointed counsel, Viers filed a motion for new trial. In May and June 2008, respectively, Viers\u2019s counsel filed two amended motions for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Viers alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that trial attorney Powell rendered ineffective assistance of counsel through failing to object to: (1) the improper ultimate-issue \u201copinion\u201d testimony of Dr. Aldridge, specifically Dr. Aldridge\u2019s statement that she \u201chad indicated that it was most likely that [HV] was physically abused by her mother and her father\u201d; and (2) the improper admission of HV\u2019s statements through the hearsay testimony of Dr. Aldridge and foster father Abercrombie.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">On June 2, 2008, the state trial court held a hearing on Viers\u2019s motion for new trial. As to Viers\u2019s first claim of ineffective assistance, attorney Powell testified that he did not object to the above \u201copinion\u201d statement by Dr. Aldridge because he believed that it was admissible testimony and that an objection would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">As to Viers\u2019s ineffective assistance claim based on HVs hearsay statements, attorney Powell testified that he did not move to exclude the statements or otherwise object because he believed that the statements were admissible under Georgia\u2019s Child Hearsay statute. In particular, Powell believed that the statements had sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d as required by that statute, to be admitted and that an attempt to exclude the statements would not be successful. Powell \u201cheavily based\u201d this conclusion on the Child Hearsay statute and \u201cthe fact that there\u2019s not much case law out there where the statements are thrown out because of indicia of reliability. There are a few. But it seems to be a fairly rare experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">In addition, attorney Powell testified that he developed a strategy of attacking the statements directly to the jury through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Dr. Stark\u2019s testimony and his closing argument. Powell decided to highlight to the jury that HV was \u201cso young\u201d and that it took \u201crepeated\u201d sessions with Dr. Aldridge before she identified Viers as the cause of the \u201cboo-boo\u201d in her vaginal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">On July 22, 2008, the state trial court summarily denied Viers\u2019s counseled motions for new trial. On August 19, 2008, Viers\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appeal. On March 26, 2009, after granting Viers\u2019s motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal, the state trial court again denied Viers\u2019s motion for new trial, stating that its denial would facilitate Viers\u2019s right of review on appeal and establish a proper record.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Also on March 26, 2009, Viers filed <em>pro se </em>a \u201cBrief in Support of Amended Motion for New Trial.\u201d Subsequently, Viers filed a motion for reconsideration in light of his <em>pro se </em>brief. Viers <em>pro se </em>reiterated the ineffective assistance claims already raised in his counseled motion-for-new-trial proceedings but also expanded on the claim that Powell rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to improper opinion testimony of Dr. Aldridge. Viers listed all five of the statements identified above as objectionable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The state trial court denied Viers\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and Viers filed an amended notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">D. Direct Appeal to the Georgia Court of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>on appeal, Viers raised the two ineffective assistance claims litigated before the state trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to the issues concerning Dr. Aldridge\u2019s allegedly improper opinion testimony, Vi-ers asserted ineffective assistance based on all five of the supposedly objectionable statements identified in his <em>pro se </em>brief filed in the state trial court following'the denial of his motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">On March 8, 2010, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Viers v. State, </em>303 Ga. App. 387, 693 S.E.2d 526 (Ct.App.2010). The Georgia Court of Appeals correctly noted that Viers\u2019s claims of ineffective counsel were governed by the two-prong standard in <em>Strickland v. Washington. Id. </em>at 391, 693 S.E.2d at 530-31 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (requiring a petitioner alleging ineffective counsel to show both deficient performance and prejudice)). At the outset, the Georgia Court of Appeals indicated that it would address each of the \u201cspecific [ineffective assistance] arguments\u201d made by Viers \u201cseparately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 693 S.E.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">First, as to Dr. Aldridge\u2019s \u201cultimate issue\u201d opinion testimony, the Georgia Court of Appeals noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Viers contended that trial counsel should have objected to Dr. Aldridge\u2019s testimony that she \u201chad indicated that it was most likely that [HV] was physically abused by her mother and her father.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 693 S.E.2d at 531. The Georgia court concluded that Viers failed to show deficient performance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-14\">We disagree with Viers\u2019s characterization of Dr. Aldridge\u2019s testimony. When read in context with the question posed by Viers\u2019s counsel, it is clear that Dr. Aldridge was not expressing an opinion regarding whether the abuse occurred, but instead explaining that HV had accused both parents of abuse, as opposed to merely her father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-15\"><em>Id. </em>The Georgia court also concluded that Viers failed to show prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Nevertheless, pretermitting whether Dr. Aldridge\u2019s response to questioning constituted a comment on the ultimate issue in the case and whether trial counsel\u2019s decision not to object thereto constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, it does not require reversal because Viers has failed to establish that the testimony so prejudiced his defense as to affect the outcome of his trial. We are not persuaded that Dr. Aldridge\u2019s response was so significant that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if counsel had objected thereto, especially in light of the physicians\u2019 testimony regarding HV\u2019s injuries, the inconsistencies in Vi-ers\u2019 various versions of events, the blood found in the car seat, and the testimony and photographs \u2014 which the jury viewed \u2014 regarding the bruises and lacerations on HV.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 392, 693 S.E.2d at . 531 (alteration adopted, quotation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Second, as to Dr. Aldridge\u2019s and Aber-crombie\u2019s testimonies recounting HV\u2019s out-of-court statements, the Georgia Court of Appeals held that Viers failed to show deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 693 S.E.2d at 532-33. The Georgia court reasoned that, \u201c[pjretermitting whether the testimony was admissible, ... [cjlearly, trial counsel made a strategic decision to attack the reliability of HVs statements during closing argument and with the testimony of Dr. Stark criticizing Dr. Al-dridge\u2019s interview techniques.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 693 S.E.2d at 532. The Georgia Court of Appeals did not reach the prejudice prong. <em>See id. </em>at 394, 693 S.E.2d at 532-33. The Georgia court also denied Viers\u2019s motion to reconsider its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">E. Federal Habeas Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">On March 3, 2011, Viers filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the district court. Viers\u2019s petition claimed (1) trial counsel Powell rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to Dr. Aldridge\u2019s opinion testimony and the recounting of HV\u2019s out-of-court statements to Dr. Aldridge and Abercrombie; and (2) the trial court violated his Due Process and Confrontation Clause rights by allowing the testimony and statements. The district court denied the \u00a7 2254 petition, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">This Court granted Viers a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on these issues and counsel to brief them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-10\">(1) Whether Mr. Viers\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the opinion testimony of Dr. Nancy Aldridge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-11\">(2) Whether Mr. Viers\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the admission of [HV\u2019s] out-of-court statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-12\">(3) Whether Mr. Viers has established cause and prejudice for failing to raise his objections to the testimony of Dr. Aldridge and the out-of-court statements of [HV];- and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-13\">(4) If so, whether Mr. Viers\u2019s constitutional rights were violated by the admission of Dr. Aldridge\u2019s testimony and the out-of-court statements of [HV].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">Below, we outline the federal habeas law applicable to Viers\u2019s claims. We then discuss the first two issues separately and the final two issues jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">II. AEDPA DEFERENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), federal courts are precluded from granting habeas relief on claims that were previously \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state court unless the adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-5\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">When a state court decision summarily rejects without discussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including a federal claim subsequently pressed in federal court, the federal habeas court must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 97-100, 131 S.Ct. 770, 788-85, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). And \u201c[wjhere a state court\u2019s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the ha-beas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 131 S.Ct. at 784. This presumption also applies, subject to rebuttal, to cases in which the state court discusses some of the defendant\u2019s claims but \u201crejects a federal claim without expressly addressing that claim.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Williams, </em>568 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 1088, 1096, 185 L.Ed.2d 105 (2013). The <em>Johnson </em>\u201cCourt observed that there are good reasons why state courts do not address every single argument made by a defendant, including \u2018instances in which a state court may simply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discussion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Comm\u2019r, Alabama Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>726 F.3d 1172, 1212 (11th Cir.2018), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Lee v. Thomas, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1542, 188 L.Ed.2d 557 (2014) (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>568 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1095).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">However, when the evidence \u201cleads very clearly to the conclusion that a federal c\u00edaim was inadvertently overlooked in state court,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>held that \u00a7 2254(d) deference does not apply. 568 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1097. Where it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, \u201c[cjourts can ... deny writs of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254 by engaging in <em>de novo </em>review ... because a habeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if his or her claim is rejected on <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 390, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">The phrase \u201ccontrary to\u201d means that the state court decision contradicts the United States Supreme Court on a settled question of law or holds differently than did the Supreme Court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1173, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). The pivotal question in most federal habeas cases is whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was unreasonable. <em>See Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 101, 131 S.Ct. at 785. \u201c[A]n <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law,\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1522, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); indeed, \u201ceven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusi\u00f3n was unreasonable,\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. at 786.

VI. Under <em>Strickland, </em>to establish constitutionally ineffective counsel, a petitioner must show both (1) that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Wiggins v.

Scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and a strong presumption exists that counsel\u2019s performance fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">The petitioner must show that no reasonable counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take. <em>See Rogers v. Zant, </em>13 F.3d 384, 386 (11th Cir.1994). Counsel is not deficient so long as the particular approach taken could be considered sound strategy. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). When assessing an attorney\u2019s decisions, we must make \u201cevery effort ... to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.

OPINION TESTIMONY CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">On appeal, petitioner Viers, through counsel, argues that the Georgia Court of Appeals unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>in rejecting his claim that trial attorney Powell rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to Dr. Aldridge\u2019s statement that it was most likely that HV was physically abused by both her mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Here, Viers has not shown that the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s rejection of this claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland, </em>or involved an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s interpretation of the statement \u2014 that Dr. Aldridge was explaining that she had indicated in her report that HV accused both parents of abuse, not merely Viers \u2014 was not unreasonable. As recounted above, defense counsel asked Dr. Aldridge whether her conclusion was that the only person HV had accused was her father. Although perhaps not precisely phrased, Dr. Al-dridge\u2019s response was that, \u201cup another sentence\u201d in the report, she \u201chad indicated\u201d that HV accused both parents of abuse. Thus, Dr. Aldridge was testifying as to whom HV accused of abusing her\u2014 not giving a conclusion about who actually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Therefore, this testimony did not impermissibly go the ultimate issue of who abused HV. <em>See McFolley v. State, </em>289 Ga. 890, 892, 717 S.E.2d 199, 201 (2011) (holding that expert testimony that the victim\u2019s injuries were caused by abuse, not an accidental fall, was not an opinion on the ultimate issue, which was the identity of the person responsible for the abuse); <em>Collum v. State, </em>281 Ga. 719, 722, 642 S.E.2d 640, 644 (2007) (holding that trial court did not err in denying motion for mistrial based on expert\u2019s testimony that victim was beaten to death because \u201cthe ultimate issue was the identity of the person or persons responsible for the beating\u201d). Fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s decision, as Dr. Aldridge\u2019s statement was not clearly objectionable or excludable under Georgia law. <em>See Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 105, 131 S.Ct. at 788; <em>Loggins, </em>654 F.3d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Viers also asserts that the Georgia Court of Appeals overlooked his remaining claims of ineffective assistance based on Dr. Aldridge\u2019s improper opinion testimony, and thus these claims should receive <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Having reviewed the record and the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s decision, we are not led \u201cvery clearly\u201d to the conclusion that the court inadvertently overlooked Viers\u2019s additional claims of improper opinion testimony. <em>See Johnson, </em>568 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1097.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notably, when moving for reconsideration, Viers did not claim that the Georgia Court of Appeals had overlooked these claims. <em>See id. </em>at-, 133 S.Ct. at 1099 (reasoning that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>petitioner, who \u201cpresumably knows her case better than anyone else,\u201d did not petition the state appellate court for rehearing on grounds that the court failed to adjudicate her federal claim on the merits, such that an oversight seemed \u201cmost improbable\u201d). Rather, Viers\u2019s motion to reconsider distinguished between claims that he contended the Georgia Court of Appeals had \u201coverlooked\u201d and those he wished the court to \u201creconsider,\u201d and he specifically requested reconsideration of all of his claims regarding Dr. Aldridge\u2019s supposedly improper opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Thus, giving deference to the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s merits adjudication of the ineffective assistance claims based on failure to object to improper opinion testimony, we cannot say that the Georgia Court of Appeals unreasonably denied relief on these ineffective-counsel claims. Viers points to Dr. Aldridge\u2019s testimony that HV could show Dr. Aldridge what \u201chappened to the doll because it happened to [HV]\u201d; that HV had \u201cdefinite medical findings\u201d and that her demonstrations on the dolls were not \u201cjust a coincidence\u201d; that HV was traumatized and concerned \u201cit might happen again\u201d; and that HV\u2019s behavior was \u201cconsistent\u201d with having been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">None of Dr. Aldridge\u2019s statements was clearly objectionable under Georgia law because none went to the ultimate issue of who abused HV. <em>See McFolley, </em>289 Ga. at 892, 717 S.E.2d at 201. Moreover, in child sex abuse cases, Georgia courts have distinguished between expert testimony that the victim had in fact been sexually abused and testimony, like in this case, that a victim\u2019s \u201cphysical examination and related behavior were consistent with sexual abuse.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Odom v. State, </em>243 Ga.App. 227, 229, 531 S.E.2d 207, 210 (Ct.App.2000) (\u201c[The expert\u2019s] testimony was a permissible expression of the expert\u2019s opinion based on factors beyond the ken of the average juror. The jury was permitted to draw for itself the final conclusion as to whether the victim had, in fact, been sexually abused.\u201d (footnote omitted)). Nor did Dr. Aldridge\u2019s testimony \u201cimproperly bolster\u201d HV\u2019s credibility. <em>See id. </em>at 227-28, 531 S.E.2d at 208-09 (\u201c[T]here is absolutely nothing wrong with expert opinion testimony that bolster\u2019s [sic] the credibility of the indicted allegations of sexual abuse, e.g., \u2018the victim\u2019s physical examination showed injury consistent with sexual abuse,\u2019 or \u2018the victim\u2019s psychological evaluation was consistent with sexual abuse.\u2019 ... Since the State is required to prove its case, expert opinion testimony often becomes necessary, especially in instances of the abuse of <em>very young children.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">As this testimony was not automatically, or even clearly, entitled to exclusion under Georgia law, a reasonable attorney in Powell\u2019s position could have declined to object based on the belief that (1) the objections would be unsuccessful, and (2) unsuccessful objections might overemphasize the statements to the jury by drawing attention to the statements as particularly damaging to the defense. <em>See Bates v. Sec\u2019y, Florida Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>768 F.3d 1278, 1299 (11th Cir.2014) (noting that a potentially unmeritorious objection \u201cmight end up backfiring by highlighting testimony the jury might have otherwise ignored completely\u201d). Attorney Powell further reasonably could have concluded that the most prudent option would be to challenge Dr. Aldridge\u2019s testimony as a whole by attacking her methodology and objectivity during cross-examination, through Dr. Stark\u2019s testimony, and during closing argument. Thus, the Georgia Court of Appeals reasonably could have rejected Viers\u2019s ineffective assistance claim as to this testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>based on the performance prong.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Additionally, even assuming deficient performance, we cannot say that the Georgia Court of Appeals unreasonably concluded that Viers failed to show prejudice in light of the overwhelming evidence against him. <em>See Viers, </em>303 Ga.App. at 392, 693 S.E.2d at 531. This evidence included: Viers\u2019s shifting and implausible accounts of how HV sustained her injuries; physical evidence and expert testimony regarding the extent and nature of HVs injuries that refuted Viers\u2019s explanations of what happened to HV; wounds consistent with repeated penetration of HVs anus; and testimony about HVs fear of men and of soiling her diaper. Even if all of Dr. Aldridge\u2019s challenged testimony were excluded, the Georgia Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>or make an unreasonable determination of fact in finding no reasonable probability of a different result at trial. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 5.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">V. HV\u2019S OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">On appeal, petitioner Viers, through counsel, argues that trial attorney Powell rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to the admission of HVs out-of-court statements through the testimony of Dr. Aldridge and HV\u2019s foster father Aber-crombie. Viers contends that the Georgia Court of Appeals unreasonably denied relief on this claim because the statements (1) bore none of the indicia of reliability required by the Georgia Child Hearsay statute and (2) violated his Confrontation Clause rights. We address the Georgia Child Hearsay statute and then the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">A. Georgia\u2019s Child Hearsay Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">At the time of Viers\u2019s 2002 trial, Georgia\u2019s Child Hearsay statute, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-3-16, allowed a victim child\u2019s statements' to another person to be admitted if the child was available to testify and if the court found sufficient indicia of reliability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6x\">A statement made by a child under the age of 14 years describing any act of sexual contact or physical abuse performed with or on the child by another or performed with or on another in the presence of the child is admissible in evidence by the testimony of the person or persons to whom made if the child is available to testify in the proceedings and the court finds that the circumstances of the statement provide sufficient indicia of reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 24-3-16.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Georgia courts have explained that \u201cin-dicia of reliability\u201d must spring from the circumstances of the statement. <em>Gregg v. State, </em>201 Ga.App. 238, 240, 411 S.E.2d 65, 68 (Ct.App.1991). The factors a court may consider include but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFU\">(1) the atmosphere and circumstances under which the statement <em>was made </em>(including the time, the place, and the people present thereat); (2) the spontaneity of the child\u2019s statement to the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>sons present; (3) the child\u2019s age; (4) the child\u2019s general demeanor; (5) the child\u2019s condition (physical or emotional); (6) the presence or absence of threats or promise of benefits; (7) the presence or absence of drags or alcohol; (8) the child\u2019s general credibility; (9) the presence or absence of any coaching by parents or other third parties before or at the time of the child\u2019s statement, and the type of coaching and circumstances surrounding the same; and, the nature of the child\u2019s statement and type of language used therein; and (10) the consistency between repeated out-of-court statements by the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><em>Id. </em>Georgia courts have cautioned that \u201c[t]hese factors are to be applied neither in mechanical nor mathematical fashion, but in that manner best calculated to facilitate determination of the existence or absence of the requisite degree of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, \u201cthe fact that the statement is made days, weeks, or even several months after the alleged incident, [does not] in and of itself make the statement unreliable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Here, we cannot say that the Georgia Court of Appeals \u2014 in concluding that Powell did not render deficient performance by failing to object to HV\u2019s out-of-court statements on state-law grounds \u2014 reached a result that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Put simply, the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s ruling on this claim was not \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">While Viers contends that trial attorney Powell should have objected to the \u2022hearsay statements based on Georgia\u2019s Child Hearsay statute, \u00a7 24-3-16, the Georgia Court of Appeals reasonably concluded that attorney Powell instead made a sound strategic decision to attack the reliability of HV\u2019s statements with the testimony of a highly qualified expert, Dr. Stark, criticizing Dr. Aldridge\u2019s interview techniques, and then later in his closing argument. Attorney Powell reasonably settled on this strategy given that a motion in limine was unlikely to be successful. <em>See Ladd v. Jones, </em>864 F.2d 108, 110 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that where \u201cclaims were meritless, it was clearly not ineffective for counsel not to pursue them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Viers has not shown that no reasonable attorney would have made this decision. <em>See Rogers, </em>13 F.3d at 386 (\u201cEven if many reasonable lawyers would not have done as defense counsel did at trial, no relief can be granted on ineffectiveness grounds unless it is shown that no reasonable lawyer, in the circumstances, would have done so.\u201d). For starters, attorney Powell\u2019s testimony indicated that motions challenging \u00a7 24-3-16 hearsay testimony are generally very difficult to win. As Powell put it, \u201cthere\u2019s not much case law out there where the statements are thrown out because of indicia of reliability. There are a few. But it seems to be a fairly rare experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Indeed, the vast majority of Georgia appellate cases examining the admissibility of \u00a7 24-3-16 hearsay statements, even by very young children, find that the testimony was sufficiently reliable and properly admitted. <em>See Irving v. State, </em>320 Ga.App. 844, 845, 850-51, 740 S.E.2d 778, 781, 784-85 (Ct.App.2013) (three-year-old); <em>Whorton v.

HV\u2019s statements bore many of the markers of reliability that Georgia courts have found to be significant in upholding the admissibility of hearsay under \u00a7 24 \u2014 3\u201416:(1) HV\u2019s statements to Dr. Al-dridge occurred in a controlled setting with a forensic interviewer, not a law enforcement officer, <em>see Whorton, </em>321 Ga.App. at 341, 741 S.E.2d at 659; <em>Estrada, </em>319 Ga.App. at 764, 738 S.E.2d at 346; (2) Dr. Aldridge did not reward, or otherwise positively reinforce, HV\u2019s answers, <em>see Whorton, </em>321 Ga.App. at 341, 741 S.E.2d at 659; (3) HV\u2019s statements to her foster father, Abercrombie, were spontaneous, <em>see Newberry, </em>184 Ga.App. at 357, 361 S.E.2d at 501; and (4) there is no indication that HV was intoxicated or under the influence of any substances at the time of her statements to Dr. Aldridge and Aber-crombie, <em>see Estrada, </em>319 Ga.App. at 764, 738 S.E.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Although Viers stresses HVs young age, Georgia courts have upheld the admission of hearsay statements by children this young. See, <em>e.g. In re BH, </em>190 Ga.App. at 131, 133, 378 S.E.2d at 176, 177 (two-and-one-half-year-old); <em>Irving, </em>320 Ga.App. at 845, 850-51, 740 S.E.2d at 778, 784-85 (three-year-old). And the child\u2019s age is just one among many factors that bear on reliability under Georgia law. <em>See Gregg, </em>201 Ga.App. at 240, 411 S.E.2d at 68. Likewise, child hearsay statements are not automatically rendered unreliable just because they occurred months after the events in question, <em>see id., </em>or because they occurred over the course of repeated sessions with a forensic interviewer, <em>see, e.g., Westbrook, </em>186 Ga.App. at 495-96, 368 S.E.2d at 134 (upholding admissibility of five-year-old victim\u2019s hearsay statements that occurred over course of eleven counseling sessions with Dr. Aldridge).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Viers also points out a number of factors arguably showing the unreliability of the statements, but this ignores the fact that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to trial counsel\u2019s reasonable strategy without the distorting effects of hindsight. <em>Cf. Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Additionally, attorney Powell could reasonably have concluded that these factors (such as inconsistencies in HVs statements) were issues that he could highlight to the jury \u2014 as, in fact, he did \u2014 and not grounds for having the evidence excluded under the statute. <em>See Herrington, </em>241 Ga.App. at 329, 527 S.E.2d at 35 (\u201cBecause there were sufficient indicia of reliability, any alleged inconsistencies in the statements were a matter for the jury\u2019s consideration in weighing the evidence,- not a matter of admissibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Finally, we find unpersuasive Viers\u2019s reliance on <em>Ferreri </em>and <em>Rolader, </em>two cases where Georgia trial courts were found to have committed reversible error in admitting child hearsay statements. Although <em>Ferreri </em>and <em>Rolader </em>did involve young children under the age of five and arguably share some characteristics with this case, <em>Ferreri </em>and <em>Rolader </em>are materially and critically distinguishable from this case on at least one important fact. In both those cases, there was little to no physical evidence corroborating the victims\u2019 hearsay statements implicating the defendants. In <em>Ferreri, </em>\u201c[m]ultiple medical examinations of the victim found no physical evidence of molestation.\u201d 267 Ga.App. at 812, 600 S.E.2d at 793. And in <em>Rolader, </em>a physical examination of the child\u2019s vaginal area showed a \u201cvery red\u201d labia but no \u201ctearing\u201d or \u201cgapping,\u201d and the examining physician stated that the redness \u201ccould have been caused by the use of a bubble bath or harsh soaps or by contact with sand and dirt.\u201d 202 Ga.App. at 136, 413 S.E.2d at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Here, in contrast, HV\u2019s statements were corroborated by the medical evidence of penetration of her anus and her badly lacerated perineum. Her injuries were so severe as to require corrective surgery by a pediatric surgeon and were consistent with her statements describing how Viers hurt her. <em>Cf. Irving, </em>320 Ga.App. at 851, 740 S.E.2d at 785 (noting that \u201cthe child specified that she was struck with a belt and a stick, which is consistent with the injuries she received\u201d). Thus, applying Georgia law, the Georgia Court of Appeals reasonably could have concluded that trial counsel Powell was not deficient for failing to object to HV\u2019s hearsay statements even in light of <em>Ferreri </em>and <em>Rolader.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">B. The Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">As to Viers\u2019s contention that attorney Powell should have objected to HV\u2019s out-of-court statements on Confrontation Clause grounds, we likewise conclude that the Georgia Court of Appeals reasonably determined that Powell did not perform deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides that a criminal defendant has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. U.S. Const, amend. VI. At the time of Viers\u2019s 2002 trial, the Supreme Court had held, in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>that when a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, an out-of-court statement is admissible if (1) the government shows that the de-clarant is unavailable, and (2) the statement bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness or falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Subsequently, in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>the Supreme Court considered a Confrontation Clause claim based on hearsay statements admitted pursuant to Idaho\u2019s statutory residual hearsay exception, which operated to allow the admission of out-of-court statements of a child victim of sexual abuse. 497 U.S. 805, 817, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). The Supreme Court identified a non-exhaustive list of factors as to whether a child victim\u2019s hearsay statements bear \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d \u2014 largely reflecting the same factors identified by the Georgia courts \u2014 and explained that courts have considerable leeway in their consideration of appropriate factors. <em>See id. </em>at 821-22, 110 S.Ct. at 3150.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">After Viers\u2019s 2002 trial, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>and held that testimonial out-of-court statements are barred under the Confrontation Clause unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had an opportunity to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>examine the declarant, regardless of the statement\u2019s reliability. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[wjhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Here, Viers argues that Powell should have objected to the out-of-court statements based on <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Wright </em>because the statements lacked \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d However, for the same reasons we discussed above as to why the statements bore sufficient indicia of reliability, Viers has not demonstrated that the statements lacked \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821-22, 110 S.Ct. at 3150.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On appeal, Viers also suggests that a Confrontation Clause violation occurred because, pursuant to the Georgia Child Hearsay statute, HV necessarily was \u201cavailable to testify,\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-3-16, while under <em>Roberts </em>\u201cthe proponent of an out-of-court statement [was required to] show the declarant\u2019s unavailability....\u201d However, Viers misunderstands <em>Roberts, </em>which required the unavailability of a hearsay declarant only if the declarant was not present for cross-examination at trial. <em>See Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. In this case, although HV did not testify, the record indicates, and Viers essentially concedes, that she was present and available for cross-examination at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Prior to <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), Georgia courts had held that the Confrontation Clause was satisfied where the hearsay declarant was available for cross-examination at trial even if she did not testify. <em>See, e.g., Starr v. State, </em>269 Ga.App. 466, 469, 604 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct.App.2004), <em>overruled by Hatley v. State, </em>290 Ga. 480, 722 S.E.2d 67. (2012). Thus, Viers has failed to show' that, at the time of trial, the admission of HV\u2019s out-of-court statements ran afoul of the Confrontation Clause or that attorney Powell should have objected on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">In addition, attorney Powell\u2019s performance was not deficient for failing to anticipate that the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Roberts </em>in <em>Crawford. See Spaziano, </em>36 F.3d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">VI. PROCEDURAL DEFAULT</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court, Viers alleged Due Process and Confrontation Clause claims, independent from his ineffective assistance claims, based on the admission of Dr. Aldridge\u2019s opinion testimony and HV\u2019s out-of-court statements. In the district court, the State responded that Viers had procedurally defaulted these claims by failing to raise them in the state courts. In its order, the district court found the claims to be procedurally defaulted. The district court also determined that Viers had not shown cause for his default on grounds that: (1) Viers \u201c[did] not attempt to assert a fundamental miscarriage of justice, i.e., his actual innocence, to excuse his proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>dural default\u201d; and (2) \u201cbecause [Viers s] ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims fail, they may not serve as cause to excuse Ms procedural default of the underlying substantive claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">As an initial matter, we decline to address Viers\u2019s arguments that these claims are not in fact procedurally defaulted, as the COA is limited to the issue of whether Viers has established cause and prejudice to overcome his default. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). Based on the record, we agree with the district court that Viers has failed to show cause for failing to raise these claims in the state courts. <em>See Henderson v. Campbell, </em>353 F.3d 880, 892 (11th Cir.2003). Even if we liberally construe Viers\u2019s arguments in the district court as alleging ineffective assistance as the cause of his procedural default, Viers cannot show cause for failure to object at trial \u2014 based on attorney Powell's ineffective assistance \u2014 because, as discussed above, Powell\u2019s failure to object to HVs statements and Dr. Aldridge\u2019s opinion testimony did not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>See Brownlee v. Haley, </em>306 F.3d 1043, 1066-67 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, because Viers has failed to establish cause to overcome the procedural default of these claims, we do not address the merits of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Viers\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-7\">. Dr. Aldridge was a registered nurse; had a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology, a master\u2019s degree in social work, and a Ph.D. in clinical research; had been in practice as a licensed clinical social worker for almost fifteen years; and had evaluated \"many, many\u201d children who had been abused emotionally, psychologically, physically, or sexually.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. Dr. Stark had bachelor's and master\u2019s degrees in psychology and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. At the time of trial, he had been practicing full-time as a licensed psychologist in Georgia for thirty years, with specialization in the areas of childhood and adolescence, abuse and neglect, forensic psychology, custody' and visitation issues, and the study of allegations of abuse. Since 1966, he had interviewed thousands of children regarding abuse and neglect issues, and he was a certified forensic examiner. Dr. Stark was admitted as an expert in the fields of clinical and' forensic psychology, particularly related to children, and child sexual abuse and neglect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b967-10\">. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part I.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b967-16\">. Although handwritten, we note that Viers\u2019s brief before the Georgia Court of Appeals was neat, coherent, and clearly organized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">. Viers did not raise these claims in the state trial court prior to the denial of his motion for new trial. However, when he raised the claims in his appellate brief, the Georgia Court of Appeals \u2014 \u201cthe last state court rendering a judgment in the case\u201d \u2014 did not \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d deny relief on these claims based \"on a state procedural bar.\u201d <em>Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 263, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 1043, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989) (quotations omitted). Thus, procedural default does not bar consideration of these claims, and we must decide whether the Georgia Court of Appeals silently adjudicated the claims on the merits or overlooked them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b973-9\">. Alternatively, even assuming that the Georgia Court of Appeals overlooked Viers's remaining ineffective assistance claims based on Dr. Aldridge\u2019s opinion testimony, we conclude that these claims do not warrant relief when reviewed <em>de novo. See Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. at 390, 130 S.Ct. at 2265 (\"Courts can ... deny writs of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254. by engaging in <em>de novo </em>review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b973-16\">. This version of the Georgia Child Hearsay statute subsequently was repealed, effective January 1, 2013. <em>Irving v.

Trial attorney Powell reasonably could have found that HV's out-of-court statements bore \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d even setting aside the fact that they were corroborated by the physical evidence in this case, a factor that is not relevant under the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 822, 110 S.Ct. at 3150 (\"To be admissible under the Confrontation Clause, hearsay evidence used to convict a defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at trial.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b978-8\">. We decline to address Viers s argument on appeal that the state trial court\u2019s improperly allowing him to proceed <em>pro se </em>in his direct appeal constitutes cause, as Viers failed to raise this argument in the district court. <em>See Walker </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
