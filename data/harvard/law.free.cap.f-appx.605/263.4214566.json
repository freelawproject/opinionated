Dawson entered into a loan-modification agreement with her loan servicer, Bank of America, N.A. (the Bank). Later, Dawson sued the Bank, alleging, among other things, that it had harmed her by failing to record the modification agreement and by failing to report her payment history to credit bureaus. The district court dismissed Dawson\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Agreeing that Dawson\u2019s complaint is inadequate, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-23\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Leor Energy LLC, </em>600 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cTo survive a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). It is insufficient for a complaint to offer only \u201clabels,\u201d \u201cconclusions,\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of a cause of action\u2019s elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the plaintiff must \u201cplead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., </em>565 F.3d 228, 257 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe complaint (1) on its face (2) must contain enough factual matter (taken as true) (3) to raise a reasonable hope or expectation (4) that discovery will reveal relevant evidence of each element of a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Dawson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint is, in the district court\u2019s words, \u201cconfusing.\u201d As Dawson points out, however, we must construe it liberally. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1994). Doing so, we understand it to assert claims\u2019 against the Bank based on (1) breach of contract; (2) violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA); (3) fraud; (4) violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); and (5) violation of the Texas Property Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Considering each claim in turn, we conclude that none is supported by sufficient factual allegations to raise Dawson\u2019s right to relief \u201cabove the speculative level.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Dawson\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Dawson\u2019s complaint does not adequately allege that the Bank is liable to her for breach of contract. \u201cIn Texas, the essential elements of a breach of contract claim are (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the breach.\u201d <em>Mullins v. TestAmerica Inc., </em>564 F.3d 386, 418 (5th Cir.2009). Dawson\u2019s complaint alleges no facts tending to show that she performed under the allegedly breached contract \u2014 the modification agreement. Furthermore, the complaint does not allege what damages Dawson sustained as a result of the alleged breach of the modification agreement. Thus, Dawson has not pled \u201cenough factual matter\u201d to give rise to a reasonable inference that <em>\u201ceach element </em>\u201d of her breach-of-contract claim is satisfied, <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 257 (emphasis added), and the district court correctly dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">The district court dismissed Dawson\u2019s DTPA claim because Dawson has not plausibly alleged that she is a \u201cconsumer\u201d under the DTPA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">\u201c \u2018[C]onsumer status is an essential element of a DTPA cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., </em>726 F.3d 717, 724 (5th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Mendoza v. Am. Nat'l Ins. Co., </em>932 S.W.2d 605, 608 (Tex.App.1996)). \u201cA mortgagor qualifies as a consumer under the DTPA if his or her primary objective in obtaining the loan was to acquire a good or service, and that good or service forms the basis of the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. Although Dawson is a mortgagor, her DTPA claim is based not on the original loan but on the modification agreement. Texas law is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>a loan modification like Dawson\u2019s \u201cis not sought for the acquisition of a good or service, but rather to finance an existing loan on previously acquired property.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Ayers v. Aurora Loan Servs., LLC, </em>787 F.Supp.2d 451, 455 (E.D.Tex.2011); <em>Fix v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, </em>242 S.W.3d 147, 160 (Tex.App.2007). Thus, Dawson is not a \u201cconsumer\u201d for the purposes of the DTPA, and she states no plausible claim to relief under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The district court properly dismissed Dawson\u2019s fraud claim because her allegations of fraud do not pass muster under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). \u201cState law fraud claims are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>600 F.3d at 550-51. That Rule requires the plaintiff to \u201cstate with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). To satisfy Rule 9(b), \u201cthe plaintiff must specify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>600 F.3d at 551 (internal quotation marks omitted). Put simply, the plaintiff must set out \u201cthe who, what, when, where, and how\u201d of the fraud. <em>Benchmark Elecs. v. J.M. Huber Corp., </em>343 F.3d 719, 724 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Although Dawson\u2019s complaint emphasizes the purportedly \u201cmalicfious],\u201d \u201cunconscionable,\u201d and \u201cpredatory\u201d nature of the Bank\u2019s conduct, it is bereft of the \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how\u201d details required to satisfy Rule 9(b). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Dawson\u2019s fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The district court dismissed Dawson\u2019s FCRA claim because Dawson did not plausibly allege that the Bank is a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d under that statute. This was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The FCRA imposes certain duties on \u201cconsumer reporting agenc[ies].\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e. A \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as \u201cany person which ... assembles] or evaluates] consumer credit information ... for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681a(f). The term \u201cconsumer report,\u201d in turn, is defined <em>not </em>to include \u201cany report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1681a(d)(2)(A)(i). We have recognized that, under this \u201c \u2018transactions and experiences\u2019 exception,\u201d \u201ca bank\u2019s report of its own experience with its customers would not constitute a consumer report.\u201d <em>Hodge v. Texaco, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 1093, 1096 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also Borninski v. Williamson, </em>Civil Action No. 3:02-CV-1014-L, 2004 WL 433746, at *2, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29407, at *8 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 1, 2004) (\u201c[W]here a financial institution furnishes information based solely on its own experience with the consumer, the information is not a consumer report, and the financial institution is not under those circumstances a consumer reporting agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The Bank is a financial institution that, Dawson alleges, should have provided information \u2014 specifically, her payment history \u2014 to credit bureaus based on its experiences with her. Thus, because of the \u201ctransactions and experiences\u201d exception, Dawson has not plausibly alleged that the Bank is a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d under the FCRA, and the district court correctly dismissed her FCRA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Finally, the district court correctly dismissed Dawson\u2019s claim that the Bank vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>lated the Texas Property Code. The complaint\u2019s only mention of the Property Code is an allegation that \u201cPlaintiff does state a Cognizable Claim for Violation of the Texas Property Code; \u00a7 12.001[sic].\u201d This is a bare \u201clegal conclusion,\u201d unadorned by any factual allegations. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Accordingly, the complaint does not \u201cstate a claim to relief\u2019 under the Texas Property Code \u201cthat is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dawson\u2019s complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
