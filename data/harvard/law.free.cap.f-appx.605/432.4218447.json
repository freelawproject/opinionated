The district court imposed a sentence of 66 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within the applicable advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. Martinez challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, asserting it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). (Martinez twice objected in district court to the court\u2019s application of the 16-level enhancement for being previously deported following a conviction for a crime of violence, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii); but, he does not raise this issue here. He has, therefore, abandoned it.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-20\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guideline? is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Martinez does not claim procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">A within-Guidelines-sentencing range sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon \u00e1 showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents. a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">As Martinez concedes, his claim that the presumption should not apply because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based is foreclosed. <em>E.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). (He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible review in the future.) Likewise, our court has rejected similar contentions to those made by Martinez that the Guideline provisions are not based on \u201cempirical data\u201d because they \u201cdouble count\u201d prior offenses, and because illegal reentry offenses are at most only nonviolent international trespasses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The court heard and considered Martinez\u2019 allocution, which included his new understanding of the penalties for illegal reentry, his long-term residence, in the United States, and his desire to see his children. During sentencing, the court noted Martinez\u2019 criminal history, the violent nature of some of his convictions (as referenced <em>supra), </em>and his disregard of warnings regarding reentry. Martinez\u2019 claims amount to a disagreement over the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence. <em>E.g., Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
