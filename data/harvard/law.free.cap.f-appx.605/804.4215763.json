In her complaint, Lamar alleged that she was a special education teacher in the CCSD from August 2006 until she was constructively discharged as a result of her complaints to administrators concerning violations of a student\u2019s special education services, the changing of a date on a document, and another teacher\u2019s qualifications. On appeal, Lamar: (1) argues that the district court violated her due process rights by not giving her the opportunity to be heard and present her evidence; (2) reiterates that she alleged facts showing that the CCSD retaliated against her; and (3)briefly mentions that the district court erred in denying her motion to amend her complaint and her motion to extend discovery. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-19\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>(11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A movant also may carry its summary judgment burden by showing an absence of evidence to support the nonmovant\u2019s case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). However, \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party will not suffice to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Under Georgia\u2019s Whistleblower Act, a public employer may not \u201cretaliate against a public employee for disclosing a violation of or noncompliance with a law, rule, or regulation to either a supervisor or a government agency.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-1-4(d)(2). GWA claims are evaluated under the <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII retaliation cases. <em>Forrester v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>308 Ga.App. 716, 708 S.E.2d 660, 665 (2011). Thus, (1) a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) if the plaintiff makes a prima facie case, the employer must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action taken; and (3) then, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the stated reason for the employer\u2019s adverse action is pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 666. The elements of a prima facie case of retaliation are: (1) the employer is a public employer; (2) the employee disclosed a violation of or noncompliance with a law, rule, or regulation to a supervisor or agency; (3) the employee experienced retaliation; and (4) there is a causal relation between the disclosure and the adverse employment decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Retaliation is defined as \u201cthe discharge, suspension, <em>or </em>demotion ... or any other adverse employment action ... in the terms or conditions of employment for disclosing a violation of or noncomplianee with a law, rule, or regulation to either a supervisor or government agency.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-l-4(a)(5). While Georgia law does not define adverse employment action, we\u2019ve described it as a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2001). We define constructive discharge as working conditions \u201cso intolerable that a reasonable person in [the employee\u2019s] position would have been compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Poole v. Country Club, </em>129 F.3d 551, 553 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">To prevail on a claim of retaliation by a govei\u2019nment employer for alleged constitutionally protected speech under \u00a7 1983, an employee must show that: (1) the speech involved a matter of public concern; (2) the employee\u2019s free speech interests outweighed the employer\u2019s business interests; and (3) the speech played a substantial role in the adverse employment action. <em>Boyce v. Andrew, </em>510 F.3d 1333, 1342 n. 12 (11th Cir.2007). The employer then has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision absent the protected speech. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has held that a public employee\u2019s speech is not protected when his statements are made pursuant to his official duties, as opposed to when he is speaking as a private citizen on matters of public concern. <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). We have subsequently modified the first prong of the test to determine: (1) whether the employee spoke as an employee or as a citizen; and (2) whether the speech addressed an issue relating to the employer\u2019s purpose or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>matter of public concern. <em>Boyce, </em>510 F.3d at 1342. To qualify as constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment, the speech must be made by a government employee speaking as a citizen and be on a subject of public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 1342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">A subject of public concern relates to a matter of political, social, or other concern to the community. <em>Watkins v. Bowden, </em>105 F.3d 1344, 1353 (11th Cir.1997). To decide if an employee\u2019s speech relates to his job as opposed to an issue of public concern, we examine the content, form, and context of a given statement, on the record as a whole. <em>Boyce, </em>510 F.3d at 1343. An employee cannot transform a personal grievance into a matter of public concern by invoking the public\u2019s interest in how an institution is run. <em>Id. </em>at 1344. \u201cThe relevant inquiry is not whether the public would be interested in the topic of the speech at issue but rather is \u2018whether the purpose of [the plaintiffs] speech was to raise issues of public concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maggio v. Sipple, </em>211 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the CCSD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As for Lamar\u2019s prima facie showing under the GWA, no jury could find that she suffered an adverse employment action as a result of her complaints about alleged violations of education statutes. As the undisputed record shows, Lamar resigned from her position in December 2012. However, other than her claim that her resignation was a constructive discharge, Lamar has not shown that she experienced a serious and material change in the terms or conditions of her employment. Indeed, she acknowledged that her \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d and carpool duties were part of her job duties. Nor did she show that any of her job duties changed as a result of her speech. While the principal suggested that she may be placed on a performance development plan (\u201cPDP\u201d), Lamar did not receive one, nor was she subject to any other type of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">Lamar claims that she suffered a constructive discharge because her supervisor disagreed with her change in a student\u2019s individualized education plan (\u201cIEP\u201d), she got \u201clooks\u201d from the staff, she had disagreements with another teacher, someone forged a special education document of hers, and she was threatened with being placed on a PDP. But these allegations do not create working conditions \u201cso intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have been compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>129 F.3d at 553. Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the CCSD on the GWA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">As for her free speech claims under \u00a7 1983 and the Georgia Constitution, no jury could find that her speech was constitutionally protected as a statement by a private citizen on a matter of public concern. Lamar\u2019s statements were made pursuant to her official duties as a special education teacher. Although Lamar\u2019s primary duty was to implement special education services for students, she also was a member of the IEP team, which developed the educational program for each student. Her statements concerning a student\u2019s IEP services were made within this role as an IEP team member determining the services for this student. Her concerns about a possible forged document were also made within her role as a special education teacher, ensuring that her paperwork was accurate. While the public does have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>interest in ensuring schools appropriately educate students with disabilities, Lamar\u2019s speech did not have the purpose of raising these issues as a public concern, but rather served to address issues personally affecting her work and issues arising within the duties of the IEP team. Lamar even explained that she was concerned about the possible forged document because late paperwork could affect her negatively. Because she failed to establish that her alleged speech was constitutionally protected, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the CCSD on Lamar\u2019s free speech claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Finally, we decline to consider the argument briefly mentioned in Lamar\u2019s statement of the issues that the district court erred in denying her motion to amend her complaint and her motion to extend discovery. A legal claim or argument not briefed on appeal is deemed abandoned and its merits are not considered. <em>Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n. 1 (11th Cir.1994) (applying this standard to a <em>pro se </em>brief). An issue is abandoned when \u201ca party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal [fails to] plainly and prominently so indicate.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Passing reference to an issue does not suffice to raise it on appeal. <em>Hamilton v. Southland Christian School, Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Even construing Lamar\u2019s brief liberally, she fails to plainly and prominently raise either of these claims on appeal and has abandoned them. As the record shows, she does not make any arguments about her motion'to amend her second amended complaint in her appellate brief other than one statement within her statement of the issues. While Lamar does make a reference outside of the statement of the issues to her argument that the district court erred in denying her motion to extend discovery, this argument is in passing and, therefore, is not plain or prominent. Accordingly, Lamar has abandoned these arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">. Lamar's arguments regarding due process are all connected to her claim that'the district court incorrectly granted summary judgment to CCSD, so we consider them in this context only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
