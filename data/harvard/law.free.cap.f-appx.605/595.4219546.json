Their attorneys have moved for leave to withdraw, and have filed briefs under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the substantive reasonableness of the respective sentences. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">This court concludes that the district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence in either case. <em>See United States v. David, </em>682 F.3d 1074, 1076-77 (8th Cir.2012) (discussing appellate review of sentencing'decisions); <em>see also United States v. Cook, </em>698 F.3d 667, 670 (8th Cir.2012) (on appeal, applying presumption of reasonableness to within-G\u00faidelines-range sentence). An independent review of both records reveals no nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">The judgments in both cases are affirmed.
