This time, the sole issue on appeal is the district court\u2019s ruling on remand that denied Plaintiffs-Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>lants\u2019 Rule 59 Motion and determined the precise amounts of the sanctions under Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Like everything heretofore presented by Plaintiffs-Appellants and their counsel, both to the district court and to us in the prior appeal, the instant appeal is totally without basis in fact and in law and wholly unmeritorious. We therefore affirm all rulings presented in this appeal, but note in passing that Plaintiffs-Appellants and their counsel are fortunate that Defendant-Appellee has not sought further sanctions or penalties under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 for a frivolous appeal. We nevertheless caution Plaintiffs-Appellants and their counsel against further prolongation of this unduly protracted and meritless litigation, lest they incur additional sanctions and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
