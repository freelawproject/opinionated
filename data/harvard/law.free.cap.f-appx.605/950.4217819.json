Tavarez argues that the district court erred by add<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>ing one point to his criminal history score based on a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Al.l(c) (Nov. 2013), which made him ineligible for relief under the safety valve, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(1). The district court ruled that it could assess Tavarez one criminal history point because he was not entitled to have the assistance of counsel for a misdemeanor offense for which he received a sentence of probation and, alternatively, that one criminal history point could be assessed for Tavarez\u2019s monetary f\u00edne regardless of whether his sentence of probation was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment, <em>see United States v. Acuna-Reyna, </em>677 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir.2012). Because Tavarez fails to present any argument against the alternative finding by the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">Tavarez contests the addition of one point to his criminal history based on his prior uncounseled conviction because his sentence of probation could have led to an actual deprivation of his liberty, but we need not address this argument because Tavarez fails to challenge the alternative finding by the district court. The district court assessed the criminal history point based on our decision in <em>Acuna-Reyna </em>where the defendant, like Tavarez, argued that he could not be assessed a criminal history point based on a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction for which he was sentenced to probation. <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. We avoided deciding that issue and held that, even assuming that the sentence of probation violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel and could not be considered in determining his criminal history, his prior conviction and monetary fine were still valid and could be counted as a prior sentence under section 4Al.l(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1285-86. Ta-varez fails to challenge the alternative finding that, under <em>Acuna-Reyna, </em>his monetary f\u00edne counts as a prior sentence. We will not reverse a \u201cjudgment that is based on multiple, independent grounds, [unless] an appellant ... convinces us that every stated ground for the judgment against him is incorrect,\u201d and Tavarez has abandoned any challenge that he could have made to the alternative ruling. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014). For that reason, Tavarez\u2019s sentence \u201cis due to be affirmed,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We AFFIRM Tavarez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
