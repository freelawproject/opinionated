On appeal, Arellano argues that his sentences are substantively unreasonable because the district court did not make an individualized assessment of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors and considered the impermissible factors of his past drug use, convictions, and arrest while on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">We review the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">A district court must revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervision and impose a prison term if the defendant violated his conditions of supervised release by possessing a controlled substance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2000) <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Tapia v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2389, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), <em>as recognized in United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1309 (11th Cir.2014). Unlike \u00a7 3583(e), which governs permissive release revocation, the subsection governing mandatory revocation, \u00a7 3583(g), does not require the court to consider any of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), (g); <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241. A district court need not specifically state that it is compelled to revoke supervised release under \u00a7 3583(g) if the conditions implicating the provision are present. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242 (\u201cAlthough not mentioned by the district court, Brown\u2019s revocation was mandatory because he possessed a controlled substance.... \u201d). When a defendant is sentenced under subsection (g), the only limitation is that the term of imprisonment must not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under \u00a7 3583(e)(3). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">We vacate a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotations omitted). Additionally, although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Nevertheless, the district court must have made an individualized assessment based on the facts of the case. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">Although the district court did not explicitly state that it found revocation mandatory, Arellano\u2019s admission that he possessed cocaine implicates \u00a7 3583(g). <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242. Thus, even though Arellano argues his sentence is substantively unreasonable, the court arguably was not required to even consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241. In any event, Arellano has not demonstrated that his sentences, each within the guideline range, were outside the range of reasonable sentences that the district court could have permissibly considered. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190. While we do not automatically presume Arella-no\u2019s within range sentences to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a result. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. If the district court gave more weight to Arellano\u2019s undisputed history of drug use and continued criminal violations than to any other fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>tor, it was not an abuse of discretion because the sentences do not fall outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Moreover, Arellano\u2019s drug use, past convictions, and arrest while on bond were relevant to his history and characteristics. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Thus, he does not prevail on his argument that these matters w\u00e9re impermissible considerations. Moreover, the district court explicitly considered the guideline ranges for the two petitions to revoke his supervised release, whether to run the two federal sentences concurrently or consecutively to Arellano\u2019s state sentence, and Arellano\u2019s conduct while out on bond, all of which show that the record belies Arellano\u2019s contention that the court failed to make an individualized assessment. Accordingly, we affirm Arel-lano\u2019s sentences as substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
