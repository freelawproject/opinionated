Specifically, he challenges the reimposition of a $100 special assessment in the district court\u2019s written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-22\">We generally review revocation sentences under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). A review of the transcript of the instant revocation hearing reflects that the district court\u2019s reimposition of the special assessment in the written judgment is contrary to its oral pronouncement and to evidence presented at the hearing. Therefore, as the government concedes, a conflict exists between the oral and written judgments. In such a situation, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001). We therefore modify the district court\u2019s judgment, striking the reimposed $100 special assessment so that the written judgment conforms with the oral pronouncement, and we affirm the judgment as modified. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>United States v.
