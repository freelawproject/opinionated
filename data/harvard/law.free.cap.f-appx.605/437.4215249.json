The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>dismissed the action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Because the district court cited both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A as authority for its dismissal, our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Cooper fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that no claim is stated in his complaint because his mere disagreement with medical officials\u2019 treatment plan is not actionable. Additionally, Cooper fails to address the district court\u2019s conclusion that he presented no factual allegations that would show that the defendants knew of an excessive risk to his health or safety but nevertheless chose to disregard that risk. Because Cooper\u2019s brief is inadequate as to those claims, we dismiss them as frivolous. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Cooper\u2019s claim of negligence and carelessness is an attempt to advance an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d and is thus frivolous. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir.1999); How<em>ard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We dismiss this frivolous appeal sua sponte. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of his complaint by the district court and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Cooper is WARNED that if he receives a third strike he will not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in'any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Cooper\u2019s requested for the appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
