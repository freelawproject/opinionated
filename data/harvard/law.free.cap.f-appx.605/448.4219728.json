Grant, </em>683 F.3d 639, 641 (5th Cir.2012). He has been released from prison but now serves concurrent terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Grant challenges, <em>pro se, </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of his January 2014 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, filed while he was imprisoned. The motion was dismissed as an unauthorized successive motion. <em>E.g., United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Additionally, Grant contests the denial , of his motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s judgment of that dismissal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Grant is barred from challenging these rulings unless he obtains a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). The district court did not rule whether Grant was entitled to a COA. Although our court has yet to decide, in the \u00a7 2255 context, whether a district court\u2019s failure to rule on a COA application deprives us of jurisdiction, \u201c[o]ur precedents have held, unequivocally, that ... the lack of a ruling on a COA in the district court causes this court to be without jurisdiction to consider the appeal\u201d. <em>Cardenas v. Thaler, </em>651 F.3d 442, 444-45 (5th Cir.2011) (emphasis, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted). Because there is no COA ruling by the district court, we assume, without deciding, that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>E.g., United States </em>v. <em>Ubani, </em>582 Fed.Appx. 333, 333 (5th Cir.2014) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>Rule 11(a), Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Regarding whether we should remand this matter to district court for it to decide whether to grant a COA, Grant contends his January 2014 \u00a7 2255 motion was not successive because he filed no prior \u00a7 2255 motion; he claims his prior (August 2012) motion was for reconsideration. Because the August 2012 motion was indisputably a \u00a7 2255 . motion, Grant\u2019s January 2014 \u00a7 2255 motion was successive. <em>See Burton v. Stewart, </em>549 U.S. 147, 153, 127 S.Ct. 793, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007) (holding that a proposed application is successive if it is another attempt to contest \u201cthe same custody imposed by the same judgment\u201d that was contested in an earlier proceeding). We decline to remand in order for the district court to make the COA determination in the first instance, as remand would be futile and a waste of judicial resources. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). Concerning the standard for granting a COA, and because Grant\u2019s appeal is utterly baseless, no jurist of reason would debate whether, or agree that, he should be encouraged to proceed with it. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
