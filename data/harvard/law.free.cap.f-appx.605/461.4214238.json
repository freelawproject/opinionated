The BIA held that sua sponte reopening was not warranted, notwithstanding a state court order giving Funez custody of her minor child and determining that it was in the child\u2019s best interest to remain in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Funez\u2019s arguments in this court are limited to the question whether the BIA erred in failing to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen the removal proceedings in light of the state court\u2019s order. Funez has failed to show that there is a legal question or constitutional claim that would support this court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the agency\u2019s refusal to exercise its discretion to reopen the removal proceedings sua sponte. <em>See Bustamante-Barrera v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 388, 400-01 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, </em>220 (5th Cir.2008). To the extent that Funez-Martinez\u2019s removal will affect her daughter, the proper vehicle for raising that issue is a cancellation of removal proceeding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
