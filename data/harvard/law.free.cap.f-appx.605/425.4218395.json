Tabot challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the BIA\u2019s affirmance of that finding..</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">Tabot has briefed only her challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision and the BIA\u2019s December 18, 2013, affirmance of that decision. Because, however, Tabot did not file a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s December 18, 2013, decision, that decision is not before the court. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 401-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003). Moreover, Tabot has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen by failing to brief the issue sufficiently. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Tabot has waived her claim for relief. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-23\">Tabot\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
