On appeal, Williams contends that the court unlawfully enhanced his sentence by ruling that his prior state drug convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) were \u201cserious drug offense[s],\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), and \u201ccontrolled substance offense[s],\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Because this Court recently held in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014), that \u201cSection 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes is both a \u2018serious drug offense,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), and a \u2018controlled substance offense,\u2019 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b),\u201d we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">A federal grand jury indicted Williams on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1). Williams pled guilty without the benefit of a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) describes three prior Florida state-court convictions for \u201cpossession with intent to sell, manufacture or deliver cocaine\u201d and one Florida state-court conviction for resisting an officer with violence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Based on these prior convictions, the probation officer initially assigned Williams a base offense level of 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.2(b), because Williams committed the instant offense after sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. But since Williams also qualified as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based on these same convictions, the PSR instead applied a base offense level of 33 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Williams\u2019s resulting advisory guideline range was 188 to 235 months of imprisonment, and as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Williams objected to the enhancements based on his prior convictions, contending that the Florida drug convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) were not qualifying predicate offenses under either the ACCA or the Sentencing Guidelines because the offenses did not require proof of a <em>mens rea </em>as to the illicit nature of the controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Williams\u2019s objections and imposed a sentence of 180 months of imprisonment, noting that the length of the sentence was \u201coutrageous\u201d but was what the law required. The court stated that it would have imposed a 71-month sentence in the absence of the statutory minimum. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009). Likewise, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1505 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Under the ACCA, an individual convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence if he has three previous federal or state convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines, a higher base offense level applies \u201cif the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions- of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d The Guidelines define \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d in turn, as \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">Florida law provides that it is a crime to \u201csell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). Where the offense involves cocaine, it is a second-degree felony carrying a 15-year maximum term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>893.03(2)(a)(4), 775.082(3)(d). In 2002, the Florida legislature amended \u00a7 893.18(l)(a) by eliminating knowledge of the illicit nature of a substance as an element of controlled substance offenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.101(1)-(2); <em>see State v. Adkins, </em>96 So.3d 412, 415-16, 423 (Fla.2012) (upholding the constitutionality of the law). Lack of knowledge is now an affirmative defense. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Williams argues that his prior cocaine convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) were not \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d or \u201ccontrolled substance offense[s]\u201d because \u00a7 893.13 does not require proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. Relying primarily on our opinions in <em>Donawa v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>735 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir.2013), and <em>Young v. United States, </em>936 F.2d 533 (11th Cir.1991), he argues that <em>mens rea </em>is an implied, essential element of any qualifying crime under the ACCA or the Sentencing Guidelines. He further contends that the rule of lenity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the presumption in favor of mental culpability require that these provisions be construed in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In <em>Donawa, </em>we held that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2), as amended by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101, was not a \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d as defined 18' U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2), and therefore was not a \u201cdrug trafficking aggravated felony\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a) and 1101(a)(43)(B). 735 F.3d at 1279-82. Using the categorical approach, pursuant to which we look \u201conly to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the offense,\u201d we asked whether \u201cthe state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280 (quoting <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1684, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (quotation marks omitted)). Because the federal analogue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, to the Florida controlled substance offense \u201crequires the government to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt and without exception, that the defendant had knowledge of the nature of the substance in his possession,\u201d but Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1)(a)(2) does not, we held \u201cthat Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2), as amended by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101, does not qualify as a drug trafficking aggravated felony under the categorical approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Similarly, in <em>Young, </em>we held that state crimes were \u201ccontrolled substance offense[s]\u201d only if they were \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to federal drug trafficking crimes. 936 F.2d at 536-38. For purposes of our decision in <em>Young, </em>the Guidelines defined a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as \u201can offense identified in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 845b, 856, 952(a), 955, 955a, 959, and similar offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(2) (Nov.1988). That definition was amended in 1989. <em>See Young, </em>936 F.2d at 536 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">After this appeal was fully briefed, this Court decided <em>Smith, </em>resolving the two issues currently before us. Specifically, we addressed whether the definitions of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) and \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) include \u201ccrimes that, do not require an element of <em>mens rea </em>regarding the illicit nature of the controlled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>stance.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1264. After considering and rejecting the same arguments raised in this appeal, we held that \u201cSection 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes is both a \u2018serious drug offense,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), and a \u2018controlled substance offense,\u2019 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1266-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In reaching that holding, we explained that the defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Donawa </em>was unavailing, stating, \u201cWe need not search for the elements of \u2018generic\u2019 definitions of \u2018serious drug offense\u2019 and \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 because these terms are defined by a federal statute and the Sentencing Guidelines, respectively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267. Looking to the plain language of the definitions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b)(2), we concluded that neither definition expressed or implied an \u201celement of <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201cwe presume that Congress and the Sentencing Commission said what they meant and meant what they said.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Finding the relevant definitions \u201cunambiguous,\u201d we also rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments based on the presumption in favor of mental culpability and the rule of lenity. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we explained that our holding in <em>Young </em>did not control because \u201cthe definition of \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 that we interpreted in <em>Young </em>is distinct from the definition at issue in this appeal.\u201d <em>Id</em>. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(2) (Nov.1988), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (Nov.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">In view of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith, </em>the district court correctly concluded that Williams\u2019s prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) qualified as both \u201cserious drug offense[s],\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), and \u201ccontrolled substance offense[s],\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Therefore, we affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. \"The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.\u201d <em>United States v.
