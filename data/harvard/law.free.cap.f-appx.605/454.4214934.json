(\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) improperly foreclosed on Plaintiffs\u2019 home. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants on multiple claims. Plaintiffs only appeal the dismissal of their claim that Defendants \u201ctemporarily waived their right to foreclose on Plaintiffs\u2019 home\u201d by accepting payments under a forbearance agreement and then \u201cfail[ing] to give [Plaintiffs] notice that strict compliance [with the original terms of the loan] would be required before foreclosing.\u201d The district court correctly determined that Plaintiffs failed to show waiver of Defendants\u2019 right to foreclose; therefore, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 waiver claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">In 2001, Plaintiffs executed a note and deed of trust to finance the purchase of them home (the \u201cProperty\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs defaulted on the loan in March 2008, entered into a loan modification agreement with Wells Fargo in May 2008, and defaulted on that agreement in November 2008. Plaintiffs kept in close contact with Wells Fargo about further loan modification from December 2008 until October 2009. During this period, Plaintiffs received several notices that the Property would be foreclosed upon. Each time, in December of 2008 and in April and May of 2009, Plaintiffs contacted Wells Fargo and received assurances that no foreclosure would occur while loan modification was under review \u2014 and no foreclosure occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">Plaintiffs signed a loan modification agreement (\u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) in May 2009, which required Plaintiffs to make three payments of $1000.00 over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>three months, followed by a payment of $14,701.43, due on September 27, 2009 (\u201cballoon payment).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs informed Wells Fargo that they could not make the final balloon payment. They allege that Wells Fargo advised them to make the first three payments, after which they would be considered for a different loan modification program. Plaintiffs did so, but defaulted on the Forbearance Agreement on September 27, 2009, when they could not make the $14,701.43 payment. On September 22, 2009, Plaintiffs were notified that they might be eligible for the aforementioned loan modification program. Wells Fargo ultimately granted no further loan modification, although Plaintiffs allege phone conversations led them to believe they were in the process of enrolling in a new program.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">On October 12, 2009, Plaintiffs received notice of a foreclosure sale scheduled for November 3, 2009. The Property was foreclosed upon on November 3, 2009. Plaintiffs filed suit in state court and the case was removed to federal district court. The district court ultimately dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 waiver claim on summary judgment, citing the non-waiver provision in the deed of trust and determining that Plaintiffs did not \u201cpoint[ ] to any evidence that Wells Fargo intentionally relinquished its right to foreclose or acted in a way inconsistent with its right to foreclose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Although we do not countenance the disorganized conduct Plaintiffs allege or the confusion and uncertainty engendered by it, that conduct is not relevant here. The district court correctly determined that the evidence does not show a waiver of Defendants\u2019 right to foreclose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs did not address the dismissal of their other claims, so we deem those matters abandoned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-17\"> Pursuant to '5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
