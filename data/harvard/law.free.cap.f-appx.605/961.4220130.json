We issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue: \u201cWhether Tittle\u2019s due-process rights were violated when the [Pinellas County Circuit Court] failed to evaluate his competency before accepting his guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-21\">\u201c[T]he conviction of an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process.\u201d <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 838, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). <em>\u201cPate </em>... established a rebuttable presumption of incompetency upon a showing by a habeas petitioner that the state trial court failed to hold a competency hearing on its own initiative despite information raising a bona fide doubt as to the petitioner\u2019s competency.\u201d <em>James v. Singletary, </em>957 F.2d 1562, 1571 (11th Cir.1992). The COA issued in this case framed a <em>Pate </em>claim. Tittle contends that the information before, the Pinellas County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Circuit Court at the time he pleaded guilty raised a bona fide doubt as to his competency to stand trial such that the court was required, but failed, to hold a hearing to determine his competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Florida law holds that <em>Pate </em>claims \u201ccan and must be raised on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Nelson v. State, </em>43 So.3d 20, 33 (Fla.2010) (per curiam) (citing <em>James, </em>957 F.2d at 1572). Tittle did not take a direct appeal from his convictions. He did not raise the claim until he moved the Pinellas County Circuit Court for collateral relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. The Circuit Court refused to consider the claim on collateral attack, holding that the claim was procedurally defaulted because Tittle had not raised it on direct appeal. The Circuit Court held alternatively that at the time Tittle pleaded guilty, the court had no information before it sufficient to require a competency evaluation. Tittle appealed, and the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed. <em>Tittle v. State, </em>44 So.3d 591 (Fla.2d Dist.Ct.App.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">In disposing of Tittle\u2019s habeas petition, the District Court upheld the Florida courts\u2019 procedural-default ruling on the ground that it \u201crest[ed] upon [an] \u2018independent and adequate\u2019 state ground.\u201d <em>Judd v. Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). Doc. 16, at 8. We find no error in the District Court\u2019s holding. We likewise find ho error in the District Court\u2019s holding that Tittle failed to demonstrate cause for the procedural default and resulting prejudice. Doc. 16, at 9-10. Tittle is therefore not entitled to habeas corpus relief on the ground that the Pinellas County Circuit Court denied him due process of law in failing to evaluate his competency before accepting his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-22\">. Tittle is serving concurrent sentences of 30 years (the statutory mandatory minimum sentence) on Counts 1 and <em>2, </em>and 15 years on Count 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
