Terry Adkins is serving prison sentences, which total 900 months, that were imposed in the Eastern District of Kentucky in 2003 following his conviction at a bench trial of one count of conspiracy to possess visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1), ninety-nine counts of receiving such depictions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), and one count of possession of such depictions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). He seeks a writ of habe-as corpus on the ground that, in calculating the sentence range under the Guidelines, the trial court used the 2003 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, instead of the 2002 version of the Guidelines in effect at the time his offenses ended, and thereby violated the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause under <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>569 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013). <em>Adkins v. Warden, FCI-Marianna, </em>2014 WL 840067 (N.D.Fla.). Moreover, in using the 2003 version, the court was able to impose consecutive sentences to reach a total sentence within the Guidelines sentence range.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Prior to filing his \u00a7 2241 petition, Adkins had unsuccessfully moved the trial court to vacate his sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because the law forbid the trial court from entertaining a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, Adkins sought the vacation of his sentences in this \u00a7 2241 proceeding under the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The District Court dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition, concluding that he failed to satisfy the requirements of the savings claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">A district court has the power to grant a \u00a7 2241 writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner who is in custody in that court\u2019s judicial district, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a), (d), here the Northern District of Florida. This power is limited, however, by \u00a7 2255(e), commonly referred to as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-13\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by [a \u00a7 2255 motion], shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus\u201d includes a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">Where a prisoner, like Adkins, has already prosecuted unsuccessfully a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from a court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h). Such restriction on a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, standing alone, does not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1267. Consequently, a petitioner who unsuccessfully prosecuted a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions by simply filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">Following our decision in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>2011) (en banc), we held in <em>Bryant </em>that, in order to bring a \u00a7 2241 challenge to the legality of his detention, a petitioner must make a five-part showing that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. He must show that: (1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and original \u00a7 2255 proceeding, his claim was squarely foreclosed by binding precedent; (2) his current claim is based on a Supreme Court decision that overturned the precedent that had foreclosed his claim; (3) that Supreme Court decision is retroactively applicable on collateral review; (4) as a result of the application of the new rule, his sentences exceed the applicable statutory maximum penalties; and (5) the savings clause reaches his claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Pertinent to Adkins\u2019s present claim, in <em>Peugh, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that \u201cthere is an <em>ex post facto </em>violation when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>Peugh, </em>568 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2078. Also pertinent to Adkins\u2019s claim, a defendant convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a) or (b) is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years and a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Adkins\u2019s petition. Adkins\u2019s prior \u00a7 2255 motion was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d because he has failed to satisfy the fourth element of <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>analytical framework. He has not shown that his sentences for each of his offenses exceeded the applicable statutory maximum penalties of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 2252, as his sentences ranged from 120 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the trial court was required to impose consecutive sentences. Moreover, <em>Gilbert\u2019s </em>holding\u2014 that the savings clause \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the Sentencing Guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum\u201d \u2014 does apply to Adkins\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\">. The 20-year statutory maximum under this provision became effective on April 30, 2003, while Adkins\u2019s offense conduct was still ongoing; the indictment alleged that his offense conduct began in September 2002 and continued through July 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
