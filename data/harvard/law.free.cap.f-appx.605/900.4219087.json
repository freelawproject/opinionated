No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). On appeal, Spears argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling because (1) his plea counsel led him to believe he had no right to an appeal; and (2) mental health issues, medication, and prison transfers prevented him from timely filing a \u00a7 2254 petition. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">Spears was indicted in February 2010 on counts of murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, and kidnapping. The State originally sought the death penalty. Following plea negotiations, Spears pled guilty to a subset of these offenses and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in March 2001. He did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">Before pleading guilty, Spears stated in his \u201cpetition to enter plea of guilty\u201d that he intended to plead \u201cguilty but mentally ill.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00d3.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-7-131 (explaining when a court may accept a \u201cguilty but mentally ill\u201d plea and defining the term \u201cmentally ill\u201d). Spears\u2019s present \u00a7 2254 petition reflects his belief that he entered such a guilty plea. However, nothing in the guilty-plea transcript or the trial court\u2019s written judgment indicates that he pled \u201cguilty but mentally ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">At Spears\u2019s guilty-plea hearing, Spears\u2019s counsel stated that Spears was taking Zoloft and. that he \u201chad some psychological problems.\u201d Spears told the court that taking Zoloft did not affect his ability to understand what was going on. Spears\u2019s counsel also stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alqq\">[Spears] has chosen life and he has chosen to accept the responsibility for the tragedy and he knows because of this hope for redemption and his faith that he will be redeemed and that perhaps even though he is pleading to life without parole that one day he may be reunited with his family. There will be no trial and there will be no endless years of appeals and things like that.... It ends today and their wounds can begin to heal today....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>In December 2007, Spears filed his first collateral challenge to his conviction \u2014 a ha-beas-corpus petition in Georgia state court. He alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and challenged whether his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. At the state habeas evidentiary hearing, Spears\u2019s former counsel testified that he initially had considered an insanity defense for Spears. However, counsel explained, a mental health expert evaluated Spears, and, although the evaluation showed that Spears had \u201csome anti-social disorders,\u201d it did not provide a sufficient basis for an insanity defense. Counsel also testified that he believed based on numerous interactions and communications with Spears that Spears was competent to enter a guilty plea. The state court denied Spears\u2019s habeas petition on October 7, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\">In June 2012, Spears filed the instant federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, raising similar arguments to those that he made in his state petition. In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Spears appears to concede that the petition was untimely but asserts that the untimeliness may be excused because his counsel misled him into believing that he had no right to an appeal, and because, once convicted, he was transferred \u201cfrom prison to prison in a state of psychotherapy drug-induced near sedation.\u201d The State moved to dismiss Spears\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In response to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, Spears explained that he did not seek information about his appeal or post-conviction rights for years following his conviction because, based on his attorneys statements at the guilty-plea hearing, he did not believe that he had the right to appeal. In addition, Spears reiterated that he \u201cwas transferred from prison to prison while drugged to near-sedation,\u201d which, he asserted, made it difficult to establish any connection with his fellow prisoners and learn that his attorney was incorrect. In support, Spears also submitted prison records showing that he had been transferred between prisons five times for mental-health reasons from August 2001 to April 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Without holding an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation rejecting Spears\u2019s arguments for equitable tolling and recommending that his \u00a7 2254 petition be dismissed as untimely. The judge found that Spears had not established an extraordinary circumstance that prevented timely filing and that Spears had not exercised due diligence because he provided no explanation of his actions from the time of the guilty plea in 2001 until the time that he filed for state post-conviction relief in 2007. The district court overruled Spears\u2019s <em>pro se </em>objections, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissed Spears\u2019s \u00a7 2254 as untimely, and denied a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">This Court appointed Spears counsel and granted a COA on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in finding, without holding an evidentiary hearing, that Mr. Spears was not entitled to equitable tolling for the filing of his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002). We likewise review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal decision on equitable tolling. <em>Id. </em>However, we review for clear error the court\u2019s determination of the relevant facts. <em>Id. </em>In this regard, the district court\u2019s determination regarding a party\u2019s diligence is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing on an equitable-tolling claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Under the AEDPA, \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions are subject to a one-year statute of limitations that begins to run on the latest of four triggering events. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Here, the relevant trigger was \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). There is no dispute that Spears\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was filed beyond the one-year time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">However, the district court may still review the merits of an untimely \u00a7 2254 petition if the petitioner shows that he is entitled to equitable tolling. <em>San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir.2011). To do so, a petitioner must show \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). In proving an \u201cextraordinary circumstance,\u201d a petitioner must \u201cshow a causal connection between the alleged extraordinary circumstances and the late filing of the petition.\u201d <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267. The extraordinary circumstance must be \u201cunavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>See Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir.1999). The diligence required is \u201creasonable diligence, not maximum feasible diligence.\u201d <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267 (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner has the burden of proving that circumstances justify applying the equitable-tolling doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Here, the district court did not err in finding, without holding an evidentiary hearing, that Spears was not entitled to equitable tolling for the filing of his \u00a7 2254 petition. First, Spears has not shown that his attorney\u2019s misleading advice that he did not have the right to an appeal was an extraordinary circumstance that affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>his ability to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267. To the extent that Spears contends that his counsel was negligent in misadvising him, we are bound by our precedent holding that \u201cattorney negligence, however gross or egregious, does not qualify as an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 for purposes of equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>742 F.3d 473, 481 (11th Cir.2014). Therefore, even assuming that his attorney was negligent, equitable tolling would not be warranted on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Spears also has not shown how his attorney\u2019s misleading advice regarding his appellate rights prevented him from timely filing a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 649, 130 S.Ct. at 2562. While we understand why Spears might have chosen to rely on his counsel\u2019s advice, he had the ability to choose not to rely upon it. We have stated that <em>\u201cpro se </em>litigants, like all others, are deemed to know of the one-year statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Outler v. United States, </em>485 F.3d 1273, 1282 n. 4 (11th Cir.2007) (concerning the one-year limitation period for motions by federal prisoners under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). And we have not accepted a lack of a legal education as an excuse for a failure to file in a timely fashion. <em>See Rivers v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201cprocedural ignorance [has never been accepted] as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statute\u2019s clear policy calls for promptness\u201d) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 311, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 1582, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Nonetheless, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Spears was able to show that his attorney\u2019s misleading advice constituted an extraordinary circumstance that prevented him. from filing both a direct appeal and a timely \u00a7 2254 motion, Spears has failed to show he was reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights, as explained below. Before reaching the question of due diligence, however, we first address Spears\u2019s other alleged extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Regarding Spears\u2019s allegations about his mental incapacity, and prison transfers, some basis exists for concluding that Spears was prevented from timely filing a \u00a7 2254 petition by extraordinary circumstances for some period of time. Spears specifically alleged that he \u201cwas transferred from prison to prison while drugged to near-sedation.\u201d While this allegation is fairly conclusory, the prison-transfer form offers some support, indicating that he was .transferred five times for mental health reasons during the AEDPA limitation period. And several of the transfers were in quick succession. Over roughly a three-month period, from January 18, 2002, to April 11, 2002, Spears was transferred four times for mental-health reasons. Based on these facts, the period in which Spears was \u201cdrugged to near-sedation\u201d and transferred between prisons may constitute an exceptional circumstance for purposes of equitable tolling because it would have been outside of his control and unavoidable even with due diligence. <em>See Sandvik, </em>177 F.3d at 1271-72. <em>But see Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2004) (indicating that equitable tolling is inapplicable for periods of lockdown or for routine prison transfers).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">But Spears\u2019s remaining allegations of mental incapacity are insufficient to show a causal connection to his untimely filing. \u201c[M]ental impairment is not <em>per se </em>a reason to toll a statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Ferrell, </em>587 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2009). Rather, the alleged impairment must have affected Spears\u2019s ability to file a timely habeas petition. <em>Id.; see Lawrence v. Florida, </em>421 F.3d 1221, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Lawrence, </em>we concluded that a petitioner\u2019s allegations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>his full-scale IQ was 81 and that he had \u201csuffered from mental impairments his entire life\u201d alone were insufficient to justify equitable tolling because they did not establish a \u201ccausal connection between his alleged mental incapacity and his ability to file a timely petition.\u201d 421 F.3d at 1226-27. By contrast, in <em>Hunter, </em>we found that an evidentiary hearing was necessary where the petitioner\u2019s evidence of his significant, irreversible mental retardation and illiteracy raised a factual issue as to, whether his mental impairment affected his ability to timely file a federal petition. 587 F.3d at 1309-10. Here, the record indicates that Spears has some history of mental-health issues and medication, but, as in <em>Lawrence, </em>Spears has not explained how his mental-health issues or medication, apart from the drug-induced prison transfers, affected his ability to file a timely petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Yet even if Spears had established an extraordinary circumstance, as explained above, \u201cequitable tolling is available only if a petitioner establishes <em>both </em>extraordinary circumstances and due diligence.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 (11th Cir.2004). Here, the magistrate judge found that Spears did not exercise due diligence because \u201cnothing in the record indicat[ed] that Petitioner attempted to pursue his rights until 2007.\u201d The district court adopted this finding. We review this factual, determination for clear error, and Spears has offered no reason to conclude that this determination lacks substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Looking only at the period between what appears to be Spears\u2019s last prison transfer in April 2002 (to Hays State Prison, where he was incarcerated at the time of his state habeas petition) and the filing of Spears\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court in December 2007, Spears has not alleged that he took any action to pursue his rights. \u25a0 Rather, he explained that he did not seek information about his appeal or post-conviction rights for years following his conviction because he believed that he did not have the right to appeal. But, as explained previously, procedural ignorance is not an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statute calls for prompt action. <em>See Rivers, </em>416 F.3d at 1323. While it may be true, as Spears\u2019s counsel argues, that any assessment of what is \u201creasonable\u201d diligence must take into account Spears\u2019s mental illnesses and the fact that he was told that he could not appeal, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Spears did not exercise reasonable diligence because he took no action to pursue his rights until 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Finally, we are satisfied that the district court did not. abuse its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on equitable tolling. In <em>Drew, </em>this Court explained that the decision as to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on equitable tolling is .committed to the sound discretion of the district court because \u00a7 2244 \u201cdoes not require a hearing on the issue of time-bar or equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1292. While an evidentiary hearing may be necessary where material facts are in dispute, an evidentiary hearing is not required where no basis exists to believe that further inquiry would help the petitioner prove entitlement to equitable tolling. <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1271-72; <em>Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1292. Here, Spears has offered no reason to believe, by way of allegations or supporting evidence, that further inquiry by the district court would help him prove that he pursued his rights diligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding, without holding an eviden-tiary hearing, that Spears was not entitled to equitable tolling for the filing of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>\u00a7 2254 petition. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Spears\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-5\">. The COA in this case is arguably defective because it does not \"specify what constitutional issue jurists of reason would find debatable.\u201d <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132, 1138 (11th Cir.2014) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 12, 2015) (No. 18-8449). As we explained in <em>Spencer, </em>\"[e]ven when a prisoner seeks to appeal a procedural error, the certificate must specify the underlying constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although <em>Spencer </em>indicated that this Court, going forward, would vacate COAs which do not specify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>underlying constitutional issue, <em>id., </em>the COA in this case was issued well before the decision in <em>Spencer. </em>And given that the equitable-tolling issue has been fully briefed and neither party has addressed whether the COA' is defective, we exercise our discretion to resolve the issue specified in the COA. <em>See id. </em>at 1137-38; <em>Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 641, 649-52, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (holding that a defective COA does not deprive an appellate court of jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-12\">. Spears's counsel \"questions whether the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s formulation of his burden survives <em>Holland.\" </em>There is no question. Both <em>Holland </em>and our cases applying <em>Holland </em>clearly place the burden of establishing entitlement to equitable tolling on the petitioner. <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 649, 130 S.Ct. at 2562; <em>see, e.g., San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267-68. The Court in <em>Holland, </em>in deciding whether \u00a7 2244(d)(1) was subject to equitable tolling, explained that there is a general presumption that non-jurisdictional federal statutes of limitations are subject to equitable tolling. <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 646, 130 S.Ct. at 2560-61. But <em>Holland </em>does not suggest that federal courts should presume that a specific petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
