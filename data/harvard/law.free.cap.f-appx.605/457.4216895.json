Williamson moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Williamson claimed that he was unlawfully detained for speeding, subjected to an illegal search, and not given <em>Miranda </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings upon his arrest for failure to identify. The district dismissed his complaint based on the immunity of the defendants, insufficient service of process, and Williamson\u2019s failure to file the suit within the applicable statute of limitations. Denying his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, the district court certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">By moving to proceed IFP, Williamson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We may dismiss the appeal under 5th Circuit Rule 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Williamson does not challenge sufficiently the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint or denying him leave to proceed IFP on appeal. Pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction. <em>Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d </em>222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, when an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Williamson asserts, without further explanation, in his <em>opening </em>brief that the limitations period is four years because his suit is based on fraud and official oppression by officers. For actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, federal courts borrow the forum state\u2019s general personal injury limitations period. <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 387, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). In Texas, that period is two years. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.003(a); <em>Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002). Williamson\u2019s complaint alleged violations of federal constitutional rights and thus was subject to the two-year statute of limitations period. <em>See Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 387, 127 S.Ct. 1091. In addition, federal law determines when a \u00a7 1983 cause of action accrues. <em>See Hitt, </em>301 F.3d at 246. Under federal law, the limitations period begins to run \u201cwhen the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered an injury or has sufficient information to know that he has been injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Montgomery County dropped criminal charges against Williamson in May 2010, giving him until May 2012 to file suit timely. He did not commence proceedings against the officers and the State until March 2013. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding his suit time barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Because Williamson has failed to challenge any legal aspect of the district court\u2019s disposition of his complaint or the certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith, he has abandoned the critical issues of his appeal. <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Thus, the appeal lacks arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, Williamson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>MISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir.
