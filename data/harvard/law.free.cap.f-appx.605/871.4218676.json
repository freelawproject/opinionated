Mr. Burke argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court erred when it sentenced him to 12 months above the advisory guideline range based on his past criminal conduct. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Mr. Burke defrauded three women\u2014 D.G., S.H., and C.W. \u2014 whom he met separately at a Fleming\u2019s Restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, between October of 2010 and May of 2011. He encouraged the three women to invest in different projects, which all shared one common characteristic: they were fictional and fabricated by Mr. Burke. Mr. Burke had the women wire money from their bank accounts to the bank accounts for his businesses, Burke Construction and Computer Converters.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">D.G. wired a total of $104,000 to Computer Converters and Burke Construction to loan money to pawn shops and invest in the publication of academic coloring books for children. S.H. wired $40,000 to Burke Construction to invest in the purchase of a pawn shop. C.W. personally hand delivered a check to Mr. Burke for $100,000 to invest in the Admiral Semmes Hotel in Mobile, Alabama. Mr. Burke used the $244,000 for his own personal benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">In March of 2013, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Burke on four counts of wire fraud and one count of transportation of stolen money in interstate commerce. He ultimately pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud and one count of transportation of stolen money in interstate commerce. The government and Mr. Burke agreed that the loss amount attributable to him for sentencing purposes was $264,300. The presentencing investigation report set Mr. Burke\u2019s total offense level at 16 and his criminal history category at III, which resulted in an advisory guideline sentencing range of 27 to 33 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">The report also detailed Mr. Burke\u2019s ten prior criminal convictions. Mr. Burke had six criminal convictions in the 1980s. These convictions were for extortion, intimidating a witness, promoting prostitution, reckless driving, impersonating a peace officer, and negotiating a worthless instrument. The 1990s were a bit less active for Mr. Burke, as he was convicted of two crimes: selling game fish and bank fraud. Significantly, Mr. Burke\u2019s criminal history score under the Sentencing Guidelines was not increased by any of these eight convictions from the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 2000s, Mr. Burke was convicted of two counts of theft of property, and these convictions gave him four criminal history points and a criminal history category of III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">The report further listed approximately twenty arrests for criminal conduct of which Mr. Burke was either not prosecuted or not convicted. These arrests, which spanned from the 1970s to the mid-2000s, also did not increase Mr. Burke\u2019s criminal history category. Of all the listed prior arrests, charges, and convictions listed in the report, Mr. Burke objected only to the veracity of his 1992 conviction for the sale of game fish.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">The report, under \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d states that in November of 2012, D.B., another female, contacted the Alabama Securities Commission regarding a $20,000 investment she had made with Mr. Burke.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>In 2013, the Commission also spoke to other women who claimed to have invested with Mr. Burke: J.P. invested $40,000, J.H. invested $80,000, L.P. invested $60,000, and M.H. invested over $1,000,000. Although his offense level was not increased by the amounts allegedly invested by these women, Mr. Burke objected to the inclusion of this conduct in the report and denied the allegations. At sentencing, the district court sustained Mr. Burke\u2019s objection as to the relevant conduct obtained from statements given to the Alabama\u2019s Securities Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The government argued that there was \u201ca pattern of Mr. Burke actually preying upon women who were in a vulnerable position.\u201d D.G., one of the' victims, testified that Mr. Burke \u201cwas enjoying a very lavish lifestyle, all while stealing from others to maintain it,\u201d and recounted the financial and mental anguish Mr. Burke\u2019s lies had and continue to cost her.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The district court acknowledged that the advisory guideline range was 27 to 38 months and that neither Mr. Burke nor the government had objected to this range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court then recognized that its \u201cjob is to sentence the defendant to a sentence which is sufficient but not more than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in the federal statutes,\u201d but stated that \u201c[t]he advisory guideline range is just that[, advisory] ... [fit\u2019s not binding.\u201d The district court considered Mr. Burke\u2019s \u201cpast, prior convictions that start in the 80s\u201d and stated it was \u201cabundantly clear ... that the guideline range is not sufficient.\u201d The district court ordered that Mr. Burke serve 45 months in prison for Counts 1, 4, and 5, \u201call separate but to run concurrently.\u201d It stated that, when considering \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristic of the defendant,\u201d such a sentence was appropriate. Although Mr. Burke had a gambling issue, he also had, the district court found, \u201ca thieving issue.\u201d \u201cHe has been stealing and being a con man for a long time. And times have come to \u2014 that time has come to an end today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Mr. Burke on appeal argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, because it was greater than necessary to serve the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). According to Mr. Burke, the district court did not make any additional findings that justified a 12-month upward variance. Mr. Burke concedes that the district court cited his past criminal acts as the reason for the variance, but he contends that his prior criminal conduct had already been addressed by the guidelines. Therefore, the district \u2022 court abused its discretion, when it used his prior criminal conduct to vary upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d 627, 636 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). These include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Importantly, the weight given to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor \u201cis a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). We will reverse only if the district court committed a clear error in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cby arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonableness].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cannot reverse a district court\u2019s sentence, under this standard, simply because we would have imposed a different sentence. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1191. The party challenging the sentence has the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The sentencing guidelines are advisory. <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[A] sentence outside the Guidelines carries no presumption of unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Irizariy v. United States, 553 </em>U.S. 708, 714, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008) (internal citation omitted). District courts are required to provide sufficient justifications to explain why any unusually harsh sentence is appropriate, <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, but we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that there is no abuse of discretion. The district court considered and weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sufficiently explained its reason for imposing a sentence above the advisory guideline range. The district court, noting Mr. Burke\u2019s long criminal resume of cons and thieving, \u201cthe nature and circumstances of offense,\u201d and his characteristics, concluded that the guideline range was insufficient to accomplish \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing goals, particularly reflecting the seriousness of the offense and deterring Mr. Burke\u2019s behavior from continuing. Although the district court acknowledged Mr. Burke had a gambling problem, it also found he had a \u201cthieving problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Mr. Burke argues that the district court\u2019s analysis gave undue weight to his past criminal activity, which mostly occurred decades ago. He emphasizes the fact that, despite his past crimes, he has \u201chad no criminal conviction in the last ten years,\u201d and suggests the district court failed to consider the fact that most of his crimes were in the distant past. While that is relevant, it is also perhaps just as relevant that Mr. Burke had been incarcerated and on parole for almost the entirety of those ten years. And although the district court undoubtedly gave greater weight to Mr. Burke\u2019s criminal past than other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we cannot substitute our views for those of the district court. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. The district court\u2019s analysis did not constitute clear error and'was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">We affirm Mr. Burke\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. Wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of twenty years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and the transportation of stolen goods in interstate commerce carries a maximum sentence of ten years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C: \u00a7 2314. Mr. Burke's total sentence was less than four years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
