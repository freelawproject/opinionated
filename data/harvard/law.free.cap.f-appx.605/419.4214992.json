Hernandez contends she established she suffered past, and fears future, persecution in Mexico, based on encounters with her cousin. She asserts this persecution was on account of her membership in a particular social group: her family in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-23\">In seeking withholding of removal based on her membership in a particular social group before the immigration judge (IJ), Hernandez identified the social group to which she belongs as \u201c[(Individuals in fear of the violence and gangs in Mexico\u201d. But, on appeal to the BIA, she asserted she belonged to a different particular social group: her own family. In her petition here, Hernandez advances her claim based on her membership in her family. Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019 withholding-of-removal claim based on her fear of gang violence is waived because she failed to challenge it before the BIA. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). But, because the BIA addressed her withhold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ing-of-removal claim based on membership in her family, we will consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Hernandez is not eligible for withholding of removal is a factual finding reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Likewise, whether Hernandez demonstrated the requisite nexus between persecution and a protected ground is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2004). Under the substantial evidence standard, the BIA\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the petitioner shows \u201cthe evidence compels a contrary conclusion\u201d. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The IJ and BIA determined Hernandez did not establish a nexus between any persecution in Mexico and a' statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) (defining refugee to protect those who suffer persecution in home countries due to race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion). The record establishes Hernandez\u2019 cousin acted for personal or criminal reasons, and not because of Hernandez\u2019 membership in any particular social group. <em>See, e.g., Khan v. Gonzales, </em>164 Fed.Appx. 486, 488 (5th Cir.2006). In short, the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
