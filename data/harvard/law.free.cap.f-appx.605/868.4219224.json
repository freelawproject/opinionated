The plane is currently grounded in Colombia at the direction of Colombian tax authorities, and Aires has sued the plaintiffs in Colombian court over the lease. A year after Aires filed its Colombian suit, the plaintiffs sued in Florida state court, and Aires then removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On Aires\u2019 motion, the district court issued an order staying the plaintiffs\u2019 suit pending the outcome of the Colombian court case. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">We review a district court\u2019s issuance of a stay pending the resolution of related proceedings in another forum only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ortega Trujillo v. Conover &amp; Co. Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1262, 1264 n. 2 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The ordinary rule is that we may not review stay orders because our jurisdiction extends only to the review of final decisions. <em>See 28 TJ.S.G. \u00a7 1291 </em>(\u201cThe courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.... \u201d). But when a stay order places a plaintiff \u201ceffectively out of court,\u201d that order is reviewable. <em>See King v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>505 F.3d 1160, 1169-70 (11th Cir.2007). A plaintiff is \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d when \u201clitigation whose nature, extent, and duration are unknown[ ] is pending in\u201d a foreign jurisdiction and the stay has \u201cthe legal effect of preventing [the plaintiff] from proceeding with his claims in federal court for an indefinite period of time, potentially for years\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hines v. D'Artois, </em>531 F.2d 726, 731 (5th Cir.1976) (holding a stay of at least eighteen months sufficient 'to place plaintiffs \u201cout of court\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, as in <em>King, </em>the district court\u2019s stay order placed the plaintiffs \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d and we have jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Aires contends that the plaintiffs have abandoned any argument that the district court\u2019s order was in error because they failed to brief any basis for vacating that order. A party may abandon a claim by failing to \u201cplainly and prominently raise it,' for instance by devoting a discrete section of his argument to\u201d that claim. <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 681 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he law is by now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before a court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d). Similarly, a party has abandoned an issue when the references to the issue are \u201cmere background to the appellant\u2019s main arguments or when they are buried within those arguments.\u201d <em>Sapuppo, </em>739 F.3d at 682. For example, we have held that a claim was abandoned when the defendant\u2019s brief contained only \u201cpassing references\u201d to the claim, \u201ceach of which [was] embedded under different topical headings.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). There, we held that the defendant had \u201cburied\u201d his claims within other arguments in part because he failed to \u201cdevote[ ] a discrete section of his argument\u201d to the claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">So too here. The plaintiffs\u2019 brief contains two argument sections with these headings: \u201cI. Did the District Court\u2019s granting of AIRES\u2019 stay[ ] effectively place Appellants DASH [224] and [Regional One] out of court?\u201d and \u201cII. Does the District Court\u2019s order granting AIRES a stay[ ] amount to a collateral order?\u201d Each of those sections addresses whether we have jurisdiction to review the stay order. Neither section \u201cplainly and prominently raise[s]\u201d a claim that the district court was wrong on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief argues that they had raised the merits issue in their initial brief by likening the facts in this case to those in <em>Ortega Trujillo v. Conover &amp; Co. Communications, Inc. </em>Even if that comparison were apt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is \u201cburied within\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>another argument, <em>Sapuppo, </em>739 F.3d at 682, and \u201cembedded under [a] different topical heading[],\u201d <em>Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1283 n. 8. The plaintiffs also argue in their reply that Aires \u201cunderstood that [plaintiffs] made the argument and the nature of the argument, as is evidenced by their arguments against it.\u201d But the mere fact that Aires took care itself not to abandon its own merits argument says nothing about what the plaintiffs did (or, in this case, did not do) in their opening brief. Because the plaintiffs have abandoned any argument that the district court abused its discretion by entering the stay order, we have no reason to decide whether it did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-5\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">. It is not an apt comparison. In <em>Ortega Tmjillo, </em>we reviewed a short court <em>order </em>that failed to set out its reasons for ordering a stay. 221 F.3d at 1265 (\"The stay order does not explain in detail the district court's reasoning in staying further proceedings in this case.\u201d). We thus declined to presume that a district court that \"did not mention abstention at all\u201d was in fact relying on internation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>al-comity abstention.. <em>Id. </em>In this case, however, the district court laid out in persuasive detail in seven pages of its thirteen-page order its reasons for staying the case on the basis of comity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
