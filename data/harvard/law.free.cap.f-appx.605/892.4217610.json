Clark appeals his conviction, contending that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence of his crime, namely, a gun seized from his car during a traffic stop that led to his arrest. He argues that the district court erred for two reasons: (1) because the arresting detectives\u2019 testimony at his suppression hearing was not credible, and (2) because the war-rantless search of his car was not a valid search incident to arrest under the Supreme Court\u2019s-decision in <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-20\">One evening in August 2013, Clark turned right on a red light without first coming to a complete stop, catching the attention of two detectives sitting in an unmarked police vehicle in the lane next to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the light turned green, the detectives drove up behind Clark\u2019s car and activated their car\u2019s lights and sirens. Clark did not pull over at first but stopped at a gas station about eight or nine blocks away. After Clark pulled over, both detectives exited their car; the first (Detective Michael Mendez) approached the driver\u2019s side of Clark\u2019s car while the second (Detective Franco Cugge) approached the passenger\u2019s side. As they approached, both detectives smelled the scent of marijuana wafting from Clark\u2019s car. Mendez also observed Clark leaning towards the passenger side of the car with his right arm extended. Based on the \u201cstrong odor of marijuana\u201d and Clark\u2019s movements, Mendez decided to open the driver\u2019s side door. When he did, he saw a marijuana cigarette located in the \u201clittle cubby or hole\u201d in the \u201carmrest on the driver\u2019s side [of the] car.\u201d Mendez then decided to arrest Clark. In the course of handcuffing him, the detective \u201cnoticed a butt of a gun under [Clark\u2019s] seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">After the detectives had secured Clark on the curb, Mendez returned to Clark\u2019s car and recovered the gun \u2014 which turned out to be loaded \u2014 and the marijuana cigarette. The detectives then requested backup, including an officer who could fingerprint Clark. The fingerprint check revealed that Clark was a convicted felon with a long criminal record. .The detectives also called a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, who initiated a federal investigation of Clark\u2019s possession of the firearm. A later inventory search of Clark\u2019s car revealed a bag of marijuana and a digital scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Two weeks later, a federal grand jury charged Clark with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Clark pleaded not guilty and filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss the indictment. He also filed a counseled motion to suppress evidence of the gun. After holding a hearing, the district court denied both motions. At trial, Clark was convicted. The district court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months. This is Clark\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">A district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law and fact. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. See United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2010). In doing so, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, which in this case is the government. <em>See United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 966 (11th Cir.2008). We also defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, unless the testimony was \u201ccontrary to the laws of nature, or [was] so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Clark argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress because the testimony of the government\u2019s witnesses \u2014 the two arresting detectives\u2014 was not credible. He asserts that, the detectives could not actually smell the scent of marijuana from two or three feet away. He also asserts that their testimo- \u2022 ny was inconsistent with that of the ATF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>agent, who testified for the defense at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Clark\u2019s argument fails. The court did not clearly err in crediting the detectives\u2019 testimony that they could smell the scent of marijuana coming from Clark\u2019s car, especially given that both detectives had made numerous narcotics arrests involving marijuana over the course of their careers. (Nine years for Mendez and ten for Cugge.) Nor did the court clearly err in crediting the detectives\u2019 testimony despite some inconsistencies between their statements and those of the ATF agent. Indeed, on cross-examination, the ATF agent reasonably explained that, although there were slight differences between her statements and those of Mendez,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> those differences were due to the fact that she had formed her own account of the traffic stop\u2019s events based on how she had interpreted and paraphrased the detectives\u2019 briefing. Because the district court did not clearly err, we are bound by its choice to credit the detectives\u2019 testimony. <em>See United States v. Aldridge, </em>719 F.2d 368, 371 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cAbsent clear error, the district court\u2019s credibility choices at suppression hearings are binding on this court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Clark also argues that the warrant-less search of his car was not a valid search incident to arrest under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gant. See </em>556 U.S. at 343, 129 S.Ct. at 1719. But the district court did not rely on that particular exception to the warrant requirement, and neither do we. Instead, we conclude that the detectives lawfully searched Clark\u2019s car under the automobile exception. Under that exception, a warrantless search of a car is constitutional if (1) the car is \u201creadily mobile\u201d (that is, operational), and (2) probable cause exists to believe that it contains contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>United States v. Lanzon, </em>639 F.3d 1293, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see United States v. Watts, </em>329 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The warrantless search of Clark\u2019s car fit squarely within the automobile exception because the car was operational and the detectives had probable cause to search it based on the smell of marijuana. <em>See United States v. Tobin, </em>923 F.2d 1506, 1512 (11th Cir.1991) (en banc) (\u201cThere is no doubt that the agent\u2019s suspicions rose to the level of probable cause when ... he detected what he knew from his law enforcement experience to be the odor of marijuana.\u201d); <em>United States v. Lueck, </em>678 F.2d 895, 903 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201cAt the point marijuana was smelled by [the officer], probable cause to believe a crime had been committed ... arose.\u201d). Because the detectives had probable cause to search Clark\u2019s car, they properly seized the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">In any event, Clark\u2019s challenge to the legality of the search in this case masks yet another attack on the detectives\u2019 credibility. At the suppression hearing, Clark conceded that, if the court were to \u201ctake [the detectives] at their word,\u201d they had probable cause to search his car based on the smell of marijuana. Having decided that the court did not clearly err in crediting the detectives\u2019 testimony, we agree with Clark\u2019s assessment. The warrantless search of Clark\u2019s car did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-6\">.
