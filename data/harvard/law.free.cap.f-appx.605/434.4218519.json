He claims the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement to his offense level under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (requiring enhancement if illegal-reentry defendant was previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>deported after conviction for <em>felony </em>crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The court based the enhancement on Martinez\u2019 prior North Carolina conviction for indecent liberties with a child, for which he was sentenced to 10-12 months\u2019 imprisonment. Martinez claims his prior conviction was not a felony because, under North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing statute, he was subject to no more than 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 2 (defining felony as a \u201cfederal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo; its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Martinez did not preserve this challenge in district court, however. Therefore, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir.2012). Under that standard, Martinez must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">When Martinez committed the North Carolina offense in September 2009, state law punished indecent liberties with a child as a Class F felony, for which the presumptive maximum sentence was 47 months\u2019 imprisonment for an offender with a prior record level of VI. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 14-202.1 (2009); 15A-1340.17(c)-(d). The state court ruled Martinez should be punished under the mitigated range as a Class F felon with a prior record level of I. The mitigated range of minimum punishment was 10-13 months\u2019 imprisonment. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c). The court imposed a minimum sentence at the bottom of that range, and the corresponding maximum sentence was 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 15A \u2014 1340.17(c)\u2014(d). Martinez claims the 12-month maximum determines whether his offense was a felony for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). The Government counters that the 20-month maximum term of imprisonment for the aggravated-sentencing range for an offender with a prior record level of I governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">This issue need not be decided. The state court <em>could </em>have sentenced Martinez to a minimum term of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment, for which the corresponding maximum term was 16 months. <em>E.g., United States v. Selvan-Cupil, </em>603 Fed.Appx. 242, 247, 2015 WL 860779, at *5 (5th Cir.2 Mar. 2015) (\u201cWhat matters for the felony determination is not the sentence imposed, but whether the defendant was eligible for a sentence exceeding a year.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(17 Mar. 2015) (No. 14-8964). In other words, that the state court sentenced Martinez to a minimum term of 10 months\u2019 imprisonment is irrelevant. <em>E.g., id. </em>In short, the district court did not commit clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
