Recommendation and Dismissing Case, in which that court approved and adopted the Memorandum and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and overruled Smith\u2019s objections thereto. That Memorandum and Recommendation patiently and painstakingly sets out, over the course of 20 pages, the factual background and the legal reasoning for granting Defendant-Appellee\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, affirming the May 11, 2011 holding of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that Plaintiff-Appellant was not disabled for purposes of the applicable sections of the Social Security Act through December 31, 2010, the last date insured. Barring the grant of a writ of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, this court will be the last of four fora to consider Smith\u2019s original and appellate claims..</p>\n<p id=\"b471-22\">We have carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including the briefs and record excerpts of the parties, paying special attention to the ALJ\u2019s decision, the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Memorandum and Recommendation, and the district court\u2019s adoption thereof. As a result of our review, we are satisfied that, given the deferential standards of review applicable in this Social Security case to the ALJ\u2019s determinations and to the proceedings and holdings in the district court, all rulings before us bn appeal are free of reversible error and are hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
