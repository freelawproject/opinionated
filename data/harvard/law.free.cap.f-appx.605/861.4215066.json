He brought an initial motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in 2000, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>the district court denied it on the merits. In 2010, Sampson filed the instant habeas corpus petition, this time seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. He challenged his ACCA sentence enhancement and asserted that the government used perjured grand jury testimony to secure an indictment. The district court dismissed the petition on September 28, 2013, after determining that Sampson\u2019s challenge to his ACCA enhancement failed on the merits. It did not address whether the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 afforded it jurisdiction to entertain the \u00a7 2241 petition, nor did it address Sampson\u2019s perjured testimony claim. Sampson moved for reconsideration on October 28, 2013, the district court denied reconsideration in April 2014, and Sampson appealed. On appeal, he asserts that the district court erred in its analysis of his ACCA claim and violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) by not addressing his perjured testimony claim. After careful review, we dismiss the appeal in part, and vacate and remand it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We are obligated to inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>and review jurisdictional issues <em>de novo. Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). In a habeas case, the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 209-13, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). We read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, but issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>party are still deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In a civil case, a party has 60 days from the entry of the judgment or order appealed from to file a notice of appeal where the United States is a party to the case. Fed. RApp.P. 4(a)(1)(B). A timely filed Fed. R.Civ.P. 59 motion, or a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 motion \u2014 filed within 28 days of the relevant judgment or order \u2014 tolls the time that a party has to file a notice of appeal. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), (v), and (vi); Fed.R.Civ.P. 59, 60. We can consider a timely appeal from an order denying a motion for reconsideration, even if the motion was untimely to toll the appeal period. <em>See Advanced Bodycare Solutions, LLC v. Thione Int'l, Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1352, 1359 n. 14 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that we had jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order on a post-judgment motion, although the motion was untimely to toll the appeal period from the underlying judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Because Sampson filed his post-judgment reconsideration motion more than 28 days after the judgment, it did not serve to toll the time in which he was required to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv) and (vi). Sampson\u2019s April 2014 notice of appeal, therefore, was untimely to appeal the September 23, 2013 dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition, and we lack jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B); <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 209-13, 127 S.Ct. 2360. Accordingly, to the extent that Sampson challenges the underlying denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition, his appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">That being said, the notice of ap1 peal was timely as to the denial of Sampson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and Sampson\u2019s notice of appeal references that order, so we may review arguments that Sampson raises on appeal regarding that order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3(c)(1)(B) and 4(a)(1)(B). Moreover, Sampson\u2019s initial brief, construed liberally, does not abandon his challenge to the denial of his motion for reconsideration. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">However, we cannot rule on questions that the district court never had jurisdiction to entertain. <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013). We also have an obligation to consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>whether the district court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>exercised jurisdiction over a case. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida v. Kraus-Anderson Constr. Co., </em>607 F.3d 1268, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">While \u00a7 2255 is the primary method of collateral attack for federal prisoners, \u00a7 2241 provides a limited, additional basis for habeas actions brought by federal prisoners. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 opens the portal to relief under \u00a7 2241 if \u201cthe remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). Whether the savings clause \u201cmay open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 petition\u201d is a threshold jurisdictional question that must be decided before delving into a petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262; <em>see also Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Here, as always, we have a duty to determine <em>sua sponte </em>whether the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, </em>607 F.3d at 1272-73. As the record shows, the district court resolved Sampson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition on the merits, without discussing whether the savings clause provided it jurisdiction to entertain the petition in the first place. Whether the savings clause \u201cmay open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 petition\u201d is a threshold jurisdictional question that must be decided before delving into a petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. Because the district court never established that the savings clause gave it jurisdiction over the case, we cannot determine whether it had jurisdiction to rule on the motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court with instructions to consider whether there was a proper basis for exercising jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
