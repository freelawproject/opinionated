Regarding psychological limitations, the ALJ found that Lewen was limited to \u201ctasks and instructions that are simple and consistent with unskilled work,\u201d occasional interaction with the public, and \u201croutine and occasional interaction with supervisors.\u201d Based partly on this determination of Lewen\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ then concluded that Lewen was not disabled because there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that she could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">On appeal, Lewen contends that the ALJ erred in failing to properly evaluate various medical opinions when determining Lewen\u2019s residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In a Social Security appeal, we review de novo the legal principles upon which the ALJ\u2019s decision is based. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We review the resulting decision only to determine whether substantial evidence supports it. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence that a reasonable person would accept as sufficient to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>This limited review precludes our deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or reweighing the evidence. <em>Id. </em>The claimant bears the burden of proving a qualifying disability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">In determining whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ considers medical opinions together with the rest of the relevant evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(b). Medical opinions are statements from physicians and psychologists that reflect judgments about the nature and severity of the claimant\u2019s impairments, including (1) what the claimant \u201ccan still do despite impairments,\u201d and (2) her \u201cmental restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">While the ALJ\u2019s explanation of the decision must sufficiently explain the weight given to \u201cobviously probative exhibits,\u201d <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981), it need not discuss every piece of evidence. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIn all events, there is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in [her] decision,\u201d so long as the decision enables the reviewing court to conclude that the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>Id. </em>In assessing medical evidence, an ALJ is required to state with particularity the weight given to the different medical opinions and the reasons therefor. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Lewen\u2019s contention, that the ALJ did not properly consider the medical opinions, lacks merit. The mental limitations imposed in the ALJ\u2019s determination of Lew-en\u2019s residual functional capacity were consistent with the medical opinions, even the portions that the ALJ did not specifically quote in her order. The ALJ limited Lew-en to simple tasks and instructions, occasional interaction with the public, and occasional routine interaction with supervisors. Lewen was further limited to tasks and instructions that were \u201cconsistent with unskilled work.\u201d There is no indication that these limitations do not account for the doctors\u2019 opinions in their entireties. Rather, any need to limit Lewen\u2019s ability to concentrate, deal with stress, or maintain a regular schedule on the job \u2014 opinions that Lewen argues are omitted from the ALJ\u2019s decision \u2014 is accounted for by the ALJ limiting her to simple tasks and unskilled work with little interaction with the public and supervisors. Moreover, there is no indication that the doctors, by opining that Lewen might have difficulties dealing with stress, concentrating, or maintaining a schedule, meant that these limitations would limit her ability to work a full work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>day/week. These doctors opined that, despite these limitations, she could perform simple routine tasks. Finally, while the ALJ is required to state the weight afforded to each medical opinion, <em>Sharfarz, </em>825 F.2d at 279, the ALJ is not required to discuss every piece of evidence. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-25\">.
