In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b814-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b814-20\">Danyel D. Lawston, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas' corpus. By adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R), the district court dismissed Lawston\u2019s sentencing-error claim. In dismissing the claim, the district court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Lawston\u2019s petition because it was, in substance, a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. On appeal, Law-ston argues that his claim, based on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-23\">Lawston first challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). The question of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>savings clause applies is a threshold jurisdictional issue, and the petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">In 2006, Lawston was indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), and 846. The statutory maximum sentence for a conviction under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) is ordinarily 20 years. However, the government filed a notice under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 that it intended to use Lawston\u2019s four prior convictions for cocaine possession to seek an enhanced 30-year statutory-maximum sentence. A jury found Lawston guilty, and the court sentenced him to 262-months imprisonment. Lawston raised several claims in an October 2008 \u00a7 2255 motion, all of which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In the petition now before us, Law-ston claims for the first time that <em>Alleyne </em>prohibits the statutory-maximum enhancement he received. Lawston\u2019s claim cannot succeed because <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively, and a second or successive habeas petition is allowed only for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d or \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court....\u201d \u00a7 2255(h)(2); <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact that aggravates the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, including a fact that increases the statutory minimum, is an element of the offense that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. 570 U.S. at-, 133 S.Ct. at 2162-63. Yet this Court has held that <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review for purposes of a \u00a7 2241 petition filed pursuant to the savings clause. <em>Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam). The district court properly concluded that Lawston\u2019s sentencing claim under Alleyne could not be brought under the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Lawston\u2019s petition under \u00a7 2241, it properly considered Lawston\u2019s challenge to the legality of his detention under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256. Because Lawston had already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was decided on its merits, the district court properly concluded that this petition was a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, for which Lawston needed prior approval from this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Lawston did not receive prior approval to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, so the district court was right to dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Lawston next claims that he never received a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s R <em>&amp; </em>R, as was required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As a result, the district court did not review the case with Lawston\u2019s objections in mind, which he says caused prejudice. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">When a magistrate judge issues an R &amp; R, the clerk of court must mail a copy of the R &amp; R to each party. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)(1). Parties may object to the proposed factual findings and recommendations within fourteen days of being served. \u00a7 636(b); Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)(2). This Court applies a harmless error standard to claims that the district court did not provide sufficient time to object to an R &amp; R denying habeas relief. <em>See Braxton v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 392, 397 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam) (holding that any error resulting from inadequate service was harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>where none of the appellant\u2019s arguments resulted from a factual dispute and the district court \u201ccould assess the merits of the petition from its face\u201d (quotation omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Even if we were to assume that the district court did not give- Lawston the proper opportunity to object, that error was harmless. Lawston raises no factual objections to the R &amp; R on appeal. Instead, he challenges only the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his \u00a7 2241 petition via \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, regardless of whether Lawston filed a timely objection to the R &amp; R. <em>Monroe v. Thigpen, </em>932 F.2d 1437, 1440 (11th Cir.1991). Thus, the standard of review does not change. The district court here conducted an independent review of the R &amp; R and the record and was able to decide the merits of the petition from its face. Lawston was not harmed because, as discussed above, he cannot raise an <em>Alleyne </em>claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition brought under the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lawston\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
