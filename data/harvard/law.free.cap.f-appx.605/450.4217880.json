The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">We must raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte. Bhatia named several federal agencies as defendants. The district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Bhatia\u2019s claims that these agencies violated his constitutional rights because <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), does not provide a cause of action against a federal agency. <em>F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as modified to be for lack of jurisdiction with respect to Bhatia\u2019s constitutional claims against the federal agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">We review do novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bhatia\u2019s Privacy Act claims and constitutional claims against unnamed individual defendants. <em>See Frame v. City of Arlington, </em>657 F.3d 215, 222 (5th Cir.2011) (en banc). The district court correctly concluded that the records at issue are exempt under the law enforcement exemption in \u00a7 552a(j)(2). The district court also correctly concluded that Bhatia\u2019s Privacy Act claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because a favorable decision in the instant case would necessarily imply the invalidity of Bhatia\u2019s convictions. <em>Heck </em>also bars Bhatia\u2019s constitutional claims against the unnamed individual defendants for the same reason. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
