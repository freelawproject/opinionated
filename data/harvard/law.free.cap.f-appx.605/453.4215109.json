California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Florets, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ortega-Huete has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">Ortega-Huete has been released from prison and removed to Mexico, and thus any challenge to his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant parts of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2, and in part as moot, <em>see Rosenbaumr-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d at 383.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
