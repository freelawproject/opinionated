O\u2019Garro argues that INA \u00a7 239(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(i) is unambiguous and must be honored. Thus, his continuous physical presence in the U.S., for purposes of eligibility for cancellation of removal, was not stopped when he was served with a notice to appear (NTA) that lacked the time and place at which his initial removal proceeding would be held. Instead, his time was stopped by the notice of hearing, which was sent after he was physically present in the U.S. for ten years and four months, so he remains eligible for cancellation of removal, and his merits hearing in Immigration Court should be resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Where the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision to that extent. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision but agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings. Thus, we review both decisions to that extent. <em>See id. </em>Although we typically lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of an INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b application for cancellation of removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), we retain jurisdiction to review questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Alhuay v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>661 F.3d 534, 549 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s or IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review that decision de novo. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Section 240A(b)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), states, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the status of an [immigrant] lawfully admitted for permanent residence, an [immigrant] who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the [immigrant] \u2014 [among other requirements] (A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application ...\u201d However, \u201c[a]ny period of ... continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end ... when the [immigrant] is served a notice to appear under [INA \u00a7 239(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a) ].\u201d INA \u00a7 240A(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1). This provision is commonly referred to as the \u201cstop-time\u201d rule. <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Section 239(a)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-12\">In removal proceedings under [INA \u00a7 240; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a], written notice (in this section referred to as a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d) shall be given ... to the [immigrant] ... specifying the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-13\">(A) The nature of the proceedings against the [immigrant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-14\">(B) The legal authority under which the proceedings are conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-15\">(C) The acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-16\">(D) The charges against the [immigrant] and the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-17\">(G)(i) <em>The time and place at which the proceedings will be held.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>INA \u00a7 239(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">When a statute is ambiguous with respect to a particular issue, a court must determine whether the agency\u2019s answer was based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). \u201c[T]he BIA should be accorded <em>Chevron </em>deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication.\u201d <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 1445, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the stop-time rule permissibly construes the text of the statute and the context in which it appears. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. The statute identifies a particular form that must be served on the individual, but it does not say that only a form that contains every item, including a yet-to-be-determined time and date for a hearing, stops the ten-year clock. <em>See INA </em>\u00a7 240A(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). In <em>In re Camarillo, </em>the BIA stated that \u201cthe best reading of the statute as a whole is that Congress intended the phrase \u2018under section [1229](a)\u2019 after \u2018notice to appear\u2019 to specify the document the DHS must serve on the [immigrant] to trigger the \u2018stop-time\u2019 rule.\u201d 25 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 644, 647 (2011). According to the BIA, \u201c[a] primary purpose of [an NTA] is to inform an [immigrant] that the Government intends to have him or her removed from the country, but the inclusion of the date and time of the hearing is not necessary for the Government\u2019s intention in this regard to be conveyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650. We defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the stop-time rule. <em>Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. at 425, 119 S.Ct. at 1445. Thus, the BIA did not err in determining that O\u2019Garro did not establish his eligibility for cancellation of removal. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny O\u2019Garro\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
