The issue he presents is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) \u201cerred by not giving great weight to the decision of the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) that [he] was ... entitled to individual unemployable rating (100% disability rating) ... as of November 21, 2008.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1. We conclude that the ALJ did not err in considering the VA\u2019s disability finding and that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>In determining whether the Commission\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we are mindful that substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla.\u201d Rather, it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion that a claimant is or is not entitled to benefits. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). At the end of the day, if we conclude that the ALJ (whose decision became the Commissioner\u2019s) ruled on the claimant\u2019s application for benefits on the basis of such evidence, we will defer to the ALJ\u2019s decision even if the evidence preponderates against it. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">For Social Security purposes, \u201cdisability\u201d is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The Commissioner uses a five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). This process includes an analysis of whether the claimant: (1) is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe and medically determinable impairment; (3) has an impairment, or combination thereof, .that meets or equals a Listing, and meets the duration requirement; (4) can perform his past relevant work, in light of his residual functional capacity (RFC); and (5) can make an adjustment to other work, in light of his RFC, age, education, and work experience. <em>Id.; </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4). The claimant\u2019s RFC is an assessment, based upon all the relevant evidence, of the claimant\u2019s ability to do work despite his impairments. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a)(1). The claimant bears the \u201cheavy burden\u201d to demonstrate \u201cboth a qualifying disability and an inability to perform past relevant work.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The ALJ has a duty to make clear the weight accorded to each item of evidence and the reasons for those decisions, so as to enable a reviewing court to determine whether the ultimate decision is based on substantial evidence. <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). \u201c[TJhere is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in [her] decision,\u201d so long as the ALJ\u2019s decision is not just \u201ca broad rejection\u201d that does not enable the reviewing court to conclude that the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211. The ALJ may make fact findings implicitly if the implication is sufficiently clear. <em>See Parker v. Bowen, </em>793 F.2d 1177, 1178 nn. 1-2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>(11th Cir.1986) (discussing credibility findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504, a decision by any other government agency, such as the VA, regarding a claimant\u2019s disabled status \u201cis based on [that agency\u2019s] rules and is not [the commissioner\u2019s] decision\u201d as to disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504. Instead, the Commissioner must \u201cmake a disability ... determination based on social security law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>VA disability ratings are thus not binding on the ALJ, but such ratings should be considered and \u201cgiven great weight.\u201d <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 921 (11th Cir.1984) (quotation omitted). In <em>Rodriguez v. Schweiker, </em>640 F.2d 682, 686 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981) (per curiam)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the court stated that \u201c[a] VA rating of 100% disability should have been more closely scrutinized by the ALJ,\u201d because the ALJ mentioned the VA rating but \u201cobviously refused to give it much weight.\u201d The court noted that VA disability ratings are nonbinding but \u201cshould be considered\u201d and are \u201centitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In the instant case, the ALJ expressly acknowledged the VA\u2019s determination that Boyette was entitled to total disability on the basis of individual unemployability (\u201cTDIU\u201d), and she also noted that this determination was not binding. Although the ALJ did not assign an express level of weight to the VA disability rating itself, except to say that it was not entitled to controlling weight, she scrutinized the VA\u2019s decision and explained in detail why it was not entitled to controlling weight. The ALJ considered and assigned weight to the VA examiners\u2019 opinions, VA primary care provider opinions, and VA treatment records. In fact, the ALJ appears to have given great weight to the VA examiners\u2019 opinions that Boyette was capable of light or sedentary employment, which she concluded were consistent with the medical evidence and record evidence as a whole. However,.the ALJ noted that other agencies determined disability under parameters other than those used by the SSA, and thus, while the clinical findings reported by the VA medical staff were given \u201cappropriate weight,\u201d the VA\u2019s final opinion as to degree of disability was not entitled to controlling weight. <em>Cf. Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that the ALJ must give treating physician testimony substantial or controlling weight unless there is \u201cgood cause\u201d not to do so, and explaining that good cause exists when the treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence, the evidence supported a contrary finding, or the opinion was concluso-ry or inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own medical records). Thus, although the ALJ declined to give controlling weight to the VA disability determination and did not expressly state she gave \u201cgreat\u201d weight to it, there is no indication that she failed to give the VA\u2019s determination great weight or consideration. <em>See Brady, </em>724 F.2d at 921; <em>see also Parker, </em>793 F.2d at 1178 nn. 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Boyette does not present any other objection to the ALJ\u2019s decision. Although he contends that it is more difficult to obtain a TDIU rating than it is to obtain SSA disability benefits, even the VA\u2019s TDIU ratings are not binding on the ALJ and are not determinative as to whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Brady, </em>724 F.2d at 921. Here, the ALJ correctly noted that the VA disability determination is guided by dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>ferent factors than those for SSA disability. Where, as here, the VA treatment notes, examining VA doctors\u2019 opinions, treating doctors\u2019 opinions, and state agency assessments all support the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment, the ALJ did not err in her treatment of the VA\u2019s disability determination. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s finding of no disability is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-17\">. Boyette\u2019s applied for disability insurance benefits in February 2010, alleging that he became disabled on July 17, 2007, due to physical impairments. He worked after that, from April to November 2008, and from April to November 2009, as an assistant football <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>coach for an average of two hours a day. He stopped working on both occasions not because of his disability but because the football season ended in November. The state agency responsible for disability determinations at the initial and reconsideration levels of review found Boyette not disabled. On June 13, 2011, the ALJ held a hearing on Boyette\u2019s application for benefits. Boyette, who was represented by counsel, and a vocational expert testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"A_T\">Boyette testified that several conditions limited his ability to work: (1) degenerative disc disease; (2) degenerative joint disease/post-thrombotic syndrome; (3) postphlebotic syndrome in his legs; (4) Factor V coagulation defect; (5) hypertension; (6) tinnitus; (7) tension headaches; (8) sleep apnea; and (9) chronic sinusitis. The ALJ found Boyette not disabled under the Social Security Act, concluding that he was still capable of performing his past relevant work as an administrative assistant and hearing officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">.
