This section provides : \u201cNo person shall be imprisoned for debt in civil actions . . . unless in cases of fraud. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">In the judicial review and interpretation of legislation, two basic principles govern the courts: (1) The courts do not pass on the wisdom or the discretion of the Legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>enacting a law, but merely test the enactment to ascertain whether or not it comes within the framework of the Constitution ;  (2) Legislation is presumed to be constitutional. Unconstitutionality must be clearly shown, and all doubts are to be resolved in favor of validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Keeping these principles firmly in mind, several issues are presented for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">I. <em>Does the Constitutional Prohibition Against Imprisonment for Debt Apply in Criminal Cases? Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The People contend that this constitutional prohibition does not apply in criminal cases. With that contention we cannot agree. Although such a general statement appears in several cases <em>(In re Nowak, </em>184 Cal. 701 [195 P. 402] <em>; In re Oswald, </em>76 Cal.App. 347 [244 P. 940]), these statements were expressly disapproved in <em>In re Trombley, </em>31 Cal.2d 801 [193 P.2d 734]. In that case the court stated, at page 804 (after quoting section 15 of article I of the California Constitution) : \u201cAlthough by its terms the prohibition is directed to imprisonment in civil actions, it has been held to apply in a criminal proceeding when it appears that the legislation under which the accused is charged constitutes an attempt to make the mere act of failing to pay a debt a crime. (Citations.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\"> II. <em>Are These Workers\u2019 Contributions Taxes, and, If So, Does the Prohibition Against Imprisonment for Debt Apply to Taxes? The Answer to Both of These Questions Is Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The People contend that these contributions are taxes, and that the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt does not apply to taxes. As to the first contention, the weight of authority appears to be that these workers\u2019 contributions are taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The Supreme Court in <em>Umpire Star Mines Co. </em>v. <em>California Employment Commission, </em>28 Cal.2d 33 [168 P.2d 686), held that the word \u201ccontributions\u201d as used in the California Unemployment Insurance Code is \u201ca euphemistic expression meaning tax exactions (page 47).\u201d Section 989 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code refers to \u201cthe annual tax rate or contribution rate.\u201d In <em>In re Hacker-Byrnes Corp., </em>96 F.Supp. 349, the court states: \u201cWe think that the monies which were withheld from the wages of the employees (under California Unemployment Insurance Code) are clearly taxes. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">However, we cannot agree with the People\u2019s contention that this constitutional prohibition does not apply to taxes. The expression \u201cthe law abolishing imprisonment for debt has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>no application for taxes\u201d is to be found in Cooley on Taxation, fourth edition, paragraphs 22 and 1349, and cases cited therein. However, most of these cases are license cases. There the penalty is for engaging in business without paying the tax, not simply for nonpayment of a tax. There the defendant is not charged with failure to pay the license or tax; he is charged with carrying on a business without a license which he could secure by the paying of a license or tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In all cases found in our research the element of wilfulness is found to be present before a criminal act is held to have been committed. The expression \u201cwilfully non-complying,\u201d \u201cwilfully neglecting,\u201d \u201cwilfully refusing,\u201d \u201cwilfully attempting\u201d appears in all legislation in which criminal prosecution for failure to pay the tax is upheld. It appears to us that there must be criminal intent and wilfulness so as to bring the matter within the fraud exception to this constitutional prohibition (see below) before imprisonment for nonpayment of taxes may be had. Thus, we hold that the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt does apply to taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">III. <em>Does Section 2110 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code Come Within the Fraud Exception to the Constitutional Prohibition Against Imprisonment for Debt? Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">This constitutional prohibition is expressly subject to the exception \u201cunless in case of fraud.\u201d The people contend that this section, as reasonably interpreted, brings the case within this exception. With this contention we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The section provides that an employer is guilty of a criminal offense who knowingly withholds the deduction and \u201cwilfully fails or is financially unable to pay.\u201d The first alternative, i.e. \u201cwilfully fails ... to pay\u201d is, under the authority of <em>In re Trombley (supra), </em>clearly constitutional as a \u201ccase of fraud.\u201d In that case it was declared a misdemeanor for an employer who \u201chaving the ability to pay, wilfully refuses to pay wages, etc.\u201d The court held, on page 810, that \u201can employer who knows that wages are due, has ability to pay them, and still refuses to pay them, acts against good morals and fair dealing, and necessarily intentionally does an act which prejudices the rights of his employee. Such conduct amounts to a \u2018case of fraud\u2019 within the meaning of the exception to the constitutional prohibition and may be punished by statute.\u201d The same reasoning fits the situation in this case. An employer who knowingly withholds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>the deductions and then <em>wilfully </em>fails to pay them does an act against good morals and fair dealing and necessarily intentionally does an act which prejudices the rights of the employee. Such conduct amounts to \u201ca case of fraud\u201d and is an exception to the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The second alternative, \u201cor is financially unable,\u201d presents a problem in interpretation. If this provision is interpreted to provide that simply being financially unable to pay is a criminal offense, it is clearly within the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. Simple insolvency would be a crime. The employing unit, and each member of it, would be guilty of a crime, if a dishonest employee or partner would embezzle the funds or if the money was stolen, lost, or destroyed, regardless of proof of fault. Such was clearly not the intent of the Legislature.  In order for there to exist a case of fraud so as to bring this or any other ease within the fraud exception to this constitutional prohibition, there must exist wilfulness.  The word \u201cwilfully\u201d as used in criminal statutes implies a purpose or willingness to commit the act, and although it does not require an evil intent, it implies that the person knows what he is doing, intends to do what he is doing, and is a free agent <em>(In re Trombley, supra). </em>Thus, the question presented is, with reasonable interpretation, does the word \u201cwilfully\u201d qualify not only the word \u201cfails,\u201d but also \u201cis financially unable.\u201d We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">It appears to us that the Legislature intended by this section to punish the individual who wilfully has divested himself of these withheld contributions. For example, he pays business creditors with them, gambles them away, conveys them to his wife in a property settlement agreement, and then comes to court and says, \u201cI am not wilfully failing to pay these withheld deductions, I simply don\u2019t have them. I am financially unable to pay them.\u201d If he is wilfully financially unable to pay them, he is guilty. If not wilfully financially unable, but innocently so, then he is not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">How effectively did the Legislature carry out this intent? We grant that this is an awkwardly drawn law. The Legislature might well have repeated the word \u201cwilfully\u201d before each alternative, so that it would read \u201cwilfully is financially unable,\u201d but it did not. However, it should be noted that there is no punctuation which would indicate any intent that the word \u201cwilfully\u201d does not qualify this second alternative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>An examination of penal statutes with alternative provisions indicates that the Legislature does not repeat the words \u201cwilfully,\u201d \u201cmaliciously,\u201d \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cunlawfully\u201d before each of the alternative acts proscribed. Typical is section 415 of the Penal Code which provides, \u201cEvery person who maliciously and wilfully disturbs the peace and quiet ... by loud or unusual noise ... or who upon the public highways . . . runs a horse-race ... or fires any gun ... or uses any vulgar, profane, or indecent language ... is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The words \u201cwilfully\u201d and \u201cmaliciously\u201d are not repeated before each alternative; yet each alternative is read as though they were, and proof of wilfulness and malice is essential before a successful prosecution can be had on any alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We hold that the word \u201cwilfully\u201d qualifies the phrase \u201cis financially unable.\u201d Thus, a showing of wilfulness is necessary for a conviction. This case is thus distinguishable from the case of <em>In re Crane, </em>26 Cal.App. 22 [145 P. 733], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolder, </em>53 Cal.App. 45 [199 P. 832], in which statutes were held unconstitutional as being violative of the constitutional prohibition since the provisions in those statutes did not require wilfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to set aside the order of dismissal and proceed with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">West, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
