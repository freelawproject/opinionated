The various governmental agencies (collectively the United States) appealed the Judgment on Decision to this court. Because we conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in failing to follow the law of the case, and that the decision denying the United States\u2019 right to setoff was incorrect, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-22\">In 1984 Steve A. Buckner (Buckner) and John M. and Leona J. Tuttle (the Tuttles) each borrowed money from FmHA. These debts were secured by mortgages on Buckner\u2019s home and the Tuttles\u2019 crops, respectively. Buckner and the Tuttles also entered into contracts with the CRP in 1987 and 1989. They agreed that for ten years they would not farm and would conduct conservation practices on certain depleted land in exchange for an annual payment from the CRP consisting of a rental payment per acre of land and a share of the costs of the conservation practices. No funds were due each year from the CRP to Buckner or the Tuttles until the government\u2019s fiscal year ended with Buckner and the Tuttles in compliance with the contracts, and until Congress made funds available to pay on CRP contracts the following fiscal year. When Buckner and the Tuttles defaulted under their FmHA loans, FmHA notified the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the entity that administered the CRP, of its intent to exercise an administrative offset of amounts due to Buckner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the Tuttles under their respective CRP contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">A. The Buckner Case</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Buckner filed a petition seeking relief under chapter 13 in November of 1990, prior to FmHA exercising its setoff rights. FmHA filed motions for relief from the automatic stay to allow it to setoff Buckner\u2019s annual 1990 CRP program payment of $5,562.20, as well as future CRP payments, against its claim. The bankruptcy court granted FmHA relief from stay as to the CRP payment that was owed when Buckner filed his chapter 13 petition,- but denied it relief as to all future payments that Buckner would earn by post-petition performance of the CRP contract (Bankruptcy Court Order). FmHA appealed the Bankruptcy Court Order to the district court (District Court Appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">While the District Court Appeal was pending, FmHA and Buckner entered into an agreement regarding his chapter 13 plan. Buckner agreed to assume the CRP contract and make payments toward FmHA\u2019s secured claim. The claim amount was fixed at the stipulated value of his home. Buckner\u2019s payments on FmHA\u2019s secured claim would be paid with funds received in the future under the CRP contract. At the conclusion of payments pursuant to the plan, Buckner was required to refinance his home and pay FmHA whatever it had not yet been paid on the amount of its secured claim. FmHA\u2019s claimed right to setoff future CRP payments was not treated as part of its secured claim as allowed under \u00a7 506(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">FmHA sought a continuance of the confirmation hearing on Buckner\u2019s plan, arguing that the plan should not be confirmed until there was a resolution of FmHA\u2019s right to setoff through the District Court Appeal. The bankruptcy court denied FmHA\u2019s motion for a continuance, stating that if FmHA was not satisfied with its treatment under Buckner\u2019s plan it should appeal the confirmation order and seek consolidation of such an appeal with the District Court Appeal. The bankruptcy court entered an order confirming Buckner\u2019s plan in June of 1991. FmHA did not appeal the confirmation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">According to the bankruptcy court, the fact that the confirmed plan did not treat future CRP payments as part of FmEA\u2019s allowed secured claim was not communicated to the district court in the District Court Appeal. In March of 1994, almost three years after the confirmation order became final, a decision was issued in the District Court Appeal. In <em>In re Buckner, </em>165 B.R. 942 (D.Kan.1994) (District Court Order), the district court reversed the Bankruptcy Court Order, concluding that the United States was entitled to setoff because both the debt CRP owed to Buckner for CRP payments and FmHA\u2019s claim against Buckner for mortgage payments arose prepetition. The District Court Order remanded the matter \u201cfor a determination of whether the government [was] entitled to relief from the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In August of 1996, two years after the District Court Order was issued and after the Tenth Circuit ruled on setoff rights in an unrelated ease involving CRP payments, <em>Turner v. Small Business Administration (In re Turner), </em>84 F.3d 1294 (10th Cir.1996) (en bane) (government should be considered a unitary creditor for purpose of setoff under \u00a7 553), the bankruptcy court held an eviden-tiary hearing in Buckner\u2019s case. We do not know what prompted this hearing, whether it was pursuant to a motion or as a result of the District Court Order. However, the evidence presented described the nature of the CRP program. At the time of the hearing Buckner had completed his chapter 13 plan payments, and the parties contested the government\u2019s right to setoff a CRP payment Buckner became entitled to receive under his prepetition contract late in 1996, after his plan was completed. At the close of the evidence, the bankruptcy court took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">B. The Tuttles\u2019 Case</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">In the Tuttles\u2019 case, ASCS approved FmHA\u2019s request for an administrative setoff, and several months later the Tuttles filed a petition seeking relief under chapter 11. The Tuttles filed an adversary proceeding seeking turnover and injunctive relief to obtain an order that a CRP payment that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>withheld be paid, and that all future CRP payments be made as they became due. The bankruptcy court allowed the Tuttles to use CRP payments upon providing adequate protection to FmHA in the form of a second mortgage. The bankruptcy court subsequently stayed this adversary proceeding as well as the Tuttles\u2019 main case pending resolution of the District Court Appeal in Buckner\u2019s case. There is no record before us that the Tuttles assumed the CRP contract, or of the terms of or confirmation of any plan in the Tuttles\u2019 chapter 11 case. In 1994, after the District Court Order was issued in Buckner\u2019s case, FmHA moved for relief from stay to effect a setoff in the Tuttles\u2019 case. This motion was not resolved and was still pending at the time the bankruptcy court issued its Judgment on Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">C. The Judgment on Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In July of 1997, three years after the District Court Order was issued<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one year after the evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court issued the Judgment on Decision supported by a Memorandum Decision (collectively the Judgment), reported at <em>In re Buckner, </em>211 B.R. 46 (Bankr.D.Kan.1997), which is the subject of this appeal. The Judgment was issued as a consolidated ruling in both Buckner\u2019s ease and in the adversary proceeding pending between the Tuttles and the United States. The bankruptcy court ruled that the United States did not have a right to setoff because Buckner and the Tuttles incurred their debts to FmHA pre-petition, but Buckner and the Tuttles\u2019 CRP payments were earned by them and funded by Congress postpetition. <em>Id. </em>at 46. In the Buckner case, the bankruptcy court refused to apply the District Court Order that gave the United States a right to setoff. Instead, the bankruptcy court concluded that the District Court Order was entered in an appeal that was moot as a result of the unappealed order confirming Buckner\u2019s chapter 13 plan, and that the district court was not privy to important facts revealed at the August 1996 hearing. Therefore, the bankruptcy court determined the District Court Order was not controlling under the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">II. <em>Appellate Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\"><em>We </em>have jurisdiction over this appeal. The Judgment is a \u201cfinal\u201d order, subject to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), and the United States\u2019. notice of appeal was timely filed. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002. The parties have consented to this court\u2019s jurisdiction by failing to elect to have their respective appeals heard by the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c)(1); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001; 10th Cir. L.R. 8001-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">We accept the factual findings reported in <em>Buckner, </em>211 B.R. at 47-51, because none are contested by the parties. Since we have not been supplied with a record that would allow review of the otherwise uncontested findings, we accept them over any inconsistent statements of fact made by the parties in their respective briefs. <em>Deines v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., </em>969 F.2d 977, 979-80 (10th Cir.1992) (and cases cited therein) (appellant has burden to establish evidentiary record).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">We review that portion of the Judgment refusing to apply the District Court Order in Buckner\u2019s case as the law of the case under an abuse of discretion standard. The law of the case doctrine is a discretionary rule of practice in the courts. <em>See, e.g., Messinger v. Anderson, </em>225 U.S. 436, 444, 32 S.Ct. 739, 740, 56 L.Ed. 1152 (1912) (law of the case expresses practice of courts to refuse.to reopen what has been decided); <em>United States v. Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d 114, 116 (10th Cir.1991) (law of the case is only a rule of practice and not a limit on a court\u2019s power). A ruling that is discretionary is reviewed utilizing an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 558, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2546-47, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (stating generally that matters of discretion are reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard). \u201cUnder the abuse of discretion standard: \u2018a trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>pellate court has a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moothart v. Bell, </em>21 F.3d 1499, 1504 (10th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>McEwen v. City of Norman, Oklahoma, </em>926 F.2d 1539, 1553-54 (10th Cir.1991)). An abuse of discretion may occur if a court bases its ruling on a view of the law that is erroneous. <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2460-61, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990); <em>accord Ute Indian Tribe v. State of Utah, </em>114 F.3d 1513, 1520 (10th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S _, 118 S.Ct. 1034, 140 L.Ed.2d 101 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We review the Judgment <em>de novo </em>to determine if the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law in denying the United States a right to setoff. <em>Underwood, </em>487 U.S. at 558, 108 S.Ct. at 2546 (questions of law are reviewable <em>de </em>novo); <em>Lilly v. Fieldstone, </em>876 F.2d 857, 858 (10th Cir.1989) (standard of review is the same as that was applied by the trial court in making its ruling).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">A. Failure to Follow the Law of the Case Set Forth in the District Court Order was an Abuse of Discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">In Buckner\u2019s case the bankruptcy court disallowed the United States\u2019 right to setoff after the District Court Order reached the opposite conclusion. The United States argues that the bankruptcy court was not free to revisit the setoff issue in Buckner\u2019s case because it was bound under the doctrine of law of the case to apply the District Court Order. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Under the law of the case doctrine, \u201cwhen a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages of the same case.\u201d <em>Arizona v. California, </em>460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 1390-91, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983), <em>quoted in Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d at 115; <em>accord Ute Indian Tribe, </em>114 F.3d at 1520. In <em>Monsisvais, </em>the Tenth Circuit quoted with approval the First Circuit\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Rivera-Martinez, </em>931 F.2d 148, 150 (1st Cir.1991) (citing <em>Arizona, </em>460 U.S. at 618, 103 S.Ct. at 1390-91), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">[I]n terms of the dynamics between trial and appellate courts, the phrase \u201claw of the case\u201d signifies, in broad outline, that a decision of an appellate tribunal on a particular issue, unless vacated or set aside, governs the issue during all subsequent stages of the litigation in the nisi prius court, and thereafter on any further appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">946 F.2d at 115-16; <em>accord Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. v. Woolsey &amp; Co., Inc., </em>81 F.3d 1540, 1543 (10th Cir.1996) (a trial court may not reconsider a question decided by an appellate court). The policy behind the doctrine is to promote both judicial efficiency and the public policy that litigation should come to an end, and the doctrine is designed to quickly resolve disputes by preventing continued reargument of issues already decided. <em>Anthony v. Baker, </em>955 F.2d 1395, 1397 n. 1 (10th Cir.1992); <em>accord Wilson v. Meeks, </em>98 F.3d 1247, 1250 (10th Cir.1996). It also serves the purpose of \u201cassuring [trial] court compliance with the decisions of the appellate court.\u201d <em>Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d at 116. The law of the case doctrine is applicable in Buckner\u2019s case because the District Court Order squarely determined the United States\u2019 right to setoff, the same issue decided in the Judgment. <em>See Rishell v. Jane Phillips Episcopal Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>94 F.3d 1407, 1410 (10th Cir.1996) (law of the case doctrine applicable if appellate court explicitly issues decision on the merits of claim sought to be precluded), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 1331, 137 L.Ed.2d 491 (1997), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 1427, 137 L.Ed.2d 536 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">Issues decided on appeal become the law of the case and are to be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court, \u201c \u2018unless the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different, controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues, or the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d at 117 (quoting <em>White v. Murtha, </em>377 F.2d 428, 431-32 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>381 F.2d 34 (5th Cir.1967)); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>accord Stifel, </em>81 F.3d at 1548 (citing cases); <em>Woods v. Kenan (In re Woods), </em>215 B.R. 623, 625 (10th Cir. BAP 1998). The Tenth Circuit reads these exceptions to the law of the case doctrine narrowly, requiring trial courts to apply the law of the case unless one of the exceptions specifically applies. <em>Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d at 117 (following both <em>United States v. White, </em>846 F.2d 678, 685 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 984, 109 S.Ct. 538, 102 L.Ed.2d 568 (1988), and <em>Leggett v. Badger, </em>798 F.2d 1387, 1389 n. 2 (11th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The Judgment stated two reasons why the District Court Order was not law of the case: (1) the failure to appeal the order confirming Buckner\u2019s chapter 13 plan that treated the United States\u2019 claim as secured only to the extent of the value of Buckner\u2019s home, rendered the District Court Appeal moot; and (2) the record in the District Court Appeal did not contain evidence later presented to the bankruptcy court showing that, except for the 1990 payment, no CRP money was available for setoff when Buckner filed chapter 13. <em>Buckner, </em>211 B.R. at 55-56. We interpret these reasons to have been a ruling that the District Court Order was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice, and that subsequent evidence adduced at the August 1996 hearing before the bankruptcy court was substantially different from that relied upon in the District Court Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The mootness argument set forth in the Judgment relies upon \u00a7 1327(a), which provides that a confirmed plan binds creditors to the terms of the plan. <em>See Paul v. Monts, </em>906 F.2d 1468, 1471 (10th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (under \u00a7 1141(a), which is similar to \u00a7 1327(a), a confirmed plan binds the debtor and creditors); <em>Andersen v. Higher Education Assistance Foundation (In re Andersen), </em>215 B.R. 792 (10th Cir. BAP 1998). Under this theory, even if the United States had a valid setoff right prepetition, the order confirming Buckner\u2019s chapter 13 plan, which fixed the value of the United States\u2019 secured claim pursuant to \u00a7 506<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the value of Buckner\u2019s home, had the effect of terminating the United States\u2019 right to setoff. As a result, the bankruptcy court\u2019s final confirmation order, which was entered prior to the District Court Order, rendered the District Court Appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">We disagree with the mootness analysis contained ,in the Judgment. We recognize that mootness is a jurisdictional issue that must be analyzed at all stages of litigation, <em>Arizonans For Official English v. Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, \u2014, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 1067, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997); <em>Yellow Cab Cooperative Ass\u2019n v. Metro Taxi, Inc. (In re Yellow Cab Cooperative Ass\u2019n), </em>132 F.3d 591, 594 (10th Cir.1997), and have no quarrel with the bankruptcy court reviewing whether the setoff issue was moot <em>when remanded. </em>It did not do so. Instead, the Judgment essentially <em>vacated </em>the District Court Order, concluding that it had been entered when the setoff issue was moot. Unhampered by the District Court Order, the Judgment then went on to rule on the exact issue that was the subject of the District Court Appeal: whether the United States has a right to setoff the CRP payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court had no authority to vacate the District Court Order, which was issued by a district court sitting as an appellate court in bankruptcy. The district court was the appropriate court to determine its jurisdiction over the District Court Appeal, including whether or not the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation order mooted <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the District Court Appeal, or the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>lying issue of whether the United States\u2019 setoff rights survived confirmation without the need for an appeal of the confirmation order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">For purposes of applying the law of the case doctrine, the sole concern was whether the District Court Order was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in light of the confirmation order. <em>See Monsisvais, </em>946 F.2d at 117. Upon a review of the law, we conclude that the District Court Order was not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d notwithstanding the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The issue of whether setoff rights can be modified by a confirmed chapter 13 plan is not settled. <em>See </em>5 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 553.08 (Lawrence P. King ed., 15th ed. rev. 1997). The Ninth Circuit, in <em>Carolco Television Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co. (In re De Laurentiis Entertainment Group), </em>963 F.2d 1269, 1274-78 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 918, 113 S.Ct. 330, 121 L.Ed.2d 249 (1992) (collecting eases), discussed the direct conflict between the prepetition setoff rights preserved under \u00a7 553 and the binding nature of a confirmed plan under \u00a7 1141. The Ninth Circuit concluded that for historical reasons, to ensure the equitable treatment of creditors, and because of the language of the statute, \u00a7 553 takes precedence over \u00a7 1141(a), and prepetition setoff rights are unaffected by a confirmed chapter 11 plan. <em>Id; but see United States v. Continental Airlines (In re Continental Airlines), </em>134 F.3d 536 (3d Cir. 1998). <em>Be Laurentiis </em>relied, in part, upon the Tenth Circuit\u2019s ruling in the chapter 7 case of <em>Davidovich v. Welton (In re Davidovich), </em>901 F.2d 1533, 1539 (10th Cir.1990), that \u201ca discharged debt may be setoff upon compliance with the terms and conditions stated in section 553 of the Code.\u201d Under <em>Bavidovich, </em>therefore, it is arguable that the bankruptcy court\u2019s unappealed confirmation order had no effect on the United States\u2019 alleged setoff right. The District Court Order is not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and, absent the application of some other exception, must be applied in Buckner\u2019s case as law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The second reason stated by the bankruptcy court for refusing to apply the District Court Order as the law of the case in Buckner\u2019s ease was that the evidence received by it at the evidentiary hearing on remand was unavailable to the district court in the District Court Appeal. While, as discussed above, substantially different evidence is an exception to the law of the case doctrine, this exception does not apply unless the \u201cnew\u201d evidence was unavailable to the parties during earlier proceedings. As the Tenth Circuit has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201cThe \u2018different evidence\u2019 exception to the law of the case doctrine does not apply when a trial court gratuitously jettisons the rule in order to address an issue explicitly decided, and foreclosed, in an earlier appeal in the same case.

Thus, although they have not necessarily expressed this reasoning, some courts have correctly specified the creditors\u2019s debt to the debtor must be <em>\u201cabsolutely owed\u201d and \u201c\u2018all the transactions which gave rise to [the] debt occurred prior to the petition date.\u2019 \u201d Braniff Airways[, Inc.] v.

Since the Tuttles performed conservation work on and did not plant the land, and since Congress appropriated funds for CRP payments postpetition, the bankruptcy court concluded the obligation to pay the CRP payments was not \u201cabsolutely owed\u201d and thus constituted a postpetition debt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We conclude that the interpretation recited in the Judgment that \u201cdebt\u201d is not \u201ccoextensive\u201d with \u201cclaim\u201d is incorrect, and thus the underpinning of the decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>setoff is in error. In <em>Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v.

This broad reading of the word \u201cdebt\u201d is controlling in the context of \u00a7 533(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Even if <em>Davenport </em>was not controlling, the interpretation in the Judgment that to constitute a \u201cdebt,\u201d liability must be \u201cabsolute\u201d on the petition date with no contingencies whatsoever is not supported by case law. Although both the Eighth Circuit in <em>Gerth </em>and the Fifth Circuit in <em>Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>814 F.2d 1030, 1036 (5th Cir.1987), state that a debt must be \u201cabsolutely\u201d owed, these courts ultimately conclude that unmatured, contingent, or unliqui-dated obligations may be \u201cabsolutely\u201d owed as of the petition date and capable of setoff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Tenth Circuit has not even focused on the \u201cabsolute\u201d nature of a debt as of the petition date, much less an interpretation of \u201cabsolute\u201d that excludes unmatured, contingent, or unliquidated obligations. Instead, under Tenth Circuit law, a \u201cdebt\u201d or a \u201cclaim\u201d subject to setoff under \u00a7 553(a) must be \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d on the petition date. <em>Peterson Distrib., </em>82 F.3d at 959-63; <em>Davidovich, </em>901 F.2d at 1537; <em>see Davenport, </em>495 U.S. at 559, 110 S.Ct. at 2131 (in interpreting \u201cclaim\u201d and,- therefore, \u201cdebt,\u201d the Court noted that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of a \u2018right to payment\u2019 is nothing more nor less than an enforceable obligation_\u201d). This broader interpretation of \u201cdebt\u201d is consistent with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s ruling that a debt for which liability attaches, although the amount remains unascertained, is nonetheless subject to setoff. In a pre-Code case, the Tenth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">[T]he tax refund due the bankrupt ... was not due on the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy in the sense that there was at that time no legal duty on the United States to make such refund since no claim therefor had been filed.... But the overpayments had been made and the liability therefor existed. The amount of such liability was not ascertained and determined until later. But it existed in an undetermined amount at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. And the mere fact that the amount of the liability was not determined until after the intervention of bankruptcy does not deprive the Government of the right of setoff it is [sic] otherwise would have existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-15\"><em>Luther v.

Based on the evidence adduced at the August 1996 hearing, the Judgment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The debtors signed contracts with the government which called for performance over ten-year periods, each year constituting an annual rental period. For each rental period, the government was not bound to pay unless the debtors fulfilled their obligations under the contracts and Congress, in its discretion, appropriated CRP funds to the CCC [ (Commodity Credit Corporation)]. If the debtors failed to perform, the government could terminate the contract and seek a refund of all previous payments.... When the debtors led [sic] for bankruptcy, the CCC had no money to pay them any future rent but, at most, had money to pay them for their performance during the prior fiscal year. When the FmHA requested setoff, the CCC had no money to give it for future years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Buckner, </em>211 B.R. at 52. No party asserts that the Tuttles\u2019 CRP contract is invalid. The only issue is whether the Tuttles\u2019 obligation to perform postpetition or the payment provisions in the contract rendered the United States\u2019 duty to pay unenforceable. No party argues that the Tuttles\u2019 CRP contract was unenforceable prepetition. The Tuttles performed and the United States paid in the years prior to the filing of the Tuttles\u2019 chapter 11 case. It follows that the United States\u2019 debt to the Tuttles for CRP payments was \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d on the day that they filed chapter 11 and this pre-petition debt may be setoff by the United States against claims that it has against the Tuttles.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Tuttles, and farmers in other cases, have argued that CRP payments are postpe-tition debts thereby precluding setoff because the yearly obligations of the United States and the farmers under CRP contracts are conditions precedent so that the contracts are not enforceable each year until performed, as opposed to mutual promises resulting in an enforceable contract on the day that the' contract is signed. The Judgment touched upon this argument, but did not resolve it. Rather, the Judgment concluded that the CRP payments were not \u201cabsolutely owing\u201d to the Tuttles on the petition date because, when the contract was signed, the Tuttles\u2019 performance thereunder was conditioned on the United States\u2019 subsequent obligation to pay the annual rental payment for each year. <em>Buckner, </em>211 B.R. at 54. For the reasons stated above, the Judgment\u2019s restriction that to constitute a debt the obligation must be \u201cabsolutely owed\u201d is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The majority of the case law concludes that the United States\u2019 obligation to make CRP payments arises when CRP contracts are signed, <em>ie., </em>CRP contracts create mutual promises rather than conditions precedent. <em>See Gerth, </em>991 F.2d at 1436; <em>Buckner, </em>165 B.R. at 946-47; <em>United States v.

In Buckner the district court entered its order reversing the order of the bankruptcy court that denied the United States\u2019 motion for relief from stay.

This was the explicit finding by the bankruptcy court in its Judgment. <em>In re Buckner, </em>211 B.R. 46, 51 (Bankr.D.Kan.1997). Thus, the parties were not back before the bankruptcy court contesting the issues framed by the motion of the United States for relief from stay. Instead, the parties were then contesting the right of the United States to set off the CRP payment Buckner became entitled to receive late in 1996, after his plan was completed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The bankruptcy court held that the United States was bound by the terms of the debt- or\u2019s Chapter 13 plan, and had retained no right of set off that it could effect after the plan payments were completed. The majority addresses the question of whether set off rights can be modified by a confirmed chapter 13 plan, but does so in the context of deciding whether the District Court Order was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d I do not believe the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d analysis is apt.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-1\">Bankruptcy proceedings are not static; they are fluid and continuing. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying the motion of the United States for relief from stay was on appeal at the time the court entered its order confirming Buckner\u2019s chapter 13 plan. I agree with the bankruptcy court in its holding that the plan became final and binding on the parties and governed the future course of the chapter 13 ease. The mandate of the district court does not supersede the order of confirmation. Where I would part company with the bankruptcy court is in its conclusion that the plan cut off the right of the United States to exercise its right of set off post-consummation of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-2\">As the majority recognizes, this issue is not without controversy. Nevertheless, and without further lengthening this concurrence, I would follow the holding of the Ninth Circuit in the <em>Carolco </em>case, where it concluded that section 553 of the Code takes precedence over an order of confirmation. <em>Carolco Television Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co. (In re De Laurentiis Entertainment Group), </em>963 F.2d 1269 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 918, 113 S.Ct. 330, 121 L.Ed.2d 249 (1992). Based on that precedent I would reverse the order of the bankruptcy court and remand for the entry of an appropriate order allowing the United States to exercise its right of set off as to any CRP payments that became payable to Buckner after consummation of his plan.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
