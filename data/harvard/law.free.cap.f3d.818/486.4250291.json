Bd. of Trs., </em>795 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir.2015). We offer a brief summary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">Bos was an employer who was bound by a handful of Trust Agreements to make payments to certain employee pension Funds, which were administered by the Board of Trustees: <em>Id. </em>at 1007. Bos struggled to meet his obligation, and in March 2009 he signed a Promissory Note pledging to make monthly contributions and personally guaranteeing payment to the Funds of $359,592.09. He mostly fell short. In August 2009 the Board.brought a grievance against Bos, and an arbitrator ruled that he had violated such obligations, awarding the Funds $504,282.59. A California Superior Court confirmed the Board\u2019s arbitration award and later entered a judgment against Bos in the same amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">Around the same time, Bos filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. <em>Id. </em>at 1008. When Bos tried to discharge the half-million-dollar debt he owed the Funds, the Board objected, and brought an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court in an effort to have Bos\u2019s debt declared nondis-chargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. <em>Id. </em>The Board sought relief under three different provisions of the Code. One of those provisions, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4), provides that a debtor may not discharge a debt he incurred through \u201cfraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary, capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">Bos conceded that the Trust Agreements and the Promissory Note were fully enforceable, conceded that he had breached them, and conceded that his debt to the Funds was valid. Bos argued, however, that the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s exceptions to discharge simply did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"AEJq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The bankruptcy court sided with the Board, ultimately ruling that Bos\u2019s debt could not be discharged because he was a \u201cfiduciary\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4), The district court, affirmed. Both courts decided that Bos was a fiduciary under the Bankruptcy Code because they determined that he was a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Bos then appealed to this Court and we concluded th\u00e1t he was not a fiduciary under ERISA, and thus the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s \u201cfiduciary\u201d exception to discharge could not be applied to him. <em>Bos, </em>795 F.3d at 1008-12. Having prevailed on the merits, Bos now seeks to recover attorney\u2019s fees expended litigating the nondischarge-ability action from the bankruptcy court up through our court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Bos\u2019s motion rests on two bases. First, he invokes a certain fee-shifting provision under California law, California Civil Code \u00a7 1717. Alternatively, he argues that ERISA authorizes us to award him fees in our discretion, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), and he asks us to do so.'</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Section 1717 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to other costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1717(a). The effect of section. 1717 is to make reciprocal an otherwise unilateral contractual obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Santisas v. Goodin, </em>17 Cal.4th 599, 610-11, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">As we recently explained, \u201c[tjhree conditions must be met before [section 1717] applies.\u201d <em>In re Penrod, </em>802 F.3d 1084, 1087 (9th Cir.2015). First, the action generating \u2022 the fees must have been an action \u201con a contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the contract must provide that attorney\u2019s fees incurred to enforce it shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>And third, the- party seeking fees must have prevailed in the underlying action. <em>Id </em>at 1087-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">The California Supreme' Court has explained that \u201csection 1717 applies' only to actions th\u00e1t contain at least one contract claim,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f an action-asserts both contract and tort or other noncontract claims, section' 1717 applies only to attorney fees incurred to litigate the- contract claims.\u201d <em>Santisas, </em>17 Cal.4th at 615, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399. Consistent with <em>Santisas, </em>we have previously held that a nondischargeability action is \u201con a contract\u201d within section' 1717 if \u201cthe' bankruptcy court needed to determine the enforceability of the ... agreement to determine dischargeability.\u201d <em>In re Baroff, </em>105 F.3d 439, 442 (9th Cir.1997),</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the' Ninth Circuit has held'that <em>Santisas </em>and Relevant Ninth' Circuit 'cases 'establish not just a rule of inclusion, but also a rule of exclusion: that \u201cif the bankruptcy court did <em>not </em>need to determine whether the contract was enforceable, then the dis-chargeability clairri is <em>not </em>an action on the contract within the meaning of [California Civil Code] \u00a7 1717.\u201d <em>In re Davison, </em>289 B.R. 716, 723 (9th Cir. BAP. 2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">We adopt the BAP\u2019s construction of section 1717. It accords with the common sense meaning of the phrase \u201con a contract\u201d' and finds ample support in our precedents. For instance, we have held that an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court was not \u201con a contract\u201d within-the meaning of section 1717 where the action neither litigated the validity of the contract nor required the bankruptcy court to consider \u201cthe state law governing contractual relationships.\u201d <em>In re Johnson, </em>756 F.2d 738, 740 (9th Cir.1985). More broadly, we instructed that when \u201cfederal and not state law govern[s] the substantive issues involved in the [adversary proceeding],\u201d we may not \u201caward[ ] attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a state statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Likewise, in <em>In re Fulwiler, </em>624 F.2d 908 (9th Cir.1980), we held that a non-dischargeability action, in bankruptcy, was not \u201con a.contract\u201d under an Oregon fee-shifting statute identical to section 1717. <em>Id. </em>at 909 (citing, Or.Rev.Stat.. \u00a7 20.096). The reason, we later explained, was that \u201cthe bankruptcy court did not adjudicate the validity of the note in determining whether the debt was dischargeable,\u201d and so the note was merely \u201ccollateral to the non-dischargeability proceeding.\u201d <em>Baroff, </em>105 F.3d at 442 (citing <em>Fulwiler, </em>624 F.2d at 909-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Similarly, in <em>In re Hashemi, </em>104 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir.1996), we. cited <em>Baroff </em>in holding that a creditor\u2019s \u201cdischargeability claim [was] not an actiop on the contract,\u201d within the meaning of the contract itself, because \u201cthe bankruptcy court did not need to \u2018determine the enforceability of the ... agreement to determine dischargeability.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1126 (quoting <em>Baroff, 105 </em>F.3d at 442).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In light of our precedents, we are persuaded-that the action underlying Bos\u2019s fee request \u2014 the nondischargeability proceeding that began in bankruptcy court \u2014 \u25a0 was not an action \u201con a contract\u201d within the meaning of section 1717. As the parties agree, \u201c[t]here was no \u2018breach of contract\u2019 claim in the Trust Funds\u2019 adversary complaint,\u201d The nondischargeability proceeding arose entirely under the federal Bankruptcy Code, and in no way required the bankruptcy court to determine whether or to what extent the Trust Agreements or the Note were enforceable against. Bos, or whether Bos had violated their terms. Those questions had been answered in arbitration, and confirmed by a State Court; indeed, in the nondischargeability action Bos conceded that such contracts were valid and that he had breached them. The litigation from that point forward asked only whether federal bankruptcy law forbade Bos from discharging the debts everyone agreed he owed to the Funds. Such litigation is collateral to a contract rather than \u201con a contract,\u201d and as a consequence Bos may not use section 1717 to recover the fees he incurred in pursuing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Bos\u2019s principal counterargument relies on our recent decision in <em>Penrod, </em>802 F.3d 1084. There, Penrod incurred her attorney\u2019s fees in an action that sought \u201cto enforce, or avoid enforcement of, the provisions of the contract\u201d between herself and one of her creditors. <em>Id. </em>at 1088. Specifically, the action underlying Pen-rod\u2019s motion for fees had asked \u201cwhether [a] provision- of the contract should be enforced according to its terms, or whether its enforceability was limited by bankruptcy law to exclude [a particular] portion of the loan. By prevailing in that litigation, Penrod obtained a ruling that precluded [her creditor] from fully enforcing the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Penrod\u2019s action, in other words, required \u201cthe bankruptcy court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>... to determine the enforceability of the ... agreement,\u201d and so it was comfortably an action \u201con a contract\u201d within section 1717\u2019s previously recognized reach. <em>Baroff, </em>105 F.3d at 442. In Bos\u2019s case, by contrast, the relevant action did not raise any question about the enforceability of the Trust Agreements .or .the Note. Such action was therefore not \u201con a contract,\u201d and the attorney\u2019s fees Bos incurred are not recoverable under section 1717.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Nor is Bos entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA. ERISA\u2019s fee-shifting provision provides that \u201c[i]n any action under this subchapter ... by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). Bos\u2019s attempt to invoke ERISA fails because the' nondis-chargeability action \u2014 the action giving rise to his fee request \u2014 was not an' \u201caction under\u201d ERISA, and therefore \u00a7 1132(g)(1) does not make Bos eligible to recover fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Indeed, a party is eligible to recover fees under ERISA only if the action giving rise \"\"to his fee request .meets the test for \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction set forth in ERISA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e). Such rule should not be surprising; it comes directly from the straightforward language of the- statute itself. In particular-, \u00a7 1132(g)(1) follows immediately after ERISA\u2019s jurisdictional provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 1132(e)(1) and -(2), and the statute uses the same operative language to define <em>both </em>the scope of ERISA\u2019s jurisdiction <em>and </em>the scope of ERISA\u2019s fee shifting. That is, \u00a7 1132(e)(1) allocates federal and state court jurisdiction over <em>\u201cactions under </em>subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section,\u201d <em>\u201cactions under </em>this subchapter,\u201d and <em>\u201cactions under </em>paragraphs (1)(B) and (7) of subsection (a),\u201d while \u00a7' 1132(e)(2) specifies venue and related requirements for <em>\u201cac-tionfs] under </em>this subchapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1132(e)(1)-(2) (emphases added). Immediately thereafter, \u00a7 1132(g)(1) opens the door to fee shifting in <em>\u201caction[s] under </em>this subchapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1132(g)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">ERISA\u2019s statutory structure and \u201c[l]in-guistic consistency\u201d make plain that ERISA\u2019s jurisdictional and fee-shifting provisions \u2022 are inextricably linked: the scope of the statute\u2019s jurisdictional reach sets the outer bound of the scope of its fee shifting. <em>Cf. Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 808, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988). Thus, \u00a7 1132(g)(1)-makes a party eligible to recover fees if and only if the action that generated his fees meets the test for \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction incorporated into \u00a7 1132(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">.Such test is well established. Decades ago, in Franchise, <em>Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983), the Supreme Court held that an action \u201carises under\u201d a particular federal law \u2014 there, the law was in fact ERISA \u2014 only if such law \u201ccreates the [plaintiffs] cause of action\u201d or, potentially at least, if \u201cthe plaintiffs right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question\u201d under such law. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 103 S.Ct. 2841.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Here, there is no dispute that the Bankruptcy Code, not. ERISA, grounds the Board\u2019s cause of action; <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157(b)(2)(I)-(J). Indeed, the -Board\u2019s adversary complaint neither cited ERISA nor alleged any violation of an ERISA plan; instead, the Board sought relief exclusively under the Bankruptcy Code. .</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Furthermore, because the nondis-chargeability claim in the Board\u2019s adversary complaint did not \u201cnecessarily depend!]\u201d upon resolution of <em>any </em>question under ERISA, let alone a \u201csubstantial\u201d question, no relief is available under such theory. The Board\u2019s nondischargeability complaint invoked three different provisions of the Bankruptcy- Code, any one of which would have been sufficient to render Bos\u2019s debts nondischargeable. <em>See Bos, </em>795 F.3d at-1012 (noting \u201cthe other nondis-chargeability exceptions put. forth by the Board\u201d). Only \u00a7 523(a)(4) potentially implicated ERISA, but even then not necessarily, because the bankruptcy court could have found Bos\u2019s debts to be nondis-chargeable under that section\u2019s \u201cembezzlement\u201d or \u201clarceny\u201d exceptions rather than its \u201cfiduciary\u201d exception, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4), or the court could have found Bos to be a fiduciary due to some statute other than ERISA, <em>see In re Hemmeter, </em>242 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.2001). In other words, the Board could have won the relief it sought without any court ever needing to invoke ERISA. Such was also the case in <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>where \u201con the face of a well-pleaded complaint there are many reasons completely unrelated to the provisions and purposes of ERISA why the State may or may not be entitled to the relief it seeks.\u201d 463 U.S. at 26, 103 S.Ct. 2841. As in that case, so too in this one: the'relevant proceeding did not arise under ERISA. <em>See id. </em>at 25-26, 103 S.Ct. 2841.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Of course, Bos is right - that, as this litigation unfolded, the mehning. of an ERISA term came to assume a central role. After all, the only question we reviewed on appeal was whether Bos qualified as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code, on the specific theory that Bos was a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA. <em>Bos, </em>795 F.3d at 1008-09. But the Board\u2019s well-pleaded complaint did not <em>require </em>us to construe an ERISA term; that we wound up doing so is not enough to make the nondischarge-ability proceeding an \u201caction under\u201d ERISA for jurisdictional purposes. Indeed, in <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the proposition that \u201cany ... action which would require the interpretation or application of ERISA to a plan document \u2018arises under\u2019 \u201d ERISA. 463 U.S. at 24, 103 S.Ct. 2841. The Court also made clear that ERISA \u201cdoes not purport to reach every question relating to plans covered by ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 103 S.Ct. 2841. Hence, the mere fact that the parties spent time debating the meaning of an ERISA term is not enough to make the nondischargeability proceeding an \u201caction under\u201d ERISA for fee-shifting purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We reject Bos\u2019s invitation to take a more liberal approach to fee-shifting under ERISA. First, and most important, the text of the statute is simply not flexible enough to allow the interpretation Bos proposes. Second, we are concerned about the mischief that would result if we were to allow fee shifting under ERISA even for actions that cannot be said to arise specifically under that statute. , Doing so would \u201cundermine the.clarity and ease of administration\u201d that \u00a7 1132(g)(1) would enjoy insofar as its application is tied to the jurisdictional requirements of the \u201cwell-pleaded-complaint doctrine.\u201d <em>See Holmes Grp. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., </em>535 U.S. 826, 832, 122 S.Ct. 1889, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>153 L.Ed.2d 13 (2002) (citing <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 11, 103 S.Ct. 2841). Additionally, Bos\u2019s more expansive interpretation would incentivize plaintiffs to plead non-ERISA causes of action that incorporate ingredients drawn from ERISA, if for no other reason than to render themselves eligible to recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1). We think neither consequence is desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In sum, the Board\u2019s nondischargeability proceeding was not an \u201caction under\u201d ERISA within the meaning of \u00a7 1132(g)(1), and therefore ERISA does not provide Bos grounds to recover the attorney\u2019s fees he generated litigating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Bos\u2019s application for. attorney\u2019s fees is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-18\">. We grant the Board\u2019s unopposed request and supplemental request for judicial notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"><em>. </em>The Board argues in the alternative that Bos cannot recover fees under section 1717 because in this case section 1717 is preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and even if not, in this case section 1717 is preempted by ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). Because we conclude that Bos\u2019s fee request fails under section 1717, we express no view on the Board\u2019s preemption arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
