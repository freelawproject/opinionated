Benson, a fiirm in Baltimore County, being a part of the same property that passed to her son under his father\u2019s will. Benson paid a part of the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>money, and was ready and willing to pay the balance, as soon as the plaintiff could convey to him a good and valid title to the farm. He was unwilling, however, to pay said balance until the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s title to said farm was established by decree of the Circuit Court. On a special case stated under Equity Rules Nos. 47-49, the Circuit Court (Duffy, J.,) passed a decree adjudging that William Amasa Linthicum, the son, took an indefeasible fee-simple estate in the property devised to him by the will of his father, and that the devises in remainder in said will, to the brothers and sisters of the testator .were void; and that the son, by his will, conveyed an indefeasible fee-simple title to the farm mentioned in the special case stated, to his mother, the plaintiff, which she could convey to the defendant. The decree further adjudged that the defendant should pay the balance of the purchase money agreed to be paid by him for said farm, and that on said payment the plaintiff should convey to him a good and valid fee-simple title to said farm. Erom this decree the defendant-appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b178-5\">The cause was submitted to Alvey, C.

The sole question arises under the following clause of the will of Wm. A. Linthicum:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\"><em>\u201cI </em>give and bequeath to my son, William Amasa, all my property, both real1 and personal, and, in case-he should die without heir, then, and in that case, it is my will and desire that it should be equally divided between my brothers and sisters.\u201d (naming them).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The son thus named was the testator\u2019s only child. He took possession of the property thus devised, and occupied it till his death in 1875, leaving a will hy which he devised all of his property of every kind to his mother, the appellee. The question is, what estate did the son, William Amasa, take under the will of his father ? Under the Act of 1825, ch. 119, now sec. 314 of Art. 93 of the Code, the devisee of real property without words of \u25a0perpetuity, takes <em>an absolute </em>estate \u201c unless it shall appear hy devise over, or hy words of limitation, or otherwise, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.\u201d Here the devise over, upon the death of the son, <em>\u201ctuithout heir,\u201d </em>to the brothers and sisters of the testator, shows that the word <em>\u201cheir\u201d </em>was not used in the sense of heirs generally \u2014 that is to say, an indefinite failure of heirs \u2014 the limitation over being to persons capable of taking as heirs to the first devisee. By the term \u201cheir\u201d as thus used, it is clear the testator meant, and such is the legal construction, <em>heirs of the body </em>of his son, his lineal descendants. And it is well settled \u2014 too well settled to require reference to the decided cases, that where real estate is devised with a limitation over upon dying <em>luithout heirs of the body </em>of the first taker, the devisee takes an <em>estate tail, </em>even though such limitation may be to one capable of being an heir to the devisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Construing then the word \u201cheir\u201d used in this will, as meaning <em>heirs of his body </em>\u2014 for so it must be construed\u2014 we are of opinion that the son took an estate tail under the will of his father. And being an estate tail which by the Code becomes a fee-simple, he took an absolute estate in the property devised to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The will in this case was made before the Act of 1862, ch. 161, Art. 93, sec. 311, of the Code, was passed, and is to be'construed, therefore, witho'ut reference to its provisions, and without reference too to the case of <em>Gambrill vs. Forest Grove Lodge No. </em>4, <em>&amp;c., </em>66 <em>Md., </em>17, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>decision in which, was based upon the construction of that Apt.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b181-6\">(Decided 17th December, 1891.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
