The facts as stipulated are as follows. The taxpayer was one of a firm of attorneys which had done legal services for a company that was unable to pay its resulting fee in cash. The client had, however, a large number of notes of another company, called Erie &amp; St. Lawrence Corporation, and on ISTovem-ber 16, 1933, the parties came to agreement as follows. The client agreed to pay down $10,000 and to deliver its promissory note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>for $70,000, dated November 1, 1933, payable in six months, with interest; as \u201ccollateral\u201d for this note it pledged $85,000 par value of the Erie &amp; St. Lawrence notes; and the taxpayer agreed that if the note or the interest on it should not be paid when it fell due, he should accept the Erie &amp; St. Lawrence notes \u201cin full discharge of\u201d the client\u2019s note, and should have no claim against it because of \u201cany insufficiency in the realization of said collateral.\u201d On December 2nd the client paid $10,000 in cash, delivered seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars of Erie &amp; St. Lawrence notes. (The parties had agreed upon this reduction). At the same time it delivered its promissory note for $70,000, which concluded: \u201cThis note is delivered subject to the terms and provisions of a settlement agreement dated November 15, 1933, secured and payable accordingly.\u201d On May 1, 1934, the client did not pay the note, and on February 1, 1935, the firm sold the Erie &amp; St. Lawrence notes for $62,500. Both the taxpayer and the firm kept their books on a cash basis and the question is whether the Erie &amp; St. Lawrence notes were acquired in December, 1933. If so, they had been \u201cheld\u201d for more than one year and only 80% of their value was taxable; if not, they were \u201cheld\u201d only from May 1, 1934, and 100% of their value was taxable. The Commissioner assessed the taxpayer on the theory that the firm had \u201cheld\u201d the notes only from May 1, 1934, and the Board affirmed his ruling. That is the only question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The transaction, shorn of its form, was an accord which the client had an option in satisfying; it might either surrender the Erie &amp; St. Lawrence notes, or pay its own note; it was not bound to do either, but it was bound to do one of the two. There was, properly speaking, no pledge and no \u201ccollateral,\u201d because the client\u2019s note was not a debt, since it was not bound to pay it. \u201cHeld\u201d in \u00a7 117 of the Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 707, means the same as \u201cacquired and held\u201d (McFeely v. Commissioner, 296 U.S. 102. 107, 56 S.Ct. 54, 80 L.Ed. 83, 101 A.L.R. 304) and one cannot be said to have \u201cacquired\u201d property merely because one has given his debtor the power to use it in satisfaction of an accord. Property is not \u201cacquired\u201d even when the optionee has a \u201ccall,\u201d not, as here, a \u201cput.\u201d Helvering v. San Joaquin Co., 297 U.S. 496, 56 S.Ct. 569, 80 L.Ed. 824. Yet that is a stronger case, since it might be argued that the optionee \u201cholds\u201d what he has in his power to \u201cacquire.\u201d Cf. Sommers v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 63 F.2d 551, 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
