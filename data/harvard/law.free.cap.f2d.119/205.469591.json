The complaint alleged a conspiracy in restraint of trade, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and claimed treble damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The act charged was a strike at appellant\u2019s plant, to enforce a demand that appellant cease importing goods from Philadelphia for resale here. The complaint alleged that appellant\u2019s plant was closed, -and remained closed, in consequence of the strike. Counsel for appellant, in his opening statement in the District Court, declared that appellees said to appellant \u201cYou can\u2019t buy cakes in Philadelphia, and you cannot make cakes in your own plant unless you will agree not to buy any cakes out of town * * * the reason being, they said, the wage scales in Philadelphia paid to men working in the plant there were lower than the scales paid to the men here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The District Court directed a verdict for appellees on appellant\u2019s opening statement. This was clearly right. \u201cRestraints on competition or on the course of trade in the merchandising of articles moving in interstate commerce\u201d do not violate the Sherman Act \u201cunless the restraint is shown to have or is intended to have an effect upon prices in the market or otherwise to deprive purchasers or consumers of the advantages which they derive from free competition. * * * The restraint here * * * has not been shown to have any actual or intended effect on price or price competition.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201cThe use of conventional, peaceful activities by a union\u201d in an attempt to secure more jobs for its members is not a violation of the Sherman Act, \u201cwhatever effect on interstate commerce may be intended to follow from the acts done.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">GRONER, Chief Justice, concurs in the result on the authority of the Apex and Hutcheson cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3, as amended by Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> Apex Hosiery Company v.
