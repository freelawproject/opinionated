(b) Was the employer\u2019s dominating influence present in the labor union? In other words, does the case fall within the rule announced, and the factual situations disclosed, in the cases of Labor Board v. Link-Belt Co., 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. -, decided January 6, 1941; Labor Board v. Newport News Co., 308 U.S. 241, 60 S.Ct. 203, 84 L.Ed. 219; and Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 657, affirmed per curiam, March 10, 1941, 61 S.Ct. 736, 85 L.Ed. -?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-25\">The facts are unusually free from dispute. Strange as it may seem, most of the facts are either stipulated or are docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>mentary. The order directs cessation of domination of both organizations and the disestablishment of the new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The old employees\u2019 organization was clearly, if not admittedly, created and dominated by the employer. It was known as the \u201cEmployees\u2019 Representation Plan.\u201d Here it will be called the Plan. The new organization, \u201cThe Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Agency,\u201d a nonaffiliated labor organization, we will call the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The Company conceived and gave to its employees the Plan. Our inquiry is to ascertain the status of the Agency. Was it a company-fostered union, \u2014 a successor to the Plan, or an independent employee group ?</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The numerous cases, of which the above-cited ones are typical, make it tolerably clear that the correct rule of law necessitates affirmance if the evidence, however slight, be substantial and support the findings of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">While the indicia of company participation or domination may be numerous, the following are the more or less common types which have received recognition, if not emphasis, from the courts when considering cases which present the same inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">(1) Organization of a union to \u201csucceed\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d a Company union which suspended immediately after Supreme Court decision upholding the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.; (2) organization on Company time and property; (3) lack of dues, and support by mere contributions; (4) similarity in union structure between old and new unions; (5) similarity of. official personnel of the former and new unions; (6) failure of the Company to \u201cbroadcast\u201d to all employees its impartiality in selection of union; (7) acts of the Company indicative of its preference for or against a particular union; (8) its maintenance of a Company union long after the enactment of the Wagner Act as indicative of the Company\u2019s attitude towards unions generally; (9) statements of all these factors are the \u201cimponderables which the Board was entitled to appraise\u201d in determining whether the Company dominated and fostered the new union.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">A careful reading of the precedents on this subject discloses facts more accusing than those presented by this record. We, nevertheless, must conclude that the criteria, above outlined, find some factual application and support in the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Briefly, we shall attempt to point out such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">The Employer produces crude oil in Texas and employs over 3800 employees. Until 1933.there had been no employee organization of any kind. In June of that year, the Company prepared the Plan, which was adopted. About 80% of the eligible employees voted, electing representatives to a Council which was composed of an equal number of employee and management representatives. No dues were payable; the Company defrayed the expenses and provided election facilities. Wage increases occurred (the Board holds such increases occurred only on the suggestion of the management). Representatives were paid regular wages for the time spent at council meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">In March of 1937, the C. I. O. announced its intention to conduct an intensive campaign for membership. On May 13, 1937, a meeting of the Plan council was called by one Bennett, its secretary. No representative of the Company was present. The minutes of this meeting \u2014 held in the Company dining room \u2014 read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">\u201cThe purpose of this meeting was explained by Mr. Bennett, as, in brief, to <em>reorganise </em>the present employee-management council plan <em>or </em>to develop a new plan to take its place. Read an excerpt from minutes of last Council meeting at which Mr. Wallace (manager) expressed his views on the present plan and the advisability of retaining it, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">\u201cMr. Wallace advised that the present Employee Representation Plan is <em>satisfactory </em>under the Wagner Act, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">\u201cAdvised that the <em>Council Members </em>should feel perfectly free to <em>modify </em>or change the present Plan or' adopt any other form of bargaining with the Management. Pointed out that the Management cannot work out a plan for the men and if the men see fit to <em>continue </em>the present Employee Representation Plan in effect it is up to the men entirely. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-17\">\u201cStated that the <em>present </em>Council Plan has worked out satisfactorily as a bargaining agency so far * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">This meeting was adjourned, and a second meeting called ten minutes later in the <em>same dining room, </em>and non-council representative-employees participated. Bennett was elected chairman of the meeting. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>general discussion of unions followed, and a committee was appointed to draw up plans. Two meetings followed in the Company-dining room and the structure of the Agency was formulated. Bennett sent notices to selected employees in the various departments and a meeting was held May 18, which 64 employees attended, of whom 24 had been members of the Plan Council. The articles of the Agency were approved. The next meeting of the Agency was held in the Company dining room, May 27, 1937. Of the 50 employees present 17 had formerly been on the Council, and they discussed a forthcoming election of representatives. They devised a \u201cdonation list\u201d to be circulated to obtain funds. The next meeting was held in the dining room on June 9th. The election was held June 16-18. Approximately 59% of the eligible employees voted.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The minutes of the June 2 meeting of the Plan stated that it was voted to discontinue the Plan, and that the \u201cPlan be discontinued <em>upon the date which the new Employe Plan </em>(Agency) <em>becomes effective.\u201d </em>The relevant testimony, as summarized in Company\u2019s brief, is:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u201cThere was testimony that at this meeting Bennett told Frank L. Wallace, then Assistant General Superintendent * * * that the employees had voted * * * to discontinue the old plan * * * and Wallace \u2018said that he didn\u2019t want to kill the old Plan until the new one was * * * workable.\u2019 <em>As a result of this statement, </em>the motion which was then before the Plan Council to discontinue the Plan <em>immediately was amended </em>so that, as finally passed, it provided for the discontinuance of the Plan at the end of June * *</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The Agency, too, had a \u201cCouncil\u201d composed of representatives of the various departments. The Agency wrote the Company asking for recognition as bargaining representative, but the Company merely replied they would <em>meet </em>with the Agency. At its first meeting with the Company \u201cthree <em>unfinished </em>matters which had been the subject of discussion by the Council under the * * * Plan were taken up for discussion.\u201d The Board cites the action of the Company on the unfinished matters as indicative that the Agency was, as a bargaining agent, \u201cspineless and ineffective.\u201d It appeared that its business consisted of the employees\u2019 asking for a special rate on gasoline, and the manager stated that he had written to New York and had received a reply; that New York \u201cdeclined to grant this request at this time. Motion made and carried that this item be <em>closed.\u201d </em>Representatives on duty at the time of the meeting <em>received recpdar pay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Donations to the Agency had amounted to $232.25, and expenditures were $217.75. Contribution blanks had been distributed by two employees of supervisory capacity, on Company time.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">After July, 1939, the Agency no longer met on Company property, pursuant to advice from the Regional Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">In addition to some of the above-stated' facts, the Board predicated its decision on the following matters : (as to the Plan)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-17\">\u201cGeneral revisions and schedules of minimum rates of pay were invariably prepared and introduced by the respondent and adopted by the Council as presented. Attempts by employee representatives to have the Council consider general raises in pay or the establishment of fixed rates for given jobs met with a refusal by the management representatives to consider adjustments in rates of pay except on an individual basis. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-18\">\u201cThe Plan was not only instituted and established by the respondent, but continued thereafter to operate only with the respondent\u2019s constant financial aid and outspoken support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-19\">\u201cThe Plan and the Council continued to function at, the respondent\u2019s * * * refinery until June, 1937, with the uninterrupted approval, encouragement, and material support of the respondent.\u201d (as to the C. I. O.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-22\">\u201cLate in Feb. of 1937 it was publicly announced that the C. I. O. had decided on a general organizing drive in the oil industry * * * On March 18, 1937, Gen. Supt. Dodge delivered a speech at a Rotary Club luncheon in which he referred to the C. I. O. \u2018threat\u2019 to organize labor in Port Arthur, coupled the C. I. O. with sit-down strikes, and urged the city\u2019s merchants and businessmen to \u2018line up\u2019 against any such activities and to discourage any such movement * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-23\">\u201cReed (an employee) testified * * * that he * * * distributed these (C. I. O.) handbills just outside the plant. * * * shortly afterwards he was approached by Moser (asst, to gen. supt.) in the respondent\u2019s plant and had an extended conversation with him. Moser indicated to Reed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that the latter\u2019s activities in behalf of the C. I. O. were regarded by Moser as a sign of dissatisfaction on Reed\u2019s part * * * In response to a question from Reed as to why he did not want the men to join the C. I. O., Moser replied that it was because of the C. I. O. leadership.\u201d (as to the Agency)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cIt is admitted * * * that the discussion (at the May 13th meeting) included a request by the Asst. Gen. Supt. Wallace that the old Plan not be \u2018killed\u2019 until the new one was \u2018workable,\u2019 In accordance with his wishes, the effective date of the termination of the Plan * * * was postponed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201cOf the 74 representatives to the Agency Council elected in the 1937 election, approximately 30 were former plan Council * * * members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201cAny representative (of the Agency) leaving \u2018the service of the Company * * \u2019 was automatically to lose his status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">\u201cAt the joint conference of April 12, 1939, there was extended discussion of a request for a general increase in rates of pay for all employees * * *. Dodge asked for a statement by the Agency representatives present of the reasons upon which the request for an increase was based. * * * One of the representatives * * * stated that the men in his department * * * felt that the Agency \u2018is not worth a damn,\u2019 and that the C. I. O. was Worth more to them than the Agency. In answer, Dodge \u2018advised that a lot of good had been accomplished by the * * * Agency,\u2019 and stated that he \u2018was sorry to hear such a statement made as he did not feel that this represented the men as a whole * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-15\">\u201cIn response, finally, to a direct demand by Fuller for a definite answer, Dodge rejected the request for a general increase.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-20\">\u201cFrom its inception, the Agency made free and continued use of company facilities in carrying on its activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-21\">\u201cThis conception of continuity was given concrete expression in the duplication of Plan and Agency personnel, in the structural similarity of the Plan Council and the Agency joint conference, and in the uninterrupted assumption by the Agency of the Plan\u2019s Council\u2019s Activities. The respondent, itself, made no effort to inform its employees of any demarcation or difference between the Plan and the Agency, or of any change in its established policy of dominating and supporting the organization which purported to speak for the employees in their dealings with the respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-22\">We are not especially impressed by this evidence. However, we are not the fact finding body. As we have been advised, oft and repeatedly, by the Supreme Court, it is not our duty to make findings, but only to accept the findings of the National Labor Relations Board, where there is dispute in the testimony, however contrary said findings may be, in our opinion, to the' weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-23\">We are in no doubt, in this case, of the existence of substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding. In fact, we might add, if the observation counted, that in our opinion, taking the record as a whole, \u201cthe whole congeries of fact\u201d rather, clearly identify the dominating hand of the employer in the organization and perpetuation of both these unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-24\">This conclusion is fortified by a study of the decisions wherein a like question was under consideration. Their pertinency is such that we feel justified in setting forth liberal excerpts from them.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The determinative question being the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding, it follows that petitioner\u2019s application to set aside the order of the Board must be, and is hereby, denied. The petition of the Board to enforce its order must be, and is, hereby granted,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b86-16\"> National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co., 61 S.Ct. 358, 362, 85 L.Ed. \u2014, decided January 6, 1941:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">\u201cMost of the company union representatives were active and prominent in Independent\u2019s membership drive and during that drive apparently enjoyed somewhat the same privilege of moving freely about the plant which they had been allowed as company union representatives. * * * But, as the Board concluded, it seems impossible to infer that, in view of the extensive and intensive solicitation for Independent in the plant on company time, the supervisory staff were not aware of the campaign and did not acquiesce in it. * * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-26\">\u201c \u2018Congress has left questions of law which arise before the Board \u2014 but not more \u2014 ultimately to the traditional review of the judiciary. Not by accident, but in line with a general policy, Congress has deemed it wise to entrust the finding of facts to these specialized agencies. It is essential that courts regard this division of responsibility which Congress as a matter of policy has embodied in the very statute from which the Court of Appeals derived its jurisdiction to act.\u2019 Congress entrusted the Board, not the courts, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the power to draw inferences from the facts. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u201cThe Board had the right to believe that the maintenance of the <em>company </em>union down to the date when Independent\u2019s membership drive was completed was not a mere coincidence. The circumstantial evidence makes credible the finding that complete freedom of choice on the part of the employees was effectively forestalled by maintenance of the <em>company </em>union by the employer until its abandonment would coincide with the recognition of Independent. * * * the failure of the employer to wipe the slate clean and announce that the employees had a free choice, the belated instructions to the supervisory staff not to interfere \u2014 all corroborate the conclusion that the employer facilitated and aided the substitution of the union, which it preferred, for its old company union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">National Labor Relations Board v. Newport News Co., 308 U.S. 241, 60 S. Ct. 203, 208, 84 L.Ed. 219:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u201cThe Board held that, where an organization has existed for ten years and has functioned in the way that the Committee has functioned, with a joint control vested in management and men [such was the case here], the effects of the long practice cannot be eliminated and the employes rendered entirely free to act upon their own initiative without the complete disestablishment of the plan. sis %</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u201cIn applying the statutory test of independence it is immaterial that the plan had in fact not engendered, or indeed had obviated, serious labor disputes in the past, or that any company interference in the administration of the plan had been incidental rather than fundamental and with good motives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Westinghouse Co. v. Labor Board, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 657, 660, affirmed per curiam, on authority of the above two citations, March 10, 1941, 61 S.Ct. 736, 85 L.Ed. \u2014:</p>\n<p id=\"ALf\">\u201cIt is true that in that case there was somewhat less separation between the old and the new than in the case at bar; the union was in form merely a \u2018revision\u2019 of the earlier \u2018Plan\u2019, and its constitution had been prepared in part at any rate, by executives of the company. But that was not the circumstance which counted * * * it was rather that the employees at large had not been advised that the company was wholly indifferent whether they joined the new union, and that, as it might, and probably did, appear to be a successor of the old, the separation should have been made plain, and with it the discontinuance of any continued countenance from the employer. The theory is that in cases such as this, where an unaffiliated union seems to the employees at large to have evolved out of an earlier joint organization of employer and employees, the Board may take it as datum, in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, that the employees will suppose that tho company approves the new, as it did the old, and that their choice is for that reason not as free as the statute demands. How substantial such a fear really is, it is not for us to say; upon how much evidence the Board may insist to make public the change, the court did not declare; nor need we here; for the company did not make any effort to make it plain to the employees generally that the \u2018Independent\u2019 was not a revision, or amendment, of tho \u2018Plan\u2019. On the surface it seemed to be such, for it emanated from tho old elected representatives, <em>and that alone </em>established <em>an </em>appearance of continuity between the two. <em>Madden\u2019s speech on May 12th was only to those representatives', the company did not seek to broadcast it or its equivalent in any way to the employees </em>\u2014 about 2,500 in all. So far as appears, it was content to let <em>them assume, what was </em>true, that the \u2018Independent\u2019 had arisen out of the \u2018Plan\u2019; and to believe, as they quite naturally might have done, that it preferred the successor to the O. I. O.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
