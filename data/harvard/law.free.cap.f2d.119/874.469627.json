The books are also sold generally for the use of students in preparation for college entrance board examinations. They 'are of 127 and 160 pages respectively, and include lessons and exercises in grammar and composition, sample copies of previous Regents\u2019 examinations, and lists of commonly used French words, with appropriate articles and English translations. Plaintiff hired for the work of compilation and arrangement two New York high school French teachers, who chose 1,590 French words for the two-year list from the Regents\u2019 syllabus of 1,623 elementary French words, and 775 for the three-year list from the Regents\u2019 syllabus of 778 more advanced words. They then supplied articles and translations from their own knowledge and from reference works.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-22\">Shortly after the publication of these books, defendant prepared for publication \u201cFrench Two Years\u201d and \u201cFrench Three Years,\u201d books similarly designed and to be sold to the same trade at a price much lower than that of plaintiff\u2019s books. These, too, in addition to other material, contained word lists, compiled by Mr. Albert Beller, defendant\u2019s president. The lists in plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s books are so closely similar, according to plaintiff\u2019s contention, as to pass the bounds of coincidence and to show copying by Beller of plaintiff\u2019s lists, comprising French words, articles, and translations.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-23\">Beller admits that he owned copies of plaintiff\u2019s books at the time he arranged his own, and that he used them to some extent. He claims, however, that he relied on the Regents\u2019 syllabi for his choice of French words; on a Heath\u2019s and a Longman-Green\u2019s French-English dictionary for French articles; and on a list of English translations supplied by a French teacher, a Mr. Louis Goodman, and on the two dictionaries for translations. The similarities, he says, are only to be expected in the compilation of such stereotyped matter. The district court agreed, and dismissed the complaint. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 33 F.Supp. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-24\">We think, however, that Beller\u2019s lists themselves are unimpeachable evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Beller made them up from the lists in plaintiff\u2019s books. Even his choice of French words bears such evidence, although he obviously referred to the syllabi for this purpose, and partly relied on them, using about the same number \u2014 1,623 in the two-year list, and 778 in the three-year list \u2014 and almost the identical words there found. But the fact that 7 French words of extremely common use, included in the syllabi, but inadvertently omitted from plaintiff\u2019s lists, were also omitted from Beller\u2019s first edition is hardly explicable except on the supposition that Beller resorted directly to plaintiff\u2019s lists, and thereafter added syllabi words whose omission he happened to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Beller\u2019s choice of articles offers much stronger evidence of copying, for here he was helped by neither Goodman\u2019s work nor the syllabi. Of course, the dictionaries would show whether or not a word may be used as a noun, and if so, which gender it bears; but that is at most only a beginning. Thus, many French words may be properly used either as nouns or as other parts of speech. Of at least 9 such words in the three-year books \u2014 translated by Goodman by an English word equally <em>ambiguous </em>\u2014 2 were treated in both plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s books as nouns by prefixing the article, while the other 7 were treated in both as adjectives by omitting the article. Likewise, 39 such words in the two-year list were accorded identical treatment by plaintiff\u2019s compilers and by Beller, a certain 9 of them as nouns, the rest as adjectives or adverbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Again, if a word is to be used as a noun, and its gender is known, it is still necessary to choose between the definite and the indefinite article. A fairly common practice in works of this kind is to use the definite article before all words beginning with a consonant, and the indefinite article before those beginning with a vowel or an aspirate \u201ch.\u201d But in several instances, plaintiff\u2019s lists show an inadvertent departure from this rule; and in every such instance the departure was reproduced in defendant\u2019s lists. Both use the indefinite article before the first four nouns beginning with \u201cB.\u201d In both, \u201cle,\u201d instead of \u201cF, \u201d or the indefinite article, is erroneously used before '\u201chomage.\u201d In both, the article is entirely omitted before \u201carriere,\u201d translated as \u201cback.\u201d In both, \u201cle\u201d is erroneously used, instead of \u201cles,\u201d before \u201cfrais,\u201d translated as \u201cexpense\u201d ; and in both, there was a failure to indicate, either by an article or by express reference, the gender of the same four words: \u201cmidi,\u201d \u201cles vacances,\u201d \u201cminuit,\u201d \u201cles guillemets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">In the case of many abstract nouns, however, such as \u201cl\u2019argent,\u201d translated as \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cthe money,\u201d use of the indefinite article would be less usual than the definite, or even meaningless. Consequently plaintiff\u2019s compilers departed from the above practice in the case of 31 out of a total of 84 abstract nouns beginning with a vowel, and Beller did the same in exactly the same instances. Of course, a certain degree of similarity might be explained by Beller\u2019s ability, along with plaintiff\u2019s compilers, to choose the better usage; but in the case of not over half of these words assigned the \u201cF \u201d is the necessity of it clear. It is unbelievable that the complete identity of choice was a matter of coincidence. Moreover, many of these words before which both used the indefinite article might be thought by an independent compiler to be more frequently used with the definite article.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">It was also a common practice to include the English article as a part of the translation, but in the same 14 instances this rule was ignored in both plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s lists, although the French article was given in every such instance. A case could hardly be made out that it is less customary to use the article with these particular words than with many other abstractions before which the article was used.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Equally strong evidence can be derived from Beller\u2019s choice of translations. In well over 100 instances in his three-year list of 778 words, he departs from Goodman\u2019s suggestion and uses exactly the translation or translations given in plaintiff\u2019s list. Most of these he might conceivably have obtained from his two dictionaries; but the dictionary translations average six to a dozen words, Beller had not the experience or the qualifications to identify the most common usage, and he did not regularly pick the first or second meaning. In 9 instances his translations, identical with plaintiff\u2019s, are not to be found at all in Goodman\u2019s list or in the dictionaries which he claims to have used. Of his translations in the two-year lists, 29 are not to be found in the dictionaries; but as Goodman\u2019s translations for this list were never produced, no definite conclusion is possible. For S words in the three-year list which required one translation if used as one part of speech, another translation if used as an alternate part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Beller gave the same translation given by plaintiff\u2019s book, although Goodman had supplied a different one.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In all, 96 per cent of the 1,590 items in plaintiff\u2019s two-year list and 82 per cent of the 775 items in its three-year list were exactly reproduced in defendant\u2019s lists \u2014 as to the French word, whether or not an article was used, what it was, the English translation or translations, whether or not an article was used with it, what it was, and whether or not \u201cto\u201d was used before English verbs. This accumulation of evidence convinces beyond any doubt that Beller copied plaintiff\u2019s lists, with only a comparatively trivial number of changes. Since the evidence itself was uncontradictable, the inferences drawn from it by the court below cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Nor do we believe that any of the other reasons advanced by defendant can support the judgment. \u201cAll the writings of an author\u201d are entitled to be copyrighted, 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4, and this includes \u201ccomposite and cyclopedic works, directories, gazetteers, and other compilations.\u201d 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5. There was some originality even in plaintiff\u2019s choice of the French words to be included, still more in its choice of articles, and quite a considerable amount in its choice of translations appropriate for the purpose. This last step, at least, required ingenuity equal to that used in the arrangement of a \u201chandwriting chart,\u201d Deutsch v. Arnold, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 686; in the compilation of a list of jewelers and their trade-marks, Jeweler\u2019s Circular Pub. Co. v. Keystone Pub. Co., 2 Cir., 281 F. 83, 26 A.L.R. 571, certiorari denied 259 U.S. 581, 42 S.Ct. 464, 66 L.Ed. 1074; or in supplying case annotations to statutes, W. H. Anderson Co. v. Baldwin Law Pub. Co., 6 Cir., 27 F.2d 82. In United Dictionary Co. v. G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 208 U.S. 260, 28 S.Ct. 290, 52 L.Ed. 478, it was not questioned that a dictionary might be copyrighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Although the word lists constitute only a small proportion \u2014 less than 15 per cent \u2014 of the printed matter included in the present editions of both parties\u2019 publications, it is evident that they are of real importance (defendant\u2019s original edition comprised only a word list and sample examinations), and entitled to copyright protection. Oxford Book Co. v. College Entrance Book Co., 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 688 (cartoons in a school history text); King Features Syndicate v. Fleischer, 2 Cir., 299 F. 533 (one character of a cartoon strip).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Both plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s books met exactly the same demand on the same market, and defendant\u2019s copying was unquestionably to avoid the trouble or expense of independent work. This is an unfair use. West Pub. Co. v. Lawyers\u2019 Cooperative Pub. Co., 2 Cir., 79 F. 756, 35 L.R.A. 400; see Lawrence v. Dana, Fed.Cas. No. 8,136. There is nothing to the contrary in Oxford Book Co. v. College Entrance Book Co., supra, 98 F.2d at page 691, which reversed in part a judgment for plaintiff because \u201cno sound reason remains for saying that the accused book in its text is a copy of any substantial part of the copyrighted book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The judgment of dismissal is therefore reversed and the action is remanded to the district court for such relief against the offending word lists by way of injunction, damages, and an accounting as it shall find appropriate in the light of this opinion. Any issue concerning an attorney\u2019s fee in this Court, as well as below, may be settled by the district court in its final judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
