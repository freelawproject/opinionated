The Patent Office and the District Court both held that no invention was involved. We have arrived at the same conclusion. The lower tribunals relied upon three references which, while differing in some respects from appellant\u2019s machine, reveal arrangements for producing stitch variations, from which a mechanic skilled in the art could, without invention, reasonably be expected to produce such improvements as are claimed by appellant. More than this is required to call for the issuance of a patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANv\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\"> Textile Machine Works v.
