The assignment is well taken. There is no evidence that appellant was a party to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>spiracy charged in count 6. All that the evidence shows is that, as a part-time employee of the conspirators, appellant performed services which the conspirators made use of in effecting the object of the conspiracy \u2014 a conspiracy of which, so far as the evidence shows, appellant had no knowledge.
