Appellant\u2019s property line runs east along Lane Avenue an approximate distance of 228 feet from the intersection with Tremont Road, which runs north and south on the west side of appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Around five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the patrolman idled his motor and parked his motorcycle, facing north, on Tremont Road some distance south of appellant\u2019s property. From this point, he started after a speeding automobile which was traveling east on Lane Avenue; and, as he reached the corner of Lane and Tremont, he saw a dog come out of the west drive of appellant\u2019s premises and cross over to the Blos-ser place on the northeast corner of the two highways, where the animal stood still. Then, on the park strip to the north of Lane Avenue, the dog ran alongside the motorcycle officer, who was proceeding east on Lane Avenue at increasing speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">At the Blosser driveway, the barking dog ran out into Lane Avenue in front of the motorcycle and kept ahead in the chase until the intersection of York Road with Lane Avenue, approximately 288 feet from Tremont Road, was reached. There the dog was struck by the guards on the side of the fast moving motorcycle. The impact of the collision turned the machine sideways, and the officer was thrown violently to the pavement. The dog ran away yelping and jumped a stone fence to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">Patrolman Cary wavered in his testimony as to whether he first observed the dog coming forth from appellant\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">\u201cQ. * * * the first positive fact you are sure of is that you saw the dog in Mr. Blosser\u2019s front yard, that is a fact? A. Yes; that is the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">\u201cQ. Then the dog went down to the driveway, Blosser\u2019s driveway, and then came on to the road? A. That is right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">But, inasmuch as the testimony on this review must be considered in the light most favorable to the appellant, we shall assume that, as stated by the witness Cary on direct examination, the dog when first observed by him was coming out of a driveway of appellant\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-19\">Stressing the doctrine that when an insurance policy is open to two constructions, that most favorable to the insured will be adopted (Stipcich v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <em>277 </em>U.S. 311, 48 S.Ct. 512, 72 L.Ed. 895; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hurni Packing Co., 263 U.S. 167, 44 S.Ct. 90, 68 L.Ed. 235, 31 A.L.R. 102; Thompson v. Phenix Insurance Co., 136 U.S. 287, 10 S.Ct. 1019, 34 L.Ed. 408), appellant urges that, because the chase which culminated in the collision began at a location covered by the policy and merely continued to the point of accident a short distance beyond the east line of insured\u2019s property, the chase and collision must be construed as inseparable, with the sequence that the accident must be held to have occurred on ways \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d to appellant\u2019s property within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">The doctrine invoked applies only to cases of ambiguity in the language used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>insurance policies. In the instant case, we find no ambiguity. In the context, the words \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d have a distinct and definite meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We think it clear that the place where the accident and resulting injury occurred determines liability under the policy. This .point was some sixty feet east of the nearest portion of appellant\u2019s property immediately adjacent to the way (Lane Avenue) on which the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Used alone, the word \u201cadjacent\u201d would mean \u201clying near\u201d; \u201cadjoining\u201d would mean \u201clying next\u201d; although the words are often used synonymously. Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, 2d Ed., Unabridged; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; the New Century Dictionary; Funk and Wagnall\u2019s Comprehensive Standard Dictionary, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In its instant usage, the word \u201cimmediately,\u201d as defined by the New Century Dictionary, means with no space intervening, or next, as \u201cimmediately adjoining.\u201d Other lexicographers are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We think the words \u201cimmediately adjacent,\u201d as used in the insurance policy under construction, have the same natural significance as the words \u201cimmediately adjoining.\u201d Unless such construction be adopted, the word \u201cimmediately\u201d in the present context would have no practical effect. Its express use must not be disregarded. If the insurance company had intended to cover an accident on ways adjacent to the insured premises, there would have been no occasion for using the qualifying word \u201cimmediately\u201d in conjunction with the word \u201cadjacent.\u201d But, inasmuch as the word \u201cadjacent\u201d has been actually qualified by the word \u201cimmediately,\u201d the two words used conjunctively must receive a reasonable interpretation. If policy coverage had been intended despite intervening space, the insurer would have used some such expression as \u201cclosely adjacent,\u201d or \u201cnearly adjacent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Although none of the following authorities are directly in point, for comparison with the case at bar, see Chas. Wolff Packing Co. v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., 94 Kan. 630, 635, 146 P. 1175, 1177; City of Lawrenceburg v. Maryland Casualty Co., 16 Tenn. App. 238, 242, 64 S.W.2d 69; Tudor v. Chicago, etc., R. Co., 154 Ill. 129, 39 N.E. 136; Id., Ill.Sup., 27 N.E. 915; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Texas Fireproof Storage Co., Tex.Civ.App., 69 S.W.2d 826; Hanifen v. Armitage, C.C., 117 F. 845, 851; National Optical Co. v. United States F. &amp; G. Co., 77 Colo. 130, 235 P. 343; Nomath Hotel Co. v. Kansas City Gas Co., 204 Mo. App. 214, 223 S.W. 975, 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">In the last cited case, it was said: \u201c \u2018Adjacent\u2019 is defined as being near or close at hand; adjoining; bordering. New Standard Dictionary. It does not at all times mean abutting, but it is usually synonymous with abutting, adjoining, and bordering. * * * It means contiguous, adjoining, lying close at hand, near. Its precise and exact meaning however, is \u2018determinable principally by the context in which it is used and the facts of each particular case of by the subject-matter to which it is applied.\u2019 1 Corp.Juris. 1196. The term is a relative one, and hence is necessarily governed by the nature and circumstances of that to which it is applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">As above stated, the words \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d in the present context are, in our opinion, synonymous with the-words \u201cimmediately adjoining.\u201d The locus quo of the accident was not on a way immediately adjacent to the premises of the assured. There was, therefore, no policy coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">Since oral argument was heard, appellant has cited and we have considered the-opinion of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County in Kenney v. Occidental Ins. Co., of San Francisco, 66 Ohio App. 284, 34 N.E.2d 237, decided June 10, 1940,. where it was held that an insurance policy-covering a barge against loss from windstorm \u201cwhile located and contained as described herein,' and not elsewhere,\u201d covers, damages to the barge received at another location to which it was driven as the direct -and proximate result of a windstorm\u2019s; breaking the barge from its moorings at the place of location named in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">On its materially different facts, we think this Ohio case, which we accept as authority, does not force a conclusion adverse to that which we have reached in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
