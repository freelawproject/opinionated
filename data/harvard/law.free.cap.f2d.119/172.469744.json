Brown of Beverly Hills, California, be suspended for the period of sixty days from the date hereof, and thereafter until he shall have demonstrated to the satisfaction of a designated representative of the Authority, through a written examination given in accordance with section 20.5 of the Civil Air Regulations, that he is thoroughly familiar with Parts 01 and 60 of the Civil Air Regulations and the local field traffic rules for Los Angeles Municipal Airport, Union Air Terminal, and Grand Central Air Terminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-24\">On May 17, 1940, Brown petitioned this court to review and set aside respondent\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also moved for a supersedeas, but, as he had not yet taken the examination required by the order, his motion was on June 7, 1940, denied without prejudice. 9 Cir., 112 F.2d 737. Thereafter he took the examination, demonstrated to the satisfaction of respondent\u2019s designated representative that he was thoroughly familiar with the rules and regulations mentioned in the order, and on June 12, 1940, renewed his motion for a supersedeas. On June 17, 1940, we made the following order: \u201cUpon consideration of the renew'd by petitioner, filed June 12, 1940, of motion for superse-deas pending determination by this court of petition to review the order of the [re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>spondent] herein, and good cause therefor appearing, it is ordered that the order of the respondent herein, dated May 3, 1940, suspending petitioner\u2019s pilot certificate No. 5168 be, and hereby is superseded pending determination of petition to review in this cause by this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Our order did not suspend the running of the sixty-day period mentioned in respondent\u2019s order, and could not have done so. For the period mentioned was not merely a period of sixty days; it was that certain period of sixty days which commenced May 3, 1940, and expired July 2, 1940 \u2014 an expiration which no court order could postpone.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Although a copy of the petition for review was, upon filing, forthwith transmitted to respondent by the clerk of this court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a transcript of the record upon which respondent\u2019s order was entered was not filed in this court until August 13, 1940. Meanwhile the petition for review had become moot. For, the sixty-day period having expired, respondent\u2019s order was no longer in effect and could never again be put into effect. Thus review of the order became and is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-25\"> Act of June 23, 1938, c. 601, 52 Stat. 973, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 401-681.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AtC\"> 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 425(a), 559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AxV\"> Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, \u00a7 1006, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-16\"> Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 , \u00a7 1006 (c), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
