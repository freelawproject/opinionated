Company, a Washington corporation (hereafter called General). The cost of the' North Fourth stock to petitioner was $10,-672.53. Prior to December 5, 1935, petitioner made loans aggregating $36,272.41, of which $7,981.60 was loaned to North Fourth and $28,290.81 was loaned to North Fourth or to General. No part of either loan was ever repaid. On December 5, 1935, petitioner-, for a consideration of $62,-871.22, sold the North Fourth stock to Dave Miller and released North Fourth from all indebtedness then due or owing by it to petitioner. Of the $62,871.22 received from Miller, petitioner paid Joseph J. Gottstein $4,733.42 and retained the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">For the purpose of determining petitioner\u2019s net gain from the sale of the North Fourth stock, the Board used as a basis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the cost of the stock ($10,672.53), plus the loan of $7,981.60 \u2014 a total of $18,654.13. Petitioner contends that the proper basis was the sum last mentioned, plus the loan of $28,290.81, plus the $4,733.42 paid to Gottstein \u2014 a total of $51,678.36. The contention is based on two asserted facts: (1) That the loan of $28,290.81 was made to North Fourth and was due and owing by North Fourth to petitioner on December 5, 1935; and (2) that Gottstein had an interest in the stock which entitled him to the $4,733.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The Board did not find that the loan of $28,290.81 was made to North Fourth. Instead the Board found it was made to General. The findings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> state; \u201cGeneral * * * was incorporated March 1, 1933. * * * It operated the Roxy Theatre in Seattle, Washington. This theatre operated at a loss from the beginning. * * * North Fourth was not earning sufficient profits to finance General, and it became necessary to finance it from some other source. This was done largely from loans or advances made by petitioner, some of which were paid directly to General and some paid to petitioner\u2019s subsidiary, North Fourth, and passed on by North Fourth to General<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. * * * It is obvious from the evidence that all the loans or advancements here in question were made by petitioner either directly to General or indirectly to North Fourth to be passed on to General. * * * Obviously the book records of petitioner do not evidence the real facts. * * * The record does not disclose why petitioner caused its advances to General to appear as loans from North Fourth to General, but the record is clear that petitioner intended to advance the money to General and in fact did just that thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">Nor did the Board find that North Fourth ever obligated itself, or ever became obligated, to pay the loan of $28,290.81. The Board found that North Fourth\u2019s trustees (directors) passed a resolution admitting that North Fourth was so obligated, but the Board also found; \u201cPetitioner owned all the stock of [North Fourth and General] and absolutely controlled them. * * * North Fourth had no interest in General and derived no benefit from the loans. All its acts in the matter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were directed and controlled by petitioner.\u201d Thus, in effect, the Board found that the admission contained in the resolution was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">The Board did not find that Gottstein had any interest in the North Fourth stock. The Board found that on March 18, 1933, J. von Herberg wrote Gottstein a letter stating that \u201cIt is understood that I, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>undersigned J. von Herberg, hold in trust for you [Gottstein] a 20% interest in [North Fourth],\u201d but the Board also found: \u201cThere is no evidence in the record of any corporate authorization of this trusteeship, and no corporate records to indicate that petitioner was engaged in a joint adventure with Gottstein or had transferred to von Herberg a 20 per cent interest in North Fourth for the benefit of Gottstein. * * * As owner of all the stock of North Fourth, petitioner received the consideration therefor, presumably in its own right, and the respondent [the Commissioner of Internal Revenue] has so determined. The burden is on petitioner to show that the respondent erred. * * * This burden it has failed to meet and the action of the respondent is sustained as to this issue.\u201d Thus, in effect, the Board found that Gottstein had no interest in the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">All findings hereinabove referred to are supported by substantial evidence and hence are conclusive.

Rankin, 295 U.S. 123, 131, 55 S.Ct. 732, 79 L.Ed. 1343; General Utilities &amp; Operating Co. v. Helvering, 296 U.S. 200, 206, 56 S.Ct. 185, 80 L.Ed. 154; Hulburd v. Commissioner, 296 U.S. 300, 306, 56 S.Ct. 197, 80 L.Ed. 242; Elmhurst Cemetery Co. v. Commissioner, 300 U.S. 37, 40, 57 S.Ct. 324, 81 L.Ed. 491; Helvering v. National Grocery Co., 304 U.S. 282, 294, 58 S.Ct. 932, 82 L.Ed. 1346; Colorado National Bank v. Commissioner, 305 U.S. 23, 26, 59 S.Ct. 48, 83 L.Ed. 20; Helvering v. F. &amp; R. Lazarus &amp; Co., 308 U.S. 252, 255, 60 S.Ct. 209, 84 L.Ed. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Upon the facts as found, the Board properly concluded that the basis for determining petitioner\u2019s net gain from the sale of its North Fourth stock should not include the loan of $28,290.81 or the $4,733.42 paid to Gottstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In 1926 petitioner purchased for $20,200 bonds of Ballard Aerie No. 172, Fraternal Order of Eagles, of the face value of $20,-200 \u2014 part of a total issue of $150,000 \u2014 secured by a second mortgage on real property in Seattle, Washington. Ballard Aerie having defaulted in the payment of interest, the bondholders brought an action<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in a State court of Washington and, on December 29, <em>1932, </em>obtained a judgment against Ballard Aerie for the principal amount of the bonds ($150,000), plus accrued interest ($59,400), a total of $209,400, with 6% interest on that total from November 1, 1932, an attorney\u2019s fee of $10,000, a trustee\u2019s fee of $3,500 and other costs. The judgment also foreclosed the second mortgage. Accordingly, on February 18, 1933, the mortgaged property was sold \u2014 subject to a first mortgage of $230,000 \u2014 and was bid in by the judgment creditors (including petitioner) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for $13,641.11, which sufficed merely to pay the cos.ts and a small part ($110.36) of the interest due on the judgment. Whether the principal amount of the judgment ($209,400) or the balance of the interest thereon was ever paid the record does not show.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">In computing its net income for the taxable year \u2014 the fiscal year ended June 30, 1936 \u2014 petitioner deducted as a bad debt<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the $20,200 invested by it in Ballard Aerie bonds. The deduction was disallowed by respondent, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and by the Board, on the ground that the debt evidenced by the bonds and, later, by the judgment was not ascertained to be worthless within the taxable year. This ruling is specified as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">Respondent\u2019s determination that the debt was not ascertained to be worthless within the taxable year was presumptively correct. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212; Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 289, 294, 55 S.Ct. 158, 79 L.Ed. 367. The burden of proving it incorrect rested on petitioner. Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co., 281 U.S. 264, 271, 50 S.Ct. 263, 74 L.Ed. 848; Welch v. Helvering, supra; Helvering v. Taylor, 293 U.S. 507, 512-516, 55 S.Ct. 287, 79 L.Ed. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">The burden was not sustained. There was no proof that the judgment was ascertained to be worthless in the taxable year, or that it was in fact worthless. There was some attempt to show that the judgment creditors\u2019 equity in the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>purchased at the foreclosure sale was ascertained to be worthless in the taxable year, but the Board found otherwise, and its finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\"> Revenue Act of 1934, \u00a7 113, 26 U.S. C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> Some of the Board\u2019s findings are stated in its \u201copinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> Of the $28,290.81 found to have been loaned by petitioner to General, $19,-921.74 was found to have been loaned directly to General, and $8,369.07 was found to have been \u201cadvanced\u201d to North Fourth and by it \u201cpassed on\u201d to General.
