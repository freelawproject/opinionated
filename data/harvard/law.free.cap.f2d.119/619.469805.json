Castanea Paper Co., 3 Cir., 105 F.2d 126, 129, quoting with approval the opinion in Egry Register Co. v. Standard Register Co., 6 Cir., 1 F.2d 11, 12, viz., \u201cThe rule is that, whenever the right to file a bill is at all doubtful, leave is granted as a matter of course. This does not necessarily involve any consideration whatever as to the sufficiency of the hill, but only as to the apparent right of the plaintiff to file the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"avq-dedup-0\">An order will be entered in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
