W. Erickson, trustee in bankruptcy of Magnet Oil Company, a corporation (hereafter called Magnet), appeals from an order affirming an order of a referee in bankruptcy allowing the claim of Brix Estate Company, a corporation (hereafter called Brix), Lisenby Estate Company, a corporation (hereafter called Lisenby), H. U. Maxfield and H. H. Welsh against the bankrupt estate for $35,000, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-26\">On May 5, 1938, for a consideration of $10 and \u201cother valuable considerations,\u201d appellees (Brix, Lisenby, Maxfield and Welsh) leased to Magnet, for the term of 20 years, certain real property in Fresno County, California. The \u201cother valuable considerations\u201d included five promissory notes executed and delivered by Magnet to appellees on May 6, 1938 \u2014 one for $4,000, one for $5,000 and three for $10,000 each, all bearing 5% interest from date. The note for $4,000 was paid on May 25, 1938. The others fell due 30, 60, 120 and 180 days after their date, but remained and still remain wholly unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-27\">On March 9, 1939, Magnet was adjudged a bankrupt, and the case was referred to a referee in bankruptcy. Thereafter appellant was appointed trustee. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>does not disclose the first date set for the first meeting of creditors, but, indulging the presumption that the court followed the statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we presume that the first date set for such meeting was not earlier than March 19, 1939, nor later than April 8, 1939. On June 29, 1939 \u2014 well within the time prescribed by <em>statute</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 appellees\u2019 claim for $35,000 was proved and filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Appellees\u2019 claim was founded on the four last above mentioned promissory notes, copies of which were set out in the proof of claim. The proof stated that Magnet was \u201cjustly and truly indebted to [Brix] and the other payees appearing on the * * * notes in the sum of thirty-five thousand * * * dollars.\u201d The other payees appearing on the notes were Lisenby, Max-field and Welsh. The proof was signed and sworn to by Brix\u2019s secretary, Earl J. Fenston. Though not signed or sworn to by Lisenby, Maxfield or Welsh, it evidenced a claim which was theirs as well as Brix\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">On September 26, 1939, appellant filed objections to appellees\u2019 claim, referring to it as Brix\u2019s claim. On November 21, 1939, appellant filed amended objections to ap-pellees\u2019 claim, again referring to it as Brix\u2019s claim. On February 14, 1940, ap-pellees applied for and, over appellant\u2019s objection, obtained leave to file, and did file, an amended proof of their claim. The amended proof was signed and sworn to by Brix\u2019s secretary, Lisenby\u2019s secretary, Maxfield and Welsh. It was stipulated that the amended objections filed by appellant on November 21, 1939, should \u201cbe deemed and considered as objections to the amended claim insofar as applicable.\u201d The referee heard the objections, overruled them and allowed appellees\u2019 claim. The District Judge affirmed the referee\u2019s order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Appellant contends that the referee erred in overruling (1) his objection to the filing of appellees\u2019 amended proof of claim and (2) his objections to the claim itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The grounds of appellant\u2019s objection to the filing of appellees\u2019 amended proof of claim were \u201cThat the payees under the promissory notes are tenants in common and that it was necessary for all of such payees to join in the execution and filing of the original claim, that the execution of the original claim by [Brix] alone was a nullity and of no force or effect, that said original claim could not, therefore, be the basis for the amended claim proposed to be filed, and that the proposed amended claim was in fact a new and original claim being offered for filing subsequent to the six (6) months statutory period within which claims could be filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">There was no merit in the objection. What appellees proposed to file, and did file, on February 14, 1940, was not, as contended by appellant, \u201ca new and original claim.\u201d It was merely an amended proof of the claim filed on June 29, 1939. Defects, if any, in the original proof were defects of form only. To cure such defects, amendments are permissible even after the time for filing claims has expired. Hutchinson v. Otis, 190 U.S. 552, 555, 23 S.Ct. 778, 47 L.Ed. 1179; Brown v. O\u2019Connell, 9 Cir., 200 F. 229, 231-234; In re Patterson-MacDonald Shipbuilding Co., 9 Cir., 293 F. 190, 192; Barks v. Kleyne, 8 Cir., 15 F.2d 153, 156; In re Whicker, 5 Cir., 47 F.2d 106, 108; In re Rothert, 7 Cir., 61 F.2d 1, 2; In re International Match Corp., 2 Cir., 69 F.2d 73, 74; Cook v. Union Trust Co., 4 Cir., 71 F.2d 645, 647; In re Prindible, 3 Cir., 115 F.2d 21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">To the claim itself appellant made numerous objections, of which, however, only two are urged here: (1) That the obligation evidenced by the notes on which the claim was founded was a conditional one, in that the notes were to be paid out of the proceeds of a sale of Magnet\u2019s stock, and that, as the stock was never sold, the notes never became due or payable; (2) that there was an accord and satisfaction of the obligation by reason of Magnet\u2019s executing and delivering to appellees a quitclaim deed to the property which they had leased to Magnet.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">The referee found it was not true that the notes were to be paid out of a sale of Magnet\u2019s stock. The District Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>approved the finding and adopted, it as his own. The finding is amply supported by evidence. We accept it, therefore, and reject appellant\u2019s contention that the obligation evidenced by the notes was a conditional one.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"> On September 9, 1938, Magnet executed a quitclaim deed in favor of appellees and proposed that, in consideration thereof, appellees release Magnet from the obligation evidenced by the notes. The proposal was not accepted, but was rejected. Hence, there was no accord and satisfaction. California Civil Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1521-1523; Silvers v. Grossman, 183 Cal. 696, 699, 192 P. 534. Nor is it material, if true, that the proposal remained unanswered for more than two months; for appellees were under no duty to answer in two months or at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Appellant\u2019s final specification is that \u201cthe court erred in not ordering that [appellees\u2019] claim should in any event be deferred as to payment * * * and subordinated to the payment of creditors furnishing money, labor and material.\u201d The referee was not asked to make any such order. The petition for review prayed \u201cthat an order be entered disallowing said claim, or in the alternative, subordinating the same to the payment of claims for money, labor and material;\u201d but the petition did not state, nor does the record here disclose, any fact or facts warranting such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\"> Section 55, sub. a, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 91, sub. a, provides : \u201cThe court shall cause the first meeting of the creditors of a bankrupt to be held not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the adjudication * * \u00edfc \u00bb</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-18\"> Section 57, sub. n, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93, sub. n, provides: \u201cClaims which are not filed within six months after the first date set for the first meeting of creditors shall not be allowed * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
