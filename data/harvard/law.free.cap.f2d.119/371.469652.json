Bender, were universal partners, having no individual property or debts. Frank died March 18, 1934, leaving a will,,of which Eugene was executor, and which required all his debts to be paid and then gave Eugene all his property of every sort. Eugene qualified as executor but before completing the administration died December 1, 1934, leaving a will of which the petitioners are executors. A return for federal estate taxes on Frank\u2019s estate had been made by Eugene as executor, but the taxes had not been paid when Eugene died. There was no controversy over them, and they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>been paid by petitioners. The estate taxes of Eugene\u2019s estate are in dispute, the Commissioner having assessed a deficiency, which the Board of Tax Appeals, In re Bender\u2019s Estate, 41 B.T.A. 80, confirmed. The errors assigned in the petition to the Board and elaborated here are: (1) The Commissioner in his computation of the deduction for property previously taxed erred in using the net estate of the prior decedent (Frank) as a basis instead of the gross estate. (2) He erred in reducing the deduction for debts evidenced by notes on partnership property from three-fourths of $406,000 to one-half of $406,000. (3) He erred in disallowing deductions of $61,464 and $-14,902 for federal estate tax and State inheritance tax respectively on the estate of Frank, which became debts of Eugene\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The facts are all stipulated. Frank left a widow, who under the Texas community property law had a half interest in her husband\u2019s half of the partnership. She was settled with in property and money, and by her assumption of one-fourth of the debts. She does not figure in this case. Her husband\u2019s interest in the partnership and his one-fourth of the debts alone do. The point of the controversy is whether Eugene\u2019s gross estate is to include Frank\u2019s gross estate and to take deduction for his fourth of the debts, or whether Frank\u2019s estate is to be considered reduced by the amount of his debts in figuring Eugene\u2019s estate. The question occurs in two forms: first, in figuring Eugene\u2019s gross estate and the deductions for claims against that estate; and, second, in figuring the special deduction for property previously taxed within five years, under Revenue Act of 1926, Sect. 303 (a) (2), as amended by Revenue Act of 1932, Sect. 806 (a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Some effort is made in petitioner\u2019s brief to foreclose the matter by claiming that the stipulation of facts establishes that the gross value of Eugene\u2019s estate is $2,-411,920. That figure and those of which it is the total are preceded in the stipulation by this: \u201cAt the date of Eugene L. Bender\u2019s death the value of the property formerly belonging to the partnership enterprise * * * without reduction for debts owing * * * was as follows.\u201d We do not think the stipulation was intended to cut off enquiry as to whether Frank\u2019s debts ought to be dedticted from his share of the property in figuring Eugene\u2019s estate, for that was the very thing to be tried under the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Under the law generally prevalent in the United States Eugene, as surviving p\u00e1rtner, would have been under duty to possess and administer the partnership land and personalty for the settlement of the partnership. 47 C.J., Partnership, \u00a7\u00a7 611, 613, 616, 633, 642. The land, no matter how the legal title stood, would in equity be treated as personalty. The dead partner\u2019s estate would be entitled only to a share in the residue after the business was wound up. Fourth Nat. Bank v. New Orleans &amp; Carrollton Railroad, 11 Wall. 624, 20 L.Ed. 82; Shanks v. Klein, 104 U.S. 18, 26 L.Ed. 635; Bank of Southwest Georgia v. McGarrah, 120 Ga. 944, 48 S.E. 393. 47 C.J., Partnership, \u00a7\u00a7 626, 627, 629. When the surviving partner is also the personal representative of the deceased partner, his rights and his duties as survivor are unaffected. 47 C.J., Partnership, \u00a7\u00a7 643, 646, 221. These principles seem to be well established -also in Texas. Moore v. Steele, 67 Tex. 435, 3 S.W. 448; Oliphant v. Markham, 79 Tex. 543, 15 S.W. 569, 23 Am.St.Rep. 363; Altgelt v. Alamo Natl. Bank, 98 Tex. 252, 83 S.W. 6; Gresham v. Harcourt, 93 Tex. 149, 53 S.W. 1019; Martin v. Dial, Tex.Com.App., 57 S.W.2d 75, 89 A.L.R. 571; Bright v. Morrow, Tex. Civ.App., 225 S.W. 580; Colorado River Syndicate v. Alexander, Tex.Civ.App., 288 S.W. 586; Ramon v. Ramon, Tex.Civ.App., 10 S.W.2d 584; Sherk v. First Natl. Bank, Tex.Com.App., 206 S.W. 507; Diamond v. Gust, Tex.Civ.App., 206 S.W. 366. Neither Frank\u2019s estate, nor Eugene as Frank\u2019s legatee, could have anything except an interest in what was left of the partnership property -after the debts were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">If the partnership be considered wound up, it being clearly solvent, by Eugene\u2019s apportioning the property and debts among Mrs. Frank, Frank\u2019s estate, and himself, so that one-fourth of the property became Frank\u2019s and one-fourth of the debts (as between themselves) Frank\u2019s individual debts, a similar result follows. Eugene as executor was bound to sell so much of Frank\u2019s property as was needed, and pay Frank\u2019s debts. Had he done so, he as sole legatee would get only what was left. The value of Frank\u2019s property less the amount of Frank\u2019s debts was his legacy, and the will so said. He did not become entitled to anything else by dying during the year of administration. In most juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>dictions the executors of the executor would then become Frank\u2019s representative, or an administrator de bonis non cum testamento annexo would be appointed to complete the administration of Frank\u2019s estate, and Eugene\u2019s estate would get only what was left after paying Frank\u2019s debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"> It is argued that it is otherwise in Texas because of Rev.Civ.Stats. Art. 3314: \u201cWhen a person dies, leaving a lawful will, all of his estate devised or bequeathed by such will shall vest immediately in the devisees or legatees * * * subject, however, to the payment of the debts of the testator * * There is a similar provision as to heirs where there is no will; and in either case the grant of letters testamentary or of administration entitles executor or administrator to possess and dispose of the estate. Art. 3343 makes the debts of the decedent a lien on the property if taken without administration. As to this we observe that federal taxing statutes are to be so applied as to have the same results in like situations throughout the United States. The peculiarities of local laws do not control unless the statute refers to them ' as a standard. Thomas v. Perkins, 301 U.S. 655, 57 S.Ct. 911, 81 L.Ed. 1324; Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U.S. 103, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77 L.Ed. 199. Whether the local law provides one sort of administration, or another sort, or no administration, ought not to affect the incidence or the amount of this tax on the transfer of wealth from the dead to the living. When an administration is cut short, as here, just as equity considers that done which ought to have been done and grants relief accordingly, so the estate tax administration ought to consider that done which should have been done and assess the tax accordingly, and alike in all parts of the United States. If either the partnership or the estate of Frank had been regularly wound up, Eugene would not have received from Frank\u2019s estate a full one-fourth of the partnership assets, but that fourth reduced by Frank\u2019s fourth of the debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">As to the partnership creditors, Eugene owed the debts equally with Frank; but as between themselves after dissolution and settlement with Mrs. Frank, he did not. Each partner was amply solvent. If Eugene should pay Frank\u2019s part he would have recourse on Frank\u2019s estate. For present purposes Frank\u2019s fourth of the debts were an incumbrance on Frank\u2019s property and not \u201cclaims against the estate\u201d of Eugene. The two things are clearly distinguished in the tax statute and regulations; Sect. 303 (a) (1), as amended by Revenue Act 1932, \u00a7 805, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 232; Reg. 80, Art. 38. That section, providing for deductions, after naming funeral and administration expenses, mentions: (C) Claims against the estate, and (D) Unpaid mortgages upon or any indebtedness in respect to property, where the value of decedent\u2019s interest therein, undiminished by such mortgage or indebtedness, is included in the value of the gross estate. Frank\u2019s part of the debts, a lien on his part of the property, is \u201csuch mortgage or indebtedness.\u201d Subsection D permits, so far as it is concerned, either that the net value of the property be put in the gross estate in which case the indebtedness may not be deducted, or else the full value may be included in the gross with a contra deduction. There is, as the Board remarks, no difference thus far which is done.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">But when we come to Sec. 303 (a) (2), as amended by Sect. 806 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, which deals with the deduction of property which has caused estate taxes within five years preceding, it does make a difference, both in the basis of this deduction, and in the subtraction from it of the result of the formula with which subparagraph (a) (2) ends. The purpose of these provisions is to avoid a double estate or gift tax on the same property within five years. The language used is adapted to one or more particular pieces of property specifically given or inherited. It is not adapted to an unadministered estate as a whole. This is a strong reason for caution in applying it to -an unadministered estate which is indebted. If applied, it should be on condition that the reality of the situation be regarded, that Eugene did not become devisee of all Frank\u2019s property and of his debts, but was by the will and by the law told to pay the debts first. The estate tax of Frank was returned and estimated as though that had been done. Eugene was enriched only by the net amount of Frank\u2019s estate. He ought not to have his estate tax diminished because he did not pay Frank\u2019s debts, thus acquiring a larger gross estate and larger deductions as for claims against his own estate. Petitioners insist on the literal words in the subparagraph limiting this deduction: \u201cOnly in the amount finally determined as the value of such property in determining * * * the gross estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>such prior decedent.\u201d The fallacy and injustice lie in the fact that all of Frank\u2019s property is sought to be included in Eugene\u2019s gross estate, whereas only that left after paying Frank\u2019s debts would be there if Eugene had done his job as executor; and Frank\u2019s debts are sought to be made deductions, when they ought to have been discharged before any of Frank\u2019s property was taken into Eugene\u2019s estate. Neither the peculiarity of Texas law nor the death of Eugene before completing his duties about Frank\u2019s estate ought to affect these taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The federal estate tax and State inheritance tax assessed against the estate of Frank, though paid by petitioners after the death of Eugene, are not claims against the estate of Eugene. They go to reduce the value of property received by Eugene\u2019s estate from Frank\u2019s, along with his fourth of the partnership debts and administration charges, as the Commissioner ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b435-7\">HUTCHESON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aqg-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">This appeal involves a tax deficiency in the amount of $84,951.55, assessed against the estate of Eugene Bender, sole legatee of his brother, Frank Bender, who had died eight months before. In arriving at the deficiency determination, taxpayer and commissioner found themselves in -almost complete agreement upon the values of the properties forming the gross estates of the two brothers. They found themselves in complete disagreement upon whether in determining the reduction from the deduction, it allowed, Section 303 (a) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******required the use in the equation of the gross or the net estate values.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">The Board in confessed inability to understand the significance and effect of taxpayer\u2019s insistence that the section required an equation using the gross estates, brushed the contention aside as really detrimental to taxpayer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proceeding then on the wholly erroneous assumption that the commissioner\u2019s use of net estate figures favored the taxpayer, it sustained the deficiency determination which had been arrived at by the use of the net, rather than the gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Petitioners are here insisting that the commissioner in arriving at his determination as to the deduction allowable under Section 303 (a) (2), as amended, and the Board in affirming it, have not as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>should have done applied the ratio provision of the 1932 Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They have read and applied the section as though it still contained the provision found in prior acts, \u201cand not deducted under paragraph 1 or 3 of subsection (a) of this section.\u201d I agree with petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">From the very beginning the estate tax acts have provided that, for the purpose of the tax, the value of the net estate shall be determined by first ascertaining the gross estate and then making certain deductions from it. Whatever form additions to or amendments of the estate taxing acts have taken, this method of arriving at the net estate has always been pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The first provision for deduction of the value of properties forming part of a prior estate, appeared in Section 403 (a) (2), Revenue Act of 1918.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1921 this section was amended,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so as to make more detailed and accurate provision for taking this pri- or estate deduction. In this act there first appeared the words, \u201cand not deducted under paragraphs (1) or (3) of subdivision (a) of this section.\u201d This provision was carried substantially unchanged into the 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, pages 69, 233. The ratio provision in question here, italicized in note 3, first appeared in the 1932 Amendment of the 1926 Act. As then amended it has been carried forward in subsequent tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The report of the House Ways and Means Committee on the Revenue Act of 1932,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> purports to give a reason for amending out of the section, the provision in the prior acts against deductions already taken, and writing into it in lieu.thereof, the provision for reducing the deduction by the use of an arbitrary ratio. Whether this is a good reason for the change or whether the purpose of it has been accomplished, is beside the mark here. The report is cited only to emphasize what the Board and the Commissioner seem to have completely overlooked, that this section of the Act of 1926, as amended in 1932 is a very dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ferent thing iroin the section as it existed before the amendment. As so written it does not provide as the former acts did, for reducing the deduction for prior taxed property, allowed under subsection (2) of the section, by excluding from the value of the gross estate, inherited by the second decedent, deductions allowed under subsections (1) and (3) of the section. It provides for reducing the paragraph (2) deduction by an amount bearing the same ratio to the deductions allowed under the other three paragraphs of the section, which the paragraph 2 deduction hears \u201cto the value of the decedent\u2019s gross estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Petitioners sought below and seek here the application of this formula. In principle they ask no more than this, in principle no less should be accorded them. Where the words of a taxing\" act have a sensible meaning they are controlling. They must be followed rather than a supposed intent not expressed in them. \u201cCourts and administrative agencies are bound to enforce the plain words of the statute although there may he reason to think, in view of the general legislative purpose that some other provision would have met with favor if the Legislature had called it to mind.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Windrow, 5 Cir., 89 F.2d 69, 71, 110 A.L.R. 1251. The Board cannot, if it would, amend subdivision (2) of the statute, to read into it the provision, \u201cand not deducted under paragraphs (1) or (3) or subdivision (a) of this section\u201d, which Congress has by amending it, taken out of it. It will not do then for the Board to say to the petitioners, we think the method employed by us is more nearly right and just than the one you invoke. For this is not to apply but to rewrite the section. It must be able to point out that its determination is in accordance with the section as amended and not as it formerly was. It lias failed to do this. The majority opinion, though satisfied with the conclusions of the Board, recognizes that the reasons it advances for its conclusions do not form a sound basis for them, and it therefore puts forward reasons of its own to sustain them. These reasons are that the Benders were partners and because they were, the value of Eugene\u2019s gross estate and the deductions from it, are different from what they would have been but for the partnership relation. With deference then, rationalization of the Board\u2019s conclusions is as fallacious and unsound, does as complete violence to the terms of the statute as that the Board puts forward. I therefore respectfully dissent from the judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">It does not follow however that I think that petitioners, though right in principle in insisting that gross rather than net estate values should be used, in determining the amount of the subsection (2) deduction, are right throughout. I think they are wrong in claiming as a deduction the $64,-090.41 federal estate taxes due and paid by Frank Bender\u2019s estate. It is not, it could not be claimed that Frank Bender could take these taxes as a deduction in his estate. It may not any more be claimed that Eugene may take them because they were unpaid at the time of Eugene\u2019s death. Federal taxes are not deductible and though they are obligations of Eugene Bender\u2019s estate by reason of his having taken under Frank Bender\u2019s will, all of his property subject to the payment of his debts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> they are not deductible obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In arriving then at the true amount of the subsection (2) deduction, the figures to be used are the gross value of Frank Bender\u2019s estate as found by the Commissioner, to wit, $909,349.98, less payments made on account of that estate before Eugene\u2019s death, over the gross value of Eugene Bender\u2019s estate as also found by the Commissioner, to-wit, $2,414,929.07, and all of Eugene\u2019s deductions. These to include, not merely the approximately $203,000 of the partnership debts which was Eugene Bender\u2019s original share, but the $304,500 both Eugene and Frank Bender\u2019s share, and the other debts and charges against the estate of Frank Bender including therein, stale inheritance taxes but excluding therefrom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>federal estate taxes. I therefore think that the order of the Board should be reversed and the cause remanded for a redetermination of the deficiency in accordance with these views.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> \u201cAn amount equal to the value of any property (A) forming a part of the gross estate situated in the United States of any person who died within five years prior to the death of the decedent, * * * where such property can be identified as having been received by the decedent * * * from such prior decedent by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance * * \u00bb.
