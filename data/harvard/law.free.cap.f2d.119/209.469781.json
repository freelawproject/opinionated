After an extended hearing, the Court entered judgment compelling obedience to the order, with certain exceptions as to some of the records called for. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">There is no doubt the administrator had authority to issue the subpoena and the Court had jurisdiction to enforce it. W. \u201cBlondie\u201d Graham v.
