Plaintiff contends that there was sufficient evidence of an unconditional delivery of the policy to the insured, and of a waiver of premium prepayment, so that, under the law of Missouri, the court could not properly have directed a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-21\">At the time he made application for the policy, O. A. Urseth, the insured, was a soliciting agent for defendant, authorized to take applications, to deliver the policies issued by the company upon such applications, and to collect the initial premiums thereon. His contract as agent was dated January 28, 1936. It was cancelled on March 23, 1936, because he had failed to produce any business, except his own application. Under the contract, he was to receive a commission allowance on the business written by him, but, since he claimed to be without funds, the company made three cash advances to him of $25 each, on the 4th, 12th.and 18th of Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ary, or a total of $75, which it charged against him on its books. During this period he submitted an application in his own name, with his wife as beneficiary, for a five-year term policy, in the amount of $5,-000, with a $15.05 quarterly premium. The application bears date of February 15, 1936, but the medical examiner\u2019s report is dated February 11, 1936, and the policy itself was executed at the home office in Montreal, Canada, on February 20, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The policy was transmitted to the branch office of the company at St. Louis, Missouri, and on February 24, 1936, was either handed to Urseth at the office or left in his agent\u2019s box. The evidence shows that a memorandum of instructions was placed with it, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cMemorandum from St. Louis, Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201cTo Mr. Urseth</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201cRe: Your Policy 1493-954.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201cEnclosed is the above mentioned policy which is lo be delivered subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\u201c(1) If the policy is written as applied for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">\u201c(a) Where a settlement in accordance with the Company\u2019s regulations (cash in full or part cash and agreement on Company\u2019s form for balance) has already been arranged the policy may be immediately delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">\u201c(b) Where a settlement has not already been arranged, provided the applicant is still in good health and other conditions in the application have not changed, settlement must be effected within two months from the date of the medical examination, or of the non-medical personal declaration in non-medical cases; otherwise the policy must be returned to this office for cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">\u201c(2) If the policy is written on terms other than applied for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">\u201c (a) Where a settlement has already been arranged, this office must be notified at the earliest possible moment (not later than one mouth from this date) that the policy has or has not been accepted and any necessary settlement adjustment made.

He had never paid the premium on his policy, nor did he ever execute the inspection receipt attached to the memorandum of instructions given him with the policy. The records of the St. Louis of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>fice showed that on April 13, 1936, it mailed him the following form letter, which was regularly sent every applicant who failed to accept a policy within 60 days from the date of the medical examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201cThe time allowed by the Company for your acceptance of this policy has expired, but before we report this fact to our Head Office we would like to give you an opportunity to reconsider your decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cIn your own case, if you act now, a declaration of continued good health satisfactory to the Company, and an arrangement for the payment of the premium are the only requirements to put this policy in force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cWill you please let us hear from you if you are at all interested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Urseth was killed April 15, 1936, in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s first contention is that the delivery of the policy to Urseth, without payment of the initial premium on his part, constituted, under the law of Missouri, an automatic extension of credit and a waiver of premium prepayment, as a matter of law, or that it at least was such evidence of a credit extension as entitled her to have that question submitted to the jury. National City Bank v. Missouri State Life Insurance Co., 332 Mo. 182, 57 S.W.2d 1066, 1070, is cited in support of this contention. That case held in substance that where the insurer\u2019s agent was authorized to deliver a policy and make collection of the premium, his delivery thereof to the insured, without requiring the premium to be paid, would constitute a waiver of the prompt payment of the premium, and the policy would be treated as having become effective from the date of its delivery. The opinion says: \u201cNumerous Missouri cases, in which the defense was that the first premium was not paid upon delivery of the policy, rule that such payment may be deemed to have been waived by the agent of the insurer, authorized. to deliver the policy and to collect the premium. * * * These decisions rest upon the principle of estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Reliance also is placed upon Lafferty v. Kansas City Casualty Co., 287 Mo. 555, 229 S.W. 750, where it was held: \u201cIn an action to recover upon an accident policy for the death of the insured, the insured\u2019s possession of the policy raises the presumption that it had been delivered and paid for, or that credit had been given for the premium; and, where defendant\u2019s testimony was otherwise, the question was for the jury.\u201d The court thus applied to an insurance case the rule previously adopted in res ipsa loquitur cases, under Gannon v. Laclede Gaslight Co., 145 Mo. 502, 46 S.W. 968, 47 S.W. 907, 43 L.R.A. 505, and took the view that the presumption arising from possession of the policy created such a prima facie case in favor of plaintiff that even uncontradicted testimony on positive facts could not destroy its probative force, and that \u201ceven though hundreds of the most reputable witnesses of the community should testify to the facts * * * the jury alone must be the judge of their credibility and the weight to be given to their testimony, and <em>* * </em>* the court has absolutely no legal authority to interfere with that absolute prerogative of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">The Lafferty case has been cited with approval in other Missouri decisions, among them Bennett v. Royal Union Mutual Life Insurance Co., 232 Mo.App. 1027, 112 S.W.2d 134. The opinion in the latter case expressly indicates that the term prima facie case in such a situation is intended to be synonymous with a submissible case. In other decisions, attempts have been made to distinguish between a prima facie case based on the production of at least some affirmative evidence and one resting wholly on presumption. In Berne v. Prudential Insurance Co., Mo.App. 1939, 129 S.W.2d 92, 95, it was declared that the general rule, that where the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case the trial court cannot direct a verdict for the defendant is subject to the exception that, where the proof is documentary or the defendant relies on plaintiff\u2019s own evidence, or evidence which the plaintiff admits to be true, and the reasonable inferences therefrom all point one way, or where plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case is based upon a presumption, there is no issue of fact to be submitted to the jury. The opinion says: \u201cThe general rule announced in the Gannon case [Gannon v. Laclede Gaslight Co., supra] * * * has been held by our Supreme Court to be subject to a further exception where plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case is based upon a presumption. State ex rel. Bowdon v. Allen et al., 337 Mo. 260, 85 S.W.2d 63.\u201d The Bowdon case, which involved an issue as to suicide, seeks to distinguish between a \u201clegal presumption affecting the burden of proof\u201d and one relating only to \u201cthe burden of evidence,\u201d and holds that \u201cthe presumption against suicide which arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>* * * in the plaintiff\u2019s favor affected only the burden of evidence.\u201d [337 Mo. 260, 85 S.W.2d 67.]</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The Lafferty case, however, declares that the non-delivery of a policy is an affirmative defense, on which defendant has the burden of proof, and holds in effect that the jury alone has the right to determine wild her defendant\u2019s proof is sufficient to sustain the burden resting upon it and to overcome the prima facie case of plaintiff. The difference in the language used in the two cases and the lack of any reference to the Lafferty case in the Bowdon opinion may leave a doubt as to whether the rule declared with respect to the presumption against suicide was intended to have application also to the presumption as to policy delivery and extension of premium credit, and a more definite expression on the part of the Supreme Court of Missouri will perhaps be necessary to settle the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Tt is unnecessary for us here, however, to attempt to clear up the confusion in the Missouri decisions, by a consideration of the seeming soundness or unsoundness of their conflicting expressions. Even if the rule recognized in the Bowdon case is not intended to have application to a presumption as to policy delivery and extension of premium credit, this would not entitle plaintiff to a reversal of the judgment in this case. The rule in the Lafferty case clearly does not apply except within the immediate boundaries of an insurer and insured relationship. It rests upon the obvious premise that delivery of the policy could only have been made to the insured in that status or capacity. It is somewhat analogous to the situation where a debtor has obtained possession of the papers which evidence his obligation. His possession creates a presumption of payment, because, as the Supreme Court of Missouri has said, in Erhart v. Dietrich, 118 Mo. 418, 24 S.W. 188, 191, \u201cit accords with the ordinary course of dealing that, when one pays his note or bond, or other security, he usually takes it up.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d the court adds, \u201cwhen the debtor had the means of obtaining possession of, or of canceling, the obligation, other than by paying it, then no such presumption arises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">In the present case, the policy came into Urseth\u2019s hands as an agent of the company, and not as one of its insured. Plaintiff argues that, where the agent is the applicant for the insurance, a delivery to the agent ought to be held to be a delivery to the insured. But such an indistinguishability docs not follow, where, as here, an obligation was imposed upon him as agent, in connection with the receipt of the policy, which the company had a right to require of him, and which it was his duty under his agent\u2019s contract to perform. Under the memorandum of instructions placed with the policy when it came into his hands, Urseth as agent could not legally release the policy to himself, so as to enable it to become effective, until the initial premium was paid. Whatever might be the necessity and justice of creating an estoppel against the company, where an agent has placed a policy in the hands of a third-party insured, in violation of his instructions, the wrongful acts of an agent certainly do not compel an estoppel against the company in favor of himself. The law will not permit an agent to profit from his own fraud against his principal. Clinkscales v. Clark, 137 Mo.App. 12, 118 S.W. 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Plaintiff argues that it was a question for the jury whether the memorandum of instructions was in fact placed with the policy at the time, since none was included with it when Urseth later handed it to plaintiff. The positive testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses, however, in connection with the established practice in such cases, and the carbon copy of the memorandum contained in defendant\u2019s file, could leave no rational doubt on that point for a jury to settle. Ephemeral speculation does not afford substance for a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\"> It is suggested also that the fact that the memorandum was addressed, \u201cTo Mr. Urseth. Re: Your Policy 1493-954,\u201d was evidence to indicate that the policy was delivered to Urseth as an insured and not as an agent. The contents of the memorandum and the fact that, if Urseth were being dealt with as an insured, the instructions were superfluous malee this too a mere wishful assertion. The same is true of the declaration that the jury might find the expression \u201cO. K.\u201d oil the memorandum to be an indication that the policy was to be delivered without prepayment of the premium. The testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses shows that this expression had reference to a special commission allowance, which was stricken out on the memorandum immediately following the expression itself. But, in any event, such an abstract expression, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>without some apparent correlation, would constitute an immateriality which could not be translated into a plenary ambiguity for convenient jury resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">It is argued that the fact that the company did not specifically demand that Urseth return the inspection receipt duly executed, or make a special request for payment of the premium, is evidence of its intention to extend credit. But these were matters duly covered by the memorandum of instructions, and as to which the responsibility was cast solely upon Urseth. Neither he nor his beneficiary can mould his own dereliction into a weapon against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The contention is made that if the company was willing to make some cash advances to Urseth, as it did, it may be assumed that it also was willing to extend credit for his premium. But this again is mere argument. The evidence shows conclusively that credit for a policy premium was never extended to an agent, except where he had renewal commissions accruing, and then only on his signed written order. Urseth never had any renewal commissions coming to him, nor is there any evidence that he had ever requested that he be extended credit for the premium. On. the contrary, plaintiff offered evidence, on rebuttal, to show that Urseth had stated that \u201che would pay for it out of his salary.\u201d This he never did, possibly because his advances were terminated. The company never charged the premium against him on its records. The initial premium not having been paid within 60 days from the date of his medical examination, and Urseth not being in a position as agent to deliver the policy to himself as an insured so as to create an estoppel against the company, the policy never became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention is that, under the recitation in the policy, defendant was precluded from showing that the premium was unpaid. The policy contained the following clause: \u201cThis policy is issued in consideration of the application therefor and of a premium of Fifteen \u00b0%oo Dollars to be paid to the Company on the fifteenth day of February, 1936, and of the payment to it of a like amount quarter-yearly thereafter on the fifteenth day of May, August, November and February in every year during the continuance of this policy until five full years\u2019 premiums shall have been paid.\u201d It contained a further provision that \u201cThe words \u2018date of issue\u2019 as used herein shall be construed to mean the date on which this policy was signed and sealed at Montreal.\u201d There was a recitation that the policy was \u201cSigned and Sealed at Montreal, this twentieth day of February one thousand nine hundred and thirtjr-six.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the issuance of the policy on February 20th, when the first premium was to be paid on February 15th, was \u201can irrefutable admission that the premium was paid.\u201d In Missouri State Life Insurance Co. v. Salisbury, 279 Mo. 40, 213 S.W. 786, it was said: \u201cThe payment of the first premium, where the policy itself recites that such first premium was made, cannot be disputed for the purpose of invalidating the policy; but where the recital is that \u2018the insurance is granted in consideration of the payment in advance\u2019 of a named sum of money, \u2018being the premium for the first year\u2019s insurance under this policy,\u2019 the recital is not a specific recital of payment, but a mere statement that the first payment shall be the consideration for the issuance of the policy.\u201d Here, as in the Salisbury case, the \u201crecital is not a specific acknowledgment of payment; it merely states that the first payment shall be as consideration for the issuance of the policy.\u201d Hence, even if plaintiff had been in a position to invoke the provisions of the policy, this contention would be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The trial court properly held that the evidence conclusively established that the initial premium had not been paid, nor had credit been extended with respect to it. Urseth could not in this situation deliver the policy, which came into his hands as agent, to himself as insured, so as to create a liability upon it against the company. The policy under these circumstances never became effective, and the judgment for defendant must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
