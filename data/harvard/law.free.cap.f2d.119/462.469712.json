Pending the suit, the Association was ordered dissolved and appellant was appointed its receiver. The District Code provides that \u201cNo action pending * * * against any corporation shall be discontinued or abate by the dissolution of the corporation, whether such dissolution occur by the expiration of its charter or otherwise * *<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">The suit was brought to rescind subscriptions for stock in the Association, and also to recover $900 which appellees had paid to the Association as \u201csurplus premiums\u201d or \u201cmembership fees\u201d, on the ground of fraud on the part of the Association\u2019s agents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Though appellant resists 'the return of the premiums or fees, he consents to rescission of the stock subscriptions because the Association is no longer able to fulfill its part of the subscription contracts. Therefore no question regarding the rescission of stock subscriptions, whether before or after dissolution, is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-24\">The District Court found that appellees were induced to pay $900 as \u201csurplus premiums\u201d by the representations of the Association\u2019s agent that it intended to invest this money in real estate mortgages, and that the agent knew that these representations were false. The evidence supports these findings. Appellee Nicholas Volsk dealt with one Anthony. The persons in charge of the Association\u2019s office represented to .Volsk that Anthony was its salesman; they also accepted <em>money from </em>Volsk, and delivered certificates to him, pursuant to the offers which Anthony induced him to make. The Association thus confirmed Anthony\u2019s authority as agent. His representations were connected with his agency. And \u201cone may be bound by the misrepresentation of his agent, if it is made in the exercise of his apparent authority, relates to the matter intrusted to his management or control, and the party dealt with has no knowledge of the misrepresentation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-17\"> Title 5, \u00a7 406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-18\"> Cf.
