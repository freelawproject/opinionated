He was sentenced to custodial terms aggregating life imprisonment plus 16 years with parole ineligibility periods aggregating 32V2 years. On this appeal from the judgment, defendant urges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>POINT I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">The defendant was entitled to relief from prejudicial joinder pursuant to Rule</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">3:15-2(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">POINT II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">The New Jersey insanity statutes are unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">POINT III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">Defendant\u2019s statement subsequent to his arrest should have been excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">POINT IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">The trial court erred in failing to charge <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">POINT V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">The trial court erred in failing to charge the intoxification defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-16\">POINT VI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-17\">Prosecutor\u2019s use of statements not in evidence in summation was prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-18\">POINT VII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-19\">Prosecutor\u2019s comments at sentencing were prejudicial. (Not raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-20\">POINT VIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-21\">The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">The convictions result from two incidents precipitated by defendant\u2019s estrangement from his former girlfriend, Awilda Estevez, with whom he had a child. On May 14, 1982, defendant was in his car with Awilda. Notwithstanding her attempts to leave, defendant restrained her in the car and threatened her with a knife as they drove about for more than an hour and a half before defendant brought her home. On May 26, defendant came to Awilda\u2019s house. He was not permitted to enter and remained on the porch. The police were called. As the police arrived, defendant broke through a window and entered the house, where he was confronted by Awilda\u2019s father holding a machete. Defendant took the machete, struck the father and demanded to know where Awilda had gone; he also struck Awilda\u2019s mother. The police saw defendant swinging the machete and shot him. Awilda\u2019s father was found dead, the result of stab wounds to the lung and heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-23\">Defendant did not dispute the facts of the occurrences, but interposed the defenses of insanity and diminished capacity as to the May 26 occurrences. Dr. Seymour Kuvin, an examining psychiatrist, reported that defendant had an unstable family background, attended high school for only one year although he did subsequently get his GED in 1980, had a strong marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>habit and used cocaine and quaaludes, although less frequently. He had been employed but was laid off some time before the murder. The affair with Awilda was passionate and defendant was greatly upset as it broke up. He began to contemplate suicide and to increase his use of marijuana, other drugs and liquor. Defendant, armed with a rifle, went to Awilda\u2019s house on May 26 planning to manipulate her by telling her that he would kill himself if she would not return to him. He remembered breaking through the window but had little other recall of the homicide. At the time of his examination, Dr. Kuvin said, defendant was \u201cmarkedly depressed\u201d but with thinking, judgment and insight intact. Dr. Kuvin concluded that defendant was suffering from \u201cdepressive neurosis, to a suicidal degree,\u201d which he characterized as a mental \u201cdisease\u201d or \u201cdisorder.\u201d On May 26, Dr. Kuvin opined, defendant suffered \u201can acute psychotic episode,\u201d at which time \u201chis instinctual aggressive and sexual drives burst through uncontrolled.\u201d Defendant then had \u201cno capacity because of this illness and defective reasoning for determining that he was doing anything wrong, legally or morally wrong\u201d; it was \u201cimpossible for [defendant] to have acted purposely or knowingly.\u201d Dr. Kuvin pointed out that Dr. Seyere of Perth Amboy General Hospital had also made a diagnosis of depressive reaction and possible acute psychotic episode when defendant was being treated there immediately after the May 26 events. However, Dr. Kuvin testified that defendant was not insane or psychotic on the night of the kidnapping episode, May 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The State responded with the testimony of Dr. Irwin Perr, who found defendant to be suffering from an \u201cadjustment disorder with mixed features\u201d and possibly a \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d He characterized those conditions as a \u201cmental disorder or mental dysfunction\u201d but \u201c[n]ot necessarily a mental disease.\u201d Dr. Perr concluded that at the time of the killing defendant was not laboring under such a disease or defect of the mind as to impair his ability to tell right from wrong; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>offered no opinion as to whether defendant\u2019s disorder made him unable to act purposely or knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">At the close of all the evidence, defense counsel requested the trial judge to charge aggravated manslaughter <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a) and manslaughter <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4b(1)). Counsel also requested that, with respect to the murder charge, the jury be instructed as to the substance of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense. In the absence of such evidence, it may be presumed that the defendant had no mental disease or defect which would negate a state of mind which is an element of the offense. Mental disease or defect is an affirmative defense which must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The trial judge determined to charge murder, aggravated manslaughter and manslaughter and the defense of insanity <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>2C:4-1). He refused, however, to charge the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2 defense. In Point IV of his brief, defendant urges that refusal as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">We are persuaded that defendant was entitled to the requested charge. We recognize that there is conflicting authority emanating from this court concerning the showing which must be made in order to permit the \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense to be considered by the jury. In <em>State v. Humanik, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283 (App.Div.1985), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>266 (1985), <em>N.J. S.A. </em>2C:4-2 was read to require a defendant \u201cto prove the existence of a mental disease or defect by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 291. <em>State v. Breakiron, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442 (App.Div.1986), app. docketed #25817, certif. granted \u2014 <em>N.J. </em>\u2014 (1986), on the other hand, specifically disagrees with <em>Humanik </em>and holds that a defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am32\">must prove more than that he suffered from some mental disease or defect. He must also prove that his condition negated the state of mind which is an element of the offense. 210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\"><em>Breakiron </em>further holds that the admissibility of diminished capacity evidence must first be evaluated by the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The judge, not the jury, must be persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant suffered from a \u201cmental disease or defect which would negate a state of mind which is an element of the offense.\u201d If the judge is so persuaded, the evidence is admissible and the State must then overcome it at trial beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish the \u201cstate of mind which is an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We need not join in the <em>Humanik-Breakiron </em>debate, for we are satisfied that under either approach defendant\u2019s diminished capacity defense should have been presented to the jury. Dr. Kuvin had unequivocally testified that defendant suffered from a mental \u201cdisease\u201d which rendered it \u201cimpossible\u201d for him \u201cto have acted purposely or knowingly.\u201d Dr. Perr agreed that defendant was suffering from a mental \u201cdisorder\u201d or \u201cdysfunction.\u201d Although Dr. Perr said that condition was not \u201cnecessarily\u201d a mental \u201cdisease,\u201d he expressed no opinion as to whether it negated either state of mind which is an element of a murder offense. The psychiatric testimony, together with the proofs as to defendant\u2019s personal background, his relationship with Awilda and the circumstances of the killing itself, could well justify a factfinder in concluding that defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect on May 26 and that he did not then have the requisite state of mind to commit murder as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(l) and (2). Accordingly, whatever test is used to assess the sufficiency of the proofs, we conclude that defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the diminished capacity defense defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The failure to so charge the jury cannot be construed as harmless error. To be sure, the jury was instructed that the State had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted \u201cpurposely\u201d or \u201cknowingly\u201d and was also given the opportunity to consider whether defendant acted \u201crecklessly,\u201d either under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life or otherwise. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a, 4b(1); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3). But the jury might well have assessed defendant\u2019s state of mind differently had it been specifically instructed that the proofs concerning his mental condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>could bear on his ability to act purposely or knowingly; the charge as given suggested to the jury that if the proofs of mental condition did not sustain the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-1 insanity defense, they would not serve to mitigate defendant\u2019s responsibility. Consideration of the diminished capacity defense might well have led the jury to conclude that defendant acted only \u201crecklessly\u201d or, indeed, without any culpable state of mind. The trial judge\u2019s refusal to charge the substance of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2 thus foreclosed the jury from considering a viable affirmative defense which could mitigate or remit defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">That error, of course, does not infect the convictions for terroristic threats and kidnapping arising out of the May 14, 1982 incidents, for there was no contention at trial that defendant was laboring under any mental disease or defect on that date. However, the error does require that we reverse not only the murder conviction but also the three convictions for weapons possessions and the aggravated assault conviction arising out of the May 26, 1982 incidents. All of those convictions are closely intertwined with the murder conviction and, excepting for the Sixth Count conviction, all similarly are predicated on findings that defendant acted purposely or knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In light of those conclusions, we need not address the contentions raised in Points II and V of defendant\u2019s brief. We are satisfied that, to the extent they bear upon the two convictions arising out of the May 14 incidents, the contentions advanced under Points I, III, VI, VII and VIII are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The convictions and sentences for terroristic threats (First Count) and kidnapping (Second Count) are affirmed. The remaining convictions are reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for new trial as to the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Counts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
