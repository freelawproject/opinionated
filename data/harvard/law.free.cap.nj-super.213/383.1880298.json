BARBARA J. GHEGAN, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b411-10\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b411-11\">Argued October 8, 1986</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APD\">Decided October 29, 1986.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b412-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Before Judges FURMAN and STERN.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-7\"><em>John H.

We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The Law Division Judge erroneously applied <em>State v. Kreyer, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202 (App.Div.1985). <em>Kreyer, </em>in his view, mandated a conviction based upon the .25% blood alcohol reading in defendant\u2019s breathalyzer test. He referred to <em>Kreyer </em>as imposing strict liability against a driver of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol reading of .10% or higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Dr. Lester, defendant\u2019s expert, testified that the videotape admitted in the Municipal Court trial showing defendant taking balance and coordination tests and reciting the alphabet at police headquarters was consistent with a blood alcohol reading of .05%, not .25%, and that no one registering .25% could have performed as well as defendant did. The State offered no expert testimony contradicting or questioning Dr. Lester. Recognizing that Dr. Lester\u2019s opinion raised an \u201cinteresting point\u201d as to the \u201capparent inconsistency of the videotape,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Law Division Judge nevertheless considered himself barred by <em>Kreyer </em>from reaching any result other than a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We disagree. <em>Kreyer </em>does not mandate that a .10% blood alcohol reading is irrebuttable. Rather, <em>Kreyer </em>should be limited to its holding that a .10% reading is sufficient to prove a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 <em>prima facie, </em>\u201cwithout regard to whether the operator\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Independently of the breathalyzer result, the Law Division judge did not base defendant\u2019s conviction upon the alternative ground of physical evidence of drunkenness, such as symptoms observed by the arresting police officers or failure of defendant to perform adequately on balance and coordination tests or in reciting the alphabet. As the judge below did, we have viewed the videotape of defendant at headquarters. The only obvious symptoms or results suggesting drunkenness are that defendant swayed slightly in the heal-to-toe test and omitted the letter \u201cv\u201d in her first, but not her second, recital of the alphabet. We cannot hold as a matter of law that the videotape is inconsistent with Dr. Lester\u2019s opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Reversed and remanded in accordance herewith for a retrial <em>de novo </em>on the Municipal Court transcript.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
