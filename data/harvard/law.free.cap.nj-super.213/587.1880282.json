After an examination by a staff psychologist at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Avenel (\u201cAvenel\u201d) his conduct was reported to have been characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior and therefore within the purview of the New Jersey Sex Offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-1 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-7. A private examination conducted at defendant\u2019s behest by Dr. Lawrence M. Eisenstein June 3, 1985, however, resulted in a recommended finding that defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201can isolated incident and not evidence of any compulsive behavioral trend.\u201d After a hearing held July 15, 1985, pursuant to <em>State v. Horne, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>372 (1970), to determine defendant\u2019s psychiatric status, he was sentenced July 25, 1985 to Avenel for a term of seven years, allowed 423 days credit for time already served and ordered to pay a $25 fine to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On this appeal, defendant contends that under the circumstances presented the trial court was without authority to impose the Avenel sentence since it had not advised him before accepting his guilty plea of the impact such a sentence would have on his parole opportunities. Thus, he seeks to be resentenced to state prison or granted leave to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Under an Avenel sentence the inmate does not become eligible for parole until \u201cit shall appear to the satisfaction of the State Parole Board, after recommendation by a special classification review board ... that such person is capable of making an acceptable social adjustment in the community.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-5. Under the ordinary sentence to the state prison system without an Avenel specification the flat parole eligibility term is one-third of the term of imprisonment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51; <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10A:71-3.2(c)2. Hence, if defendant had been sentenced to state prison, his flat eligibility would have arisen after 28 months. The State concedes that defendant\u2019s earliest eligibility, allowing for good time and work credits, would have come about after approximately 16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Rule 3:9-2 governs the entry of guilty pleas and provides that the court shall not accept such plea \u201cwithout first addressing the defendant personally and determining by inquiry of the defendant and others, in the court\u2019s discretion, that ... the plea is made voluntarily ... and with an understanding of ... the consequences of the plea.\u201d After the plea is entered, a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ant\u2019s \u201cclaim to be relieved of its consequences must be weighed against the strong interest of the State in its finality.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>353, 362 (1979). Rule 3:21-1 states that a \u201cmotion to withdraw a plea of guilty ... shall be made before sentencing, but the court may permit it to be made thereafter to correct a manifest injustice.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">The touchstone is basic fairness to the defendant: it is crucial \u201cthat the plea bargain has been fairly reached and that defendant\u2019s reasonable expectations drawn from the terms of the bargain have been fulfilled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 135 (App.Div.1981), quoting <em>State v. Taylor, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">While a plea bargain should be meticulously honored, <em>State v. Marzolf, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>167, 183 (1979), a defendant \u201cattacking a guilty plea has little to lose and his contentions should be assessed with great care and realism.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 365. \u201cReasonable expectations grounded in terms of the plea bargain\u201d should not be confused with \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d <em>State v. Marzolf, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">But in <em>State v. Kovack, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>476 (1982), the Supreme Court held that the imposition of a period of parole ineligibility, not explained at the time of taking the plea, lay beyond the scope of a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectations. Specifically, the Court stated at 483 the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">[W]hereas a trial court need not explain to a defendant what the parole opportunities are in general, the court must make certain that defendant has been made aware of any loss of parole opportunities <em>that may be a component of the </em>sentence. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The Court also noted that the sentencing court, not defense counsel, must assure itself that a defendant appreciates the possibility that a parole ineligibility period can be imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">We do not consider the <em>Kovack </em>rationale to be applicable herein since the Avenel sentence does not involve the loss of any parole opportunities. The Sex Offender Act merely leaves the matter of parole to the discretion of the Parole Board and the special classification review board without specifying the time of eligibility. Parole may be granted earlier than under an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ordinary prison term or later, depending on how the authorities exercise their discretion. If anything, defendant\u2019s parole opportunities were improved under the Avenel sentence since he became, in effect, immediately eligible for parole, whereas a prison sentence carries a prescribed period of ineligibility. Furthermore, the fact that an inmate under a prison sentence becomes eligible for parole by no means assures that he will receive favorable parole consideration. As in a sentence to Avenel, this is governed by the judgment of the State Parole Board. Moreover, even if an Avenel sentence were interpreted to entail a \u201closs of parole opportunities,\u201d <em>Kovack, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, this is clearly provided for by statute and does not constitute \u201ca component of the sentence,\u201d <em>ibid,., </em>comparable to the period of parole ineligibility imposed by the court in <em>Kovack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Finally, circumstances leave little doubt that defendant knew before sentencing that an Avenel sentence and its parole implications were a possibility. As noted, he was referred to Avenel for examination and diagnosis, he resorted to the unusual measure of engaging his own psychiatrist to support his position that he was not subject to treatment under the Sex Offender Act, he participated in a plenary hearing to determine his status under the Sex Offender Act and, finally, he voiced his objection to the Avenel feature of his sentence immediately after its imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erred, in deciding whether he was subject to the provisions of the Sex Offender Act, by acting on a mere preponderance of the evidence. Rather, he argues, that issue should have been decided beyond a reasonable doubt. His argument depends largely on the premise that a sentence to Avenel impacts more severely upon his liberty interest than does a sentence to state prison. <em>See, Specht v. Patterson, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>605, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>1209, 18 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 326 (1967); <em>People v. Burnick, </em>14 <em>Cal.3d </em>306, 121 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>488, 535 P.2d 352 (1975) <em>(en banc); </em>Anno., \u201cStandard of Proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Required under Statute Providing for Commitment of Sexual Offenders or Sexual Psychopaths,\u201d 96 <em>A.L.R.3d 840 </em>(1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3a provides that if the examination reveals that the offender\u2019s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior the court \u201cmay\u201d upon the recommendation of Avenel sentence the offender to that institution for treatment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3b specifies that sentences to Avenel shall be set, as with all criminal sentences involving sex offenses, \u201cin accordance with Chapters 43 and 44 of this code.\u201d Thus, the court is free to impose whatever sentence is appropriate to the crime. The only feature of the Avenel sentence claimed by defendant to result in greater curtailment of liberty than a prison sentence is the lack of a specific parole eligibility date. As we explained, however, this merely signifies that defendant is immediately eligible for parole and makes the penal consequences of an Avenel sentence less onerous, not more, than a prison sentence. We therefore conclude that the standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence was properly applied by the trial court in finding that defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Defendant also complains that the trial court erred in applying the Avenel staff psychologist\u2019s concept of \u201ccompulsive\u201d behavior rather than a legal standard formulated by the legislature. We discern no difference between the two. Nothing suggests that the lawmakers intended the term to be used in other than its ordinary and common meaning. Although the psychologist described the psychological mechanics of defendant\u2019s behavioral disorder in terms of \u201crelational sexual stress\u201d and difficulty in his hetero-sexual and hetero-social relationships, he concluded that the aberrant behavior was \u201ccompulsive.\u201d In its commonly accepted sense the term is understood to describe behavior resulting from \u201can irresistible impulse to perform some irrational act.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language </em>(World Publishing Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>1960). If the psychologist used the term to convey a meaning other than this, such an intention is not disclosed by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Defendant's final point is that the trial court erred in denying his motion for immediate transfer to Avenel. However, in view of the fact that he has now been in residence at Avenel for more than six months we find the issue to be moot. <em>Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Wojtycha, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>562, 566 (1967); <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Melko, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>524, 525 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
