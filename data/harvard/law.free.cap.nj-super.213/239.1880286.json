In order to render a complete determination of the matter, we exercised our original jurisdiction and assessed damages based upon the substantially uncontroverted facts before us. <em>R. </em>2:10-5. We determined that plaintiff\u2019s lost claim should be reduced by the one-third attorney\u2019s fee which had been quoted by defendant and which plaintiff had noted would have been charged by any other attorney. The parties, however, had not briefed the point, and our decision to reduce the award by the unearned attorney\u2019s fee was made without citation of New Jersey or any out-of-state authorities. Plaintiff, by substituted counsel, moved for a reconsideration of this portion of our earlier decision. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>granted plaintiffs motion, <em>R. </em>2:11-6, and now modify our earlier determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We find no New Jersey authority either mandating or precluding the deduction of the attorney\u2019s fees which would have been charged or assessed in the underlying claim, the loss of which is the subject of a legal malpractice action. General statements abound. Plaintiff must be put \u201cin as good a position as he would have been had the defendant kept his contract.\u201d <em>Lieberman v. Employers\u2019 Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>325, 341 (1980), quoting <em>Giumarra v. Harrington Heights, Inc., </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178,196 (App.Div.1954), aff\u2019d o.b. 18 <em>N.J. </em>548 (1955). A client \u201cmay recover for losses which are proximately caused by the attorney\u2019s negligence or malpractice.\u201d <em>Lieberman v. Employers\u2019Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 341; <em>Hoppe v. Ranzini, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158,164 (App.Div.1978). This issue, however, is whether a client is made whole when the attorney\u2019s fee he would have paid in the initial action is deducted and he then must pay a second fee to collect even the reduced amount in a suit against his original attorney. There is a split in authority as to whether there should be a deduction for the unearned attorney\u2019s fee. <em>Compare McGlone v. Lacey, </em>288 <em>F.Supp. </em>662 (D.S.D.1968); <em>Sitton v. Clements, </em>257 <em>F.Supp. </em>63 (E.D.Tenn. 1966), aff\u2019d 385 F.2d 869 (6th Cir.1967); <em>Childs v. Comstock, </em>69 <em>App.Div. </em>160, 74 <em>N.Y.S. </em>643 (App.Div.1902), apparently overruled by <em>Andrews v. Cain, infra, </em>all deducting the fee as a recovery of a sum originally unanticipated by plaintiff, <em>with Kane, Kane &amp; Kritzer, Inc. v. Altagen, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 36,165 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>534 (1980); <em>Togstad v. Vesely, Otto, Miller &amp; Keefe, </em>291 <em>N.W.2d </em>686 (Minn.1980); <em>Andrews v. Cain, </em>62 <em>A.D.</em>2d 612, 406 <em>N.Y.2d </em>168 (3d Dept.1978) <em>(but see Titsworth v. Mondo, </em>95 Misc.2d 233, 407 <em>N.Y.2d </em>793 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1978) deferring the issue to the trial court and noting the diversity of views); <em>Duncan v. Lord, </em>409 <em>F.Supp. </em>687 (E.D.Pa.1976); <em>Winter v. Brown, </em>365 A.2d 381 (D.C.Ct.App.1976); <em>Christy v. Saliterman, </em>288 <em>Minn. </em>144, 179 <em>N</em>.W.2d 288 (1970), all permitting recovery without deduction. Some of these cases have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>collected in <em>Meiselman, Attorney Malpractice: Law and Procedure, </em>(Lawyers Co-op. Pub. Co. 1980) at 59, where the author notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">There has been much debate as to whether the damages are reduced by what the attorneys fees would have been in the underlying action. The earlier cases hold that such fees are to be deducted since plaintiff was neither entitled to nor anticipating such recovery without a deduction for the attorneys fees. However, the recent cases holding otherwise have clearly indicated that the potential fee that the attorney would have recovered is not deductible. Thus, the client receives, at least in the eyes of some, a windfall benefit which the courts may feel is deserved by the client having to endure two lawsuits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Awarding of the full amount of the initial claim, undiminished by the unearned attorney\u2019s fees, in most cases will \u201cput a plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been had\u201d there been no malpractice. <em>Lieberman v. Employer\u2019s Ins. of Wausau, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 341. Relying upon the better-reasoned of the authorities just cited, we could find that \u201cthe damages sustained ... include the cost of additional litigation in order to recover on [plaintiff\u2019s] original claim ... [and such] additional attorney\u2019s fees cancel out any attorney\u2019s fees that [plaintiff] might have owed [defendant] had [he] successfully prosecuted the case ...\u201d <em>Winter v. Brown, supra, </em>365 A.2d at 386. As otherwise stated in <em>Christy v. Saliterman, supra, </em>the parties may well have assumed themselves \u201cthat the element of attorneys\u2019 fees, which plaintiff might have had to pay defendant had he successfully prosecuted the suit, was canceled out by the attorneys\u2019 fees plaintiff incurred in retaining counsel to establish that defendant failed to prosecute a recoverable action.\u201d 179 N.W.2d at 307. While not strictly constituting an award of an attorney\u2019s fee in the second suit, application of this theory has an equitable appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We prefer, however, to rest our decision upon the proposition that a negligent attorney in the appropriate case is not entitled to recover his legal fees. <em>See Kane, Kane &amp; Kritzer, Inc., v. Altagen, supra, </em>107 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>at 43-44,165 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 538, although the court there also applied the offset rationale. We prefer not to establish a hard and fast rule that in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>case can a negligent attorney be entitled to any portion of his legal fees. We can envision cases where on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis the efforts of a defendant attorney may have so benefited a plaintiff or other circumstances exist that it would be unfair to deny all or part of the offset. The general rule should be that the negligent attorney is to be considered precluded from recovering his attorney\u2019s fee and, therefore, the total amount of the initial recovery would be awardable. A court should determine on a case-by-case basis whether the general rule should be applied and may relax the rule and permit the deduction for the initial attorney\u2019s fee where the interests of justice so dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In the case before us there is no reason to relax the rule and we, therefore, modify our initial damages determination, 209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499, and award plaintiff $3,272.99, undiminished by the attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We remand this matter for the entry of a modified judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
