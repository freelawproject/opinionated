The remaining counts of indictment 348-3-84 and all of indictments 344-3-84, 345-3-84, and 1002-8-84 were dismissed as to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The negotiated disposition was explained as follows in a colloquy between the prosecutor and the court at the time of plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">MR. WEST: ... There are seven indictments\u2014correction, six indictments plus the accusation against Mr. Alevras. And as I understand the plea bargain, Mr. Alevras is prepared at this time to enter pleas of guilty to Counts 1, 10,13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 of Indictment 348-3-84; also Counts 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is the entire indictment of 347-3-84; Counts 1, 4, and 5 of Indictment 351-3-84; and Accusation 241-9-84.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">In exchange for those pleas of guilty, the State will move to dismiss the remaining counts of Indictment 348-3-84, Indictment 1002-84 in its entirety, Indictment 344-3-84 as it relates to this defendant, Indictment 345-3-84, in its entirety including the indictment against the codefendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">THE COURT: Which codefendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">MR. WEST: Mr. Alevras\u2019 wife. And the State will recommend the following: A total sentence of max 12 years with a minimum parole period of ineligibility of four years. That sentence is to run concurrent with the present sentence he is serving which, for the Court\u2019s knowledge, is a five year State prison sentence with a two-and-a-half year parole ineligibility sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">THE COURT: That\u2019s a Middlesex County sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">MR. WEST: That\u2019s correct. He began serving that approximately a month ago, if I\u2019m not mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-15\">MR. WEST: In addition, the State will recommend that the sentence imposed is to run concurrent with any other sentence he receives. For instance, he has some outstanding charges from New York. He has a possible parole violation out of the State of New York. We\u2019re recommending that the sentence in New Jersey run concurrently but not limited to the sentences he may get outside this jurisdiction. All right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-16\">And, finally, two other problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-17\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. Say that again. You want whatever the Court here imposes on these charges to run concurrent with a parole violation in New York, which has not been yet imposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-18\">MR. WEST: Our sentence will not be consecutive. Obviously, it can\u2019t be if it hasn\u2019t been done yet, but we\u2019re making a promise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">MR. WEST: That we\u2019re not going to ask for an extended term, which he might be eligible for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">Finally, we reserve the right to be heard at sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">There\u2019s one other promise that was made or an inducement to Mr. Alevras, and that is we\u2019re saying to him that he preserves the right to appeal a denial of a motion to dismiss the indictments and-complaint which was heard before Judge Kuhlthau on December 3, 1984. He preserves the right to appeal that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">At the plea hearing the defendant acknowledged his maximum exposure to all offenses and to the offenses for which he pled guilty, indicated his knowledge that pursuant the agreement he was exposed to 12 years with a minimum parole ineligibility period of four years and indicated a factual basis for each offense to which a guilty plea was entered. Indictment 347-3-84 alleged violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-5 (issuing a bad check) in counts one and three and violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-4 (theft by deception) in counts two and four. At the plea hearing the defendant gave the following factual basis with respect to those counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">MR. WEST: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">Okay, Indictment 347 has four counts. The first count indicates that between\u2014strike that\u2014on or about October 8, 1983, in the Township of Millbum, County of Essex, you issued a check dated October 5, 1983, drawn on an account of a John Libretto, at the Bank of the South located in Forest Park, Georgia, in the amount of $15,000, and when you gave the merchants, and when you gave the individuals that check, you knew it was a bad check. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">MR. WEST: Specifically, on or about that date you gave a $9,500 check payable to you and John Libretto to a Patricia Fine. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-14\">MR. WEST: Specifically, you gave to a person who worked for a jewelry store known as Kroupa Jewelers a check in the amount of $15,000, and you knew the check was bad. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">MR. WEST: And the second count says on or about the 14th day of October, 1983, also at Kroupa Jewelers in the Township of Millburn, this is at the Short Hills Mall\u2014correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-18\">MR. WEST: \u2014you obtained from Kroupa Jewelers property in excess of $500 with the use of that bad check. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>MR. WEST: And in effect, you got approximately $13,000 in jewelry and $2,000 in change. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">MR. WEST: Count three indicates that on or about October 17, 1983, in Edison, you uttered to an individual check number 101 dated September 30, 1983, drawn on the account of John Libretto at the Bank of the South in the amount of $9,500 knowing that the Bank of the South would not honor the check. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">MR. WEST: When you gave the cheek to Mrs. Fire, you knew the Bank of the South wouldn\u2019t honor the check. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">MR. WEST: And the last count of this indictment says by use of that check you obtained from Patricia and Robert Fire property in the amount of $500. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">MR. WEST: And, in fact, you obtained exactly $9,000. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">In direct response to a question from the court the defendant again acknowledged that he understood that he could be sentenced up to 12 years in custody and that he could be required \u201cto serve at least four years before being eligible for parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\">The court sentenced defendant on indictment 347-3-84 to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for three years on each of the four counts, each term \u201cto run consecutive to each other\u201d for an aggregate of twelve years, and the court further ordered that the defendant \u201cserve a minimum period of four years before he may become eligible for parole.\u201d The sentences on the four counts were made concurrent with the sentence defendant was then serving on another indictment for which he had been convicted and sentenced the month before (indictment 346-3-84). Further, the sentences on the four counts of indictment 347-3-84 were also made concurrent with concurrent three year custodial sentences simultaneously imposed on indictments 348-3-84 and 351-3-84 and on accusation 241-9-84. All the sentences imposed were also made concurrent \u201cwith violation of parole, if any.\u201d Hence, the court im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>posed an aggregate sentence of 12 years in custody with four years to be served before parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Defendant appeals and argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">POINT I WHERE FROM THE PLEA BARGAIN TERMS AND TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DEFENDANT\u2019S SUBJECTIVE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE MAXIMUM PAROLE INELIGIBILITY TERM WOULD BE FOUR YEARS, THE VALIDITY AND REASONABLENESS OF WHICH IS ACKNOWLEDGED AND CONFIRMED BY DEFENSE COUNSEL AND THE PROSECUTOR, IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL ERROR FOR THE COURT TO IMPOSE A PAROLE DISQUALIFIER EFFECTIVELY EXCEEDING FOUR YEARS. V, VI, XIV USCA. (This issue was raised in the court below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">POINT II WHERE AS PART OF A PLEA BARGAIN THE PROSECUTOR PROMISES TO RECOMMEND SPECIFIC SENTENCING PARAMETERS WHICH ARE ILLEGAL AND STATUTORILY PROHIBITED SUCH PROMISE IS DEEMED UNFULFILLABLE THEREBY RENDERING THE GUILTY PLEA FATALLY FLAWED AND CONSTITUTIONALLY INFIRM. V, VI, XIV USCA. (This issue was raised in the court below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">POINT III WHERE FACTUAL INTERDEPENDENCE OF INDICTMENT COUNTS IS SUCH THAT PROOF OF GUILT IN ONE IS CONDITION PRECEDENT TO PROVING GUILT IN OTHER, AND ALL COUNTS ARE DERIVED FROM AND CONTAINED WITHIN SINGLE CRIMINAL EPISODE, MERGER PRECLUDES CONSECUTIVE SENTENCING. V, XIV USCA. (This issue was not raised in the court below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">POINT IV WHERE DEFENDANT, A CORE CONSPIRATOR, HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY, DOUBLE JEOPARDY PROHIBITS SUBSEQUENT PROSECUTION FOR OFFENSES COMMITTED IN FURTHERANCE OF THE SINGLE CONSPIRACY OR COMMON PLAN. ALTERNATELY, THE HEARING IN THE COURT BELOW FAILED TO COMPLY WITH DUE PROCESS REQUIRING THE ISSUE BE REMANDED FOR REHEARING AND REDETERMINATION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">At the time of plea defendant preserved his right to challenge the denial of his motion to dismiss. <em>See R. </em>3:9-3(f). Given the pendency of the charges against him in Middlesex County, it would have been prudent for the prosecutor to have avoided the issue regarding statutory bars to prosecution for the offenses not moved simultaneously with indictment 346-3-84 by making an application under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8c for separate trials. <em>See also R. </em>3:15.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>We need not decide whether all the offenses could have been joined in a single indictment against defendant charging conspiracy or otherwise, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2b and c; <em>R. </em>3:7-6, because our review of the indictments indicates that each related to different times, places and events and that mandatory joinder was not required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8b. <em>Cf. State v. Gregory, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>510 (1975), where the Supreme Court concluded that a defendant could not, after trial for sale of a controlled dangerous substance, be tried for possession of that substance with intent to distribute on the day of the sale. <em>See also State v. Muscia, </em>206 <em>N.J. Super. </em>551 (App.Div.1985); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-10a(2), (3); <em>R. </em>3:15-1(b); <em>R. </em>3:15-2(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indictment 346-3-84, which had been disposed of by trial before the plea, related to a conspiracy with Daniel Petito, referred to in the indictment as \u201cJohn Doe A/K/A Anthony S. Russo.\u201d That conspiracy involved the use of forged checks stolen from Jenson and Mitchell, Inc. and events between May 21 and June 2, 1983. While indictment 344-3-84 included \u201cJohn Doe A/K/A Anthony S. Russo\u201d as a co-conspirator and while evidence at the trial of indictment 346-3-84 introduced through Daniel Petito referred to the role of Michale Bove, a co-defendant on some of the other indictments, all of the indictments disposed of by the plea and related dismissals involved events occurring after those alleged in indictment 346-3-84, involved different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>checks and accounts and involved different victims at different locations. The issue involved on this appeal is not whether mandatory joinder was required had any of the offenses disposed of by the plea been moved first. The question is only whether any of the offenses disposed by the plea had to be joined for purposes of trial with indictment 346-3-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Here, we find that neither the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8b nor the doctrines of double jeopardy, mandatory joinder or fundamental fairness requires dismissal of the charges which were the subject of the plea proceedings. <em>See e.g. Garrett v. United States, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>773, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2407, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985); <em>Jeffers v. United States, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>137, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977); <em>State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370-371 (1980); <em>State v. Gregory, supra; State v. Muscia, supra; State v. Godfrey, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 140-141 (App.Div.1976), certif. den. 73 <em>N.J. </em>40 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Defendant argues that the sentence imposed exceeds his reasonable expectations and that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered because of his expectation with respect to credits. He contends that the denial of credits for time spent in custody before sentencing on the offenses which are the subject of this appeal, but after sentencing on indictment 346-3-84, in effect increased the ineligibility term imposed by the number of days equivalent to the credits he expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We acknowledge that, at least in certain circumstances, a defendant\u2019s misunderstanding of credits may affect his understanding of the maximum exposure. Hence, a guilty plea based on this misunderstanding may fail to satisfy the constitutional requirement that a plea be voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly entered, at least where the denial of the expected credits results in the imposition of a sentence longer in duration than the maximum contemplated. <em>Cf. State v. Kovack, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>476 (1982); <em>State v. Jones, </em>184 <em>N.J. Super. </em>626 (Law Div.1982). This would be particularly true if a misunderstanding not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>clarified during the plea colloquy had an impact on his decision to enter the guilty plea. <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S.-, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>366, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We decline to decide the question of credits to which defendant was entitled under <em>R. </em>3:21-8 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5b(2) because the issue was not developed before the sentencing judge. In fact, the sentencing judge expressly reserved consideration of the subject and indicated that upon a proper showing with respect to the time spent in custody he would \u201cbe more than willing without any time limitation to make the appropriate modification.\u201d The judge also indicated that if defendant \u201ccan convince us I\u2019ll be more than willing to amend whatever sentence is imposed today to include that time period.\u201d We therefore conclude, particularly in light of our remand for resentencing for reasons to be considered <em>infra, </em>that all factual and legal issues concerning credits should be considered upon presentation to the sentencing judge and that he should give a statement of reasons, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, with respect to the subject of credits and its impact on the sentence and the voluntariness of the plea, if defendant renews his motion to withdraw the guilty pleas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">We note that the issue of merger was not raised at the time of sentencing on indictment 347-3-84. Generally, when a defendant simultaneously enters a guilty plea to more than one offense, the issue of merger is waived unless, in response to a question by the court or otherwise, the issue of merger is preserved. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8. As stated in <em>State v. Truglia, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>513, 523-524 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">We conclude that a holding of non-waiver of a claim of merger following guilty pleas is more consistent with our notions of fairness, limited however to the situation in which there has been no consideration given at the plea or sentencing hearing to the potential for merger of any of the offenses. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>have said, when, as in this case, the question of merger is first raised on appeal, not having been averted to below or subject to a specific waiver, defendant must establish the merger. There may, for example, be instances in which merger fairly leaps off the pages of the record, despite which it escaped the attention of everyone below. Under those circumstances a defendant should have little difficulty in bearing the burden that today\u2019s opinion casts upon him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Defendant acknowledges that the issue of merger was not raised below and that we must consider the subject under the test embodied in <em>Truglia. </em>The State, however, contends that there is no merger under the standard embodied in the Code of Criminal Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8a and d, and that the Code standard is that enunciated in the United States Supreme Court opinion of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 <em>U.S. </em>299, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>180, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>306 (1932). Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test when the same conduct violates two provisions of the criminal law, defendant can be convicted and sentenced for both if each requires proof of a fact which the other does not. The factual basis for the pleas and the elements of each offense indicate that there may well be no merger under the <em>Blockburger </em>test even though the obtaining of property in exchange for a bad check constituted a single transaction. <em>See State v. Fraction, </em>206 <em>N.J. Super. </em>532, 536-540 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">However, our Supreme Court has declined to hold that the <em>Blockburger </em>test controls the subject of merger in New Jersey. In <em>State v. Truglia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 520, the court expressly declined to \u201cprobe the nuances of whatever differences there may be between the <em>Blockburger, </em>Code, and <em>[State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>69 (1975) ] tests for merger\u201d because in <em>Truglia </em>the result would have been the sam\u00e9 under any test. However, the court did indicate that the <em>Blockburger </em>test \u201cmay suffer from a certain sterility,\u201d 97 <em>N.J. </em>at 521, and that the court has found it \u201cmore comfortable in recent years to eschew the \u2018mechanical application of formulas\u2019 to resolve merger questions, <em>[State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492 (1982) ] at 501, and to resort to the flexible approach of <em>Davis.\u201d </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 521.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">While counts 1 and 2 and counts 3 and 4 of indictment 347-3-84 allege different dates for the issuance of the checks and the resulting thefts, a review of the factual basis at the time of plea, the presentence report and the transcript of proceedings at sentence leaves no doubt that the property referred to in counts 2 and 4 of the indictment was obtained as a result of the issuance of the checks referred to in counts 1 and 3 respectively. In fact, the sentencing judge so indicated when he stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that counts 1 and 2 and counts 3 and 4 must merge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Just for example, I\u2019m just going to take, under the caption \u2018summary of offense,\u2019 on just one of the indictments, I think it\u2019s Indictment 347, and this typifies the kind of person we are dealing with here. It says, \u2018The Prosecutor\u2019s records indicate that a John Lebreto (phonetics) opened an account at the Bank of the South in Forrest Park, Georgia. Lebreto made out checks and gave them to this Defendant, the Defendant knowing that these checks would not be honored at the Bank of the South, successfully cashed the cheeks for $15,000 and another one for $9,500 in the following manner, takes one check, the $15,000 one and buys $12,000 worth of jewelry with it in Milbum, New Jersey,\u2019 and according to the Presentence Report, \u2018receives the cash change.\u2019 That\u2019s a fairly good return for a cheek that won\u2019t be honored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\u2018Then he takes the $9,500 check and uses it as a down payment to buy a Jaguar from Robert and Patricia Fryer (phonetics), then decides not to buy it and he receives from these people $9,000 and tells them to keep the $500 for their trouble.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">He ends up with $12,000 worth of jewelry, $3,000 plus $9,000 more, that\u2019s $12,000 in cash and that\u2019s only one incident. I think that\u2019s fairly sophisticated, and I think you\u2019ve injured alot of innocent people, Mr. Alevras, and I might say, sir, that you\u2019ve got as much justice and you\u2019ve got as much mercy, I think, than any Court in this nation can give you, and you have alot more problems in New York, and I don\u2019t know how many other states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>A new sentence, subject to the aggregate maximum originally imposed may be imposed on resentencing, provided that one can be so constructed consistent with the negotiated plea. The determination of merger, however, does not mean that the aggregate sentence must be affected. <em>See State v. Truglia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 524-525; <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Because we remand for resentencing, we do not have to address the legality of the sentences originally imposed. However, we do note that the court on indictment 347-3-84 imposed consecutive sentences at the bottom of the range for third degree crimes and simultaneously imposed ineligibility terms on each count. While some deference must be paid to the negotiated disposition, <em>see State v. Sainz, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Guzman, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 351-353 (Law Div.1985), here the imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the range required factfinding inconsistent with that necessary for the imposition of a period of parole ineligibility. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b; 2C:44-1f(1). <em>But see State v. Martelli, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 383 (App.Div.1985); <em>State v. Guzman, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 351-353. Moreover, the court imposed an aggregate parole ineligibility term on all four counts of indictment 347-3-84, as opposed to an ineligibility term on each count or specific term sentence imposed, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. <em>See also State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627 (1985), <em>cert. </em>den. \u2014 U.S.-, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986) concerning consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">It appears that the prosecutor and court below honored the negotiated recommendation concerning the New York parole violation. The prosecutor made certain communications to New York authorities and the court made its sentence concurrent to any parole violation. The New Jersey sentence was made concurrent with any New York parole violation irrespective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>what impact that may have in New York, and the New York courts cannot amend the New Jersey sentence. However, it appears that, as of the time defendant filed his brief on this appeal, the New York parole proceedings had not been completed. We have not been informed that the \u201cparole sticker\u201d or detainer against defendant has been withdrawn or that the parole violation charges have been dismissed by virtue of the New Jersey sentence. But <em>see Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>484 (1972). In any event, given the need for resentencing on indictment 347-3-84, and the possible application and impact of <em>State v. Truglia </em>and <em>State v. Rodriguez </em>on the sentences imposed with respect to the other indictments which were the subject of simultaneous sentencing, as well, the updated facts concerning the New York parole violation and its possible impact on this case should be considered at the proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Accordingly, the judgments under review are affirmed except that counts 1 and 3 and counts 2 and 4 of indictment 347-3-84 are merged and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The allegations in the various indictments and charges on different dates in close proximity must involve the same \u201cconduct\u201d <em>{see </em>the definition of \u201cconduct\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-14d) or \u201cepisode\u201d to require joinder under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8b and <em>R. </em>3:15-l(b) or the same \u201ctransaction\u201d to require joinder under the Rule. We do not have to decide whether the offenses <em>could </em>have been joined in a single indictment, <em>see R. </em>3:7-6, or whether the separate indictments <em>could </em>have been tried together by virtue of the ability to have joined them in a single proceeding. <em>See R. </em>3:15-l(a). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-10a bars subsequent prosecutions only where there was <em>required </em>joinder under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8 and in cases involving \u201cconduct\u201d where different proofs are not required. We read <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-10a(l) to bar only subsequent prosecutions for offenses for which defendant could have been convicted based on the charges for which he was actually tried or which were actually the subject of disposition. See II <em>Commentary, Final Report of Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>30-31 (1971). In light of our disposition we do not have to consider the impact of the charges relating to offenses committed outside of Middlesex County, given the \"venue\u201d requirement embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8b. <em>But see State v. James, </em>194 <em>N.J. Super. </em>362 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\">We recognize that, at present, there may be some dispute as to the proper interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5b(2). <em>See State v. Richardson, </em>208 <em>N.J. Super. </em>399 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The Code may not control because of the constitutional aspects of \u201cmerger.\u201d In the absence of legislative intent to the contrary with respect to multiple punishment stemming from the same prosecution, the <em>Blockburger </em>test governs \u201cmerger\u201d for purposes of the federal constitution. <em>See e.g., Garrett v. United States, supra. </em>However, while the New Jersey Constitution has been interpreted to include jeopardy principles which accord with the federal constitution, <em>see e.g., State v. Barnes, supra, </em>420 A.2d at 370, our Supreme Court has not interpreted our constitution to be coextensive with <em>Blockburger </em>because other constitutional values may be involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
