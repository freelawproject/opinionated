As the alleged murder occurred on June 29, 1983, the trial proceeded as a capital case. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b, -3c. The jury concluded that the death penalty was not warranted, and defendant was sentenced on the purposeful or knowing murder conviction to life imprisonment with a mandatory 30 years of parole ineligibility. Defendant was also sentenced to a concurrent ten year custodial term, with five years of parole ineligibility, on the aggravated arson conviction. The felony murder conviction was merged into the purposeful or knowing murder, and the arson conviction was merged into the aggravated arson. Defendant appeals and argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">POINT I THE COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN FAILING TO DISMISS COUNT I OF THE INDICTMENT CHARGING THE DEFENDANT WITH KNOWING AND PURPOSELY COMMITTED MURDER IN VIOLATION OF 2C:11-3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">POINT II PREJUDICIAL ERROR WAS CREATED IN THE COURT\u2019S CHARGE TO THE JURY REQUIRING THEM TO FIND SEVERE INTOXICATION BEFORE INTOXICATION DEFENSE COULD BE FOUND, AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE JUDGMENT WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">POINT III DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE TO A MINIMUM TERM OF 30 YEARS AS \u2018REQUIRED\u2019 BY <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3(b) WAS AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION BY THE TRIAL JUDGE, AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL DEPRIVATION OF HIS RIGHTS CONTRARY TO THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE 1, PARAGRAPH 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>POINT IV THE STATE FAILED TO MEET ITS HEAVY BURDEN WITH RESPECT TO DEFENDANT MARTIN\u2019S INTELLIGENT WAIVER OF HIS <em>MIRANDA </em>RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">POINT V COURT\u2019S REMOVAL OF JUROR FOR CAUSE WHO EXPRESSED GOOD FAITH EMOTIONAL CONCERNS AS TO IMPOSITION OF DEATH PENALTY VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S 6th AND 14th AMENDMENT RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">A recital of the facts is required in order to understand the first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Shortly before midnight on June 29, 1983, defendant Daniel Louis Martin started a fire at an apartment located at 69 Church Street in Keansburg. The fire was commenced after defendant and some friends were asked to leave a party being given at the apartment by the hostess Lois Baker. The fire quickly consumed the building and caused the death of Barbara Quartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Defendant went to the party with five others from Keyport including Paul Wade and \u201ca girl named Tracy,\u201d a juvenile 13 or 14 years of age. According to one attendee, \u201c[W]hen everybody walked in I was a little shocked to see Danny there because him and Lois didn\u2019t get along from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The group arrived at the party between 8:30 and 10:00 p.m. Subsequently, an argument broke out between Wade and one of the other guests, Mike Fitzpatrick. The argument concerned some comments or actions Wade directed towards Fitzpatrick\u2019s girlfriend, Barbara Quartz. The argument between the two broke into a wrestling match which was broken up by the other guests. Ms. Baker then asked Fitzpatrick to leave, which he did, and the party continued. Shortly thereafter, an argument erupted between Baker and Wade. According to Baker, \u201cI was arguing with Paul Wade because he brought a 13-year old girl up to my house and I don\u2019t want drinking in my house and I asked him to either tell her to stop drinking or leave.\u201d Baker continued, \u201cWell, he didn\u2019t do it, so I decided to tell them all to leave.\u201d Thus, \u201c[ejverybody who came in the car from Keyport\u201d was asked to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">It was agreed to by all the witnesses, including Ms. Baker, that defendant was not himself involved in any arguments with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>anyone either during the party or after the group was asked to leave. Defendant left the apartment with Wade.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">According to defendant, as he and Wade left the apartment, they vandalized what they thought was Fitzpatrick\u2019s motorcycle which was parked outside. They flattened the tires, slashed the seat and removed the mirrors. Defendant then took the mirrors and carried them back up the stairs to the Baker apartment and placed them outside the front door, apparently for Ms. Baker to find.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">According to defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">When I was walking down the steps, before I walked down the steps I got outside. Everybody was left except me and Paul Wade left and walked down the steps, and it was a paper bag by the\u2014in the hallway, somewhere in the hallway, I think by Lois Baker\u2019s door. I picked up the bag and I walked down the steps with it. I was just, you know, throwing it around making a mess, you know, and I set it down and I lit up a cigarette. And the match\u2014I lit the paper bag on fire, you know, \u2019cause I thought maybe it would bum up the garbage, you know, not to spread or anything, just make, like make a mess of the bottom of the landing. And then, then I left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Defendant subsequently admitted that he didn\u2019t endeavor to put the fire out because \u201cI thought it would go out. It was only the paper bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Defendant then left the scene. As he entered a waiting car, he told his friends that he \u201clit a fire.\u201d Defendant made a similar admission during the police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The fire started by defendant burned with intensity. There was no contest at trial that Barbara Quartz, who had been drinking prior to falling asleep on the living room floor of the Baker apartment, was unable to escape the blaze and died in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Investigator Frederick Dispensiere of the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office conducted an investigation of the fire and concluded that it was deliberately set at some point between the ground floor and second floor. He also suspected that an accelerant had been used and sent wood samples from the fire site to the State Police laboratory to test for the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>volatiles. Gas chromotography tests performed on these wood samples revealed the presence of kerosene.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The investigator also testified that he had found what he believed were \u201cpour patterns,\u201d which indicated the use of an accelerant, on the stairway between the first and second levels of the building which had \u201cmasonry construction\u201d on the first floor and \u201cwood-framed construction\u201d on the upper levels. Thus, the investigator concluded that the fire was set \u201c[i]n the stairwell between the ground floor and Level Two\u201d and that it \u201cwas deliberately set.\u201d According to the investigator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">I formed that opinion on again examination of the scene in detail, interviews of the responding fire fighters, police officers and witnesses, occupants and also through the systematic elimination of everything in the building which could have accidentally or naturally caused the fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">He also concluded that an accelerant was used</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhQ\">... based on several factors: The degree of damage in the hallway, the absence of anything in that hallway combustible which could have created that much of a volume of fire, the depth of char, the rate at which the fire spread and the direction that it spread also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u201cPour patterns\u201d were also found by Daniel Slowick, an expert hired by the building owner\u2019s insurance carrier, who testified for the State. According to Slowick, \u201cit was a deliberately set fire\u201d with its origin \u201cin the stairwell\u201d at a point which could not be precisely determined. He concluded that \u201cit was apparent that there had been an accelerated fire in the building\u201d and that a \u201cflammable or combustible liquid\u201d had been used to accelerate the fire. Another expert for the State, Stephen Andrews of the New Jersey State Police laboratory concluded, based on evaluation of damaged items from the fire, that \u201cthe volutiles [sic] were characteristic of petroleum distillates, in this case similar to kerosene.\u201d Moreover, an analysis by Jimmy Pau, a chemist with the Mercury Research Laboratory, similarly revealed that kerosene had been used in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Ms. Baker testified that prior to the fire, a friend had purchased a half gallon of kerosene for her, which she used to treat her children\u2019s lice problem. She stored what remained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the kerosene in a plastic milk container which she hid from her children in a corner of the hallway outside her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On July 6, 1983 Investigator Dispensiere returned to the apartment building and discovered a melted, plastic container, believed to be a Clorox bottle on the third floor stairwell landing of the building. This container the odor of a flammable liquid. Dispensiere stated that this container was not found either by himself or by the six or eight others who conducted the initial investigation. Dispensiere admitted that the container was not discovered until after Ms. Baker told the police about its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Investigator Dispensiere also concluded that the door to the Baker apartment and the building\u2019s exterior door, leading to the outside from the bottom of the staircase, were open during the fire. According to defendant\u2019s expert, Ralph Snavely, the fact that the doors were open created a chimney effect resulting in a fire which spread quickly. Mr. Snavely also opined that the astroturf artifical carpeting, which covered the building\u2019s stairwell, had a petroleum rubber based backing which contributed to the spread of the fire. However, Mr. Slowick was of the view that astroturf burned slowly and was self-extinguishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In the trial court, at the end of the State\u2019s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on the purposeful or knowing murder count. He argued that there was insufficient evidence to submit that charge to the jury. Defendant\u2019s motion was denied, and on this appeal he challenges that denial. Defendant contends that his actions cannot be deemed to constitute purposeful or knowing conduct sufficient to sustain a murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\u201cMurder\u201d occurs when the actor \u201cpurposely\u201d or \u201cknowingly\u201d \u201ccauses death or serious bodily injury resulting in death.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(1), (2). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(1) defines purposeful conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. A person acts purposely with respect to attendant circumstances if he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist. 'With purpose,\u2019 'designed,\u2019 'with design' or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">A person acts knowingly with respect to the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances if he is aware that his conduct is of that nature, or that such circumstances exist, or he is aware of a high probability of their existence. A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his conduct if he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result. \u2018Knowing,\u2019 'with knowledge\u2019 or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Defendant contends that given <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2) it must be \u201cpractically certain\u201d that his conduct will result in death. We disagree. A murder conviction based on \u201cknowing\u201d conduct can result from conduct which is practically certain to cause serious bodily injury when death is a result of the injury caused. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-3b. Similarly, a murder conviction based <em>on </em>\u201cpurposeful\u201d conduct can result from the purposeful causing of serious bodily injury when death is a result of the injury caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Upon a motion for judgment of acquittal the State is entitled to all reasonable and legitimate inferences from the evidence for purposes of determining whether a reasonable jury could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Martinez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>567, 571-572 (1984); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454 (1967). As stated by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Martinez:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">In <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454 (1967), we held that the test to be applied by the trial court in determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial, and giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>[Id. </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 459].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">This standard is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>307, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2781, 2789, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>560, reh. den., 444 <em>U.S. </em>890, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>195, 62 L.Ed.2d 126 (1979). In that case, the Supreme Court stated that the appellate .standard of reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to support a criminal conviction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACt\">must be not simply to determine whether the jury was properly instructed, but to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But this inquiry does not require a court to \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>Woodby v. INS, </em>385 <em>U.S. </em>[276] at 282, 17 L.Ed.2d 362, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>483 [486] (emphasis added). Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Johnson v. Louisiana, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>[356] at 362, 32 L.Ed.26.152, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620 [1624]. This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. <em>[Id. </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>at 318-19, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d at 573],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">[ 97 <em>N.J. </em>at 571-572 ],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Our analysis of the record is governed by the same standard irrespective of whether the evidence is circumstantial or direct, <em>see State v. Mayberry, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>413, 437 (1968), <em>cert. den. </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>1043, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 21 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>593 (1969), and the veracity of each inference\u2014including one related to culpability or intent\u2014need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the jury to draw the inference. <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 592 (1979); <em>State v. DiRienzo, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>360, 376 (1969). Circumstantial evidence need not preclude every other hypothesis in order to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Mayberry, supra, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>at 436. <em>See also State v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 49 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The definition of purposeful and knowing conduct as embodied in the Code is that recommended by the <em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission. </em>As stated in the commentary to the Commission Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">2. The approach of the Code is based on the view that it is necessary for clear analysis that the question of the kind of liability required to establish the commission of an offense be faced squarely with respect to each material element of the crime. See \u00a7 2C:1-13i. The answer may, of course, be the same in many cases as to each such element. This approach is in accord with the modem New Jersey cases. In a murder case the prosecution must normally prove an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to establish the required culpability with respect to the element of the crime involving the result of the defendant\u2019s conduct____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">[II <em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission </em>(1971) at 4011)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The jury apparently rejected defendant\u2019s contention that no accelerant was used. It could well have found that defendant set the fire with an accelerant and did so with the requisite purposeful or knowing conduct so as to cause serious bodily injury which resulted in Ms. Quartz\u2019s death. The jury could have concluded that, having just been asked to leave the party by Ms. Baker, defendant set a fire on the stairwell leading to Ms. Baker\u2019s third floor apartment (or between her apartment and the first floor exit). Given the wooden structure, the number of people in the apartment and the fact that people including Ms. Quartz had been drinking therein, we cannot conclude that the reasonable inferences do not support a conviction of defendant for \u201cpurposely\u201d or \u201cknowingly\u201d causing serious bodily injury which resulted in death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">When defendant made his motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, the trial judge denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">What is a felony murder can also be a knowing or purposeful murder. It is clear to me that under those definitions of knowing and purposeful, again we are talking about whether a jury should pass upon this issue, whether there is sufficient evidence for a jury to pass upon the issue, it is clear to me that if the jury finds that the defendant specifically directed his fire at a group of people with the object in his mind, if you will, of causing serious bodily injury to those people, then it can in fact be knowing and purposeful\u2014knowing or purposeful murder. If he directs his fire, just as he directs his gun or he directs his knife</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>One, was it the object of what he was doing to cause serious bodily injury to that group of people upstairs? That\u2019s a jury question. I think there is sufficient proof to indicate that by means of the instrument used.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Two, did he direct his fire at those people? That\u2019s something the jury can decide by virtue of the fact that it happened right after he got thrown out of the place and came back and said he lit a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">This concept of knowledge, a person acts knowingly with respect to the result of his. conduct if he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In this Court\u2019s opinion from the testimony that I have heard a jury could clearly find that he acted knowingly when he set that fire, knowing that result was practically certain, his conduct in setting the fire would cause the result, that is serious bodily injury to someone, and it turned out to be death.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">We keep talking about did he act with knowledge that he would cause death. Well, it\u2019s more than that. Did he act with knowledge that he would cause death or serious bodily injury to this identifiable victim or victims?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">A jury could say that maybe he didn\u2019t want to cause the death, but by using the instrument that he did use and the manner in which he used it and with the requisite state of mind, that is, \u2018I\u2019m going to get those people,\u2019 if they find that that is so and the instrument used is a fire with accelerants involved in it, they could say, \u2018Well, it is practically certain he must have acted, with a certain knowledge and it is practically certain that lighting that thing would cause the result that did result, that is the death of that girl or certainly serious bodily injury to somebody.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">It is not necessary that the State presents sufficient evidence to show he wanted to cause death. They can also show he wanted to cause serious bodily injury which ended up resulting in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Whether or not it was serious bodily injury that he wanted to cause, those are jury questions. I think they are traditionally and inherently jury questions and I am going to present the issue to the jury and let them decide. They may find that is not what he had in mind. He may not have intended to do that. They may believe that he did not intend it. Well, that\u2019s for them to decide.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">We agree with the judge\u2019s analysis and affirm the purposeful or knowing murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">Defendant argues that the court\u2019s instructions on intoxication incorrectly state the law, that the court incorrectly allocated the burden of proof and, further, that the statute <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>unconstitutionally shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to prove intoxication by clear and convincing evidence. Defendant\u2019s own testimony was the basis for the intoxication \u201cdefense.\u201d He stated that he had \u201c[a]bout four beers\u201d at a friend\u2019s house before going to the party and \u201c[a]bout three or four bottles of beer and a couple shots of Southern Comfort\u201d while there.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8d was amended after the date of this offense. It now provides, as it did at the time of trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">Intoxication which (1) is not self-induced or (2) is pathological is an affirmative defense if by reason of such intoxication the actor at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. Intoxication under this subsection must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8d concerns pathological intoxication and is not applicable to this case which concerns, at the most, voluntary intoxication in the absence of proof of any pathological condition. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8b. Moreover, the court properly placed the burden on the State to disprove voluntary intoxication and to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted \u201cknowingly or purposely\u201d in order to convict for an offense requiring purposeful or knowing conduct. <em>See e.g., State v. Galiyano, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393 (App.Div.1981), certif. den. 87 <em>N.J. </em>424 (1981); <em>State v. Murphy, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 74-75 (Law Div.1982). <em>See also State v. Polk, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>539, 540-541 (1979) (Pashman, J. concurring).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the jury was charged in terms of the distinction between purposeful or knowing conduct and reckless conduct, and was expressly advised that voluntary intoxication excused purposeful or knowing culpability, but not reckless conduct. As pointed out in <em>State v. Stasio, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>467, 482 (1979), intoxication \u201ccould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>reduce murder to manslaughter\u201d because of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8b which provides that \u201cWhen recklessness establishes an element of the offense, if the actor, due to self-induced intoxication, is unaware of a risk of which he would have been aware had he been sober, such unawareness is immaterial.\u201d <em>See also State v. Cameron, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>42 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Nevertheless, the defendant argues that the court incorrectly instructed the jury that it had to find that the defendant\u2019s intoxication was \u201cso severe as to result in a prostration of mental faculties.\u201d The court advised the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">If you find that at the time the defendant is alleged to have committed the offenses he was so overcome by the ingestion of alcohol that he was unable to act with purpose, that he was unable to act with knowledge, then you cannot find the defendant guilty of those offenses where purpose or knowledge are required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">However, if you find that even though he was under the influence of alcohol he was still able to act with purpose or to act with knowledge, then intoxication will not be a defense to those crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">The influence of alcohol must be such as to eliminate the element of purpose and/or knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">Whether such is the case is for you to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">Now, it is very important that you discriminate between the state of mind in which the individual is clearly excited or depressed or feels uninhibited, feels bold or feels fearless or the like by intoxicating liquor and yet is still capable of performing the specific mental acts, and that mental condition where the alcohol has so prostrated the person\u2019s faculties as to make him incapable of performing such mental acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Now, it is only with the latter that the defense of intoxication is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">In <em>State v. Stasio, supra, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>at 488, Justice Handler, in his concurring opinion, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">The fear of condoning criminals, who are also drunks, can be addressed, I respectfully suggest, by imposing a heavy burden of proof upon defendants to show a degree of intoxication capable of prostrating the senses. Drunkenness which does not have this effect does not diminish responsibility and should not serve to excuse criminality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">In <em>State v. Cameron, supra, </em>our Supreme Court has recently emphasized that \u201cprostration of faculties\u201d is a prerequisite to presentation of the intoxication issue to the jury. 104 <em>N.J. </em>at 53-56. Given <em>Cameron, </em>it is now clear that the judge\u2019s charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>properly instructed the jury regarding the requisite condition before voluntary intoxication can be found to affect the mental state of purposeful or knowing conduct. <em>See State v. Cameron, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 50-53. <em>See also State v. Merlino, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 151 (App.Div.1985), certif. den., 103 <em>N.J. </em>460 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Taking the charge as a whole, <em>see State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422 (1973), we find no reversible error in the charge and certainly cannot conclude that there was \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Experienced defense counsel, who made no relevant requests for instructions, stated to the court immediately after the instructions that he found them \u201c[a] good charge. No objections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Defendant argues that the sentencing judge misapplied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b due to a misconception that the statute required him to sentence the defendant to a minimum of 30 years without parole eligibility. Defendant asserts that, in fact, there was no such minimum term required since the statute at the time of this offense provided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axy\"><em>Murder is a crime of the first degree </em>but a person convicted of murder <em>may </em>be sentenced, except as provided in subsection c. of this section, by the court to a term of 30 years, during which the person shall not be eligible for parole or to a specific term of years which shall be between 30 years and life imprisonment of which the person shall serve 30 years before being eligible for parole. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Defendant argues that the court could have sentenced him as a first degree offender to a term of between 10 and 20 years. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(l). However, defendant\u2019s position ignores the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Prior to August 6, 1982, the sentence for murder, although a crime of the first degree, was for a term of 30 years with 15 years to be served before parole eligibility or \u201cas in a crime of the first degree except that the maximum term for such a crime of the first degree shall be 30 years.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b. Moreover, prior to August 6,1982 the court could automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>impose a sentence for murder of between 30 years and life imprisonment, with up to one-half of the term or 25 years on a life sentence, to be served before parole eligibility. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7a(l) deleted by <em>L. </em>1982, <em>c. </em>111 \u00a7 2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7b; <em>State v. Maguire, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>508 (1980). The Legislature\u2019s adoption of the death penalty statute in 1982, <em>L. </em>1982, <em>c. </em>111, \u00a7 1, cannot be understood to reduce the authorized maximum in murder cases where the death penalty was not imposed. Nor could the 1982 amendment be understood to have permitted a sentence of 10 to 20 years without even the ability to impose the previously authorized maximum of 10 to 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In <em>State v. Biegenwald, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>630, 635, opinion clarified, 97 <em>N.J. </em>666 (1984), the Supreme Court noted the authorized sentences for murder as of the date of this offense in 1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">As a result of the Code amendments establishing death as a possible penalty for murder (effective August 6, 1982), there are now three sentencing options: (1) death; (2) a sentence of thirty years without parole; (3) a sentence between thirty years and life, with a mandatory minimum thirty year term of parole ineligibility. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\"><em>See also State v. Johnson, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 344 (App.Div. 1985). Moreover, as stated in <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 274 n. 4 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b] was amended, effective August 6, 1982, to set forth a <em>minimum </em>sentence of thirty years without parole eligibility for murder, [emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Finally, we note that the word \u201cmay\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b was amended to \u201cshall\u201d by <em>L. </em>1985, <em>c. </em>178, \u00a7 2, thus evidencing legislative intent to have a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years, with 30 years to be served without parole eligibility, upon conviction for murder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We view this amendment as a clarification of the 1982 amendment given the legislative histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ry surrounding that legislation. <em>Cf. State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 374 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">At oral argument defendant abandoned his contention concerning the jury selection process in light of <em>Lockhart v. McCree, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>-, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1758, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>137 (1986) and <em>State v. Cohen, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>544 (App.Div.1986). Those cases, upholding the death qualification process in a capital case, however, presumed that juries would be selected without improper excuse of jurors who could perform their duty notwithstanding objections to capital punishment. <em>See Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>412, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985); <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>510, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1770, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>776 (1968). We are willing to accept for purposes of this appeal defendant\u2019s abandonment of the contention that a juror was improperly excused (and that a \u201cconviction prone\u201d jury resulted) because of prior New Jersey authority modifying the death penalty to life imprisonment where a possible violation of <em>Witherspoon </em>was involved. <em>See Funicello v. New Jersey, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>948, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2278, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>859 (1971), where the United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>summarily reversed and remanded the case \u201cto the Supreme Court of New Jersey for further proceedings,\u201d citing <em>Witherspoon </em>and its progeny as well as <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>570, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1209, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>138 (1968). <em>See also State v. Funicello, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>60 (1972), <em>cert. </em>den., 408 <em>U.S. </em>942, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2849, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>766 (1972), in which our Supreme Court subsequently set aside the death penalty and sentenced defendants \u201cto life imprisonment\u201d, 60 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, and further stated that \u201c[n]o such order shall delay or affect any appeal with respect to guilt.\u201d 60 <em>N.J. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">We find that defendant\u2019s other arguments including the 23 points raised in his <em>pro se </em>brief are clearly without merit and do not warrant extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and the sentences imposed are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The jury was expressly charged as to the meaning of acting \"recklessly\u201d and on the lesser included offenses of aggravated manslaughter and manslaughter.

As a matter of federal constitutional law, however, a defendant may be put to death for felony murder only if he kills, attempts or intends to kill or employs the lethal force. Such a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>must be made irrespective of the requirement of the statute, but the absence of such a statutory requirement does not render the statute unconstitutional. <em>See Cabana v. Bullock, </em>474 U.S.-, 106 <em>S.Ct. 689, 88 L.Ed.2d </em>704 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-11\">As <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8d is not involved in this case, we need not consider the impact of the amendment which took effect after the date of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-12\">This very issue was recently reserved by the Supreme Court in <em>State v.
