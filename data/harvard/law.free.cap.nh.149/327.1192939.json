Gabusi, appeals her conviction in the Superior Court <em>(Smith, </em>J.) for one count of theft by deception and two counts of theft by unauthorized taking or transfer. The defendant argues that the trial court erred in several hearsay rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">The record supports the following facts. The defendant was the younger sister of Raymond and Ruth Laveron, elderly siblings who lived together in a remote home in Milan. For many years, Raymond had taken care of Ruth, who was deaf and legally blind. In June of 1997, however, Raymond learned that he had terminal liver cancer and would not live much longer. On July 16, 1997, the defendant arrived in New Hampshire to help Raymond with his affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">Prior to the defendant\u2019s arrival, Raymond held over $200,000 in various bank accounts. He had executed a will in 1988 that placed all of his assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>in trust for the benefit of Ruth during her life, and left the remainder to the defendant. While dying of cancer, Raymond told three witnesses that he intended to care for Ruth for the rest of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The first of these witnesses, Josee Bourbeau, was Ruth\u2019s doctor. She testified that she understood Raymond wanted Ruth to be placed in the most comfortable setting possible, where she would be pampered and cared for, as opposed to a regular nursing home. When Dr. Bourbeau asked Raymond whether the defendant shared this goal, he responded, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem... I want her to be in good hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The second witness, attorney Thomas Cote, discussed estate planning with Raymond. During their initial phone conversation, Raymond told Cote that caring for Ruth was his primary goal. Cote testified that \u201c[Raymond] did not want State assistance for his sister. He made it very clear that he had the funds and those were going to be provided for his sister Ruth during her lifetime and that whatever was left would go to Lorraine.\u201d At a subsequent meeting with Raymond and the defendant, Cote advised them both that the 1988 will would effectively carry out Raymond\u2019s plans. The defendant, however, suggested that Raymond leave all of his money to her, stating that she would take care of Ruth\u2019s needs. Cote recommended against this option because it was \u201ca riskier way of handling his estate and also in carrying out his wishes after his death.\u201d The meeting adjourned without a decision because Raymond became tired, and had to rest. Cote was never able to speak with Raymond again.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The third witness, social worker Jane Gilligan, spoke with Raymond while completing a precautionary application for State financial assistance for Ruth\u2019s benefit. Raymond told Gilligan that he \u201cwanted what was best for Ruth,\u201d that he planned to provide for her in the future, and that he did not intend for her to rely upon State assistance. He also stated that Thomas Cote was \u201cgetting his affairs in order so that Ruth would be completely provided for upon his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">On about July 21,1997, the defendant contacted Tyler Harwell, another attorney. She told Harwell that both her brother and sister wished to execute new wills leaving their property entirely to her, without any provision for the care of Ruth. She also told Harwell that both siblings wished to execute durable powers of attorney that appointed her as the attorney in fact. Harwell arrived in Milan a few days later to meet with Raymond and Ruth, having already drafted Raymond\u2019s will according to the defendant\u2019s instructions. Harwell claims to have explained the documents to Raymond and Ruth, but never asked Raymond any questions about why he wished to change his testamentary plans. On July 24, Harwell returned with witnesses, and Raymond and Ruth signed the wills and powers of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Almost immediately thereafter, the defendant began to transfer Raymond\u2019s and Ruth\u2019s assets into her own accounts. She transferred Raymond\u2019s money, along with some $47,000 that Ruth had in a joint account (the Berlin City account) with her brother, into a joint account she established in her name and Raymond\u2019s name. The defendant also moved Ruth into a private, assisted-living center on August 7th.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Raymond died on August 18, 1997. The defendant subsequently wrote herself checks totaling $290,000 from the joint account she had held with him. She continued to pay Ruth\u2019s bills for medication and boarding expenses until November of 1997. At that Time, she wrote Ruth\u2019s pharmacist that she would not pay for any more medication, and informed the assisted living center that she wanted to move Ruth out of the center and into a large nursing home that accepted Medicaid. Although the defendant still held thousands of dollars of Ruth\u2019s money, the defendant filled out a Medicaid application in which she represented that Ruth had no funds of her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The defendant\u2019s behavior aroused the suspicion of Gilligan, who helped Ruth obtain legal assistance. Ruth revoked the power of attorney in December of 1997, and contested the validity of Raymond\u2019s new will. The probate court found the will was invalid because of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In 1999, the State charged the defendant with one count of theft by deception, RSA 637:4 (1996), for taking Raymond\u2019s money by creating a false impression that she intended to use the money for the benefit and care of Ruth, and two counts of theft by unauthorized taking, RSA 637:3 (1996), for depriving Ruth of her money by means of the power of attorney. At trial, the defendant maintained that she had no intent to steal from either sibling. She testified that she believed Raymond\u2019s new will was valid and that he wished her to have all of his money free of any obligation to care for Ruth. The defendant also claimed to be unaware that the joint account between Raymond and Ruth held Ruth\u2019s money. She claimed to have Raymond\u2019s permission to execute the transactions from that account and from others owned by Raymond.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">After a six-day trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts. The court sentenced her to a term of five to ten years in prison, suspending one and one-half years of the minimum and four years of the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">On appeal, the defendant raises three evidentiary issues. First, she argues that the statements Raymond made to the three witnesses regarding his intention to care for Ruth were inadmissible hearsay. Second, she argues that the admission of these statements violated the Confrontation Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. Finally, she argues that the court erred in invoking the rule against hearsay to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>her from testifying about statements Raymond made to her regarding the ownership of the Berlin City account.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 801(c). Hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls within a recognized exception. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 802. We will affirm a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude hearsay evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Gaffney, </em>147 N.H. 550, 556 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The defendant first argues that the testimony of Dr. Josee Bourbeau, Thomas Cote, and Jane Gilligan regarding Raymond\u2019s intentions to care for his sister was inadmissible hearsay. The trial court admitted these statements under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d hearsay exception, which encompasses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">statements of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">N.H. R. Ev. 803(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Statements falling under this exception may be used \u201cto show the occurrence of subsequent events.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 803 Reporter\u2019s Notes; <em>see Fissette v. Railroad, </em>98 N.H. 136, 143 (1953). In <em>Fissette, </em>we held that a decedent\u2019s hearsay statement that \u201cI will drive the Ford up to Summer Street and if the train hasn\u2019t gone I will hear it\u201d was admissible to show that the decedent subsequently approached the railroad and listened for the train. <em>Fissette, </em>98 N.H. at 142-43; <em>accord Mutual Life Insurance v. Hillmon, </em>145 U.S. 285, 295-96 (1892). Likewise, Raymond\u2019s repeated statements that he intended to care for his sister after his death were admissible to show that his subsequent execution of a will that made no such provision, and subsequent execution of a power of attorney, were the products of deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The defendant argues that the statements were admitted not to show Raymond\u2019s state of mind, but instead to prove \u201cthe truth of his belief that [the defendant] would use his money to care for [Ruth].\u201d This objection apparently tracks the language of Rule 803(3), which forbids the use of a \u201cstatement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed\u201d in most circumstances. In this case, however, the \u201ctruth\u201d of Raymond\u2019s post-mortem plans was not at issue. Rather, the relevance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>statements stems from Raymond\u2019s <em>belief </em>that they would be carried out, which in turn implies that the defendant created a false impression to obtain Raymond\u2019s money. We therefore hold that the trial court did not err in finding the statements were admissible under Rule 803(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Next, the defendant argues that these statements violated her rights under the Confrontation Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. Because the Federal Confrontation Clause affords no greater protection than the State Confrontation Clause, we need only undertake a State analysis, reviewing federal cases for guidance. <em>See State v. Spaulding, </em>147 N.H. 583, 588 (2002); <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 124-25 (1999) (stating federal standard for Confrontation Clause regarding admission of hearsay).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Hearsay statements ordinarily do not violate a defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses so long as they bear \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>135 N.H. 655, 662 (1992), or fall within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>State v. Bader, </em>148 N.H. 265, 277 (2002); <em>but see State v. Christiansen, </em>135 N.H. 583, 586 (1992) (blood test report admitted without live testimony constitutes \u201ctrial by certificate and affidavit\u201d and violates Confrontation Clause). We find that Raymond\u2019s statements possessed sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. While many of his statements were responses to questions, Raymond\u2019s answers were spontaneous in the sense that they described his contemporaneous state of mind. <em>Cf Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 664 (holding answer \u201cspontaneously volunteered in response to a question that was neither leading nor suggestive\u201d is a factor establishing reliability of statement against penal interest). Likewise, it is highly unlikely that Raymond would deliberately misrepresent his estate plans to three different persons attempting to help him carry out his wishes in the last months of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The defendant\u2019s constitutional objections to the hearsay statements center on the vagueness and faulty memory she alleges in the testimony of the three witnesses at trial. This objection, however, relates not to the reliability of the hearsay declarant\u2019s statements, but to the reliability of the witnesses testifying in court. <em>See State v. McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. 669, 675 (1992). The defendant had a full and fair opportunity to confront these witnesses about their memory, truthfulness and bias. <em>Cf Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 663. For these reasons, we find that the admission of the hearsay statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erroneously excluded Raymond\u2019s alleged statements regarding the Berlin City account. The prosecution alleged that this account belonged to Ruth and that the defendant stole money from it. Gabusi\u2019s defense was that she believed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>account belonged to Raymond and not Ruth, that she was acting under Raymond\u2019s direction in transferring the money while he was alive, and that the 1997 will represented Raymond\u2019s true intentions. At trial, she testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">Q: After Ray had passed away, you ended up moving around \u2014 or some of the money got moved while Ray was alive, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">Q: And that dealt with the wire transfers that we were talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">A: And all the wire transfers brought the money together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">Q: Now, there\u2019s a number of passbooks from Berlin City, and there\u2019s some writing on these, Exhibits 20 and 63. Do you remember these passbooks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">Q: Now, the writing on there, where did you \u2014 how did you know to put that writing on which account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">A: I put \u201cRay\u201d on because his social security check was deposited in this account. There was nothing on the inside to indicate who this belonged to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">Q: Okay. And did you \u2014 did Ray talk about that account at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">A: Ray said he had his social security check deposited \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-14\">Mr. Delker [for the State]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">At the subsequent bench conference, the State argued that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay because it related to \u201cwho owns that account, which is for the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d The trial court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">Although the trial court correctly noted the statement was not admissible for the truth of the matter it asserted, we find that the decision to exclude it was an unsustainable exercise of discretion. At the bench conference, the defendant\u2019s counsel explained that the statement would be introduced not to prove who actually owned the account, but to show that the defendant <em>believed, </em>Raymond owned the account, and thus to show that she had no intent to steal from Ruth. Because the truth of Raymond\u2019s alleged claim of ownership was unnecessary to this defense, the statement was not hearsay if admitted for the limited purpose of showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>defendant\u2019s intent or purpose. <em>See State v. McPherson, </em>127 N.H. 826, 828 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The State argues that even if the court erred in sustaining the objection, the error was harmless. When the trial court has erroneously excluded evidence, we must reverse unless the State can show beyond a reasonable doubt that such error did not affect the verdict. <em>State v. Demeritt, </em>148 N.H. 435, 440 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"ANA\">The defendant testified to the substance of the excluded statement at several other points during her direct and cross-examination. Before the objection, defendant\u2019s counsel had asked her whether Raymond told her to transfer money from the accounts. She replied, \u201cYes. It was with Ray\u2019s guidance that everything was done.\u201d Just after the objection, the defendant testified that Ray had specifically authorized her to move money from the Berlin City account. She also testified that she considered Raymond\u2019s will to be valid and the money from the Berlin City account to belong to her after his death \u201c[bjecause Ray had left it to me.\u201d Under cross-examination, she reiterated that Raymond intended to give her the money in- the Berlin City account. Because the defendant was able to present evidence supporting- her claim that she believed the account belonged to Raymond, the excluded testimony was cumulative and we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it would not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See State v. Sonthikoummane, </em>145 N.H. 316, 323 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">At oral argument, the defendant waived a fourth issue relating to hearsay, and the parties agreed that a fifth issue relating to restitution had become moot. Having considered all the defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm the decision of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-9\">BROCK, C.J., and Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred; BRODERICK, J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b366-10\">Broderick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\">concurring specially. I agree with the majority that this case should be affirmed. I also agree that the trial court did not err in admitting statements made by Raymond Laveron to Dr. Bourbeau, Attorney Cote and Ms. Gilligan under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 803(3) (Rule 803(3)). I write separately, however, because I disagree with a portion of the analysis concerning the admission of those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Raymond Laveron executed a will in 1988. Under the terms of the will, all of Raymond\u2019s assets would be placed in trust for the benefit of his sister, Ruth Laveron, during her lifetime. Upon Ruth\u2019s death, the remainder of the trust would be paid to the defendant. After being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer in June 1997, Raymond told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Bourbeau, Cote and Gilligan that he intended to care for Ruth for the rest of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Subsequent to Raymond\u2019s statements, the defendant contacted Attorney Harwell and told him that Raymond wished to execute a new will, which would leave his assets entirely to her, with no provision for the care of Ruth. The defendant also told Attorney Harwell that Raymond wished to execute a durable power of attorney, appointing her as his attorney in fact. On July 24, 1997, Raymond executed the new will and durable power of attorney; he died less than one month later.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The trial court admitted Raymond\u2019s statements to Bourbeau, Cote and Gilligan, concerning his intentions to care for Ruth, under Rule 803(3). The defendant argues that the statements were inadmissible hearsay. Rule 803(3) excepts from the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">A statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">I agree with the majority that our case law supports the conclusion that statements \u201cof then existing state of mind\u201d may be used to show the occurrence of subsequent events. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 803 Reporter\u2019s Notes; <em>Fissette v. Railroad, </em>98 N.H. 136, 142-43 (1953); <em>see also Mutual Life Insurance v. Hillmon, </em>145 U.S. 285, 295-96 (1892). I do not support the majority\u2019s conclusion, however, that Raymond\u2019s repeated statements that he intended to care for Ruth after his death, statements which were made prior to his execution of a new -will and power of attorney, \u201cwere admissible to show that his subsequent execution of a will that made no such provision, and subsequent execution of a power of attorney, were the products of deception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Raymond\u2019s earlier statements of his intent could be used to show that a subsequent will containing provisions for Ruth\u2019s care was in keeping with his intent. Raymond\u2019s execution of a will and power of attorney containing provisions contrary to his previously expressed intention to care for Ruth, however, is indicative only of an apparent change in Raymond\u2019s intent. The reasons behind such an apparent change might include incompetence, deception, or a bonafide change of intent on the part of the testator. Raymond\u2019s statements, by themselves, are not competent evidence to show one of these reasons to the exclusion of the others or why a subsequent event did <em>not </em>occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The defendant also argued that Raymond\u2019s statements were admitted, not to show his state of mind, but to prove the truth of his belief that the defendant would use his money to care for Ruth. The majority finds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">[T]he \u201ctruth\u201d of Raymond\u2019s post-mortem plans was not at issue. Rather the relevance of the statements stems from Raymond\u2019s <em>belief </em>that they would be carried out, which in turn implies that the defendant created a false impression to obtain Raymond\u2019s money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Pursuant to Rule 803(3), the trial court could have admitted Raymond\u2019s statements because they were indicative of his then existing state of mind prior to executing his new will and power of attorney. In addition, the statements could be admitted because of the internal exception to Rule 803(3), that is, as \u201cstatement^] of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed,\u201d because they related to the \u201cterms of declarant\u2019s will.\u201d Although I concur with the majority that the trial court did not err in admitting the statements, I do not agree that the statements, by themselves, imply that the defendant created a false impression to obtain Raymond\u2019s money.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
