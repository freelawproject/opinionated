On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court (Hollman, J.) erroneously permitted the State to elicit opinions from the then-deputy chief medical examiner, Thomas Gilson, M.D., that the State had not previously disclosed to the defense. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. R. 98(A)(2)\u00ae. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The relevant facts follow. The defendant was charged with second-degree murder following the stabbing death of a Rye man in October 1999. The stabbing occurred during a fight between the two men, after a night of drinking and taking drugs.'</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In March 2000, during discovery, the State provided the defendant with a report Dr. Gilson prepared of the autopsy performed on the victim. The report describes the autopsy, Dr. Gilson\u2019s findings about the victim\u2019s body, and his conclusion that the victim \u201cdied as a result of a stab wound of the chest which injured his heart and right lung.\u201d The State also listed Dr. Gilson on the witness list it provided the defense in November 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In May 2001, the defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the State from eliciting expert opinion testimony. At the hearing on the motion, the defense conceded that because the State had provided expert witness reports, its experts could testify about the reports and the examinations described therein. The defense objected, however, to the experts giving opinions not contained in the reports. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion with respect to expert testimony the State failed to \u201cproperly disclosef] in a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">At trial, the defendant offered two defenses, accident and self-defense. In his opening statement, defense counsel explained that the \u201cphysical evidence in this case is ... that the wound, the fatal wound that [the victim] sustained is more consistent with [the victim] attacking and rushing [the defendant] than any forward thrusting movement by [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The State offered, and the court recognized, Dr. Gilson as an expert in forensic pathology. The defense objected to his testimony to the extent that the State intended to ask him for opinions that were not disclosed in his autopsy report. The court ruled that the State would be allowed to ask Dr. Gilson for his opinion as to the cause of death, his observations about the condition of the body and the conclusions he made as a result of those observations. The-court further ruled that the State would be permitted to ask Dr. Gilson if the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with \u201ccertain things.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The defendant objected on the ground that, although the State had provided the autopsy report, it had not provided a summary of Dr. Gilson\u2019s testimony. The court stated that it would rule on specific questions to which the defendant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Over the defendant\u2019s objections, the court permitted Dr. Gilson to give the following opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Q. And, once again, Doctor, in your opinion, could the incise wounds and the stab wounds have been received as part of the same episode of injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">A. Yes, they could have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">Q. And would you characterize these wounds as offensive or defensive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">A. Some forensic pathologists would say these represent what are called defensive wounds. I prefer to say they\u2019re wounds that are consistent with a person who may be defending themselves. The reason I don\u2019t use the term \u201cdefensive wounds\u201d is because I can envision scenarios where a person could sustain these wounds and not be defending themselves. I can\u2019t say looking at a wound that\u2019s because a person is defending themselves or because they were doing something and they got harmed, you know, when they weren\u2019t defending themselves. There\u2019s nothing specific there to say this is really truly defensive. It\u2019s only compatible with the person defending themselves, but not necessarily so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">Q. The stab wound that you observed, is it consistent with the victim lunging forward and impaling himself on a knife simply held stationary and outstretched?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">A. No, it isn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">A. Because the trajectory of the knife through the body is such that it\u2019s coming at an angle. That tells me that the hand that was holding the knife imparted some direction in causing that wound.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The defendant\u2019s own expert opined on direct examination as follows with regard to the cause of the victim\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-16\">Q. Doctor, do you have an opinion, based on reasonable medical certainty and not on a mere \u2014 not on mere possibility, as to whether or not the fatal injury sustained by [the vietim] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>consistent with it having been sustained with the knife being held in [the defendants left hand and [the defendants body being turned in retreat, and then through force \u2014 his own force or [the victim]\u2019s combined force bringing him back into [the victim]\u2019s body \u2014 would it be consistent with such a movement? .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">A. I do not believe that the fatal wound would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">Q. And what \u2014 how can you account for \u2014 it \u2014 would it be your opinion, sir, that the wound that was sustained by [the victim] was a \u2014 an awkward movement as opposed to an intentional thrusting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">A. Well, to \u2014 to follow the path that the wound describes, I would say that it would have to be a \u2014 a thrust outwards on the part of [the defendant] as opposed to forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">Q. And would you say, Doctor, from your observations, that the injury was more probably than not a result of a struggle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">A. It could occur during a struggle, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s expert admitted that the \u201chand that held the knife in this case had to have been in motion\u201d and that the fatal stab wound \u201ccould not have been caused by the motion of the victim alone rushing forward onto a stationary knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The admissibility of evidence is generally within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>See State v. Cromlish, </em>146 N.H. 277, 280 (2001). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See In re Antonio W., </em>147 N.H. 408, 414 (2002). This same standard applies to review of the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to alleged discovery violations. <em>See Cromlish, </em>146 N.H. at 280. To show that the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is unsustainable, the defendant must show that the decision was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The defendant argues that the trial court should not have admitted Dr. Gilson\u2019s testimony because the State failed to disclose this testimony before trial. The record contradicts this assertion. It shows that the State provided Dr. Gilson\u2019s autopsy report, which contained his opinion regarding the cause of the victim\u2019s death, and the State listed Dr. Gilson as one of its anticipated witnesses. The defendant implies that Superior Court Rule 98, which governs discovery in criminal cases, required something more. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">Under Rule 98, the State, within thirty days after the defendant has entered a not guilty plea, was required to provide the defense with, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>other items, \u201cresults or reports of physical or mental examinations, scientific tests or experiments, or any other reports or statements of experts, as well as a summary of each expert\u2019s qualifications.\u201d Super. Ct. R. 98(A)(2)(i). The State complied with this requirement by providing the autopsy report.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Rule 98 also required the State to provide the defendant with a list of the witnesses it anticipated calling at trial. <em>See </em>SUPER. Ct. R. 98(C)(1). The State complied with this requirement by listing Dr. Gilson as an expected witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, Rule 98 does not oblige the State to summarize the testimony of the experts whose reports the State has provided to the defense. Nor does it mandate that an expert\u2019s report contain all of the opinions regarding which the expert may be called upon to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The defendant argues that the court\u2019s pretrial order required it to exclude any opinion tendered by Dr. Gilson that was not stated in his report. We do not share this interpretation of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">As the State aptly notes, the court\u2019s pretrial order merely echoed Rule 98(J), which permits a court to \u201ctake such action as it deems just under the circumstances\u201d including \u201cprohibiting the party from introducing the evidence not disclosed,\u201d in the event that a party fails to comply with Rule 98. Super. Ct. R. 98(J). As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">Well, I\u2019m going to \u2014 I \u2014 you know, as a general principle, I will exclude \u2014 well, I do exclude \u2014 I don\u2019t have to write it because it\u2019s part of our well-established rule \u2014 I will exclude any expert testimony to the extent that it was not disclosed in a timely manner----The expert wasn\u2019t disclosed, and what the expert was going to testify to wasn\u2019t disclosed in a timely manner. The party offering the expert\u2019s testimony is not going to be allowed to get it in. And that\u2019s the general principle that applies all the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Because the State timely included Dr. Gilson on its witness list and timely provided the defendant with his report, the court\u2019s pretrial order did not preclude the court from admitting his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Moreover, even assuming that the State violated Rule 98 and/or the court\u2019s pretrial order, the defendant has failed to show that the admission of Dr. Gilson\u2019s testimony prejudiced his case. In the context of a discovery violation, \u201c[a]ctual prejudice exists if the defense has been impeded to a significant degree by the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>State v. Stickney, </em>148 N.H. 232, 236 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The defendant suffered no actual prejudice from the admission of Dr. Gilson\u2019s opinions. The defendant\u2019s own expert gave similar opinions. The defendant argues that Dr. Gilson\u2019s testimony was prejudicial because it \u201ccontradicted the defense theory of the case.\u201d This type of \u201cprejudice\u201d does not suffice. \u201cUnfair prejudice is not mere detriment to a defendant from the tendency of the evidence to prove his guilt, in which sense all evidence offered by the prosecution is meant to be prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, brackets and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-6\">Broderick, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
