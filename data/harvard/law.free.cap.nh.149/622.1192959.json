She argues that the Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) erred by denying her motions to suppress her pr <em>e-Miranda </em>statement and silence and her post <em>-Miranda </em>confession. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The following facts were adduced at the suppression hearing. Detective Kristian Kelley and Sergeant Kevin Keenan went to the defendant\u2019s house to arrest her for forging checks stolen from a customer at a grocery store. After the defendant was told that she was being arrested for forgery, she stated that \u201cshe didn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know why she was being arrested.\u201d The defendant professed her innocence and told the officers that they had better know what they were doing. She was taken into custody, handcuffed and escorted to a police cruiser. Sergeant Keenan testified that the defendant was \u201cyelling that we had the wrong person\u201d while \u201ctrying to pull away from us\u201d because \u201c[s]he didn\u2019t want to be taken into custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In response, Sergeant Keenan showed the defendant bank surveillance photographs in which a person who appeared to be the defendant was cashing a check and said, \u201c[T]his is your picture.\u201d The defendant calmed down and told the police that she had children and did not want to go to jail. Detective Kelley testified that at that point, Sergeant Keenan stated that \u201cif you\u2019re cooperative with us, we will explain the fact that you do have three kids and do what we can to try to make sure that you get back to those kids, make that recommendation to the judge when [you go] for arraignment.\u201d The defendant was calm and quiet for the remainder of the trip to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">At the police station, the defendant was read her <em>Miranda, </em>rights and given a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form on which she marked that she understood each right. She then waived her rights. She was interviewed for approximately one hour and confessed to the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress her post-<em>Miranda, </em>confession, claiming that her waiver was not a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver because \u201cthe Gilford police threatened that unless she gave a statement she would not be released, so that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>children would be left uncared for.\u201d The defendant asserted that she would not have given her statements had she not been threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">At the suppression hearing, the defendant also argued that the police violated <em>Miranda </em>by not giving her warnings prior to showing her the bank surveillance photographs. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, finding that the police did not threaten the defendant, but it did not address the issue of the bank surveillance photographs. The defendant filed a motion to reconsider arguing that the showing of the photographs was tantamount to interrogation for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>because it was likely to elicit an incriminating response. Accordingly, the defendant argued that \u201ceverything [she] said subsequent to her being shown the photographs should be suppressed.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. The defendant was convicted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that her rights under Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution were violated. She argues that her statements and silence in the police cruiser after being shown the bank surveillance photographs should have been suppressed because Sergeant Keenan violated <em>Miranda </em>by engaging in the functional equivalent of interrogation in eliciting her response. She further argues that her <em>Miranda </em>waiver and subsequent confession at the police station should have been suppressed because neither was voluntary. She argues that either the first <em>Miranda </em>violation tainted her waiver and subsequent confession or a police promise coerced her into waiving her rights and confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We first address each of the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983), and cite federal opinions only to aid in our analysis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\n<em>I. Pre-Miranda statement and silence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Before the defendant\u2019s responses made during a custodial interrogation may be used as evidence against her, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she was warned of her constitutional rights, that she waived those rights, and that any subsequent statements were made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>140 N.H. 573, 577 (1995). There is no question that the defendant was in custody at the time she was shown the surveillance photographs. Thus, the first issue we review is whether Sergeant Keenan interrogated the defendant by showing her the bank surveillance photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">In reviewing a determination of interrogation, we have deferred to the trial court if it applied the appropriate legal standard, and its factual findings were sufficient and not contrary to the manifest weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>evidence. <em>See State v. Dedrick, </em>132 N.H. 218, 226 (1989), <em>cert. </em>denied, 494 U.S. 1007 (1990). In light of our holding in <em>State v. Ford, </em>144 N.H. 57 (1999), however, we find it necessary to clarify our standard of review. In <em>Ford, </em>we held that \u201c[b]ecause the ultimate determination of custody [in <em>Miranda </em>cases] requires an application of a legal standard to historical facts, it is not merely a factual question but a mixed question of law and fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 62, and accordingly reviewed the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination of custody <em>de novo, id. </em>at 63. Likewise, whether the defendant was subjected to interrogation is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Moreno-Flores, </em>33 F.3d 1164, 1168 (9th Cir. 1994); <em>State v. Juarez, </em>903 P.2d 241, 244 (N.M. Ct. App. 1995). Thus, while we will continue to defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, we will review the ultimate determination of interrogation <em>de novo. See Juarez, </em>903 P.2d at 244; <em>see also Ford, </em>144 N.H. at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes occurs where \u201ca person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-01 (1980). The functional equivalent of interrogation includes \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The defendant argues that Sergeant Keenan\u2019s use of the bank surveillance photographs was the functional equivalent of interrogation. We disagree. Sergeant Keenan\u2019s action in response to the defendant\u2019s repeated questions about the basis for her arrest and claims of innocence cannot be considered interrogatory. Courts have held that a police officer\u2019s response to certain inquiries by the defendant does not constitute interrogation under <em>Innis. See, e.g., United States v. Briggs, </em>273 F.3d 737, 740-41 (7th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Conley, </em>156 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. Benton, </em>996 F.2d 642, 644 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1016 (1993); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>985 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 1993). In <em>Benton, </em>for example, the court admitted the defendant\u2019s response to a police officer\u2019s explanation of why the defendant was being arrested because the explanation was a response to the defendant\u2019s questions about his arrest. <em>Benton, </em>996 F.2d at 643, 644. In <em>Taylor, </em>the court concluded that the defendant\u2019s question - \u201cwhy is this happening to me?\u201d - was a direct request for an explanation as to why she was under arrest. <em>Taylor, </em>985 F.2d at 8. Thus, the court held that the police officer\u2019s response to the question was not the functional equivalent of interrogation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>In the present case, the defendant stated that \u201cshe didn\u2019t know why she was being arrested,\u201d \u201cthat she didn\u2019t know anything about forgery,\u201d and that the officers \u201chad better know what they were doing.\u201d Sergeant Keenan testified at the suppression hearing that the defendant was \u201ctrying to pull away from us\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be taken into custody.\u201d The officers testified that she was shown the photographs in an attempt to calm her down and explain the basis for her arrest, not to elicit an incriminating response. <em>Cf. United States v. Crisco, 725 </em>F.2d 1228, 1232 (9th Cir. 1984) (where agent commented on incriminating evidence to explain the arrest, action not the functional equivalent of interrogation). While the officer\u2019s intent in showing the photographs is not conclusive, it is relevant in determining whether the action was the functional equivalent of interrogation. <em>See United States v. Lynch, </em>813 F. Supp. 911, 916 (D.N.H. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We cannot say that Sergeant Keenan should have known that showing the defendant the photographs was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The photographs were not shown in a way that required an affirmative response from the defendant, <em>cf. Shedelbower v. Estelle, </em>885 F.2d 570, 573 (9th Cir. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1092 (1991), but rather were shown in response to the defendant\u2019s apparent confusion over being arrested, <em>cf. Briggs, </em>273 F.3d at 740-41 (where police officer responded to suspect\u2019s question about what would happen to him, action not the functional equivalent of interrogation). Moreover, we see no reason why Sergeant Keenan should have expected the defendant to cease her protestations of innocence. Even after being told the charges that led to her arrest, the defendant continued to claim her innocence and question her arrest. Sergeant Keenan could have reasonably concluded that the defendant would respond to the photographs in a similar manner. <em>Cf. State v. Guajardo, </em>135 N.H. 401, 403-04 (1992). In sum, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and thus the defendant\u2019s response to viewing the photographs was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\n<em>II. Miranda waiver and subsequent confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The defendant argues that her <em>Miranda </em>waiver and subsequent confession were tainted by Sergeant Keenan\u2019s violation of <em>Miranda </em>in showing her the bank surveillance photographs. <em>See generally State v. Aubuchont, </em>141 N.H. 206 (1996). However, because we hold that the defendant\u2019s unwarned statement and silence were not elicited in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that her waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was coerced by a police promise to obtain personal recognizance bail in exchange for her cooperation. In her motion to suppress, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>argued that the officer\u2019s comment, that \u201cif you\u2019re cooperative with us, we will explain the fact that you do have three kids and do what we can to try to make sure that you get back to those kids, make that recommendation to the judge when [you go] for arraignment,\u201d was a threat that coerced her into waiving her <em>Miranda </em>rights and confessing. On appeal, she argues that this statement was a promise which had the same coercive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">While the concepts of threat and promise are different, prompting concern over whether the defendant\u2019s argument has been preserved, <em>see State v. Cole, </em>142 N.H. 519, 523 (1997) (arguments not raised below are not preserved for appellate review), the defendant asserted at oral argument that, in this case, the officer\u2019s comment could properly be interpreted as either a threat or a promise. In other words, the defendant urges us to review the trial court\u2019s ruling as if the court had denied her motion to suppress because it found that the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver and confession were not coerced by a police promise. Because the State does not argue that the defendant\u2019s argument was not preserved for appellate review, we will review the trial court\u2019s ruling accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\u201cOur State Constitution requires the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily. Whether a confession is voluntary is initially a question of fact for the trial court, whose decision will not be overturned unless it is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, as viewed in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d <em>State v. Aubuchont, </em>147 N.H. 142, 146 (2001) (quotation and citation omitted); <em>see also State v. Sullivan, </em>130 N.H. 64, 69 (1987) (applying same standard when reviewing trial court\u2019s finding on voluntariness of <em>Miranda </em>waiver). \u201cTo be considered voluntary, a confession must be the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice and not be extracted by threats, violence, direct or implied promises of any sort, or by the exertion of any improper influence.\u201d <em>State v. Monroe, </em>142 N.H. 857, 864 (1998) (quotation and brackets omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1973 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">\u201cIn determining the voluntariness of the confession, the trial court must examine the totality of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Beland, </em>138 N.H. 735, 737 (1994). The existence of a promise is not dispositive of the question of voluntariness. <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>124 N.H. 428, 434 (1984). \u201cRather, all the facts must be examined and their nuances assessed to determine whether, in making the promise, the police exerted such an influence on the defendant that [her] will was overborne.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The trial court found that after the defendant calmed down in the police cruiser, Sergeant Keenan \u201cstated something to the effect of because of [the defendant\u2019s] cooperating[,] the police intended to ask for her release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>on P.R. bail.\u201d Thus, the trial court construed Sergeant Keenan\u2019s comment as a response to the defendant\u2019s cooperation, rather than as a promise in exchange for future cooperation. The defendant argues that the trial court made an erroneous factual finding because Detective Kelley testified that Sergeant Keenan told the defendant that <em>\u201cif </em>you\u2019re cooperative\u201d he would try to help her rather than \u201cbecause of her cooperating\u201d- as the court found. However, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s-finding is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Detective Kelley did not testify that her recollection of Sergeant Keenan\u2019s statement was a direct quote. In fact, Detective Kelley testified that Sergeant Keenan\u2019s statement, to the effect of \u201cyou know, we\u2019ll do what we can, 'and we\u2019ll make that recommendation, that we understand that [the defendant has] three children,\u201d was made in response to the defendant\u2019s becoming calm and discussing how she wanted to get back to her children. .Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, this characterization of Sergeant Keenan\u2019s statement supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Sergeant Keenan\u2019s comment was a response to the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The defendant argues that the-timing of the officer\u2019s comment to her renders her subsequent waiver and confession the product of coercion. The defendant argues that an offer to help is more likely to have a coercive effect on a <em>Miranda </em>waiver and subsequent confession if made prior to the defendant\u2019s Waiver rather than after it. <em>Cf. State v. Elbert, </em>125 N.H. 1, 11 (1984) (waiver not involuntary because, in part, the record reflected that the mention of leniency came after the waiver, not before it). However, this is not a case in which the police conditioned a promise to help the defendant upon obtaining an incriminating statement. <em>State v. Ray, </em>489 N.W.2d 558, 565 (Neb. 1992) (a defendant\u2019s statement is inadmissible if totality of the circumstances shows that police offered -a benefit in exchange for a statement). The officer\u2019s comment came immediately- after the defendant ceased protesting the arrest and became calm. Because the comment was'made while neither officer was attempting to obtain a statement from the defendant, \u2022 and because the defendant had already done what she had been asked to do, which was to calm down and stop protesting her arrest, it is unlikely that she would have interpreted the statement as being a promise for a future Miranda waiver and confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Moreover, we have recognized that offers to inform other authorities of the defendant\u2019s cooperation are not as coercive as other types of promises, such as those for confidentiality or immunity. See <em>State v. McDermott, </em>131 N.H. 495, 501 (1989). Here, Sergeant Keenan merely offered to make -a recommendation to the judge at the arraignment to \u201ctry\u201d to assist her in obtaining personal recognizance bail. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>remaining circumstances of the defendant\u2019s waiver and subsequent confession also indicate that the defendant was not coerced. The one-hour interview was not excessively long. <em>Cf. Carroll, </em>138 N.H. at 695. There was no evidence of threats of violence, intimidation or deprivation of food, water or sleep. <em>Cf. id. </em>Under the totality of circumstances, we conclude that the defendant was not coerced by the officer\u2019s comment into waiving her <em>Miranda </em>rights and confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\n<em>III. Federal Constitutional Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances. <em>See Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 168-69 (1986) (applying preponderance of the evidence standard); <em>Ford, </em>144 N.H. at 60. Thus, we reach the same result on all issues under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b661-8\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, J., concurred; Duggan, J., with whom Nadeau, J., joined, dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b661-9\">Duggan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9j\">dissenting. Because I conclude that showing the bank surveillance photographs to the defendant constituted interrogation, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">In <em>State v. Dellorfano, </em>128 N.H. 628, 633-34 (1986), we adopted the definition of interrogation announced in <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291 (1980).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">\u201c[I]nterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police____But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-14\"><em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02 (footnotes omitted). We noted in <em>Dellorfano </em>that \u201c[t]he <em>Innis </em>court interpreted the term \u2018interrogation\u2019 broadly.\u201d <em>Dellorfano, </em>128 N.H. at 633-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>In <em>Innis, </em>while the two police officers who had arrested Innis were transporting him to the police station, they exchanged comments about the danger that a missing shotgun could pose to students of a nearby school for handicapped children. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 294-95. Innis \u201cinterrupted the conversation\u201d and volunteered to show the police where the gun was located. <em>Id. </em>at 295. The Court held that there had been no interrogation because the \u201cconversation was ... nothing more than a dialogue between the two officers to which no response from [Innis] was invited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"A5XU\">Here, by contrast, the police confronted the defendant directly by showing her the photographs and saying, \u201cThis is your picture.\u201d Up to this point, the defendant had loudly and persistently proclaimed her innocence. Given the defendant\u2019s loquaciousness and the dramatic confrontation with overwhelming evidence of her guilt, the police should have known that she would respond and that it was reasonably likely her response would be incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">This is unlike the cases which have held there is no interrogation when the police respond \u201cto a direct inquiry by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>273 F.3d 737, 739 (7th Cir. 2001) (where defendant asked what would happen to co-defendant, police officer\u2019s response that \u201cboth men would be charged with possession of cocaine\u201d not interrogation); <em>United States v. Conley, </em>156 F.3d 78, 81, 83 (1st Cir. 1998) (where defendant asked postal inspectors to tell him what evidence they had against him, statements blurted out by defendant during recitation of evidence not the product of interrogation); <em>United States v. Benton, </em>996 F.2d 642, 644 (3d Cir. 1993) (where, in response to defendant\u2019s inquiry, officer \u201cdid nothing more than tell [the defendant] why he was being arrested,\u201d police did not engage in interrogation); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>985 F.2d 3, 6-7, 8 (1st Cir. 1993) (where defendant asked police why she had been arrested and police officer replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t be growing dope on your property like that,\u201d defendant\u2019s incriminating statement not the- product of interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In this case, it is correct that \u201c[t]he photographs were not shown in a way that required an affirmative response from the defendant,\u201d <em>cf. Shedelbower v. Estelle, </em>885 F.2d 570, 573 (9th Cir. 1989), but the test under <em>Innis </em>is not so narrow. It is sufficient if the police conduct \u201cwould encourage [the defendant] to make some spontaneous incriminating remark.\u201d <em>Id.; see, e.g., People v. Ferro, </em>472 N.E.2d 13, 16-17 (N.Y. 1984) (showing defendant furs stolen from decedent\u2019s residence held to be interrogation); <em>State v. Nixon, </em>599 A.2d 66, 67 (Me. 1991) (showing defendant sketch of crime scene was interrogation); <em>State v. Uganiza, </em>702 P.2d 1352, 1355 (Haw. 1985) (\u201cpolice officer should have known that the presentation of apparently overwhelming inculpatory evidence in the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of written witnesses\u2019 statements and oral explanations of them was reasonably likely to elicit [an incriminating] response\u201d); <em>Drury v. State, </em>793 A.2d 567, 571 (Md. 2002) (showing defendant tire iron and stolen goods and informing him these items would be fingerprinted held to be interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The test for interrogation is an objective one. <em>Ferro, </em>472 N.E.2d at 14. While the Court in <em>Innis </em>noted that this does not mean \u201cthat the intent of the police is irrelevant,\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02 n. 7, the Court said that the subjective intent of the police may show that a particular police practice is designed to elicit an incriminating response and thus constitutes interrogation. <em>Id. </em>The Court did not say that a police officer\u2019s after-the-fact testimony that he subjectively did not intend to elicit an incriminating response should carry significant weight in the objective analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Because the police violated <em>Miranda </em>by showing the bank surveillance photos to the defendant, I would remand this case to superior court to determine whether her subsequent <em>Miranda </em>waiver and confession were tainted. <em>See generally State v. Aubuchont, </em>141 N.H. 206 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Finally, I agree that, on the facts presented, the police officer\u2019s comment regarding bail did not render the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver or confession involuntary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-7\">Nadeau, J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
