The defendant argues that he and the plaintiff did not have a landlord-tenant relationship as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>defined in RSA 540-A:l (1997). He also argues that the statute governing campgrounds, RSA ch. 216-1 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2002), supersedes RSA 540-A:3. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In its temporary order and order on the motion for reconsideration, the trial court found the following facts. The defendant is a campground owner who rents spaces, equipped with utilities, to campers on a year-round basis. The plaintiff rented space and lived on the defendant\u2019s property from March 2001 through January 2002. The court described the plaintiffs living unit as both a \u201ccamper\u201d and a \u201ctrailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">On February 3, 2002, allegedly because the plaintiff owed back rent, the defendant\u2019s son, Stephen Vergato, and an employee entered the plaintiffs camper and removed some of the plaintiffs property. Stephen Vergato also placed a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign on the plaintiffs camper.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">On February 20,2002, the plaintiff filed a petition with the district court requesting the return of her property and damages. She argued that the defendant was a \u201clandlord\u201d under RSA 540-A:l, and thus subject to RSA 540-A:3, III (Supp. 2002), which prohibits a landlord from \u201cwillfully seiz[ing3, holdping] or otherwise directly or indirectly denying] a tenant access to and possession of such tenant\u2019s property, other than by proper judicial process.\u201d The court agreed that the defendant had violated RSA 540-A:3, and issued a temporary order directing the defendant to return the plaintiffs property. It later awarded the plaintiff damages of $1,000 for each day the defendant failed to return the plaintiffs property, assessing a total award of $23,000 plus costs. <em>See </em>RSA 540-A:4, IX (1997); RSA 358-A:10,1 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the plaintiff was not a tenant and he was not a landlord under RSA 540-A:l. He also argued that RSA chapter 216-1, which governs recreational campgrounds and camping grounds, preempts application of RSA 540-A:3. The court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">While it may have been the stated intention of the defendant to have people rent spaces at his campground on a temporary basis and only for recreational purposes, the reality is that he knowingly allowed people, the plaintiff included, to live in their campers on a year round basis. [RSA 540-A:l, I] defines \u201cLandlord\u201d as meaning \u201can owner, lessor or agent thereof who rents or leases residential premises ... to another person.\u201d ... No definition is given to the word \u201cresidential\u201d in the statute. Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary [defines residence] as \u201cthe act or fact of dwelling in a place for some time.\u201d The plaintiff lived at the campground from March of 2001 to February of 2002____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Living at the same place for 11 months is not a temporary situation. Certainly the plaintiff was not living at the campground for 11 months including the winter months, for recreational purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The court thus affirmed its finding that there was a landlord-tenant relationship,. and denied the motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the defendant raises the same issues in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We note at the outset that we do not have a transcript of the district court proceedings. The moving party has the burden of providing an adequate record. <em>See Rix v. Kinderworks Corp., </em>136 N.H. 548, 553 (1992). \u201cBecause the defendant[] failed to provide this court with a record and transcript of the hearing, we assume that the evidence was sufficient to support the result reached by the trial court. Accordingly, we review the court\u2019s order for errors of law only.\u201d <em>Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 396 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The defendant first argues that he was not a \u201clandlord\u201d under RSA 540-A:l. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u2022 I. \u201cLandlord\u201d means an owner, lessor or agent thereof who rents or leases residential premises including manufactured housing or space in a manufactured housing park to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">II. \u201cTenant\u201d means a person to whom a landlord rents or leases residential premises, including manufactured housing or a space in a manufactured housing park.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">III. \u201cPremises\u201d means the part of the landlord\u2019s property to which the tenant is entitled exclusive access for living or storage as a result of the rental or lease agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">To determine whether the defendant was a landlord, we must decide whether the plaintiffs premises were \u201cresidential\u201d within the meaning of the statute. \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, this court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Amerigas Propane, </em>146 N.H. 267, 269 (2001). Although we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory language in determining legislative intent, we will not read words or phrases in isolation, but in the context of the entire statute. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">The trial court\u2019s analysis focused exclusively on the word \u201cresidential\u201d and applied a dictionary definition of \u201cresidence\u201d to determine legislative intent. This definition \u2014 \u201cthe act or fact of dwelling in a place for some time\u201d \u2014 involves only the duration of the presumed tenancy, and does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>consider the physical attributes of the premises. For example, under the trial court\u2019s definition, a renter could establish a landlord-tenant relationship merely by paying a fee to pitch a tent on undeveloped land, and living there for a certain period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Read as a whole, the statute does not support the trial court\u2019s construction. Specifically, the trial court overlooked the last clause of the definition for both \u201clandlord\u201d and \u201ctenant,\u201d which states that \u201cresidential premises\u201d includes \u201cmanufactured housing or space in a manufactured housing park.\u201d RSA 540-A:l. The inclusion of this phrase indicates that the legislature considered the form of the housing relevant in determining whether it is \u201cresidential.\u201d If the legislature intended the <em>duration </em>of the stay to be sufficient to establish a residence, it would be superfluous to include a specific <em>form </em>of housing within the ambit of the statute. <em>See Pennelli v. Town of Pelham, </em>148 N.H. 365, 367-68 (2002) (\u201cthe legislature is presumed not to have used superfluous or redundant words\u201d). Thus, the mere fact that the plaintiff lived on the defendant\u2019s property for a certain length of time did not establish a landlord-tenant relationship, and the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling otherwise. <em>See Atwood, </em>142 N.H. at 397, 399 (holding that RSA chapter 540-A does not apply if \u201cthe primary purpose for renting the structure is commercial,\u201d even if renter actually lives on the property).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Moreover, the definitions of both \u201clandlord\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d specifically mention only one type of residential premises \u2014 manufactured housing. <em>See </em>RSA 540-A: 1. We believe it unlikely that the legislature intended \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d to be just one of many examples of trailer and camper units encompassed within \u201cresidential premises.\u201d Elsewhere in the statutes, the legislature describes \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d in exclusive terms, defining \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d not to embrace \u201ccampers\u201d and \u201crecreational vehicles.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 205-A:l (2000). Surely, if the legislature had intended campers and trailers to be residential premises, it would not have included as the sole example a type of residence that specifically excludes campers and trailers from its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We therefore conclude that the legislature intended the inclusion of \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d within the definition of \u201cresidential premises\u201d to be exclusive of other forms of campers and trailers. The defendant, thus, could not have been a \u201clandlord\u201d unless the plaintiffs camper or trailer constituted \u201cmanufactured housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Although \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d is not defined within RSA chapter 540-A, the legislature did provide a comprehensive definition within RSA chapter 205-A (2000 &amp; Supp. 2002), concerning the regulation of manufactured housing parks. This definition applies \u201csolely in [RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>chapter 205-A] unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\u201d RSA 205-A:1 (2000). Because RSA chapter 205-A and RSA chapter 540-A share the purpose of establishing the rights of tenants living in manufactured homes, it is clear that the legislature intended RSA chapter 540-A to share RSA chapter 205-A\u2019s definition of \u201cmanufactured housing.\u201d In fact, the legislature amended RSA chapter 540-A to mirror the use of the term \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d in RSA 205-A:l. <em>Compare </em>Laws 1983, 230:10, ;18 (replacing statutory references to \u201cmobile home\u201d in RSA chapter 205-A with \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d) <em>with </em>Laws 1979,305:1 <em>and </em>Laws 1985,100:6 (revising RSA 540-A:l to refer to \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d instead of a \u201cmobile home\u201d); <em>see also </em>RSA 540-A:l, Revision note (stating that \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d and \u201cmanufactured housing park\u201d were substituted in RSA 540-A:l \u201cfor purposes of conformity with RSA 205-A\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">RSA 205-A:l reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">I. \u201cManufactured housing\u201d includes, but is not limited to, manufactured housing as defined by RSA 674:31, and also includes any prefabricated dwelling unit which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">(a) Is designed for long term and continuous residential occupancy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">(b) Is designed to be moved on wheels, as a whole or in sections; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">(c) On arrival on the site, is complete and ready for occupancy, except for incidental unpacking, assembly, connection with utilities, and placing on support or permanent structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">Nothing herein shall be construed to include campers or recreational vehicles within the definition of \u201cmanufactured housing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">RSA 674:31 (1996) further provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">\u201cmanufactured housing\u201d means any structure, transportable in one or more sections, which, in the traveling mode, is 8 body feet or more in width and 40 body feet or more in length, or when erected on site, is 320 square feet or more, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities, which include plumbing, heating, and electrical heating systems contained therein____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Because the trial court erroneously limited its analysis of the landlord-tenant relationship to the duration of the plaintiffs stay, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>did not reach the issue of whether the plaintiffs housing met either statutory definition of manufactured housing. In addition, because we lack a record, and because the trial court\u2019s opinion is silent on the size and design of the plaintiffs living unit, we are unable to determine whether it met either of these definitions. We do not consider the trial court\u2019s description of the unit as a \u201ccamper,\u201d a unit specifically excluded from the definition of manufactured housing, to be dispositive because the trial court also referred to the unit as a \u201ctrailer,\u201d and did not in any case seem to be aware of the legal definition or effect of its description. <em>See </em>RSA 205-A:l. Therefore, we remand the issue of whether the plaintiffs unit qualified as \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s second issue. The defendant argues that RSA chapter 216-1 is the exclusive statute governing the relations between campers and campground owners. Thus, even if the defendant were a \u201clandlord\u201d under RSA 540-A:l, he argues that the provisions of RSA chapter 216-1 would preempt landlord-tenant protections. RSA chapter 216-1 allows campground owners more leeway in evicting campers than RSA chapter 540 permits landlords. For example, the owner of a \u201crecreational campground\u201d may remove a camper \u201cin violation of this chapter\u201d without judicial process merely by \u201cnotifying such person that the establishment no longer desires to entertain him and requesting that he immediately leave.\u201d RSA 216-1:6,1 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Assuming without deciding that RSA chapter 216-1 would preempt any protection the plaintiff could be entitled to under RSA chapter 540-A, the question is whether the premises rented to the plaintiff were in a \u201crecreational campground.\u201d The statute defines a \u201crecreational campground or camping park\u201d as \u201ca parcel of land on which 2 or more campsites are occupied or are intended for temporary occupancy for recreational dwelling purposes only, and not for permanent year-round residency.\u201d RSA 216-1:1, VII (Supp. 2002). The trial court found that the defendant, whatever his \u201cstated intention,\u201d \u201cknowingly allowed people, the plaintiff included\u201d to live year-round on his property for non-temporary and non-recreational purposes. On these facts, we find no legal error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to apply RSA chapter 216-1 to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-8\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
