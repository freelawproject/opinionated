On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for a mistrial after the State introduced evidence of his silence. <em>See </em>U.S. CONST, amends. V, XIV; N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant entered his fourteen-year-old daughter\u2019s room at approximately 5:00 a.m. on August 13,2000. He was fully undressed, and got on top of her and told her to \u201cdo this or die.\u201d Then he attempted to have her perform fellatio. The defendant ejaculated around the victim\u2019s mouth, which she then wiped with her comforter. DNA testing on the victim\u2019s shirt and comforter corroborated the presence of the defendant\u2019s semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">After the incident, the victim used the telephone in her room to call her sister, and then 911. The defendant returned to her room while she was on the phone, and when he realized that the police had arrived at the house, he apologized to the victim, said he was drunk and told her to tell the police it was a false alarm. He tried to grab the phone from the victim, who ran down the stairs and opened the door for the police officers. The defendant then went to the door, and an officer commanded him to step out onto the porch. The defendant appeared intoxicated, and an officer immediately handcuffed him and ordered him to sit upon a stone wall near the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">At trial, one of the officers testified: \u201cI went over to [the defendant] to ask him what happened, and at that point he just closed his eyes and wouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d The defendant objected, and moved for a mistrial. After the trial court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury, it concluded that while the testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, <em>see Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), the State had engaged in a discovery violation because it had not disclosed the testimony to the defendant prior to trial. The court denied the motion for a mistrial, but struck the testimony from the record and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Although the defendant cites both the Federal and State Constitutions, his argument is based upon a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that construes and applies the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. <em>See Coppola v. Powell, </em>878 F.2d 1562 (1st Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>493 U.S. 969 (1989). Because he does not assert that the State Constitution affords greater protection than the Federal Constitution, we consider only the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights under the Federal Constitution. <em>See State v. Hill, </em>146 N.H. 568, 577-78 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> Three basic principles guide the application of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination: (1) invocation of the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>is construed liberally; (2) invocation of the right does not require any magic words; and (3) the privilege applies to suspects questioned during investigations \u2014 it is not limited to persons in custody or charged with a crime. <em>Coppola, </em>878 F.2d. at 1565. While use of pre-arrest silence to impeaeh a defendant\u2019s credibility is not unconstitutional, use of pre-arrest silence in the case-in-chief, in which the defendant does not testify, is unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 1568; <em>cf. State v. Demeritt, </em>148 N.H. 435,440 (2002) (fundamental fairness precludes State\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s pr <em>e-Miranda, </em>pre-arrest silence both in its case-in-chief and for impeachment purposes where police officer ordered defendant to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The State argues that because the federal circuits are split on whether a defendant\u2019s pre-arrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence can be used as part of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, <em>see State v. Moore, </em>965 P.2d 174,180 (Idaho 1998), we are not compelled to follow <em>Coppola. </em>While this assertion may be true in theory, <em>see Martineau v. Perrin, </em>119 N.H. 529, 531 (1979), we will follow the First Circuit\u2019s precedent in analyzing this case. <em>Cf. State v. Adams, </em>133 N.H. 818, 823-24 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In this case, the defendant did not testify. The jury heard testimony from one of the State\u2019s witnesses that prior to his arrest, when asked for his side of the story, the defendant remained silent. Assuming that this was sufficient to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, we conclude that admission of this testimony was unconstitutional. <em>Coppola, </em>878 F.2d at 1568. The State argues that if the admission was erroneous, the court\u2019s jury instruction to disregard the testimony cured any error, and if not, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> \u201cA mistrial based on the introduction of inadmissible evidence is warranted only when the challenged evidence causes irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Pandolfi, </em>145 N.H. 508, 512 (2000) (quotation omitted). When evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence is erroneously admitted at trial, that error is generally cured by instructions to the jury to disregard the testimony. <em>State v. Spaulding, </em>147 N.H. 583, 587 (2002). A mere reference by a witness to a defendant\u2019s silence, without more, does not necessarily require a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>In the absence of prosecutorial misconduct or comment that cannot be cured by a cautionary instruction to the jury, an instruction to disregard the reference to the silence is generally sufficient. <em>Id. </em>We presume that jurors follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Dowdle, </em>148 N.H. 345, 348 (2002). Furthermore, when inadmissible testimony, erroneously presented to the jury, is ambiguous, \u201ca defendant is not so substantially prejudiced that a mistrial is required.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>148 N.H. 671, 675 (2002) (quotation omitted). In this case, the court found that the jury would very likely view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the testimony, not as an admission, but rather as the defendant falling asleep. <em>Cf. State v. Haley, </em>141 N.H. 541, 550-51 (1997). Furthermore, the prosecutor did not utilize the fact of the defendant\u2019s silence, nor did she comment upon it at any time. <em>Cf. State v. Booton, </em>114 N.H. 750,760 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The erroneous admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence is also subject to harmless error analysis. <em>Coppola, </em>878 F.2d at 1569. \u201cFor us to hold that an error was harmless, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Dupont, </em>149 N.H. 70, 75 (2003). \u201cAn error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity, or weight, and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Here, the jury heard substantial additional evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Cf. Dementi, </em>148 N.H. at 440. The victim testified in detail regarding the assault. She testified that after the assault, she left a message at her sister\u2019s house and then called 911 to report that her father had raped her. The 911 dispatcher confirmed this testimony, and testified that the victim sounded frightened and frantic. The victim\u2019s sister testified that she received a telephone message from the victim immediately after the assault in which the victim repeatedly whispered for her to pick up the phone. The sister later met the victim at the hospital and testified that the victim described the assault, and was crying and appeared \u201cnumb.\u201d The victim\u2019s mother testified that the night of the assault, the defendant was so angry and intoxicated that she left the house with the victim\u2019s grandmother (who also lived in the home) and spent the night in a hotel. An expert witness testified that both the victim\u2019s shirt, which she wore during the assault, and the comforter from the victim\u2019s bed had semen on them. The DNA from the semen matched the defendant\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">In light of the ambiguous nature of the officer\u2019s testimony, the curative steps taken by the court, and the other evidence before the jury, we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence did not affect the verdict. <em>Cf State v. Munson, </em>126 N.H. 191,193 (1985). Any error was therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The defendant also argues that: (1) a mistrial was warranted because his silence was the result of custodial interrogation and he had not received <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to questioning; and (2) the constitutional violation was compounded by the State\u2019s discovery violation in that the State failed to disclose the evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence prior to trial. Because we have already concluded that any error in admitting the defendant's silence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>Miranda </em>issue. If the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated, the erroneous admission of the defendant\u2019s silence, as discussed above, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument, without citation, that the compound impact of a discovery violation and a constitutional violation requires a different result. <em>Cf State v. </em>Ellison, 135 N.H. 1, 6 (1991) (inadmissible testimony, introduced contrary to prior court order, did not entitle defendant to mistrial).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">All issues raised in the notice of appeal, but not briefed, are deemed waived. <em>See Stale v. Mounijoy, </em>142 N.H. 648, 652 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-5\">Nadeau, Dai jan is and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
