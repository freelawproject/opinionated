We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">The relevant facts follow. In the spring of 2002, the town passed the \u201cEnvironmental Tobacco Smoke Regulations for Restaurants\u201d ordinance, the stated purpose of which is to \u201cprotect and improve the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in restaurants\u201d in recognition of \u201cthe right of those who wish to breath [sic] smoke-free air.\u201d After the ordinance was enacted, the town\u2019s board of health adopted it as a health regulation pursuant to RSA 147:1,1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">The ordinance prohibits smoking in \u201cany restaurant.\u201d It contains an exception for restaurant cocktail lounges that are \u201ceffectively segregated from any non-smoking area.\u201d To be \u201ceffectively segregated,\u201d a smoking area and a non-smoking area must be separated by an enclosed place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>There must also be a \u201ccontinuous, physical baxrier such as a wall... (that spans from the floor to the ceiling) that separates the no-smoking from a smoking-permitted area.\u201d In addition, for cocktail lounges, \u201cup to 30 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per occupant\u201d must be provided for 100 people per 1,000 square feet and more air must be exhausted from the room than is supplied to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\">In August 2002, the Colebrook House sought a declaration that the State Indoor Smoking Act preempted the ordinance. <em>See </em>RSA 155:64-:77 (2002). The Act became effective in January 1991. Its stated purpose \u201cis to protect the health of the public by regulating smoking in enclosed workplaces and enclosed places accessible to the public, regardless of whether publicly or privately owned, and in enclosed publicly owned buildings and offices.\u201d RSA 155:64. \u201c[Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,\u201d and except as provided in RSA 155:67, the Act prohibits smoking in \u201c[a]ll enclosed places of public access and publicly owned buildings and offices, including workplaces, except in effectively segregated smoking-permitted areas.\u201d RSA 155:66. \u201cIf smoking cannot be effectively segregated in any such enclosed place,\u201d then it is \u201ctotally prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Act defines an \u201cenclosed place\u201d as \u201ca structurally enclosed location, or portion of such location, enclosed by a floor, ceiling, and 3 or 4 solid walls, partitions, or windows, exclusive of doors or passageways.\u201d RSA 155:65, VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">\u201cEffectively segregated\u201d means that the following conditions are met: (1) procedures for accurately and fairly determining smoking preference have been followed; (2) the size and location of no-smoking and smoking-permitted areas are designed so that smoke does not \u201charm or unreasonably intrude\u201d into the no-smoking area; (3) a contiguous portion of the enclosed public place measures a minimum of 200 square feet; (4) there is either a continuous, physical barrier of at least fifty-six inches in height or a space of at least four feet in width to separate the no-smoking and smoking areas; and (5) in buildings with existing ventilation systems, designated smoking areas are proximate to exhaust vents. RSA 155:65, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The Act exempts from its provisions restaurants seating fewer than fifty people and cocktail lounges, among other places. RSA 155:67, VIII-IX. The Act requires that those in charge of enclosed places in which smoking is prohibited and of designated smoking-perxnitted areas develop written policies and procedures relative to complying with the Act. RSA 155:68, :69.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The Act authorizes the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to adopt rules relating to, among other things, criteria for smoking-permitted areas that effectively segregate such areas, and procedures for resolving complaints regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the failure to comply with the Act. RSA 155:71. Individuals who smoke in designated no-smoking areas are guilty of a violation-level offense for which they may be fined no less than $100. RSA 155:76.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The sole issue for our review is whether the State Indoor Smoking Act preempts the town ordinance. \u201cIt is well settled that towns cannot regulate a field that has been preempted by the State.\u201d <em>Town of Hooksett v. Baines, </em>148 N.H. 625, 627 (2002). Municipal legislation is preempted if it expressly contradicts State law or if it runs counter to the legislative intent underlying a statutory scheme. <em>Casico v. City of Manchester, </em>142 N.H. 312, 315 (1997). Generally, a detailed and comprehensive State statutory scheme governing a particular field demonstrates legislative intent to preempt that field by placing exclusive control in the State\u2019s hands. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn such circumstances, municipal legislation dealing with that field \u2018runs counter\u2019 to the State statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The State Indoor Smoking Act contains detailed provisions governing the circumstances under which smoking may be allowed in restaurants, defining, for instance, in minute detail, the term \u201ceffectively segregated\u201d down to the square footage of permissible smoking areas. <em>See </em>RSA 155:65, :69. It provides for State rulemaking and enforcement, including detailed provisions governing complaints and investigations, waivers, and penalties for non-compliance. <em>See </em>RSA 155:71-:76.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We hold that the State Indoor Smoking Act constitutes a comprehensive and detailed scheme that regulates smoking in restaurants. A \u201cconclusion that the State regulatory scheme is comprehensive and detailed does not end the preemption inquiry, however, because a comprehensive scheme could nonetheless authorize additional municipal regulation.\u201d <em>Casico, </em>142 N.H. at 316. The town argues that RSA 155:77 allows additional municipal regulation of smoking in restaurants to protect the public health. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">\u201cWe interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, and therefore, we will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include.\u201d <em>Baines, </em>148 N.H. at 630 (quotation omitted). When construing a statute\u2019s meaning, we first examine the language found in the statute. <em>McKenzie v. City of Berlin, </em>145 N.H. 467, 470 (2000). \u201cAlthough we give undefined language its plain and ordinary meaning, we must keep in mind the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole, and not simply by examining isolated words and phrases found therein.\u201d <em>Cross v. Brown, </em>148 N.H. 485, 486 (2002). We must construe this statutory provision in a manner that is \u201cconsistent with the spirit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>objectives of the legislation as a whole.\u201d <em>Stabler Corp. v. Town of Hooksett, </em>122 N.H. 1091,1102 (1982) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">RSA 155:77 provides that: \u201cNothing in this subdivision shall be construed to permit smoking where smoking is prohibited by any other provision of law or rule relative to fire protection, safety and sanitation.\u201d We interpret this provision according to its plain meaning and hold that it permits additional municipal regulation of smoking only with respect to fire protection, safety and sanitation, not with respect to public health. <em>See LDM, Inc. v. Princeton Reg. Health, </em>764 A.2d 507, 518 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 2000) (interpreting similar provision of New Jersey statute and holding that \u201c[t]he authority of the municipality to restrict smoking in restaurants is limited to protecting life and property from fire\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The comprehensiveness of the State Indoor Smoking Act\u2019s regulation of smoking in restaurants dictates against the town\u2019s construction of RSA 155:77. As the New Jersey Superior Court observed when faced with a similar argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">The State Legislature promulgated requirements designed to regulate when, where, and under what circumstances smoking is allowed. Their varying requirements seek to balance the rights of smokers and nonsmokers, a balance that would be thwarted by municipal smoking bans like that under challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\"><em>LDM, Inc., </em>764 A.2d at 526. The New Hampshire law likewise reflects a careful balancing of the rights of smokers and non-smokers. As its senate sponsor noted, the law was intended to replace ten years of no-smoking legislation with a more comprehensive law that \u201cprovides equal protection to the 73 percent of non-smokers in both the public and the private sectors while still providing reasonable accommodation to the 27 percent of those who are smokers.\u201d N.H.S. JOUR. 140 (1990). We regard it as highly improbable that the legislature, after establishing detailed guidelines and having considered and balanced multiple interests, intended to leave the ultimate public health regulation of indoor restaurant smoking to the vagaries of local regulation. <em>See Public Serv. Co. v. Town of Hampton, </em>120 N.H. 68, 71 (1980); <em>Stabler Corp., </em>122 N.H. at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The town argues that because the word \u201csanitation\u201d is related to \u201cpublic health,\u201d and because RSA 147:1, I, generally grants towns authority to regulate to protect the public health, RSA 155:77 preserves local authority to enact no-smoking standards that are more stringent than those under State law. Such an interpretation is strained at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Had the legislature intended to permit municipalities to enact stricter no-smoking standards to protect the public health, it could have explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>done so. In other statutory schemes, the legislature has explicitly authorized localities to enact more stringent requirements than those provided under State law. <em>See </em>RSA 485-C:20 (2001) (\u201cNothing in this chapter shall be deemed to preempt the authority of municipalities, under other statutes, to enact local ordinances or regulations affecting groundwater, other than groundwater withdrawals; provided, however, that requirements imposed under this chapter shall be considered as minimum.\u201d); RSA205-C:2, III (Supp. 2002) (\u201cNothing in this chapter shall be construed as ... superseding any local law... and all modular buildings and building components shall comply with all applicable state or local building requirements that exceed the modular building code____\u201d). We would therefore regard it as incongruous for the legislature to rely obliquely upon the reference to sanitation as establishing local control over smoking in restaurants to protect the public health. <em>See Town of Pelham v. Browning Ferris Indus, of </em>N.H., 141 N.H. 355,363 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The town\u2019s argument rests upon an overly broad interpretation of RSA 147:1, I. That statutory provision permits town health officers to \u201cmake regulations for the prevention and removal of nuisances, and such other regulations relating to public health as in their judgment the health and safety of the people require.\u201d It is part of a statutory scheme entitled, \u201cNUISANCES; TOILETS; DRAINS; EXPECTORATION; RUBBISH AND WASTE,\u201d which includes provisions related to municipal regulation of toilets, sewers and septic tanks, garbage, slaughterhouses, spitting, waste from fruit sold for retail, rubbish and discarded refrigerators. <em>See </em>RSA 147:8 (Supp. 2002), :9 (1996), :10 (Supp. 2002), :15 (Supp. 2002), :17-a (1996), :18 (1996), :19-:21-a (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">If we were to interpret RSA 147:1, I, as broadly as the town urges, the result would be \u201ca total abdication and delegation of legislative authority to towns, without any guidelines, supervision or legislative review whatsoever\u201d with respect to protecting the public health. <em>Girard v. Town of Allenstown, </em>121 N.H. 268,272 (1981); <em>see D.A.B.E. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>773 N.E.2d 536, 542 (Ohio 2002) (declining to interpret statute similar to RSA 147:1, I, as vesting \u201clocal boards of health with unlimited authority to adopt regulations addressing all public-health concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Such a sweeping interpretation of RSA 147:1, I, would potentially conflict with the New Hampshire Constitution, which grants municipalities only limited legislative authority. <em>See Girard, </em>121 N.H. at 272. Under the New Hampshire Constitution, \u201c[t]he supreme legislative power ... [is] vested in the senate and house of representatives.\u201d N.H. CONST, pt. II, art. 2. As subdivisions of the State, towns \u201chave only such powers as are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>expressly or impliedly granted to them by the legislature.\u201d <em>Public Serv. </em>Co., 120 N.H. at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We rejected a similar argument in <em>Casico, </em>142 N.H. at 317. At issue in <em>Casico </em>was a city ordinance requiring those selling alcoholic beverages on site to obtain a city-issued license in addition to the license required by the State statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 314. The city argued that because RSA 47:17, IV (1991) expressly authorized municipal regulation of liquor sales, the State statutory scheme governing the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages did not preempt the city ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We ruled that the State statutory scheme preempted the city ordinance, notwithstanding the general licensing authority conferred by RSA 47:17, IV. <em>Id. </em>In effect, the general authority conferred by 47:17, IV was suspended in operation while the State scheme for licensing and regulation of on-premises sales of alcoholic beverages remained in force. <em>Id.; see State v. Angelo, </em>71 N.H. 224, 228 (1902). Similarly, in this case, we conclude that whatever power towns may have to regulate to protect the public health under RSA 147:1,1, is subordinate to the State law governing indoor smoking in restaurants. <em>See Public Serv. Co., </em>120 N.H. at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Because the State indoor smoking law constitutes a comprehensive and detailed statutory scheme, and because we hold that there is no statutory provision permitting additional municipal regulation of smoking in restaurants, we conclude that the State law preempts the town ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The town asserts that the ordinance is not preempted because it is consistent with the overall goals of the State law. \u2018We have stated repeatedly that towns may not regulate a field that the State has preempted.\u201d <em>Stablex Corp., </em>122 N.H. at 1104 (quotation and brackets omitted). Because the State has preempted the field of regulating indoor smoking in restaurants to protect the public health, the town has no power to regulate that field. <em>See id.; see also Public Serv. Co., </em>120 N.H. at 71. The town ordinance, adopted specifically to protect the public health, is therefore inconsistent with and necessarily preempted by the State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">We need not address the parties\u2019 arguments concerning whether various provisions of the ordinance directly conflict with the State law. \u201cWhere the state has preempted the field, local law regulating the same subject is inconsistent with the state\u2019s transcendent interest, whether or not the terms of the local law actually conflict with the statewide legislation.\u201d 5 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 15.20, at 109 (3d ed. rev. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Brock, C.
