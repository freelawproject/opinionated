Jill Group, Inc. (J. Jill), and J. Jill\u2019s insurance carrier, Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Co. (Royal), appeal the dismissal by the New Hampshire Compensation Appeals Board (board) of J. Jill\u2019s appeal of a New Hampshire Department of Labor (DOL) decision finding it responsible for an injury the claimant suffered while working for the respondent, Lakes Region Manufacturing (Lakes Region). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">The relevant facts follow. The claimant injured her knee on November 10,1998, while working for J. Jill. She filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which J. Jill accepted, and received temporary disability benefits. The claimant left J. Jill\u2019s employ in May 1999. In October 1999, she began working for Lakes Region. On January 31,2000, while on a smoking break in the Lakes Region parking lot, the claimant fell. She filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which Lakes Region denied. In its denial, Lakes Region noted that the claimant was currently receiving treatment for the 1998 claim she had filed with J. Jill.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">The claimant requested a hearing before the DOL on the following issues: (1) the causal relationship of the January 31, 2000 injury to employment, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:2, XI (1999) (amended 2001); (2) the claimant\u2019s eligibility for disability, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:48 (1999); and (3) payment for the claimant\u2019s medical expenses, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:23 (1999). The claimant, Lakes Region and J. Jill were all represented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">At the hearing, the claimant argued that the January 31,2000 injury was a new work-related injury for which Lakes Region was responsible. Lakes Region denied responsibility for the claimant\u2019s medical bills and disability payments on the ground that she did not suffer any injury on January 31, 2000. It argued that the claimant submitted an injury report because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>knew that her job was at risk for poor attendance, not because she suffered an additional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">J. Jill asserted that it was not responsible for the claimant\u2019s medical bills and disability payments following her January 31, 2000 injury because the injury was not causally connected to the November 1998 injury. J. Jill argued that it ceased being responsible for the claimant\u2019s medical bills as of June 1999, when her medical condition following the November 1998 injury stabilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Neither employer asserted that the other employer was responsible for the claimant\u2019s medical bills and disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In a March 9, 2001 decision, the DOL hearing officer determined that the January 31, 2000 injury was causally connected to the November 1998 injury, and, therefore, J. Jill remained responsible for the claimant\u2019s medical bills and disability payments. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:23, I. On March 14, 2001, J. Jill notified the DOL of its intent to appeal to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The claimant did not appeal the DOL\u2019s decision. However, on March 21, 2001, she requested a DOL hearing regarding Royal\u2019s February 2001 refusal to pay her medical bills for treatment she received from July 1999 through October 2000. In its letters denying payment for the bills, Royal stated that the bills were unrelated to the November 10,1998 incident. The claimant requested the DOL to schedule a hearing on her medical bill issue after the board resolved J. Jill\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The board scheduled a hearing for August 21, 2001. On August 20th, J. Jill notified the board that its carrier had settled its claim with the claimant and had assigned to her its appellate rights. J. Jill informed the board that it did not intend to appear at the August 21, 2001 hearing and that it understood that the claimant would proceed with \u201cthe appeal against Lakes Region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">At the August 21, 2001 hearing, the board defaulted J. Jill. Following additional motion practice by the parties, the board rescinded the default and remanded the case for a hearing on the settlement reached between J. Jill, Royal, and the claimant. The board also dismissed J. Jill\u2019s appeal because \u201cthe party that brought the appeal has settled its remaining disputed issues with the claimant, thereby withdrawing its appeal, and no further appealed issues remain pending.\u201d J. Jill and the claimant moved for reconsideration, which the board denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\u201cWe will overturn the board\u2019s decision only for errors of law, or if we are satisfied by a clear preponderance of the evidence before us that the decision is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Staniels, </em>142 N.H. 794, 796 (1998); <em>see </em>RSA 541:13 (1997). The board\u2019s factual findings are <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. <em>See </em>RSA 541:13. As the appealing parties, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>claimant, J. Jill and Royal have the burden of demonstrating that the board\u2019s decision was erroneous. <em>Staniels, </em>142 N.H. at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The petitioners first argue that the board erroneously dismissed J. Jill\u2019s appeal because the claimant was statutorily entitled to have all of the issues she raised before the DOL heard by the board at the August 21, 2001 hearing. The petitioners argue that as a result of J. Jill\u2019s appeal, \u201cit was unnecessary for any other party to file an appeal\u201d because, by statute, the board would hear J. Jill\u2019s appeal <em>\u201cde novo.\u201d See </em>RSA 281~A:43, 1(b) (1999) (requiring board to hold a \u201cfull hearing\u201d on appeal from DOL decision); N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Lab 201.01 (defining \u201cde novo hearing,\u201d in part, as a \u201cnew hearing which is not bound by the findings and rulings of a previous hearing before the commissioner or hearing officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">This court is the final arbiter of legislative intent as expressed in the language of a statute. <em>Appeal of Denton, </em>147 N.H. 259, 260 (2002). \u201cWe interpret statutes not in isolation, but in the context of the overall statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Appeal of Holloran, </em>147 N.H. 177, 179 (2001). \u201cAlthough we give undefined language its plain and ordinary meaning, we must keep in mind the intent of the legislation, which is determined by examining the construction of the statute as a whole, and not simply by examining isolated words and phrases found therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We construe provisions' of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law liberally, \u201cresolving all reasonable doubts in statutory construction in favor of the injured employee in order to give the broadest reasonable effect to its remedial purpose.\u201d <em>Denton, </em>147 N.H. at 260 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The petitioners\u2019 statutory construction is flawed. RSA 281-A:43, 1(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">An appeal from a decision of the commissioner or the commissioner\u2019s authorized representative shall be taken to the board no later than 30 days from the date of such decision. Upon the filing of an appeal the board shall ... hold a full hearing on the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">On its face, this statute mandates that an appeal be filed \u201cno later than 30 days\u201d from the DOL\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">RSA 281-A:50 (1999) permits \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner who was prevented from appealing from such decision within 30 days through mistake, accident, or misfortune and not through the person\u2019s own neglect\u201d to petition the board at any time within one year of the DOL\u2019s decision to be allowed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Together these statutes limit the right to appeal from a DOL decision to those who are \u201caggrieved\u201d by it. These statutes make clear that the failure to file a timely appeal is fatal to a party\u2019s right to pursue an appeal, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the party petitions pursuant to RSA 281-A:50 and the board grants the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">In this case, assuming, without deciding, that she was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the DOL\u2019s decision, the claimant lost her right to pursue her claims on appeal to the board because she did not file a timely appeal. Nor did she bring a petition pursuant to RSA 281-A:50. Thus, we reject the petitioners\u2019 assertion that the claimant had a statutory right to pursue her claims on appeal to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The petitioners mistakenly rely upon cases in which we have interpreted the phrase \u201cfull hearing\u201d to mean that the board conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of \u201cissues raised in the [DOL] proceedings being appealed.\u201d <em>Sf,aniels, </em>142 N.H. at 796 (quotation omitted). They argue that, pursuant to these cases, the appeal by <em>any </em>party requires the board to review <em>all </em>issues raised in the DOL proceedings, regardless of whether they were appealed. To the contrary, the board\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of an appeal does not confer upon non-appealing parties the right to pursue their claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Alternatively, the petitioners contend that dismissal was inappropriate because the settlement between J. Jill and the claimant included a valid assignment of J. Jill\u2019s appeal rights. Assuming, without deciding, that J. Jill validly assigned its appeal rights to the claimant, we disagree that the assignment conferred upon the claimant the right to pursue her own claims on appeal to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">At most, the assignment conferred upon her the right to pursue J. Jill\u2019s claims on appeal. The assignment did not give the claimant the right to pursue her claim that Lakes Region was responsible for the January 31, 2000 injury on appeal. While the claimant argued at the DOL hearing that Lakes Region was responsible for her January 31, 2000 injury, J. Jill did not make this argument before the DOL and could not have made the argument on appeal to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The petitioners\u2019 final argument is that given the claimant\u2019s alleged statutory right to raise issues before the board on appeal and the valid assignment, dismissing the appeal violated her State constitutional right to due process. Having rejected this argument\u2019s premises, we need not reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-9\">Broderick, Nadeau, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
