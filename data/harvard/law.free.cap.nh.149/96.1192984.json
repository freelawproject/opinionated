We have consolidated these cases for decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The record reveals the following facts. On August 31, 2001, the petitioner filed with the BTLA two documents entitled, \u201cPetition for Abatement of Real Estate Taxes.\u201d One document pertained to Laconia\u2019s refusal to abate the petitioner\u2019s real estate taxes for the 2000 tax year; the other document pertained to Sandwich\u2019s refusal to abate the petitioner\u2019s 2000 tax year taxes. Each petition asserted that it was filed \u201cpursuant to Chapter 76, Section 16-a of the Revised Statutes Annotated.\u201d Each petition alleged that the valuations used by the municipalities failed \u201cto properly assess the true fair market value of the premises based upon its condition, location, charitable status, encumbrances and particular circumstances.\u201d Each petition alleged that, as a result of the faulty valuations, the petitioner\u2019s property had been \u201cassessed at a value far in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>excess of its true market value and ha[d] been treated disproportionately to other similar properties,\u201d thus entitling the petitioner to an abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Each document was accompanied by a form entitled, \u201cRSA 76:16-a PROPERTY-TAX APPEAL TO BOARD OF TAX AND LAND APPEALS.\u201d In section F of the form, which asked the petitioner to state the reasons for its appeal, the petitioner stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Please see the taxpayers [sic] Petition attached hereto and incorporated herein as if fully set forth. The property is encumbered by life care contracts, other charitable obligations and governmental controls which impact the marketability and value of the property. The taxpayer asserts that the municipality has erroneously assessed this property. The Taylor Home is a non-profit, charitable organization providing elderly housing and resources for the senior population in the lakes region. The taxpayer reserves the right to rely upon legal arguments and legal data submitted in connection with its prior appeals and companion appeals against [the municipality].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In section G of the form, which asked the petitioner to state the market value of its property, the petitioner stated, \u201cn/a tax exempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">On October 31, 2001, the petitioner moved to reform its August 31, 2001 petitions to state that it also appealed the failure of the municipalities to grant charitable tax exemptions for the 2000 tax year. The BTLA denied the petitioner leave to reform its petitions and its subsequent motions for rehearing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">To prevail on its appeal, the petitioner must show that the BTLA\u2019s decisions were \u201cclearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d RSA 541:13 (1997); <em>see </em>RSA 71-B:12 (1991). The BTLA\u2019s factual findings are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The petitioner argues that it timely appealed the failure of the municipalities to grant charitable tax exemptions for the 2000 tax year. The petitioner concedes that RSA 72:34-a (Supp. 2002) required it to file these appeals by September 1, 2001, but contends that its August 31, 2001 petitions <em>were </em>appeals of the failure of the municipalities to grant charitable tax exemptions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">\u201cOur task is not to determine whether we would have found differently than did the board, or to re-weigh the evidence, but rather to determine whether the findings are supported by competent evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Appeal of Land Acquisition, </em>145 N.H. 492,496 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">There is competent evidence in the record to support the BTLA\u2019s finding that the August 31, 2001 petitions appealed the municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>abatement decisions, not the municipal charitable exemption decisions. The forms accompanying each petition were entitled, \u201cRSA 76:16-a PROPERTY-TAX APPEAL TO BOARD OF TAX AND LAND APPEALS.\u201d On each form, the petitioner stated that the reason for the appeal was that the respective municipality had \u201cerroneously assessed this property\u201d in light of the encumbrances on the property \u201cwhich impact the marketability and value of the property.\u201d In the petitions themselves, the petitioner stated that it sought \u201can abatement of real estate taxes\u201d assessed by the respective municipality because the municipality had failed to assess the property\u2019s true fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Although the petitions referred to the petitioner as a \u201cnon-profit, charitable organization\u201d and stated that its market value was \u201cn/a tax exempt,\u201d the petitions did not state that the petitioner had been denied a charitable exemption. Nor did the petitions state the grounds for appealing the denial of an exemption. The only reference to an appeal of the denial of a charitable exemption was the following: \u201cThe Petition [sic] has filed, by separate appeal to the BTLA, a claim for exemption of real estate taxes on this property for 2000 and ... prior exemption appeals are pending before the BTLA for the years 1997 through 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Given this evidence, we hold that it was reasonable for the BTLA to treat the August 31, 2001 petitions as appeals of the municipalities\u2019 failure to abate taxes, rather than as appeals of the municipalities\u2019 failure to grant charitable tax exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The petitioner argues that by treating the August 31, 2001 petitions as appeals of the abatement decisions, the BTLA violated its own procedural rules. The petitioner asserts that the BTLA should have treated the August 31, 2001 petitions as non-conforming documents and, pursuant to New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Tax 201.17 (Rule 201.17), should have returned them and given the petitioner time to file conforming documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We agree with the BTLA that Rule 201.17 does not apply to the August 31, 2001 petitions. Rule 201.17 applies only to documents that do not comply \u201cwith any statute or board rule.\u201d N.H. Admin. RULES, Tax 201.17. It is undisputed that the petitions complied with the statutes and rules governing abatement appeals. Thus, they were not \u201cnon-conforming\u201d documents under Rule 201.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The petitioner next asserts that the August 31, 2001 petitions complied with the statute governing appeals of exemption decisions, and, thus, as a matter of law, the BTLA should have considered them to be appeals of the municipalities\u2019 failure to grant the petitioner charitable exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201cOn questions of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. When a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute for further indication of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Appeal of Meunier, </em>147 N.H. 546, 548 (2002) (citations omitted). \u201c[W]e interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Appeal of Brady, </em>145 N.H. 308, 310 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">RSA 72:34-a (Supp. 2002) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Whenever the selectmen or assessors refuse to grant an applicant an exemption... to which the applicant may be entitled under the provisions of RSA 72:23 ... the applicant may appeal in writing, on or before September 1 following the date of notice of tax under RSA 72:l-d, to the board of tax and land appeals or the superior court----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The petitioner asserts that because its petitions were \u201cin writing\u201d and were filed with the BTLA before September 1, 2001, they complied with RSA 72:34-a. This argument ignores the BTLA\u2019s regulations, however, which set forth the requisite content of appeals brought pursuant to RSA 72:34-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">According to the BTLA\u2019s rules, to appeal the denial of a tax exemption, a taxpayer must file with the BTLA, among other items, \u201c[a] complete and specific statement of the grounds supporting the appeal.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Tax 204.03(c)(4). As previously discussed, the August 31, 2001 petitions provided statements of the grounds for appealing the municipalities\u2019 abatement decisions, but did not provide statements of the grounds for appealing the exemption decisions. Moreover, the BTLA\u2019s regulations require an exemption appeal to include a \u201ccopy of the exemption application filed with the municipality and a statement of the municipality\u2019s action on the application.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Tax 204.03(c)(5). The August 31, 2001 petitions did not attach this information. Thus, the petitions did not comply with the BTLA\u2019s rules regarding appealing municipal exemption decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The petitioner next asserts that because its August 31, 2001 petitions put the municipalities on notice that it intended to appeal their exemption decisions, the BTLA should have accepted the petitions as appeals of the exemption decisions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">We need not decide whether our traditionally liberal approach to court pleadings applies to administrative proceedings because, at most, the August 31, 2001 petitions gave notice of the petitioner\u2019s intent to file its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>appeals of the exemption decisions separately from its appeals of the abatement decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Moreover, regardless of the petitioner\u2019s intent, the record shows that it did <em>not </em>appeal the exemption decisions by September 1, 2001, as required by RSA 72:34-a, thus depriving the BTLA of jurisdiction over these appeals. <em>See Phetteplace v. Town of Lyme, </em>144 N.H. 621, 624 (2000). Filing an appeal in a timely manner \u201cis a <em>necessary prerequisite </em>to establishing jurisdiction in the appellate body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625 (quotation omitted). The failure to file a timely appeal \u201cis fatal regardless of accident, mistake, or misfortune.\u201d <em>Appeal of Estate of Van Lunen, </em>145 N.H. 82, 86 (2000); <em>see Appeal of Roketenetz, </em>122 N.H. 869, 870 (1982) (affirming BTLA\u2019s dismissal of appeal of selectmen\u2019s refusal to act on abatement request, even though appeal was only five days late).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The petitioner argues that in <em>East Coast Conference of the Evangelical Covenant Church of America, Inc. v. Town of Swanzey, </em>146 N.H. 658, 660 (2001), we approved the trial court\u2019s determination that a church\u2019s failure to include its charitable exemption appeal in its appeal of a denial of a religious exemption was a non-fatal clerical error. To the contrary, we did not decide whether the trial court\u2019s determination was correct because the parties did not contest this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Finally, the petitioner asserts that the period for filing a timely appeal of Laconia\u2019s failure to grant a charitable tax exemption was extended for two months pursuant to Laws 1995, 265:18 (codified as RSA 76:16-d, I (repealed 2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">RSA 76:16-d, I, provided that two months would be added to the deadlines in RSA 72:34-a \u201cin the effective year of a property revaluation for towns having 9,000 or more parcels.\u201d Laws 1995, 265:18. The BTLA conducted an evidentiary hearing on whether Laconia had the requisite number of parcels for RSA 76:16-d, I, to apply. Because the BTLA\u2019s finding that Laconia lacked the requisite 9,000 parcels in tax year 2000 is supported by the evidence, we affirm its ruling that RSA 76:16-d, I, did not apply to the petitioner\u2019s appeal. As the petitioner notes, \u201cRSA 76:16-d concerns itself with the actual parcel count.\u201d Thus, the petitioner\u2019s subjective belief that Laconia had more than 9,000 parcels is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-10\">Brock, C.J., and Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
