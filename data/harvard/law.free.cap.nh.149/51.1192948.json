We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">The intervenors own a lot approximately three acres in size, located in an R-1A zoning district, a lower-density residential zoning district. The rear of the lot is much larger than the front. The intervenors purchased the property in 2000, after having confirmed that the city\u2019s zoning ordinance permitted them to stable horses on the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">In May 2001, after contracting to build a single-family home on the lot, the intervenors applied for a permit to build a bam in which to stable two horses. The, barn was to be constructed on one and one-half acres located in the rear part of the lot. The permit was denied, however, because the city had. recently amended its zoning ordinance to prohibit livestock, including horses, in an R-1A zoning district. Accordingly, the intervenors applied for a variance, which, following a hearing, the ZBA granted. The plaintiffs appealed to the superior court, and the superior court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Adp\">We will uphold the superior court\u2019s decision on appeal unless it is not supported by the evidence or is legally erroneous. <em>Morgenstern v. Town of Rye, </em>147 N.H. 558, 565 (2002). For its part, the superior court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>shall not set aside or vacate the ZBA\u2019s decision \u201cexcept for errors of law, unless the court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that said order or decision is unreasonable.\u201d RSA 677:6 (1996). \u201cTo the extent the ZBA made findings upon questions of fact properly before the court, those findings are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable.\u201d <em>Morgenstem, </em>147 N.H. at 565; <em>see </em>RSA 677:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">RSA 674:33,1(b) (1996) authorizes a zoning board of adjustment to grant a variance if the following conditions are met: (1) the variance will not be \u201ccontrary to the public interest\u201d; (2) \u201cspecial conditions\u201d exist such that \u201ca literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship\u201d; (3) \u201cthe spirit of the ordinance shall be observed\u201d; and (4) \u201csubstantial justice\u201d will be done. Only the second condition, \u201cunnecessary hardship,\u201d is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We recently articulated a new definition of \u201cunnecessary hardship.\u201d <em>See Simplex Technologies v. Town of Newington, </em>145 N.H. 727, 731-32 (2001). In so doing, we departed from our traditionally restrictive approach to this requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Before <em>Simplex, </em>to establish \u201cunnecessary hardship,\u201d an applicant for a variance had to show that a zoning ordinance unduly restricted the use of their land. <em>Id. </em>at 730; <em>see Governor\u2019s Island Club v. Town of Gilford, </em>124 N.H. 126, 130 (1983). For hardship to exist, the deprivation resulting from applying the ordinance had to be \u201cso great as to effectively prevent the owner from making <em>any </em>reasonable use of the land.\u201d <em>Governor\u2019s Island Club, </em>124 N.H. at 130 (emphasis added). The focus of the prior test was on \u201c[t]he uniqueness of the land, not the plight of the owner.\u201d <em>Grey Rocks Land Trust v. Town of Hebron, </em>136 N.H. 239, 243 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In <em>Simplex, </em>we held that our prior test was \u201ctoo restrictive in light of the constitutional protections by which it must be tempered.\u201d <em>Simplex, </em>145 N.H. at 731. We thus adopted an approach that was more considerate of a property owner\u2019s constitutional right to use his or her property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Under <em>Simplex, </em>to establish \u201cunnecessary hardship,\u201d an applicant for a variance must show that: (1) a zoning restriction applied to the property interferes with the applicant\u2019s \u201creasonable use of the property, considering the unique setting of the property in its environment\u201d; (2) \u201cno fair and substantial relationship exists between the general purposes of the zoning ordinance and the specific restriction on the property\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe variance would not injure the public or private rights of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731-32. Under <em>Simplex, </em>applicants no longer must show that the zoning ordinance deprives them of any reasonable use of the land. <em>Id. </em>at 730-32. Rather, they must show that the use for which they seek a variance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201creasonable,\u201d considering the property\u2019s unique setting in its environment. <em>Id. </em>at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The plaintiffs assert that the intervenors were not entitled to a variance because there were no \u201cspecial conditions\u201d that warranted it. <em>See </em>RSA 674:33, 1(b). To support their argument, however, they mistakenly rely upon case law developed before <em>Simplex. </em>Whereas before <em>Simplex, </em>hardship existed only when special conditions of the land rendered it uniquely unsuitable for the use for which it was zoned, <em>see Margate Motel, Inc. v. Town of Gilford, </em>130 N.H. 91, 94 (1987), after <em>Simplex, </em>hardship exists when special conditions of the land render the use for which the variance is sought \u201creasonable.\u201d In the first prong of the <em>Simplex </em>test, \u201cspecial conditions\u201d are referred to as the property\u2019s \u201cunique setting... in its environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Both the trial court and the ZBA could rationally have found that the zoning ordinance precluding horses in an R-1A district interfered with the intervenors\u2019 reasonable proposed use of their property, considering its unique setting. Evidence before the ZBA showed that the intervenors\u2019 lot was located in a country setting. Evidence before the ZBA also showed that the lot was larger than most of the surrounding lots and was uniquely configured in that the rear portion of the lot was considerably larger than the front. The ZBA also had evidence that there was a \u201cthick wooded buffer\u201d around the proposed paddock area. Further, the area in which the intervenors proposed to keep the two horses constituted an acre and a half, which, according to the city\u2019s zoning laws, was more land than required to keep two livestock animals. The trial court and the ZBA could logically have concluded that these special conditions of the property made the proposed stabling of two horses on the property \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The plaintiffs argue that a use is not \u201creasonable\u201d unless it is established in the neighborhood or customarily associated with or consistent with established uses in the neighborhood. They cite no direct legal support for this argument, relying instead upon the law of accessory uses. We decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to extend the law of accessory uses to variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Because the plaintiffs do not otherwise challenge the trial court\u2019s rulings on the <em>Simplex </em>unnecessary hardship test on appeal, we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-10\">Broderick, Nadeau, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
