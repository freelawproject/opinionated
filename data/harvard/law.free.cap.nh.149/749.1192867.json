(ES) and its chief operating officer, William McNeir Richmond, appeal an order of the Superior Court (Fauver, J.). The. court awarded liquidated damages to ES\u2019 <em>former </em>employee, defendant Andrew Hutchinson, because ES willfully failed to pay his wages, found Richmond personally liable for those wages, and awarded Hutchinson attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">In December 1999, ES, a \u201cdot com\u201d Internet company, employed Hutchinson and five others. Richmond managed the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. ES had a history of borrowing money and began many payroll periods without sufficient funds to pay wages. Richmond was unable to borrow money to make the December 31 payroll. Consequently, Hutchinson never received wages of $3,615.98. Both ES and Richmond concede the validity of Hutchinson\u2019s wage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">Hutchinson filed claims against ES and Richmond with the New Hampshire Department of Labor (department), seeking both his unpaid wages and liquidated damages against both ES and Richmond. <em>See </em>RSA 275:44, IV (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">As a result of several proceedings, the department ruled that both ES and Richmond were liable for the unpaid wages. After finding that ES knowingly withheld wages despite having the financial ability to pay, the department ruled that ES was also liable for liquidated damages. These rulings were affirmed by the superior court, which also awarded Hutchinson attorney\u2019s fees. The superior court denied a cross-appeal by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Hutchinson on Richmond\u2019s personal liability for liquidated damages. Both ES and Richmond have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">ES argues the superior court erred in upholding the department\u2019s findings that: (1) ES had the financial ability to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages for purposes of awarding liquidated damages; and (2) ES acted willfully. Richmond argues that the superior court erred in affirming the department\u2019s ruling that he is personally liable for wages owed Hutchinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On appeal, we will not overturn an agency decision unless \u201cthere is an error of law, or when the order is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Young, </em>146 N.H. 216,217 (2001); <em>see </em>RSA 541:13 (1997). We will affirm the superior court\u2019s factual findings unless they are unsupported by the evidence and we will affirm the superior court\u2019s legal rulings unless they are erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Dow v. Town of Effingham, </em>148 N.H. 121,124 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We first address ES\u2019 argument that the superior court erred when it upheld the department\u2019s finding that ES had the financial ability to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages for purposes of awarding liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> Under RSA 275:44, IV (1999), \u201cif an employer willfully and without good cause fails to pay an employee wages as required under ... this section, such employer shall be additionally liable to the employee for liquidated damages.\u201d We have defined \u201cwillfully,\u201d in the context of an action for unpaid wages due under employment contracts, \u201cto mean voluntarily, with knowledge of the obligation and despite the financial ability to pay it.\u201d <em>Ives v. Manchester Subaru, Inc., </em>126 N.H. 796, 801 (1985). We noted that a \u201cwillful\u201d act did not include \u201can accident or an act committed on the basis of a mistake of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, no liquidated damages are available when an \u201cemployer\u2019s refusal to pay wages is based upon bona fide belief that he is not obligated to pay them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The department found that ES\u2019 unsecured interests in assets exceeded the wages owed Hutchinson and thus ES had the financial ability to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages. The superior court affirmed this finding. The record supports the department\u2019s findings. When ES ceased operations on December 31, 1999, it possessed in excess of 50,000 \u201cbarter dollars\u201d and two computer servers purchased in July 1999 for approximately $13,000. \u201cBarter dollars\u201d allow individuals and businesses to exchange goods and services and are convertible to money. An accounting firm determined the barter dollars, with a minimum exchange rate of $0.40 per barter dollar, had a total value of $20,000. Investors received some of those barter dollars and in January 2000, Richmond directed ES to repay a loan he personally made to ES with 7,400 barter dollars. The computer servers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>used to run ES\u2019 business were no longer needed when ES ceased operations. That the computer servers had value is evidenced by a secured note made against them in May 2000. Given the availability of these assets, the evidence supports the factual findings that ES had the financial ability to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">ES next argues that it did not act \u201cwillfully\u201d because it had a bona fide belief that it did not have the financial ability to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages. <em>See Ives, </em>126 N.H. at 801. While ES concedes the validity of the wage claim, it argues that the barter dollars and computer servers were illiquid assets, which supports its alleged belief that it was unable to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages. The record, however, shows that ES and Richmond knew that the barter dollars had value when Hutchinson\u2019s wages became due. In January 2000, Richmond directed ES to repay a loan to him with 7,400 barter dollars. ES and Richmond also knew that the computer servers had value when Hutchinson\u2019s wages became due. In December 1999, Richmond testified he knew a creditor was trying to attach the computer servers and in May 2000, he secured a note against them. The superior court properly upheld the department\u2019s finding that ES did not have a bona fide belief that it did not have the financial ability to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages. <em>See Ives, </em>126 N.H. at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Finally, we consider whether the superior court erred in upholding the department\u2019s ruling that Richmond is personally liable for Hutchinson\u2019s wages. An \u201cofficerD of a corporation ... who knowingly permit[s] the corporation to violate the provisions of RSA 275:43, 44 shall be deemed to be the employer[] of the employees of the corporation.\u201d RSA 275:42, V (Supp. 2002). The issue of \u201cpersonal liability therefore turns on whether [the officer] knowingly permitted the violation\u201d of RSA 275:43, :44 (1999). <em>Ives, </em>126 N.H. at 803; <em>see also Rosenzweig v. Morton, </em>144 N.H. 9, 11 (1999). In <em>Ives, </em>we stated that if the corporation acted willfully through its officer, the officer \u201cknowingly permitted the violation so as to subject him to personal liability under RSA 275:42, V.\u201d <em>Ives, </em>126 N.H. at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The department found Richmond had responsibility <em>for </em>the company\u2019s day-to-day operations and knew ES lacked sufficient funds to meet the December 31 payroll. The department also found that Richmond knew of the availability of the barter dollars and computer servers to generate funds. Richmond directed ES to repay a personal loan to himself with barter dollars and knew the computer servers had value by using them to secure a loan. Thus, the department found Richmond knowingly permitted ES not to pay Hutchinson\u2019s wages. Because Richmond knowingly permitted ES to violate RSA 275:43, the department and the superior court properly found him personally liable under RSA 275:42.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b785-4\">DALIANIS, J., concurred; FITZGERALD, Hicks and VAUGHAN, JJ., superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
