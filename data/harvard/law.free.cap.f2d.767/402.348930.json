Archambault (hereinafter referred to as defendant) was convicted by a jury on six counts of knowingly concealing, removing, disposing of, or converting to her own use or that of another, with intent to defraud, cattle mortgaged or pledged to the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant appeals her convictions on various grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal are as follows: first, defendant argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658 does not include chattel mortgages; second, defendant argues that if 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658 does include property secured by chattel mortgages or security agreements, then the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions in that the government failed to produce a filed financing statement; and finally, defendant argues that a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658 is an imprisonment for debt in violation of Section 15 of Article VI of the South Dakota Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">With respect to defendant\u2019s first argument, the terms \u201cmortgaged or pledged\u201d are not defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658. In such cases, \u201cthe natural and commonly understood meaning will be given to words used in a statute unless it is plain or clear from the statute, or from the context of the words within the statute, or unless as otherwise indicated it is plain or clear from the circumstances that a different meaning was intended, and it must then appear what that different meaning is; or unless such construction would defeat the manifest intention of the legislature.\u201d 82 C.J.S. <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 329; <em>Escondido Mutual Water Co. v. La Jolla, Rincon, San Pasqual, Pauma, and Pala Bands of Mission Indians, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 104 S.Ct. 2105, 2110, 80 L.Ed.2d 753 (1984). If the plain language of the statute is clear in its context, it is controlling. <em>Blue Cross Association v. Harris, </em>622 F.2d 972, 977 (8th Cir.1980) <em>citing, Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 201, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1384, 47 L.ED.2d 668 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">We find that the language of the statute is clear in its context and that the phrase \u201cany property mortgaged or pledged to ... the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers\u2019 Home Administration\u201d includes any property in which the Farmers Home Administration has a chattel mortgage, lien, or security interest. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>United States v. Graziane, </em>376 F.2d 258 (2d Cir.1967) (chattel mortgage in cattle). As stated by the Court in <em>United States v. Kramel, </em>234 F.2d 577, 582 (8th Cir.1956), \u201csection 658 states a clear intention to protect the collateral given the Farmers Home Administration from <em>conscious fraud.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). The statute clearly states that it applies to <em>\u201cany </em>property\u201d not just to real property. Our holding here is consistent with the numerous decisions which have held that the statute applies to personal property in which the government has a security interest. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Bunker Livestock Commission, </em>437 F.Supp. 1079. (D.N.M.1977); <em>United States v. Bellman, </em>741 F.2d 1116 (8th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>666 F.2d 1385 (11th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Lisko, </em>747 F.2d 1234 (8th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Lott, </em>751 F.2d 717 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1852, 85 L.Ed.2d 150 (1985). Additionally, it is for the Congress and the federal Courts to define and clarify the terms of the statute, not the legislature of South Dakota. South Dakota\u2019s definitions of the terms \u201cmortgage\u201d or \u201csecurity interest\u201d are, therefore, irrelevant to the construction of this federal criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">Defendant\u2019s second argument, namely, that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions since the government failed to produce a filed financing statement covering the cattle, is without merit. Under South Dakota Law, the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that must be applied in determining the validity of the FmHA\u2019s security interest,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the jury below, implicitly and correctly found that the FmHA held a valid security in defendant\u2019s cattle and that this security interest was enforceable against the defendant. <em>See, </em>Section 57A-9-203, South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL). The government\u2019s failure to produce a filed financing statement is irrelevant to the enforceability of the FmHA\u2019s security agreement against the defendant. <em>See </em>sections 57A-9-201 and 57A-9-301 et seq., SDCL. Since the FmHA had a valid security interest in defendant\u2019s cattle, that cattle constituted \u201cany property mortgaged or pledged to ... the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers\u2019 Home Administration ...\u201d We, therefore, find that the evidence was sufficient to show that the FmHA had a valid mortgage on defendant\u2019s cattle and that the evidence was sufficient to support her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Finally, defendant argues that her conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658 constitutes an imprisonment for debt. Defendant\u2019s argument is flawed. She was not convicted of defaulting on her loan from the FmHA. She was convicted of concealing, removing, disposing of, or converting to her own use or that of another, with intent to defraud, property in which the FmHA had a security interest. The crime here \u201cgoes beyond failure to pay a civil debt and constitutes fraudulent conversion\u201d of FmHA\u2019s collateral to her own use. <em>See, United States v. Bellman, </em>741 F.2d 1116, 1118 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Therefore, based upon the foregoing, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658 provides fines and imprisonments for \"whoever, with intent to defraud, knowingly conceals, removes, disposes of, or converts to his own use or that of another, any property mortgaged or pledged to, or held by, ... the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers\u2019 Home Administration____\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-19\">.
