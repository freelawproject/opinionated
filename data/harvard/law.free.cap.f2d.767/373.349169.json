Sharlow contends that the Wisconsin trial court denied him his Sixth Amendment right of compulsory process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution when the trial court excluded from evidence allegedly exculpatory hearsay statements of two defense witnesses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-26\">The facts relating to the conviction of the petitioner Sharlow for first-degree murder are summarized in <em>State v. Sharlow, </em>110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Wis.2d 226, 327 N.W.2d 692 (1983), and are presumed correct unless not \u201cfairly supported by the record.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8). The petitioner does not challenge the following factual narrative contained in the opinion of the Wisconsin Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cOn the night of May 1, 1972, Thomas Blanchette and Jerry Kruschke were at Sally\u2019s Tavern in the city of Milwaukee: The victim, Edwin Harry Frahm, later joined them at the bar and the three left Sally\u2019s, inviting the bartender, Randall Lydolph, to meet them at the Driftwood Tavern for a drink. After closing Sally\u2019s, Lydolph went to the Driftwood. When Lydolph arrived at the Driftwood, he did not notice whether Sharlow was with Blanchette, Kruschke and Frahm. At Sharlow\u2019s trial, Lydolph testified that he overheard a conversation in the men\u2019s room between Sharlow and Blanchette in which Blanchette stated, \u2018I\u2019m going to get this little fink,\u2019 referring to Frahm. Sharlow said, \u2018Let me do it; I want him,\u2019 and Blanchette replied, \u2018No, he\u2019s mine.\u2019 After Blanchette and Sharlow came out of the men\u2019s room, the two stood and talked for \u2018about two minutes.\u2019 Lydolph also saw Kruschke leave the Driftwood \u2018about three times.\u2019 Each time Kruschke returned, he engaged in a conversation with Blanchette. Lydolph did not remember where Sharlow was at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201cKruschke, who had been granted immunity, testified that he had left the tavern to go back to the apartment he shared with Blanchette and get Blanchette\u2019s revolver. He came back because he couldn\u2019t get into the apartment. Finally, Arthur McConkey, a neighbor, gave the gun to Kruschke. Kruschke gave the revolver to Blanchette in the men\u2019s room at the Driftwood. This occurred before Sharlow\u2019s conversation with Blanchette in the men\u2019s room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cLydolph saw a group of four or five people, which included at least Kruschke and Frahm, leave the tavern together. He observed them drive off in a Corvair. Kruschke testified that he, Blanchette, Frahm and Sharlow left the Driftwood, driving off in Sharlow\u2019s Corvair. Kruschke was driving, at Blanchette\u2019s request; Frahm was in the front passenger seat; and Blanchette and Sharlow were in the rear seat. Sharlow was seated behind Frahm, and Blanchette was behind the driver. Kruschke testified that he heard a shot ring out and saw Frahm slump in the seat. Kruschke immediately looked in the rearview mirror and saw Sharlow holding the gun. At the same time, Sharlow was asking Blanchette if Sharlow would give Kruschke \u2018a couple.\u2019 Blanchette replied, \u2018Leave him alone; he\u2019s all right.\u2019 Blanchette then told Sharlow, \u2018Give him [Frahm] another one.\u2019 After more shots were fired, Kruschke saw Sharlow hand the revolver to Blanchette. Blanchette then directed Kruschke to drive to the spot where Frahm\u2019s body was found. Kruschke testified that Blanchette and Sharlow dragged the body to a creek, where they disposed of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cTwo days later, Frahm\u2019s body was discovered in a creek in New Berlin. A spent red cartridge and red spots were found on a nearby driveway. An autopsy showed that the victim had been shot in the head five times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cAt the trial, the pathologist testified that at least two of the bullets were fired at very close range \u2014 one to five inches. All of the wound trajectories angled downward and to the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201cCodefendant Blanchette\u2019s trial was severed from Sharlow\u2019s. At Sharlow\u2019s trial, the defense called Blanchette as a witness; however, Blanchette invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201cThe defense then proferred the testimony of Sharon Henne and James McNeal. If permitted to testify, Henne would have testified that Blanchette told her that \u2018he was the one that had shot this person six times in the head,\u2019 and that on another occasion, Blanchette asked her \u2018if I would believe him if he told me that he had not actually done the shooting but that A1 [Sharlow] did and he wasn\u2019t going to \u201csit\u201d any more for some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>thing he didn\u2019t do.\u2019 She also would have stated that she had known Blanchette for three months and had seen him daily in that period. If permitted to testify, McNeal would have testified that he shared a jail cell with Blanchette and that Blanchette told him [more than one month after the crime] that while in the car, he solicited Sharlow to participate in the murder; that Sharlow refused and grabbed Blanchette\u2019s arm and struggled with him in an attempt to prevent the shooting; that Blanchette shot Frahm after he wrestled the gun from Sharlow; and that he and Kruschke were roommates and shared a homosexual relationship, a relationship denied by Kruschke at trial. (Explanation added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><em>Sharlow, </em>110 Wis.2d at 228-31, 327 N.W.2d at 693-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Sharlow claims, as he has throughout his direct and collateral attacks on the guilty verdict, that the trial court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense when it excluded Henne\u2019s and McNeal\u2019s hearsay testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1045, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201cThe right of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State\u2019s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The <em>Chambers </em>decision held that the defendant Chambers was denied a fair trial when a Mississippi trial court ruled that the defendant could not impeach his own witness, a Mr. MacDonald, who had previously confessed to committing the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court also held that the defendant was denied a fair trial when the trial court refused to allow three of MacDonald\u2019s friends to present hearsay testimony that MacDonald confessed committing the crime to them shortly after the crime\u2019s occurrence. Similar to the situation in <em>Chambers, </em>the Wisconsin trial court did not allow Sharlow to present two witnesses, Henne and McNeal, who according to the offer of proof made to the trial court would have testified that Blanchette had committed the murder. At the time of the <em>Chambers </em>decision, Mississippi\u2019s rules of evidence like Wisconsin\u2019s rules did not recognize the hearsay exception for statements made against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">In a portion of its opinion addressing hearsay concerns, the <em>Chambers </em>Court noted the basis upon which hearsay rules of exclusion are formulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">\u201cThe hearsay rule, which has long been recognized and respected by virtually every State, is based on experience and grounded in the notion that untrustworthy evidence should not be presented to triers of fact. Out-of-court statements are traditionally excluded because they lack the conventional indicia of reliability____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 298, 93 S.Ct. at 1047. However, the Court held that under the facts in <em>Chambers, </em>the evidence was critical to Chambers\u2019 defense and evidenced a sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and, thus, the ruling of the Mississippi trial court denying the defense the opportunity to present testimony of three witnesses exculpating Chambers denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">\u201cFew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense____ In the exercise of this right, the accused, as is required of the State, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. Although perhaps no rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied in jury trials than that applicable to the exclusion of hearsay, exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed____ Under these circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 302, 93 S.Ct. at 1049. In assessing the reliability of the hearsay testimony, the Court found that the statements contained a \u201cpersuasive assurance of trustworthiness,\u201d as: (1) the confession was spontaneously made to two close acquaintances shortly after the murder occurred; (2) each statement was corroborated at trial by other independent evidence; (3) the confession was self-incriminating and unquestionably against penal interest; and (4) the declarant, MacDonald, was available for cross-examination by the State at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 300-01, 93 S.Ct. at 1048. The Court in <em>Chambers </em>emphasized that it was restricting its holding to the facts before it. <em>Id. </em>at 303, 93 S.Ct. at 1049. Thus, the factors just mentioned in the decision assessing reliability of hearsay testimony should not be considered exhaustive or absolute. <em>See United States v. Guillette, </em>547 F.2d 743, 754 (2d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 839, 98 S.Ct. 132, 54 L.Ed.2d 102 (1977). Although <em>Chambers </em>was decided on due process grounds, under the facts of this case the <em>Chambers </em>analysis is equally applicable to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With these standards in mind, we turn to the excluded hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">At trial, Sharlow offered the testimony of Blanchette\u2019s girlfriend, Sharon Henne. If allowed to testify, Henne would have stated that Blanchette confessed to her that he shot and killed Frahm. Henne would have also stated that just prior to Blanchette\u2019s arrest, Blanchette asked \u201cif I would believe him if he told me that he had not actually done the shooting but that A1 [Sharlow] did and he wasn\u2019t going to \u2018sit\u2019 any more for something he didn\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">In <em>Chambers, </em>the Supreme Court, in addressing the importance of admitting evidence excluded under the hearsay rule, adopted a balancing approach in weighing the State\u2019s legitimate interest in formulating rules of evidence to conduct its trials against the defendant\u2019s need for the evidence and the evidence\u2019s trustworthiness. <em>See Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S.Ct. at 1049; <em>see also Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 97, 99 S.Ct 2150, 2151, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979); <em>Alicea v. Gagnon, </em>675 F.2d 913, 923 (7th Cir.1982); <em>McMorris v. Israel, </em>643 F.2d 458, 461 (7th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 967, 102 S.Ct. 1479, 71 L.Ed.2d 684 (1982). In assessing the defendant\u2019s need for the evidence, <em>Chambers </em>stated that the evidence must be \u201ccritical.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S.Ct. at 1049. In <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982), the Supreme Court shed some light on what it considers as \u201ccritical\u201d evidence when it noted that the right to compulsory process as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment \u201csuggests that more than a mere absence of testimony is necessary to establish a violation of the right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867, 102 S.Ct. at 3446. Rather, the Court stated that the excluded evidence must be <em>\u201crelevant </em>and <em>material and </em>... <em>vital </em>to the defendants,\u201d <em>id. </em>citing <em>Washington v. Tex</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>as, </em>388 U.S. 14, 16, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1969), to a degree sufficient to establish that the exclusion of the evidence could have \u201c \u2018affected the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. at 868, 102 S.Ct. at 3446 citing <em>United States v. Augurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). Thus, as the district court explained in this case, \u201ccritical evidence is evidence which would make a material difference to the outcome of Sharlow\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Henne\u2019s testimony concerning hearsay statements made by Blanchette where he admitted that he shot Frahm was not critical to Sharlow\u2019s defense since Sharlow was also charged under the Wisconsin\u2019s party to a crime statute, <em>see </em>Wis.Stat. \u00a7 939.05,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides that a person may be a party to a crime if he directly commits the crime, aids or abets in the commission of it, or is a party to a conspiracy with another to commit the crime. While Henne\u2019s testimony did inculpate Blanchette, her testimony was not critical to Sharlow\u2019s case because it did not excul-' pate Sharlow from being a party to the crime of murder; thus, under the facts presented to the jury, Sharlow could still be found guilty for Frahm\u2019s murder under Wisconsin\u2019s party to a crime statute. The state presented Lydolph, a prosecution witness who testified that he overheard a conversation in the bathroom between Sharlow and Blanchette wherein Sharlow told Blanchette that he would \u201cget him\u201d for Blanchette. Further, the State introduced sufficient evidence to establish that Sharlow was present at the murder scene, was seated in his own car behind the victim Frahm at the time of the murder, and helped dispose of the victim\u2019s (Frahm\u2019s) body. The combination of Sharlow\u2019s actions including his promise to \u201cget him,\u201d his presence in the car during the murder and his helping to dispose of the body would be sufficient to convict Sharlow as a party to the crime of first-degree murder, regardless of who pulled the trigger of the gun. <em>See State v. Sharlow, </em>110 Wis.2d at 235, 327 N.W.2d at 697.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The other defense witness McNeal, if allowed to testify, would have stated that he was Blanchette\u2019s cellmate during the time Blanchette was confined to the county jail. During his period of confinement, Blanchette told McNeal, some one month after the crime occurred, that while in the car he (Blanchette) asked Sharlow to participate in the murder but Sharlow refused; subsequently, Blanchette and Sharlow struggled in the car after Sharlow allegedly grabbed Blanchette\u2019s arm in an attempt to prevent, the shooting. According to the offer of proof made at trial, McNeal further would have stated that Blanchette had told him that once he had broken free from Sharlow, he (Blanchette) shot Frahm. This testimony was \u201ccritical\u201d to Sharlow\u2019s defense since it could have exculpated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Sharlow from the murder of Frahm; however, McNeal\u2019s testimony fails to meet any of the criteria mentioned in <em>Chambers </em>for evaluating the reliability or trustworthiness of hearsay testimony (i.e., statements made to a close acquaintance, corroboration, statements against penal interest and availability of declarant for cross-examination).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In <em>Chambers, </em>the statements were \u201cmade spontaneously to close acquaintances <em>...\u201d </em>yet in this case Blanchette made the statements to McNeal, a mere cellmate, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that McNeal was a close acquaintance of Blanchette. Further, the critical portion of McNeal\u2019s testimony exculpating Sharlow from guilt for the crime where Blanchette allegedly told McNeal that he (Blanchette) had asked Sharlow to kill Frahm but that Sharlow refused and a struggle ensued between the two as Sharlow attempted to prevent the murder, fails to meet the test of corroboration as there is no evidence to support McNeal\u2019s secondhand, hearsay version of the event. Sharlow argues that the pathologist\u2019s testimony detailing that the bullets that killed Frahm proceeded in a downward angle and to the right through his head corroborate McNeal\u2019s testimony that Blanchette must have shot Frahm since Blanchette admittedly was seated in the back seat, behind Kruschke, and to the right of Frahm. However, as the Wisconsin Supreme Court in analyzing this argument noted in its opinion, the pathologist testified that she was unable to express an opinion as to the location of the weapon at the time it was fired, and that no such opinion would appear scientifically possible since there was no evidence in the record to establish the position of the victim\u2019s head at the time of the shooting. <em>Sharlow, </em>110 Wis.2d at 236, 327 N.W.2d at 697. Further, if we were to accept McNeal\u2019s testimony that Blanchette asked Sharlow to murder Frahm while they all were seated in the same car and, after Sharlow refused, the two men struggled for the gun, it seems most unlikely that Frahm would not have heard the conversation and would have continued to sit quietly by, entirely oblivious to the conversation as to who was to be the \u201chit\u201d man and the struggle over a loaded pistol, without making any attempt to escape. Henne\u2019s hearsay testimony that Blanchette confessed to her that he had shot Frahm also fails to corroborate the essential portion of McNeal\u2019s statement that there was a struggle between Sharlow and Blanchette for the gun prior to the shooting. While Henne\u2019s testimony does seem to corroborate that portion of McNeal\u2019s testimony wherein Blanchette admitted shooting Frahm, serious doubt is east upon Blanchette\u2019s confession considering that Blanchette shortly thereafter recanted his confession to Henne. Further, the jury was unable to assess Blanchette\u2019s credibility, the truthfulness of his alleged admission, or his recantation of the admission, since Blanchette invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at Sharlow\u2019s trial and thus was unavailable for direct or cross-examination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Sharlow finally argues that since Blanchette\u2019s statements were against Blanchette\u2019s penal interest<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and since Wiscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sin now allows the reception of such testimony as an exception to the hearsay rule, <em>see </em>Wis.Stats. \u00a7 908.045(4),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he should be granted a new trial. However, as the Wisconsin Supreme Court recognized, \u201cthis argument assumes too much, since under Sec. 908.045(4), Wis.Stats., Blanchette\u2019s statement would not be admissible unless corroborated.\u201d <em>Sharlow, </em>110 Wis.2d at 237-38 n. 9, 327 N.W.2d 692.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">When the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense collides with the State\u2019s interest in promulgating rules of evidence to govern the conduct of its trials, the merits of the respective positions must be weighed, and the State\u2019s interest must give way to the defendant\u2019s rights if its rules are \u201cmechanistically\u201d applied to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S.Ct. at 1049. In this case we hold that the hearsay rule was not \u201cmechanistically\u201d applied since Henne\u2019s hearsay testimony was not critical to Sharlow\u2019s defense and McNeal\u2019s hearsay testimony was not reliable. Thus, the Wisconsin trial court\u2019s exclusion of their hearsay testimony under the Wisconsin Rules of Evidence did not violate Sharlow\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-10\">. For sake of convenience, the offer of proof made at trial concerning the preferred testimony of Henne and McNeal will be referred to as Henne\u2019s and McNeal's testimony, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-18\">. MacDonald had previously made several statements to three witnesses incriminating himself in the same murder, but at trial he denied making these admissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. Sharlow cites <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) and argues that any evidence that is favorable and material to' the defendant is subject to compulsory admission under the Sixth Amendment. In <em>Valenzuela, </em>the government exported several illegal aliens before the defendant had a chance to interview them to determine if they could provide him with material evidence to aid his defense. The Court held that in order to establish a Sixth Amendment violation, the defendant must demonstrate that the witness\u2019s testimony would have been favorable and material to his defense. However, <em>Valenzuela </em>did not address the issue presented in this case of whether a witness, who is available to testify, can present hearsay evidence to aid the defendant. Rather, the <em>Chambers </em>case addresses this precise issue and thus controls our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">. The Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion indicates that Sharlow was charged generally under section 939.05 and not any specific subsection. <em>See Sharlow, </em>110 Wis.2d at 227, 327 N.W.2d at 693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\">. Sharlow also argues that Henne\u2019s testimony is inherently trustworthy as the State used this evidence against Blanchette at his trial. Sharlow argues that this situation is similar to that found in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979) where the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was prejudiced when the State excluded hearsay evidence that exculpated the defendant from the crime. In <em>Green, </em>the defendant was charged with first-degree murder. During the second portion of the bifurcated trial assessing the defendant's guilt, the State was able to exclude the hearsay evidence exculpating the defendant. However, at his co-defendant\u2019s trial, the State relied on the hearsay testimony as evidence against the co-defendant. The Supreme Court held that in this situation the State had in fact admitted the reliability of the hearsay testimony and thus it should have been admitted during Green\u2019s trial. The <em>Green </em>decision is inapposite in two respects. First, Henne\u2019s testimony was not exculpatory since Sharlow still could have been convicted as a party to the crime of murder. Second, although the State did use Henne\u2019s testimony at Blanchette's trial, it did not rely upon Henne\u2019s testimony, as evidenced by its closing arguments, as it argued that Blanchette was the person who had masterminded the murder while Sharlow was th\u00e9 triggerman. Thus, the State's theory of the case in Blanchette\u2019s trial did not contradict the theory it followed at Sharlow\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">. While we do not read <em>Chambers </em>to require that all four factors be met, we point out that McNeal's testimony failed to meet any of the factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. Sharlow contends, as he did before the district court, that the State is somehow responsible for Blanchette\u2019s unavailability at trial since the State could have tried Blanchette first. Thus, the petitioner suggests that had Blanchette been tried first and found guilty he would have been much more amenable to testifying; however, this argument is nothing more than sheer speculation. We agree with the district court that the prosecution \"has no duty to confer immunity or coordinate the prosecution of co-defendants in the manner Sharlow suggests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\">. In <em>Chambers </em>the Court stated that the statements must be \"in a very real sense self-incriminatory and unquestionably against interest.\u201d 410 U.S. at 301, 93 S.Ct. at 1048. As recognized by the district court, Blanchette\u2019s statement that Sharlow was not a party to the murder is not unquestionably against his interest since the statement, at best, only indirectly made Blanchette appear any more guilty of being party to a murder than he already appeared.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">. At the time of Sharlow's trial in 1972, the State of Wisconsin did not recognize the hearsay exception for statements made against penal interest; subsequently, this exception to the hearsay rule was added to the Wisconsin Code of Evidence in language closely tracking the language in Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">. Sharlow also claims that if McNeal were allowed to testify he would have disclosed that Blanchette and Kruschke shared a homosexual relationship and thus he should have been allowed to demonstrate the bias of Kruschke in testifying against Sharlow. Even if this impeachment evidence were admissible, we do not believe the exclusion of McNeal's testimony in any way prejudiced Sharlow's case. Granted, if Kruschke shared a homosexual relationship with Blanchette, it would tend to show some bias in favor of testifying against Sharlow. However, Kruschke's testimony also clearly implicates Blanchette in the murder and thus Sharlow's argument that Kruschke was biased in testifying against Sharlow is not persuasive since Kruschke\u2019s testimony also inculpates Blanchette in the murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
