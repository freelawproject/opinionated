The injury was diagnosed by his treating physician as a low back strain, acute with sciatic irritation. He aggravated his back condition at work on two subsequent occasions. On August 22, 1975, he experienced acute low back pain extending into his left leg while bending over to pick up an alternator. On April 29, 1976, he experienced left low back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>pain as he arose from a desk. As a result of this incident, Long experienced a numbness in his left leg and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-4\">Long filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits based on the condition of his left leg under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908(c)(2) and 908(c)(19) and for the disability resulting from the back injury under section 908(c)(21). The AU denied Long\u2019s claim for compensation under sections 908(c)(2) and 908(c)(19). The Board affirmed, holding that sections 908(c)(2) and 908(e)(19) do not apply \u201cwhere claimant\u2019s actual injury is not to a part of the body listed therein, even if one effect of the injury is disability to a scheduled part of the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-6\">ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"AxY\">Long contends that he is entitled to an award under sections 908(c)(2) and 908(e)(19) for the partial loss of the use of his leg which resulted from the injury to his back. He argues that the evidence is uncontradicted that his \u201cback injury had far reaching consequences extending to the use of his leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-7\">He also asserts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1704-8\">[t]he fact that appellant\u2019s restricted use of his left leg stems from an injury to another part of his body (i.e., his back) does not in any way distract from the truth that <em>appellant cannot now use his leg in a manner such as he could have had the accident never occurred.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">(emphasis in the original text).</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-9\">We must decide whether a claimant may receive benefits under section 908(c)(2) and section 908(c)(19) because of an impairment to his leg where the actual injury was to his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"ACGX\">The Board must accept the AU's factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). We must review the Board\u2019s decisions for errors of law and for adherence to the statutory standard governing the review of an AU\u2019s factual determinations. <em>Bumble Bee Seafoods v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>629 F.2d 1327, 1329 (9th Cir.1980). Because the Board is not a policymaking agency, its interpretation of the LHWCA is not entitled to any special deference from the courts. <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, </em>449 U.S. 268, 278 n. 18, 101 S.Ct. 509, 514 n. 18, 66 L.Ed.2d 446 (1980). This court has noted, however, that it will respect the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute \u201cwhere that interpretation is reasonable and reflects the policy underlying the statute.\u201d <em>National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. v. United States Department of Labor, </em>606 F.2d 875, 880 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"A_7Z\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-14\">The LHWCA provides that compensation shall be payable \u201cin respect of disability\u201d which \u201cresults from an injury\u201d to a person covered by the statute. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-15\">The term \u201cinjury\u201d is defined in the LHWCA as an \u201caccidental injury ... arising out of and in the course of employment....\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2). The term \u201cdisability\u201d is defined as \u201cincapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-16\">Under the facts before us, Long, an employee covered by the LHWCA, suffered an accidental injury to his back while working. Thus, he was entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-17\">The LHWCA provides that compensation for an incapacity to earn wages shall be payable pursuant to a fixed schedule for the total or partial loss of a member of the body or the use thereof. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(l)-(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b1704-18\">A back injury is not explicitly included in the scheduled injuries listed in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>8(c)(1) \u2014 (20), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(l)-(20). Here, because the accidental injury was to the back, the AU was limited to an award under section 8(c)(21), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b1705-6\">Under section 908(c)(21), if the loss of earnings is not due to an accidental injury to a member of the body itemized in section 908(c)(l)-(19), or does not result in disfigurement of the face, head, or neck or exposed parts of the body, compensation for the loss of earnings \u201cshall be 66% per centum of the difference between the average weekly wages of the employee and the employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or otherwise, payable during the continuance of such partial disability.\" Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-426, \u00a7 8(c)(21), 98 Stat. 1639, 1645, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(21). Here, the AU found that Long was 10% disabled under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(21) and that any radiation of pain to Long\u2019s leg was the result of his back injury and was encompassed in the 10% disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1705-7\">Long correctly observes that loss of earnings resulting from an accidental injury to a member of the body cannot be compensated for under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(21). In <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Director, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1705-8\">[Cjompensation for a permanent partial disability must be determined in one of two ways. First, if the <em>injury </em>is of a kind specifically identified in the schedule set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 8(c)(l)-(20) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908(c)(l)-(20), the injured employee is entitled to receive two-thirds of his average weekly wages for a specified number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning capacity has actually been impaired. Second, in all other cases, \u00a7 8(c)(21), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(21), authorizes compensation equal to two-thirds of the difference between the employee\u2019s preinjury average weekly wages and his post-injury wage-earning capacity during the period of his disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1F\">449 U.S. 268, 269-70, 101 S.Ct. 509, 510 (1980) (emphasis added) (footnoted omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1705-10\">In <em>Potomac, </em>as a result of an injury to his knee, the claimant suffered a permanent partial loss of the use of his leg. <em>Id. </em>at 271, 101 S.Ct. at 511. The AU awarded the claimant the compensation available for \u201call other cases\u201d instead of the lesser scheduled amount for a partial loss of the use of a leg. <em>Id. </em>at 272, 101 S.Ct. at 511. The Court held that \u201cthe character of the disability determines the method of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 101 S.Ct. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1705-11\">We have not been referred to any decision of a federal appellate court that has considered whether a claimant can recover compensation for impairment of a member that was not accidentally injured. Nor have we found anything in the legislative history of the Act which considers this question. In <em>Potomac, </em>the Supreme Court noted that when the LHWCA was enacted in 1927, it was \u201cpatterned\u201d after a similar \u201cscheduled benefits\u201d provision in the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 101 S.Ct. at 513. Thus, the legislative history and judicial interpretation of the New York act are relevant in interpreting the federal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 275-76, 101 S.Ct. at 513. \u201c[I]t may fairly be presumed that Congress was aware of the construction ... of the New York law\u201d when it drafted the LHWCA. <em>Rupert v. Todd Shipyards Corp., </em>239 F.2d 273, 276 (9th Cir.1956) (per curiam). Furthermore, \u201cwhen a legislature borrows an already judicially interpreted phrase from an old statute to use it in a new statute, it is presumed that the legislature intends to adopt not merely the old phrase but the judicial construction of that phrase.\u201d <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates, </em>601 F.2d 659, 664 (2d Cir.1979), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>444 U.S. 1028, 100 S.Ct. 697, 62 L.Ed.2d 664 (1980); <em>see also Burnet v. Harmel, </em>287 U.S. 103, 108, 53 S.Ct. 74, 76, 77 L.Ed. 199 (1932). In 1927, when the LHWCA was enacted, the New York stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>ute had been interpreted to preclude recovery of benefits under the schedule for the impairment to the claimant\u2019s arms caused by a physical injury to the back of his neck. <em>Knight v. Ferguson, </em>198 A.D. 756, 190 N.Y.S. 659 (1921). Therefore, Congress may be presumed to have intended to adopt the same construction when it enacted the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-4\">The failure to allow recovery under the fixed schedule for accidental injury to limbs comports with recent cases, which, without discussion, have awarded benefits under \u00a7 908(c)(21) for impairments to limbs caused by an accidental injury to a part of the body not specified in the schedule. <em>See Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Allan, </em>666 F.2d 399, 402 (9th Cir.) (injury to neck and shoulder, 25% loss of function in each arm), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1034, 103 S.Ct. 444, 74 L.Ed.2d 600 (1982); <em>Hole v. Miami Shipyards Corp., </em>640 F.2d 769, 772-73 (5th Cir.1981) (injury to back resulting in leg pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-5\">The construction we have placed on the statute fully comports with congressional intent. The purpose of the statute is to compensate for lost wage-earning capacity. \u201cSchedules are set up not to put a \u2018price\u2019 on certain parts of the human body, but to ameliorate an otherwise intolerable administrative burden by providing a certain and easily applied method of determining the effect on wage-earning capacity of typical and classifiable injuries.\u201d <em>Rupert v. Todd Shipyards Corp., </em>239 F.2d at 275-76 <em>(citing Iacone v. Cardillo, </em>208 F.2d 696, 699-700 (2d Cir.1953)). However, it is not necessary to compensate Long under the schedule for reasons of efficiency, when the issue of wage-earning capacity has already been the subject of administrative scrutiny pursuant to section 908(c)(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-7\">WAGE-EARNING CAPACITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-8\">Since his injury, Long has been promoted twice and now earns more than he did at the time of his injury. His disability, however, makes it unlikely that he will ever be able to work at his previous job should he lose his supervisory position. The AU found that Long\u2019s current earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity and accordingly found that Long had suffered no loss of wage-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-10\">Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(h), a claimant\u2019s wage-earning capacity is determined by his or her actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent the claimant\u2019s wage-earning capacity. If the actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent the claimant\u2019s wage-earning capacity, the AU may fix a reasonable amount as the wage-earning capacity. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(h). \u201cHigher post-injury wages do not preclude compensation if the claimant actually suffered a loss of wage-earning capacity.\u201d <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Allan, </em>666 F.2d at 402. An AU\u2019s findings on wage-earning capacity may be overturned only if unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Portland Stevedoring Co. v. Johnson, </em>442 F.2d 411, 412 (9th Cir.1971) (per curiam); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1706-11\">The statute provides no factors for determining whether actual post-injury earnings reasonably and fairly represent the claimant\u2019s wage-earning capacity. <em>Lumber Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. O\u2019Keeffe, </em>217 F.2d 720, 723 (2d Cir.1954). The objective is to determine the wage that would have been paid in the open market under normal employment conditions to the claimant as injured. 2 Larson, Workman's Compensation \u00a7 57.21, at 10-101-02 (1983); <em>see also Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Allan, </em>666 F.2d at 402. A general increase in wages, longer hours, and an employer\u2019s sympathy may make post-injury earnings an unreliable indicator of wage-earning capacity. 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 57.21, at 10-100 (1983). Further, if the post-injury work is continuous and stable, the post-injury earnings are more likely to reasonably and fairly represent a claimant\u2019s wage-earning capacity. <em>Cf. Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Allan, </em>666 F.2d at 402 (shipbuilding industry is often cyclical and thus employee\u2019s post-injury earnings may not accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>rately represent future effects of disability on wage-earning capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-5\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Long\u2019s post-injury earnings are representative of his wage-earning capacity is supported by substantial evidence. Within two years after his injury, Long was twice promoted and has held his current position of shop foreman since 1975. His supervisor testified that there is no reason to anticipate termination of Long\u2019s employment. Although there was evidence that some refrigeration mechanics outside of Long\u2019s current place of employment earn more than Long, mechanics at Seatrain Lines earn less than Long. Long has not established that but for his injury he could have obtained a position as a refrigeration mechanic at higher wages. The ALJ did not err in giving this evidence little weight and finding that Long\u2019s current wages reasonably and fairly represent his wage-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-7\">DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-8\">At the end of the hearing, the AU stated that the parties could submit additional information on the wage-earning capacity issue within 30 days and that if necessary they would then have another hearing. Seatrain Lines submitted an affidavit from Long\u2019s supervisor detailing the wages paid mechanics. By letter, Long objected to the admission of the affidavit on the grounds that it was hearsay and argumentative and moved to strike the affidavit. He did not request reopening of the hearing for cross-examination. The AU denied the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-15\">Long contends that the admission of the affidavit violated his right to procedural due process because he was not allowed to cross-examine the affiant. We cannot consider Long\u2019s contentions, however, because he failed to object on this ground in the proceedings before the AU. Assertion of error for the first time on appeal will not be entertained because the error, if any, might have been avoided if the issue was raised before the AU. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Weigel, </em>426 F.2d 1356, 1357 (9th Cir.1970) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-11\">An employee who suffers an accidental injury to his back, in the course of employment may not receive an award of benefits under section 8(c)(2) and section 8(c)(19) of the Longshoremen and Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act for the partial loss of the use of his leg. Those sections do not apply, notwithstanding the fact that as a direct result of the injury to an unscheduled portion of the body, use of a leg has been impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-12\">Where, as here, substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s finding that an employee\u2019s post-injury earnings reasonably and fairly represent his wage-earning capacity, we will not disturb a finding that he suffered no loss of wage-earning capacity. We decline to reach a claim of the denial of the right to cross-examine a person whose affidavit was introduced by the other side because it was not raised at a time when the error, if any, could have been cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1707-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1703-12\">. The LHWCA was amended on September 28, 1984. <em>See </em>Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act Amendments of 1984, 98 Stat. 1639.
