The district court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that it had subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), to adjudicate Transamerican\u2019s claim against the Agency, but that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the SDR. The Agency and Transamerican appeal. (The district court certified for interlocutory appeal its order denying the Agency\u2019s motion to dismiss, and we granted permission to appeal.) For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to the Agency, reverse its determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the SDR, and remand the case for proceedings on the merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">In March 1981, the Agency for International Development (\u201cAID\u201d) approved a $20 million famine relief program to ameliorate widespread starvation and malnutrition in Somalia. Under this Title II (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1721 <em>et seq.) </em>emergency program, the United States donated 40,000 tons of corn plus ocean transportation to Somalia. AID and the Somali government executed a Transfer Authorization Agreement to implement the emergency grain program, which specifically incorporated by reference the provisions of AID Regulation 11. Under Regulation 11, commodities shipped: under Title II must be admitted duty free and exempt from all taxes, including \u201call customs duties, duties, tolls, taxes or governmental impositions levied on the act of importation.\u201d 22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 211.2(g), 211.-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">In April 1981, the Commodity Credit Corporation of the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cthe Department\u201d) commissioned Transamerican to carry 5,000 tons of corn from Houston, Texas, to the Somali port of Kismayu. The Department agreed to pay $580,000 for this transportation. Upon receipt of the Somali corn in June, Transamerican issued its bill of lading in Houston and shortly thereafter contacted the Somali Shipping Agency to inform it that its ship \u2014 the M.V. Klaus Leonhardt\u2014 would arrive at Kismayu in mid-July.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">Just before the scheduled arrival of the Klaus Leonhardt, the Agency telexed Transamerican and demanded $36,162.57 as a \u201cpro forma disbursement,\u201d payable in U.S. funds to the Djibouti Branch of the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia (the \u201cSomali Bank\u201d). Transamerican objected to the amount demanded, evidently on grounds that Regulation 11 placed responsibility for such levies on the AID recipient \u2014 the Somali government. The Agency warned Transamerican, however, that the ship would be detained until the money was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">Transamerican then notified the Agency that it would pay the full amount, offset by $10,636.99 owed it by the Agency from previous transactions and, accordingly, transmitted $25,525.28 to the Somali Bank in Djibouti. The Agency initially claimed that it had not received the money and detained the ship following discharge of its cargo on July 26. Finally, the Agency on July 30 confirmed that it had received the money but insisted that an additional $28,-312.30 be paid in order to release the ship because the initial amount demanded was \u201cnot correct.\u201d The Agency directed Transamerican to pay the amount to the Somali embassy in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-14\">According to Transamerican, the detention of the ship was costing the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>approximately $10,000 per day. To secure its prompt release, a Transamerican executive personally went to the Somali embassy the next morning and presented a check for $28,312.30 payable to the Somali Shipping Agency. The embassy, however, refused to accept the check and instead directed Transamerican to electronically transfer the funds from Transamerican\u2019s New York bank into the SDR\u2019s commercial account in the Riggs National Bank in Washington. Although Transamerican complied with this demand the same day, the Agency did not release the ship until August 3. At that point the ship had been detained for a total of eight days at a cost to Transamerican of almost $100,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">When efforts to obtain redress through diplomatic channels proved unsuccessful, Transamerican sued both the SDR and the Agency in the district court. The district court granted the SDR\u2019s motion for dismissal, finding that the SDR had neither waived sovereign immunity nor engaged in commercial activities that would subject it to suit in the United States under the FSIA and therefore the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The district court further concluded that it had jurisdiction over Transamerican\u2019s claims against the Agency under the FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception. Transamerican appeals the dismissal of its suit against the SDR, and the Agency appeals the denial of its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\">A. <em>The Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), grants foreign sovereigns immunity from suit in the United States unless one of the specified statutory exceptions applies. If an exception applies, section 1330 confers subject matter jurisdiction on the district courts to hear claims against foreign states. The purpose of the FSIA is to facilitate suits in United States courts arising from the commercial conduct of foreign sovereigns. As this court has stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9-\">[W]e think it ought to be difficult for defendants engaged in commercial activity with substantial American contact ... to invoke successfully sovereign immunity when sued for underlying commercial misdeeds. This is especially so in view of the fact that FSIA was written in great measure to ensure that \u201cour citizens will have access to the courts in order to resolve ordinary legal disputes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyI\"><em>Gilson v. Republic of Ireland, </em>682 F.2d 1022, 1028 (D.C.Cir.1982) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 6604). <em>See also Velidor v. L/P/G Benghazi, 653 </em>F.2d 812, 816-17 (3d Cir.1981) (objective of Act is to facilitate suits against foreign governments in United States courts arising out of commercial activity), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 929, 102 S.Ct. 1297, 71 L.Ed.2d 474 (1982); <em>Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 300, 312 (2d Cir.1981) (Congress\u2019s primary concern in FSIA was providing access to courts to parties aggrieved by commercial acts of foreign sovereigns), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1148, 102 S.Ct. 1012, 71 L.Ed.2d 301 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Thus, a foreign state may not invoke sovereign immunity in any ca'se in which the foreign state has implicitly or explicitly waived its immunity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1), or where the claim arises from commercial activities by the foreign state. The Act provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atg4\">[a] foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case ... in which [1] the action is based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>a commercial activity carried on in the United States by a foreign state; or [2] upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or [3] upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2). In accordance with the restrictive view of sovereign immunity reflected in the FSIA, the burden of proof in establishing the inapplicability of these exceptions is upon the party claiming immunity, in this case the SDR and the Agency. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin. News 1976, p. 6604. <em>See also Vencedora Oceanica Navigacion, S.A. v. Compagnie Nationale Algerienne de Navigation, </em>730 F.2d 195, 199 (5th Cir.1984). Transamerican argues that neither the SDR nor the Agency have sustained that burden. It contends that clause 1 of the commercial activities exception applies to the SDR\u2019s claim of immunity,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and clause 3 applies to that of the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">B. <em>The SDR</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">If the relevant activity of the Somalian embassy constituted \u201ca commercial activity carried on in the United States by a foreign state,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) (1982), the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over Transameriean\u2019s claims against the SDR. The problem, as the drafters of the FSIA themselves admitted, is that the statute is vaguely worded and offers little guidance to courts construing its terms. <em>See </em>Hearings on H.R. 11315 Before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 53 (1976). <em>See also Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 300, 302-03 (2d Cir.1981). The statute\u2019s most prominent ambiguity is the meaning of the term \u201ccommercial.\u201d The statutory language itself begs the question by defining \u201ccommercial activity\u201d as either \u201ca regular course of commercial transaction or a particular commercial transaction or act. The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(d). As the Second Circuit noted, \u201cCongress deliberately left the meaning open and ... \u2018put [its] faith in the U.S. courts to work out progressively, on a case-by-case basis ... the distinction between commercial and governmental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Texas Trading, </em>647 F.2d at 309 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">Transamerican argues that SDR\u2019s actions were not governmental, but clearly commercial in character. In support of its argument, Transamerican emphasizes that the SDR (1) agreed to serve as a conduit for the second payment, (2) refused to accept the second payment in the form of a check to the Agency, and (3) instead instructed Transamerican to deposit the payment directly into the SDR\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">The district court rejected these arguments on the grounds that the SDR acted merely as a passive \u201cstakeholder\u201d in the transaction. Merely labelling the SDR\u2019s conduct in this transaction as that of a \u201cstakeholder,\u201d however, cannot be determinative. The proper inquiry is whether the embassy acted in a sovereign or essentially private capacity. SDR argues that its actions were diplomatic in character, under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>taken to protect its national, the Agency, and to promote friendly relations with Transamerican and, presumably, the United States. Although the embassy certainly could be viewed as \u201cprotecting\u201d the interests of the Agency, its conduct exceeded the bounds of ordinary diplomatic behavior. The embassy did not hold the payment pending resolution of the dispute. It did not attempt to mediate the conflict or negotiate a settlement between the parties. It apparently made no attempt even to investigate the causes or merits of the dispute. Rather, the SDR actively assisted its instrumentality, the Agency, in extracting funds from Transamerican that the latter claimed it did not owe. The embassy took an active rather than a passive role in the transaction by refusing to accept payment by a check made out to the Agency and insisting instead on an electronic transfer of funds directly into SDR\u2019s own commercial bank account in Washington. Taken together, SDR\u2019s activities were essentially those of a collection agent, acting on behalf of its principal, the Agency, to wrest funds from an unwilling payor \u2014 and not that of a foreign sovereign diplomatically attempting to maintain friendly relations. In our view, it is a normal commercial function to act for another in collecting and holding funds and advising a principal as to their receipt; private banks and collection agencies do this routinely. Indeed, had the Agency not used its own government in the transaction, it could as easily have used a bank, a law firm, or any other commercial middleman representing its interests in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\">In addition to its characterization of the SDR as a stakeholder, the district court emphasized that the SDR\u2019s receipt of the payments resulted from its participation in the AID program and that the FSIA\u2019s legislative history shows that participation in that program would not itself amount to a commercial activity. The legislative history also makes clear, however, that \u201ca transaction to obtain goods or services from private parties would not lose its commercial character because it was entered into in connection with an AID program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The embassy\u2019s receipt of Transamerican\u2019s payment resulted from just such a transaction: the exchange of $28,000 in return for the release of the Klaus Leonhardt from the Somali port. That the ship\u2019s cargo had consisted of foodstuffs donated pursuant to the AID program is beside the point. Congress did not intend the program\u2019s mere presence in the background of a related but otherwise private commercial transaction to immunize the foreign state from the consequences of that transaction. Rather, we believe that Congress intended the phrase \u201ca transaction to obtain goods or services ... entered into in connection with an AID program\u201d to encompass transactions, like this one, that result from or relate to the transport of AID-related cargo by private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">We therefore conclude that the SDR has not sustained its burden of proving the inapplicability of the section 1605(a)(2) exception and that the Somali government has participated in commercial activity in the United States. The district court thus has subject matter jurisdiction over Transamerican\u2019s claims against the SDR under section 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">C. <em>The Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">The district court found that it had jurisdiction to hear Transamerican\u2019s claims against the Agency because the suit was based \u201cupon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2). The Agency does not seriously dispute the finding that its detention of the ship and demand for payment were \u201ccommercial activit[ies] of the foreign state elsewhere.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the Agency claims that the activities were not sufficiently substantial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>warrant the district court\u2019s conclusion that they had the requisite \u201cdirect effect\u201d on the United States required by the statute. The district court found a direct effect in the United States because (1) Transameriean is an American corporation; (2) the Agency directed Transamerican to make payments in the United States; (3) because of the Agency\u2019s actions, a New York bank transferred funds to a Washington bank; and (4) because of the Agency\u2019s actions, Transamerican incurred additional debts to the American vessel owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">We noted in <em>Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea, </em>693 F.2d 1094, 1110-11 (D.C.Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 71, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983), that courts construing the \u201cdirect effect\u201d language may look for guidance to section 18 of the Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1965) concerning the extent to which a state may enact laws proscribing conduct outside its territory to prevent effects of that conduct within the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we stressed in <em>Maritime </em>that the effects in the United States should be both \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cdirect and foreseeable\u201d in order to satisfy the requirements of clause 3 of the section 1605(a)(2) exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">Applying these principles to the present case, we can only conclude that the effects of the Agency\u2019s detention of the ship and demand for payment in the United States were both direct and substantial within the meaning of the FSIA. At the Agency\u2019s insistence, a significant transaction was effectuated in the United States, with an American corporation transferring $28,000 from a New York bank to the Somali government\u2019s D.C. bank. In addition, as the district court found, the continued detention caused Transamerican to incur significant additional debts to the American vessel owner to the tune of $10,-000 a day in time charter costs and related charges.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-9\">A state has jurisdiction to prescribe a rule of law attaching legal consequences to conduct that occurs outside its territory and causes an effect within its territory, if either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-10\">(a) the conduct and its effect are generally recognized as constituent elements of a crime or tort under the law of states that have reasonably developed legal systems, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-11\">(b) (i) the conduct and its effect are constituent elements of activity to which the rule applies; (ii) the effect within the territory is substantial; (iii) it occurs as a direct and foreseeable result of the conduct outside the territory; and (iv) the rule is not inconsistent with the principles of justice generally recognized by states that have reasonably developed legal systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-13\">The Agency\u2019s' further claim that these effects on Transamerican were \u201cunforeseeable\u201d is entirely disingenuous. The Agency itself required Transamerican to make the payment to its embassy in Washington. Furthermore, that continued detention of the ship would cause the shipper to incur significant additional costs would be foreseeable to any party even slightly familiar with commercial shipping transactions. <em>Cf. Maritime, </em>693 F.2d at 1111. We therefore find that the Agency\u2019s actions in detaining the Klaus Leonhardt until it received Transamerican\u2019s payment had a direct effect in the United States within the meaning of the FSIA and sustain the district court\u2019s holding with respect to the Agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court holding that it has jurisdiction over the Agency is affirmed, the judgment of the district court dismissing the action against the Somali Democratic Republic for lack of jurisdiction is reversed, and both cases are remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-15\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">. We emphasize that our opinion here goes only to the jurisdictional issues of this case. Our findings are based on the facts as alleged by Transamerican and generously construed by this court. <em>See Gilson v. Republic of Ireland, </em>682 F.2d 1022, 1026 (D.C.Cir.1982). We make no factual conclusions regarding the merits of the dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">. In addition to the out-of-pocket detention costs, cargo assessments and overcharges, Transamerican\u2019s New York bank, on August 3, 1981, inadvertently made a second, duplicate transfer of the $28,312.30 payment to the Somali embassy\u2019s commercial account in the Riggs National Bank. Transamerican alleged in its amended complaint that the Somali government refused to return this erroneous payment to plaintiff or its bank for almost a year and then did so without paying any interest and only when threatened with suit by Transamerican and its bank. (R.E. 41, 113).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">. Transamerican argues alternatively that even if the SDR was not engaged in commercial activity, the AID Transfer Authorization Agreement and the shipping documents constitute an implied waiver of sovereign immunity. The district court rejected this contention, stating that both the Transfer Authorization Agreement and the shipping document were simply aspects of SDR\u2019s participation in the AID program and noted that the FSIA\u2019s legislative history expressly states that such participation should not lead to a waiver of sovereign immunity under the commercial activity exception. <em>Transamerican S.S. Corp. v. Somali Democratic Rep., </em>590 F.Supp. 968, 972 (D.D.C.1984). Because a majority of this panel finds that the commercial activity exception is applicable to SDR's activities, we have no occasion to address this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">..

The regulation also states that \u201cCommodities shall be admitted duty free and exempt from all taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 211.7(b) (codified at 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.7(b) (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">The question, then, is whether the SDR\u2019s contractual agreement to be bound by regulation 11, but not by the law of the United States generally, waives sovereign immunity in an action for damages allegedly caused by the SDR\u2019s violation of regulation 11. I believe that in the circumstances of this case the SDR has indeed waived immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-15\">The House Report expressly relied on existing case law in support of the proposition that by submitting to the law of a particular state, a foreign country waives its immunity. In fact, however, the case law at the time did not unambiguously establish that principle.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Most of the relevant waiver cases decided before enactment of the FSIA focused on the effect of a foreign country\u2019s agreement to arbitrate disputes. \u201cA key reason why [those] cases found that an agreement to arbitrate in the United States waived immunity from suit was that such agreements could only be effective if deemed to contemplate a role for United States courts in compelling arbitration that stalled along the way.\u201d <em>In re Arbitration Between Maritime Int\u2019l Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea, </em>693 F.2d 1094, 1103 (D.C.Cir.1982) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 71, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Revised) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 456(b) &amp; com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>ment b &amp; reporter\u2019s note 2 (Tent. Draft No. 2,1981). Courts were reluctant to permit a foreign country, after explicitly promising that it would resolve disputes before a designated tribunal in the United States, suddenly to assert after the fact that it could be held responsible for its actions, if at all, only in its own courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">Congress obviously thought that similar reasoning supports finding a waiver of sovereign immunity when a foreign country agrees to the application of United States law. Congress evidently believed that after making such a promise, the foreign country could not equitably deny that voluntarily assumed obligations under United States law were enforceable against it. Of course, a foreign country\u2019s duties under United States law might theoretically be enforced in the foreign country\u2019s own courts. But Congress could reasonably have been skeptical that, in general, a foreign country resisting application of United States law in United States courts would be likely to yield to relief in its own courts. The courts of this country are clearly best able to interpret and apply the laws of this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">In my view, these principles suggest that when a foreign government agrees to the application of a particular provision of federal law, that government has waived immunity in actions for violation of the law in question. By agreeing to observe regulation 11, the SDR assumed duties significantly different from those it would have undertaken if the text of regulation 11 had simply been written into the Transfer Authorization Agreement without any reference to any particular law. Had the regulation merely been written into the contract, the interpretation of its text would present an ordinary problem of contract law. But by expressly agreeing to the \u201cterms and conditions ... of AID Regulation 11,\u201d R.E. at 47, the SDR implicitly acknowledged that regulation 11 would apply as that regulation is understood in the law of the United States. In the House Report, Congress declared that a foreign government may not assume duties generally under United States law, only to disclaim them by invoking immunity in United States courts when a controversy arises. I believe that when a foreign government assumes specific duties under United States law, it is similarly barred from denying vulnerability to suit under the provisions of law agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The district court was concerned that regulation 11 does not state to whom the SDR is liable if it violates the regulation. <em>See Transamerican S.S. Corp. v. Somali Democratic Republic, </em>590 F.Supp. 962, 973 (D.D.C.1984). In a related argument, the SDR states that because the Transamerican Steamship Corporation was not a party to the Transfer Authorization Agreement, the SDR has not waived immunity in a suit brought by Transamerican. I believe that regulation 11, fairly understood, creates liability to the persons who normally sustain losses when illegal import duties are charged or demurrage costs are wrongfully imposed. Because the shipper is among those deliberately protected by regulation 11 and foreseeably harmed by any breach, Transamerican is, in effect, a third-party beneficiary of the relevant provisions in the Transfer Authorization Agreement. The district court was also concerned that regulation 11 does not state what country\u2019s laws would govern any demurrage claim. <em>See id. </em>at 973-74. At most, that question poses a conflict of laws problem within a framework provided by United States law; it does not change the straightforward facts that the agreement said regulation 11 applies, and regulation 11 is part of the law of the' United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">Finally, the district court relied on a passage in the House Report commenting that \u201ca foreign state\u2019s mere participation in a foreign assistance program administered by the Agency for International Development (AID) is an activity whose essential nature is public or governmental, and it would not constitute a commercial activity.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1487, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6615; <em>see Transamerican S.S. Corp., </em>590 F.Supp. at 973. As the district court recognized, this sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>explicitly addresses only the scope of the \u201ccommercial activities\u201d exception to immunity. I do not believe the House Report suggests that a different standard for implicit waiver should apply to contracts connected with AID shipments than to other contracts. Moreover, I do not claim that the SDR waived its immunity with respect to causes of action arising from any aspect of the AID shipment; the implicit waiver extends only to causes of action arising from breach of regulation 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">For these reasons, I agree that the SDR is not entitled to sovereign immunity against Transamerican\u2019s claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">The SDR suggests that because Congress arguably took too broad a view of the cases when it passed the FSIA, we should disregard the statement from the legislative history discussed in text. However, \"the relevant inquiry is not whether Congress correctly perceived the then state of the law, but rather what its perception of the state of the law was.\u201d <em>Brown v. General Servs. Admin., </em>425 U.S. <em>820, 828, 96 S.Ct. 1961, </em>1966, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
