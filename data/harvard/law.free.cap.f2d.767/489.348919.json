The litigation grew out of an investigation of the County Judge of a Minnesota County by the State Board on Judicial Standards. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">The Minnesota Board on Judicial Standards originally was created by order of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in 1970. The current Board was created by the State Legislature in 1971 by Minn.Laws 1971, ch. 909, codified as Minn.Stat. \u00a7 490.-15. The Board is within the judicial branch of the State Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">Under Minn.Stat. \u00a7 490.16 the Board is vested with broad powers to recommend to the Supreme Court of Minnesota that judges be suspended, retired, censured or removed from office for violation of judicial standards or for judicial misconduct. Subdivision 5 of \u00a7 490.16 authorizes the Supreme Court to make rules further implementing its responsibilities and authority. The Board appoints its executive secretary. Rules adopted by the Supreme Court set out specific duties and responsibilities of the executive secretary, including the authority to receive and screen complaints, make preliminary evaluations, conduct investigations and perform the general administrative functions of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-20\">The rules of the Board on Judicial Standards are set forth in the Appendix of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>opinion. Board Rules 6 through 10 establish the procedures used by the Board and its executive secretary in receiving, evaluating, investigating and acting upon complaints. Under these rules, the executive secretary screens complaints he receives and then presents them to the Board. The Board determines whether a detailed investigation is warranted. If so, the judge may be notified that he is the subject of a complaint. When the Board determines that an investigation is warranted, the executive secretary conducts the investigation and reports his findings and recommendations to the Board. The Board may determine at that point whether there is probable cause to believe that at least one of the grounds for discipline set forth in Rule 4 has been met. If so, a detailed statement of allegations is prepared by the executive secretary and served by him upon the judge. The judge then is given the opportunity to respond to the statement in writing, by personal appearance, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">After the judge has responded, the Board may terminate the proceeding and dismiss the complaint if it finds that there is insufficient cause to proceed. If the Board determines that cause exists, it files a formal complaint with the executive secretary. A copy of the complaint is served upon the judge and a copy is filed with the Supreme Court of Minnesota. The Board requests the Supreme Court to appoint a referee to conduct a formal hearing. The referee submits to the Board his or her findings and any objections received from counsel for the Board or the judge. The Board then makes a recommendation to the Supreme Court as to discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">District Judge Diana E. Murphy, in granting the motion of the defendant for summary judgment, stated in her opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQ\">This case began when Richard Erickson, plaintiffs former husband, submitted a complaint to the Board by telephone on March 30, 1982. He alleged that Judge Clement H. Snyder, Jr., a county judge in Fillmore County, Minnesota, was personally involved with Erickson\u2019s wife, had failed to remove himself from matters relating to the Erickson\u2019s divorce and child support proceedings, and had prepared false letters advertising a class for legal secretaries in St. Paul to explain the plaintiff\u2019s absence when she accompanied the judge to a meeting. Erickson also stated that he told several public officials in Fillmore County of the relationship between his wife and Judge Snyder and that this relationship was common knowledge in Fillmore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">On April 16, the Board ordered defendant, the executive secretary, to investigate the complaint and to inform Judge Snyder of it. In May and June, defendant interviewed approximately nineteen people. Defendant\u2019s memorandum states he learned from these interviews that Erickson had taken his complaint to public officials in the county first and that the relationship was the subject of \u201ccommon gossip\u201d in Fillmore County. Defendant also interviewed plaintiff on two occasions. On May 27, 1982, he showed up at plaintiff\u2019s apartment without notice. She further alleges that he asked her personal questions in front of her children concerning an affair with Judge Snyder. She refused to answer these questions. Consequently, she was subpoenaed by the Board and appeared on June 9, 1982. She responded to questions about a trip she took to Minneapolis with the judge, but stated she would rather not answer questions about the nature of her relationship with the judge because they were personal and potentially incriminating. She also stated her relationship with the judge had become known because her husband had \u201cstarted talking to a lot of people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">On June 18, 1982, the Board requested and got a response from Judge Snyder in which he admitted his relationship with the plaintiff, plaintiff states. On July 16, the Board directed the executive secretary to prepare a detailed complaint which was served on the judge on July 21. On September 17, 1982, Judge Snyder appeared and made an oral response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>in which he argued for a private reprimand for the sake of plaintiffs privacy and her children\u2019s. The Board, however, determined that a formal complaint should be issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">Kelton Gage was hired as an attorney by the Board to draft the complaint. The complaint was filed on September 30, 1982, and generally alleged that (1) the judge established and maintained a sexual relationship with the plaintiff and prepared false documents to deceive her husband about the existence of the relationship; (2) the judge brought his office into disrepute by engaging in activity which became the subject of speculation in the community and by admitting he was possibly [the] father of plaintiff's son; (3) the judge violated the Code of Judicial Conduct by signing orders in plaintiff\u2019s action for dissolution of her marriage; (4) the judge presented false expense vouchers for lodging on nights he spent with plaintiff at hotels in the Twin Cities area. A retired judge was appointed as referee on October 11, 1982. In January, 1983, the Board and Judge Snyder entered into a stipulation under which the judge agreed to accept public censure from the court and to repay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings. The stipulation was approved by the Supreme Court on July 29, 1983. This delay was occasioned by a stay pending a special prosecutor\u2019s investigation. As a result of this investigation, it was determined not to prosecute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">Plaintiff's federal claim asserts that defendant violated her right to privacy in disclosing her name and information about her in connection with the investigation of Judge Snyder and the subsequent complaint. This action is brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Her state tort claims assert tortious intrusion into private matters, disclosure of private facts, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. She also alleges a violation of Minn.Stat. Ch. 13, the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The Supreme Court of Minnesota entered the following order censuring Judge Snyder on July 29, 1983, published as <em>In Re Snyder, </em>336 N.W.2d 533 (Minn.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\u201cORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">\u201cAMDAHL, Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">\u201cThis proceeding arises from a petition of the Board on Judicial Standards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">\u201cBy complaint dated September 30, 1982, the Board instituted formal proceedings against the Honorable Clement H. Snyder, Jr., Judge of County Court, Fillmore County, Minnesota (Respondent). The charges made against Respondent were based on conduct alleged in the complaint asr</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">A. You have admitted that you repeatedly had sexual intercourse with Mrs. Connie Erickson, wife of Richard Erickson, during the past one and one-half years and continuing for about five months after you had notice of this investigation. This conduct constitutes adultery under Minnesota Statute 609.36, a gross misdemeanor. You conspired with Mrs. Erickson to deceive her husband as to the existence of this relationship. On one occasion you prepared a false notice of a legal secretarial course at William Mitchell Law School, St. Paul, Minnesota, for Mrs. Erickson to show her husband so as to provide an excuse for her absence while she accompanied you to a judges\u2019 meeting in Minneapolis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">B. You have admitted that you may be the father of Mrs. Erickson\u2019s child born January 16, 1982. You visited Mrs. Erickson at the Harmony, Minnesota Hospital prior to the child\u2019s delivery and while she was convalescing. You also attended the child\u2019s baptism at Mrs. Erickson\u2019s church and assisted in the preparation of food for the guests at the baptism. This conduct became the subject of gossip and speculation in the community, tending to bring your judicial office into disrepute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-14\">C. After the relationship between you and Mrs. Erickson began, you signed Orders to Show Cause in Mrs. Erickson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>action for dissolution of her marriage to her husband, Richard, on May 26, 1981 and February 11, 1982, in violation of Canon 3C of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">D. On October 12, 1981 and December 11, 1981, you presented false expense vouchers to the State of Minnesota wherein you claimed lodging costs for two people on occasions when Mrs. Erickson spent the night with you at motels in the Twin Cities area, in violation of Minnesota Statute 609.465.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\u201cRespondent filed his response with the Board on October 20, 1982, and, pursuant to Rules of Board of Judicial Standards 9(a)(2), this Court, upon request of the Board, appointed a referee to conduct a formal hearing in the matter. No hearing was, in fact, held before the referee for the reason that prior to the date set for such hearing, the Board and Respondent reached an accord with the result that on January 18, 1983, the Board filed with this court a document entitled:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\u2018STIPULATION BETWEEN THE BOARD ON JUDICIAL STANDARDS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND THE HONORABLE CLEMENT H. SNYDER, JR., AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD ON JUDICIAL STANDARDS TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">\u201cThe Stipulation recited that for the purposes of resolving this matter, the Respondent admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">a. Respondent repeatedly had sexual intercourse with Mrs. Connie Erickson, wife of Richard Erickson, during the past one and one-half years. Respondent continued the relationship for about five months after he had notice of this investigation. Respondent conspired with Mrs. Erickson to deceive her husband as to the existence of this relationship. On one occasion the Respondent prepared a false notice of a legal secretarial course at William Mitchell Law School, St. Paul, Minnesota, for Mrs. Erickson to show her husband so as to provide an excuse for her absence while she accompanied the Respondent to a judges\u2019 meeting in Minneapolis. This conduct became the subject of discussion among certain members of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">b. This is willful misconduct which, although not related to judicial duties, brings the judicial office into disrepute within the meaning of Rule 4(a)(3) of the Rules of the Board on Judicial Standards, and Minn.Stat. \u00a7 490.16(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">c. This is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice or conduct unbecoming a judicial officer that brings the judicial office into disrepute within the meaning of Rule 4(a)(4) of the Rules of the Board on Judicial Standards and Minn.Stat. \u00a7 490.16(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">d. This conduct violates Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and is grounds for discipline under said Canon 2, Rule 4(a)(3) and (4) of the Rules of the Board on Judicial Standards, Minn.Stat. \u00a7 490.16(3) and Article 6, Section 9 of the Minnesota Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">\u201cThe Stipulation further provided that the Respondent agreed to accept public censure from the Supreme Court and to pay $5,000.00 toward the costs of the proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">\u201cParagraph 9 of the Stipulation provides: The Board on Judicial Standards hereby recommends to the Supreme Court that this proceeding be disposed of in accordance with the Stipulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">\u201cSubsequent to the filing of the Stipulation, this Court was informed that the Board of County Commissioners of Fillmore County had employed a special prosecutor to determine whether criminal charges should be commenced against Respondent. On February 24, 1983, the Court issued an order staying further court action on the Stipulation and Recommendation until a determination had been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>by the Special Prosecutor on whether to institute criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">\u201cThe Special Prosecutor, after thorough consideration of the matter, determined that a prosecution should not be had and so notified the Board of County Commissioners of Fillmore County. A copy of that notification was provided to the Court with a covering letter from the Special Prosecutor under date of June 10, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\u201cThe Stipulation does not refer to, or make recommendation regarding, two of the charges made in the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">C. After the relationship between you and Mrs. Erickson began, you signed Orders to Show Cause in Mrs. Erickson\u2019s action for dissolution of her marriage to her husband, Richard, on May 26, 1981 and February 11, 1982, in violation of Canon 3C of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">D. On October 12, 1981 and December 11, 1981, you presented false expense vouchers to the State of Minnesota wherein you claimed lodging costs for two people on occasions when Mrs. Erickson spent the night with you at motels in the Twin Cities area, in violation of Minnesota Statute 609.465.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">\u201cThis court, being of the opinion that a remand to the Board on Judicial Standards for consideration and recommended disposition of charges C and D would result in further delay of final disposition which has already been delayed beyond a reasonable time, has exercised its authority to independently review the record of the proceedings before the Board on the law and on the facts of those two charges and has concluded, as to allegation C, that the orders executed by Respondent were routine orders presented on behalf of the Welfare Department in the collection of support funds which required neither independent conclusions nor exercise of judgment by Respondent and that such action by him was not such as to warrant discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\u201cWe further find, as to allegation D, that the record does not support, and indeed refutes and negates, any conclusion that Respondent presented false expense vouchers.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">\u201cThis court has the authority to reject or modify, in full or in part, the recommendations of the Board. <em>See </em>Rules of Board on Judicial Standards 12(f); <em>In re Gillard, </em>271 N.W.2d 785, 813 (Minn.1978). In this case, both the judge and the Board have stipulated to both the factual basis for discipline and to the discipline to be imposed. As indicated, we have carefully examined the record. Nothing there indicates the facts to be different from those stipulated by the parties. The Board is charged by statute to make disciplinary recommendations to this court. After an extensive investigation, the Board has determined an appropriate discipline to be imposed. In this case, therefore, we adopt the disposition recommended by the Board on Judicial Standards and leave to the voters of the Third Judicial District a decision, to be made in the privacy of the voting booth, as to the effect of the stipulated conduct on the office of Judge of County Court of Fillmore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">\u201cIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">1.

This Court has appointed the Honorable Bruce C. Stone as referee, who has conducted a pretrial conference between the parties. No testimony has been taken, no orders entered, and no proceedings are pending before Judge Stone presently.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">\u201c3. The Respondent has filed an Answer to the Complaint, and on June 18, 1982 and September 17, 1982, responded in person before the Board on Judicial Standards. Transcripts of the Respondent\u2019s testimony at these appearances are on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">\u201c4. The Respondent withdraws his Answer with respect to the matters hereinafter admitted. For the purposes of resolv-</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">ing this proceeding, the Respondent admits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">a. Respondent repeatedly had sexual intercourse with Mrs. Connie Erickson, wife of Richard Erickson, during the past one and one-half years. Respondent continued the relationship for about five months after he had notice of this investigation.

The Respondent understands and agrees that a continuation of the relationship previously described with Mrs. Erickson while either of them is married to another is willful misconduct justifying further disciplinary proceedings. The Respondent agrees that the misconduct which he admits in this stipulation may be used in evidence against him in any such further disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">\u201c7. The Respondent agrees that he will pay $5,000.00 of the costs of this proceeding. Respondent agrees to pay such sum on or before June 1, 1983, together with interest thereon computed at the rate of 8 percent per annum from December 1, 1982, to the date or dates of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\u201c8. The Respondent understands, and hereby agrees that the Complaint, Respondent\u2019s Answer, the transcript of Respondent\u2019s testimony before the Board on Judicial Standards and this Stipulation shall be filed with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\u201c9.

She prayed for damages in excess of $50,000 against each defendant, plus exemplary damages \u201cin an amount to deter these Defendants and others similarly situated from engaging in similar conduct in the future;\u201d an injunction prohibiting defendants from similar conduct with respect to other innocent citizens of the State of Minnesota; and attorney fees in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and Minn.Stat. \u00a7 13.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">Plaintiff later dismissed the Board as a party defendant and pursued her claim against Mr. Kurvers in his individual capacity and as executive secretary of the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-22\">Plaintiff contends that her constitutional rights to privacy were violated by defendant Kurvers during the investigation conducted by him as executive secretary of the Board. She charges that Mr. Kurvers made numerous personal and intimate inquiries concerning her alleged sexual relations with the judge who was under investigation. She alleges deprivation of \u201crights to privacy in her personal affairs guaranteed by the United States Constitution and protected by the laws of the United States and the Minnesota Common Law\u201d and that \u201cplaintiff has been humiliated and embar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>rassed in public and has suffered emotional distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The district court rejected the contentions of plaintiff and granted the motion of defendant for summary judgment on the ground that defendant Kurvers satisfied the test for qualified immunity set forth in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). In <em>Harlow, </em>the Supreme Court announced a single objective test for qualified immunity of public officials performing discretionary duties: that government officials performing discretionary functions \u201cgenerally are' shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">This Court has affirmed summary judgment in qualified immunity cases where the challenged acts do not violate clearly established law. <em>Miller v.

Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 457, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 2797, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977), the former President challenged a statute authorizing the defendant to take custody of presidential papers and tape recordings. The former President contended that his privacy rights were violated. The Supreme Court held that although the President had \u201ca legitimate expectation of privacy in his personal communication,\u201d the limited intrusion of the screening process did not violate any constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 97 S.Ct. at 2801.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The purpose of the doctrine of qualified immunity is to protect public officials called upon to perform discretionary tasks from personal liability for the good faith performance of these tasks. <em>Wentz v. Flecker, </em>721 F.2d 244, 247 (8th Cir.1983). To enjoy qualified immunity, a public official must demonstrate that he performed duties requiring the exercise of discretion. <em>See Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). The district court found that defendant Kurvers was required to exercise a broad range of discretion which is crucial to maintaining the integrity of, and public confidence in, the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">The <em>Nixon </em>Court cautioned that \u201cthe merit of appellant\u2019s claim of invasion of privacy cannot be considered in the abstract.\u201d 433 U.S. at 458, 97 S.Ct. at 2797. The scope of privacy rights asserted must be evaluated in the light of the public interest in the disclosures and their intrusiveness. <em>Id. </em>Appellant notes that there have been cases recognizing privacy rights in procreational autonomy in situations involving private decisions as to whether to bear children. <em>E.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972); <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). The district court in its decision recognized that courts and commentators have disagreed as to whether sexual conduct outside marriage is protected by the first or fourteenth amendment. Those finding that it is are nearly equally balanced with those finding it is not. Under these circumstances, there certainly are not \u201cbasic unquestioned constitutional rights\u201d violated by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s mere articulation of a general privacy interest in this case, however, does not end the inquiry into the issue of immunity. The privacy interests asserted must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>be examined in the light of the circumstances of the claim. In <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) the Supreme Court upheld a claim of qualified immunity from suit in a case charging violation of the fourth amendment. After a thorough examination of the circumstances, the Court held that former Attorney General Mitchell had not been guilty of violating constitutional rights clearly established at the time of his action authorizing the telephone wiretaps under attack. The disclosures in the present case occurred in the course of an investigation by an authorized State agency inquiring into charges of judicial misconduct. The State of Minnesota, like the other States of the American Union, has a compelling interest in maintaining standards for its judiciary. Any intrusions into privacy disclosed by the record in this case clearly were justified by the Board\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The record supports the conclusion of the district court that the executive secretary and the Board on Judicial Standards acted in good faith and violated no clearly established constitutional rights to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">RULES OF BOARD ON JUDICIAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Rule 1.
