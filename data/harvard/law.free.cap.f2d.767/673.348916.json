He raises two questions on appeal. Was the indictment fatally vague and ambiguous, and did the government prove with sufficient evidence a completed attempt? After examination of both issues this court is convinced the verdict should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Phenylacetone is a controlled substance generally regarded as a chemical precursor of amphetamine and methamphetamine. Eric Johnson, the defendant, began negotiating with Wesley Parish to buy 55 gallons of phenylacetone, then a controlled substance. Mr. Parish owned a chemical manufacturing plant in Orem, Utah. The defendant owned a business that manufactured flexible air-conditioning ducts in Houston, Texas. Wesley Parish cooperated with the DEA during all negotiations. Defendant knew phenylacetone was a controlled substance. Phenylacetone cost $323 per gallon on the open market but the defendant agreed to pay over $900 per gallon. Defendant requested the material be sent in five gallon drums marked either as \u201cExperimental Solvent A\u201d or as \u201ccutting oil\u201d or \u201cglycerol.\u201d Early in the negotiations he expressed a desire to be called \u201cMr. Smith.\u201d He sent $10,000 to Mr. Parish for preparation of phenylacetone. On Mr. Parish\u2019s request he sent an additional $5,000 towards the purchase. The indictment reads in the conjunctive, \u201cto manufacture <em>and </em>distribute.\u201d The district court instructed the jury in the disjunctive. Record Vol. I at 180, 193. <em>Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S.Ct. 642, 654, 24 L.Ed.2d 610, determined that this type of grammatical variance is permissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">\u201cThe general rule is that when a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, ... the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-10\"><em>See also United States v. Watson, </em>594 F.2d 1330, 1343 (10th Cir.). The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99, decided an indictment which charged more than was necessary did not deprive a defendant of any substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Defendant reads into the indictment ambiguity concerning either identification of the specific controlled substance he allegedly possessed or the substance he manufactured or distributed. Count I of the indictment charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-14\">\u201cERIC SANFORD JOHNSON did knowingly and intentionally attempt to possess with intent to manufacture and distribute phenyl acetone,____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">Defendant claims the indictment omits an essential element of the crime due to its lack of specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-16\"><em>United States v. Radetsky, </em>535 F.2d 556, 562 (10th Cir.), articulates the standards for a sufficient indictment established by this court. We find the indictment in this case satisfies these standards. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-17\">\u201c(a) Except as authorized by this sub-chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-18\">\u201c(1) to ... possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-19\">The statute provides that possession of a controlled substance with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance comprises a violation. The statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(14), defines \u201cmanufacture\u201d broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASh\">\u201c \u2018[Manufacture\u2019 means the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or other substance, either directly or indirectly ..., and includes any packaging or repackag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ing of such substance or labeling or relabeling of its container; ____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Reading section 841(a)(1) in conjunction with section 802(14), it is a violation to possess a controlled substance with the intent to manufacture the same chemical. Count I adequately gave defendant notice of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Defendant\u2019s evidentiary challenge focuses on the line between \u201cpreparation\u201d for a crime and an attempted crime. <em>United States v. Monholland, </em>607 F.2d 1311, 1318 (10th Cir.), establishes the purpose for making such a distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201c[M]ere intention to commit a specified crime does not amount to an attempt. It is essential that the defendant, with the intent of committing the particular crime, do some overt act adapted to, approximating, and which in the ordinary and likely course of things will result in, the commission of the particular crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">To complete an attempt a defendant must possess the requisite intent and have taken a \u201csubstantial step\u201d towards the crime\u2019s commission. <em>Monholland </em>at 1320; <em>United States v. Bunney, </em>705 F.2d 378, 381 (10th Cir.). The defendant argues his conduct failed to demonstrate overt acts necessary to prove an attempt. He also claims the government failed to prove the required specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Defendant\u2019s conduct displayed acts sufficient to support his conviction; he asked that the substance he agreed to purchase be mislabeled; he insisted on being called by an alias; he agreed to pay an inflated price for the material; and, finally, he mailed $15,000 to Mr. Parish with the understanding it was a partial payment for 55 gallons of phenylacetone.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Defendant urges that <em>United States v. Joyce, </em>693 F.2d 838 (8th Cir.), presents a closely similar fact pattern. The court in <em>Joyce </em>found the defendant did not attempt to possess cocaine. The required substantial step towards commission of the crime was lacking when the defendant refused to produce any money for purchase of the drug; \u201c[h]ere it is undisputed that Joyce, despite having both the opportunity and ability to purchase the cocaine at the agreed upon price, unambiguously refused either to produce his money or to purchase the cocaine.\u201d <em>Joyce </em>at 842. In <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>499 F.2d 370, 379 (5th Cir.), the court found the payment of money for purchase of a controlled substance particularly convincing, and said: \u201cCertainly, ... the jury could have found the transfer of money strongly corroborative of the firmness of Mandujano\u2019s intent to complete the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Defendant\u2019s payment of money to purchase a controlled substance is undisputed. The jury had before it adequate evidence to find that defendant took \u201c[a] substantial step ... strongly corroborative of the firmness of [his] ... criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Bunney, </em>705 F.2d 378, 381 (10th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>499 F.2d 370, 376 (5th Cir.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Wesley Parish shipped benzylacetone, a noncontrolled substance, to Houston. Defendant argues that because he ultimately would not have received a controlled substance he cannot be found to have attempted to possess a controlled substance. Factual impossibility may fall away as a defense to an attempt charge when adequate proof of intent to commit a specific crime exists. <em>United States v. Conway, </em>507 F.2d 1047, 1050 (5th Cir.). Evidence of intent may be coupled with proof of a defendant\u2019s acts which stamp his conduct as criminal in nature. <em>United States v. Oviedo, </em>525 F.2d 881, 885 (5th Cir.). <em>Oviedo </em>characterized the type of acts needed, \u201c[t]he acts should be unique rather than so commonplace that they are engaged in by persons not in violation of the law.\u201d Attempt and preparation are not divided by the last possible act before commission of the crime. <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>499 F.2d 370 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Coplon, </em>185 F.2d 629 (2d Cir.)). Defendant negotiated with Mr. Parish believing he bought and would receive phenylacetone. In <em>United States v. Bunney, </em>705 F.2d 378 (10th Cir.), this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>decided participation in detailed discussions of a criminal plan coupled with a \u201cfirm agreement\u201d to carry out the plan constituted an attempt. In defendant\u2019s case not only were there detailed discussions concerning the purchase of a controlled substance but also a firm agreement to buy sealed by a cash payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Defendant also maintains he lacked the specific intent to manufacture or distribute phenylacetone. He grounds this contention on Wesley Parish\u2019s testimony that during one telephone conversation Eric Johnson may have stated he planned to use phenylacetone as a solvent in his manufacturing business. Defendant believes this evidence demonstrates his intent to be only an ultimate user of the substance. Intent is inferred from all the circumstances and is \u201crarely capable of direct proof.\u201d <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>730 F.2d 1189, 1195 (8th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Cady, </em>567 F.2d 771, 774 (8th Cir.)). <em>See also Fitzgerald v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1069 (10th Cir.); <em>United States v. McManaman, </em>606 F.2d 919 (10th Cir.). Phenylacetone has little commercial use. Its common use is to produce amphetamine and methamphetamine. Defendant presented no evidence to demonstrate phenylacetone\u2019s usefulness as a solvent in his particular business. The jury could fairly infer that he intended to manufacture or distribute an unlawful substance because of phenylacetone\u2019s exceptionally limited chemical commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
