Kelleher, Senior United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b736-22\">DUNIWAY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b736-23\">The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) appeals from a judgment declaring that it is liable under a crop insurance policy to the holder of a security interest in an insured\u2019s damaged crops when the insured made no assignment of his rights under the policy to the holder of the security interest. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-24\">I. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-25\">In April, 1982, Mohinder and Gurchain Athwal, grape and raisin farmers, borrowed $160,000 from Buttonwillow Ginning Company. The parties entered into a written Security Agreement which granted Buttonwillow a continuing security interest in the Athwal\u2019s 1982 crop, \u201ctogether with all proceeds derived from such crops.\u201d Thereafter, Buttonwillow perfected its security interest in accordance with the requirements of California Commercial Code \u00a7 9303.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-26\">In August, 1982, the FCIC issued a Raisin Crop Insurance Policy to the Athwals, covering their 1982 crop against loss or damage. Paragraph 8 of the Appendix to the policy stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b736-27\">8. ASSIGNMENT OF INDEMNITY.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-28\">Upon approval of a form prescribed by the Corporation, the insured may assign to another party the right to indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>for the crop year and such assignee shall have the right to submit the loss notices and forms as required by the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFd\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.7, H 8. The Athwals made no assignment to Buttonwillow of their rights under the policy. Later that year, rainfall seriously damaged the Athwal\u2019s 1982 raisin crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In September, 1982, Buttonwillow sent a letter to the insurance company which administers FCIC policies, demanding \u201cany moneys that will be due Mr. Athwal.\u201d The FCIC replied, stating that it would not make payments to Buttonwillow \u201cunless the proper assignment forms are completed by Mr. Athwal.\u201d Buttonwillow asserted that it would hold the FCIC liable for all losses caused by its refusal to pay over the insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In February, 1983, the FCIC paid the Athwals $228,000 in accordance with its obligations under the insurance contract. Buttonwillow filed this action in district court, seeking a declaratory judgment that FCIC was obligated to pay Buttonwillow $28,984.72 from these proceeds, the amount which the Athwals owed Buttonwillow at that time. The court granted Buttonwillow\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied FCIC\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">II. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The district court granted summary judgment on a pure question of law. We therefore conduct a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Turner v. Prod, </em>9 Cir., 1983, 707 F.2d 1109, 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">III. <em>The Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">The district court erred in holding that \u201c[bjecause the policy is silent, one is lead [sic] logically to the conclusion that nothing further need be done by the holder of the perfected security interest in order to obtain payment of the proceeds from the FCIC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">An interest of a person in an insured crop existing by virtue of a lien, mortgage, garnishment, levy, execution, bankruptcy, or an involuntary transfer shall not entitle the holder of the interest to any benefit under the contract except as provided in the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">A security interest, perfected or unperfected, is a lien. <em>See </em>Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 1-201(37); Cal. Commercial Code \u00a7 1201(37). Therefore, Section 402.4 limits any benefit which Buttonwillow may receive under the Athwal\u2019s insurance policy to that granted expressly under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">Section 509 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1509 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-16\">Claims for indemnities under this chapter shall not be liable to attachment, levy, garnishment, or any other legal process before payment to the insured or to deduction on account of the indebtedness of the insured or his estate to the United States except claims of the United States or the Corporation arising under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">However, paragraph 8 of the appendix to the FCIC policy provides that the right to an indemnity may be assigned by the insured to a third party \u201cupon approval of a form prescribed by the Corporation.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.7, Appendix, 118. A holder of a perfected security interest has no right to an indemnity under the FCIC policy unless the requirements of paragraph 8 are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-18\">These requirements were not met in the present case. The Athwals made no assignment of their rights under the policy. The principles announced and applied in <em>Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, </em>1947, 332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 are applicable here. Buttonwillow is not entitled to payment of any proceeds under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-19\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
