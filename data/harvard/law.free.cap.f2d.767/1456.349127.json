Each of the three has applied for, but not yet received, political asylum. In essence, the aliens contend that the pertinent legislation and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entitle them to receive AFDC benefits. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1581-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-21\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"AAd\">The AFDC program is a cooperative federal-state effort established by Congress to furnish financial assistance to certain needy families with dependent children. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-615 (1982). The program provides benefits to needy children when at least one parent is absent or is physically or mentally incapacitated or, in the state\u2019s discretion, when one parent is unemployed. To qualify as either a dependent child, a caretaker relative, or any other person whose needs are considered in determining AFDC eligibility, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33) (1982), requires that the states provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1581-22\">such individual must be either (A) a citizen, or (B) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or <em>otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law (including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States </em>as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1157(c) of title 8 (or of section 1153(a)(7) of title 8 prior to April 1, 1980), or <em>as a result of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number><em>application of the provisions of section 1158 </em>or 1182(d)(5) <em>of title 8)....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33) (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-5\">Elizabeth Sudomir, Ebrahim Nejati, and Mahin Vojdani, aliens who have applied for asylum in the United States, each unsuccessfully sought AFDC benefits under the above section. Sudomir, after escaping from Poland in May 1981 to avoid persecution as a member of the Solidarity Labor Union, entered the United States without undergoing an inspection by an immigration officer, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1982). She applied for asylum, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) stayed the institution of deportation proceedings pending the disposition of her application. Her application for AFDC benefits was rejected in part by the Department because of her status as an asylum applicant. That is, the Department ignored Sudomir\u2019s own needs in calculating her family\u2019s monthly AFDC grant. Also, the INS has not granted her authorization to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-6\">Nejati and Yojdani overstayed the terms of their nonimmigrant visas and are deport-able under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(9) (1982). They applied for asylum to escape persecution in Iran. Again, the INS has stayed deportation proceedings pending the outcome of the asylum application process. Nejati and Vojdani applied for AFDC and Medi-Cal benefits, which the Department denied under section 602(a)(33) because of their status as asylum applicants. As in Sudomir\u2019s case, the INS has not yet granted authorization to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-7\">On January 9, 1984, the appellants brought a class action against the State of California seeking declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction preventing the Department from denying AFDC eligibility to asylum applicants. - The state responded by filing a third party complaint against the Secretary which sought to bind the Secretary to any judgment against the state. The appellants then amended their complaint, adding the Secretary as a defendant. At the time they filed their initial complaint, the appellants also moved for a preliminary injunction, which the district court denied in an order entered on May 23, 1984. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"ATIh\">Granting or denying a preliminary injunction lies within the discretion of the district court. <em>Sports Form, Inc. v. United Press International, </em>686 F.2d 750, 752 (9th Cir.1982). Accordingly, our review is a limited one. The district court\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless the court relied on an erroneous legal premise, on a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or on a misapplication of the law to the facts of the case. <em>Lynch v. Rank, </em>747 F.2d 528, 534 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Sports Form, Inc., </em>686 F.2d at 752. The issue here is whether the district court misapprehended the law governing the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-14\">SECTION 602(a)(33)</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-15\">A. <em>The Issue: Is the Secretary\u2019s Interpretation Permissible?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-16\">The Secretary offers an interpretation of section 602(a)(33) which excludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>asylum applicants from AFDC eligibility. An agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers is entitled to considerable deference. <em>Hawaiian Electric Co. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>723 F.2d 1440, 1447 (9th Cir.1984); <em>accord Worthington v. Icicle Seafoods, Inc., </em>749 F.2d 1409, 1412 (9th Cir.1984). \u201cProperly accorded, such deference entails affirmance of any interpretation \u2018within the range of reasonable meanings the words permit,\u2019 comporting with the statute\u2019s clear purpose.\u201d <em>Alcaraz v. Block, </em>746 F.2d 593, 606 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-5\">Under these circumstances, the question we face is whether the Secretary\u2019s denial of AFDC benefits to asylum applicants rests on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We cannot reject a reasonable interpretation merely because, had we considered the statute initially, we would have preferred another. <em>Id., </em>104 S.Ct. at 2782 n. 11; <em>Kunaknana v. Clark, </em>742 F.2d 1145, 1150 (9th Cir.1984); <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>732 F.2d 703, 706 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-8\">B. <em>The Statute and Its Sources.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-9\">Although section 602(a)(33) confers eligibility upon aliens \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress has provided little help in fixing the content of this clause. It is true that the statute does contain four examples of groups of aliens who satisfy the requirement. One such group consists of aliens \u201clawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of ... [8 U.S.C.] \u00a71158....\u201d Section 1158, in turn, requires that the Attorney General establish a- procedure by which aliens already present in the United States or at a border or a port of entry may apply for asylum and vests the Attorney General with discretion to grant asylum to aliens that are determined to be \u201crefugees,\u201d as defined elsewhere in Title 8. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) (1982) (defining refugee).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\">Section 1158 plainly envisions the creation of an asylum <em>process, </em>of which the application for asylum is a part. The aliens argue, therefore, that those who apply are \u201clawfully present ... as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1158.\u201d It appears that Congress borrowed the section 602(a)(33) language from a regulation promulgated earlier by the Secretary. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.50 (1978). That regulation provided that aliens \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law\u201d include aliens \u201clawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provision of section 203(a)(7) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(7) ] or section 212(d)(5) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)] of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d Sections 203(a)(7) and 212(d)(5), in turn, gave the Attorney General discretion to admit aliens as conditional entrants or as temporary parolees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-13\">Neither statute, however, made any provision for an application procedure. Conditional entrants or temporary parolees had been <em>granted </em>entry. Having been granted entry, they were \u201clawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of\u201d those statutes. It stretches this language considerably to have it embrace an alien illegally present in the United States who has merely applied for asylum. The most that can be said is that Congress, in employing the language of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.50, did not clearly consider the eligibility of asylum applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-14\">C. <em>The Secretary\u2019s Position.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-15\">The Secretary contends that \u201cpermanently residing ... under color of law\u201d rests on two factors: first, an official determination by the INS that an alien is legitimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>present in the country and, second, a determination that the alien is legitimately present for an indefinite period of time. These factors, the Secretary maintains, are the common threads running through the categories of aliens enumerated in section 602(a)(33).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the Secretary views aliens granted indefinite stays of deportation, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 243.4 (1985), or extensions of voluntary departure, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 242.5(a)(2)-(3), 244.2, as eligible for AFDC benefits. Aliens in each class have been subject to an official review and are entitled to reside in the United States for an indefinite period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-4\">Asylum applicants, by contrast, have received no official sanctioning of their presence and no official determination that they may remain in the country indefinitely. Their status and its duration are inchoate. An application triggers an administrative process that culminates either in the award of political asylum or in the institution of deportation or voluntary departure proceedings. It does not, the Secretary concludes, confer any status or right to reside in the United States permanently.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-9\">D. <em>The Appellants\u2019Position.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-10\">The appellants counter by asserting that residence in the United States \u201cunder color of law\u201d requires only that an alien remain with the knowledge and permission of the INS. Under these circumstances the inchoateness of the alien's status and its duration are irrelevant. The requirement that such alien must reside \u201cpermanently\u201d means only that the INS has no present intent to enforce departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-11\">The appellants rely on <em>Holley v. Lavine, </em>553 F.2d 845 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 947, 98 S.Ct. 1532, 55 L.Ed.2d 545 (1978). In that case, an alien sought AFDC benefits for herself and for her six depend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>ent children, who were United States citizens. Although she resided in the United States illegally, the alien possessed an official letter from the INS stating that, for humanitarian reasons, the agency did not contemplate enforcing her departure at that time. The question raised was whether the alien was \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law\u201d as required by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.50.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Second Circuit decided that she was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">The Court said the alien did not \u201cresid[e] in the United States without the knowledge or permission of the [INS].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849. Her stay, the court continued, was sanctioned by the discretionary refusal of the INS to use its enforcement powers and was therefore \u201cunder color of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849-850. Moreover, the letter constituted an official assurance that the INS would not commence deportation proceedings at least until the alien\u2019s minor children no longer depended on her. <em>Id. </em>at 849. Thus, her status and its duration were fixed. Her residence was therefore permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">The aliens here insist that they, like the plaintiff in <em>Holley, </em>reside in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As applicants, they have been informed that they may remain in the United States until a final decision is reached or until the INS decides otherwise. <em>See </em>INS Form 1-589 II4 (Request for Asylum in the United States). And the INS generally does not commence departure proceedings until after an application is denied. <em>Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.8(f)(4) (1985) (giving the district director discretion to grant voluntary departure or to commence deportation proceedings upon the denial of the applicant\u2019s request for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-7\">E. <em>This Court\u2019s Position.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-8\">The issue is a close one. However, we are persuaded that the Secretary\u2019s construction of the statute is a permissible one. The status of asylum applicants and its duration can hardly be described as fixed, or permanent. To repeat, they are best described as inchoate. Asylum applicants, therefore, reside in the United States \u201cunder color of law,\u201d but their residence is not considered by the Secretary to be \u201cpermanent.\u201d The immigration laws provide a statutory definition of the term \u201cpermanent\u201d which supports the Secretary. It means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1585-9\">a relationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>of the United States or of the individual, in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1586-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(31) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-5\">Although this section establishes that \u201cpermanently\u201d does not mean \u201cforever,\u201d <em>see Holley, </em>558 F.2d at 851, it also establishes that it does not embrace transitory, inchoate, or temporary relationships. A residence may be \u201cpermanent\u201d where the INS has permitted an alien to stay in the United States \u201cso long as he is in a particular condition,\u201d <em>id., </em>even though circumstances may change, and the alien may later lose his right to stay. A residence is temporary when the alien\u2019s continued presence is solely dependent upon the possibility of having his application for asylum acted upon favorably. Aliens who have official authorization to remain indefinitely until their status changes reside permanently;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> asylum applicants who merely participate in a process that gives rise to the <em>possibility </em>of such an authorization reside temporarily. This is, to repeat, a permissible construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-6\">It is not true that aliens present in the United States, who have applied for asylum under current immigration provisions, are indistinguishable from aliens granted temporary parole under the law as it stood before the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-212, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News (94 Stat.) 102. Prior to the enactment of the Refugee Act, the Attorney General, exercising broad discretion under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5), routinely paroled large groups of aliens into the United States pending determination of their admissibility. Aliens so paroled included applicants for asylum. <em>See United States v. Kavazanjian, </em>623 F.2d 730, 735 n. 8 (1st Cir.1980). Pre-Refugee Act temporary parolees received benefits under various welfare programs as aliens \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(l)(B) (temporary parolees are eligible for SSI benefits). The applicants in this case are not temporary parolees, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-9\">Although section 602(a)(33) explicitly provides that temporary parolees are eligible for AFDC benefits, the present discretion of the Attorney General to parole aliens into the United States is quite limited. The Refugee Act in large part replaced the use of parole with the section 1157 refugee provision and the section 1158 asylum application procedure. Under section 1158, aliens already present in the United States, as well as aliens who present themselves at a land border or a port of entry can request asylum. Applicants at the border generally are required to \u201cawait decision in the foreign contiguous territory from which they came unless it can be shown that such requirement should be waived for humanitarian reasons, to unify a family, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.\u201d INS Operations Instructions \u00a7 208.7, <em>reprinted in </em>4 C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, <em>Immigration Law and Procedure </em>23-156.15 (rev. ed. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-10\">Had such applicants been allowed to enter the United States while the INS considered their applications, their situation would have been similar to that of temporary parolees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The appellants did not do this. They either entered or remained in the United States illegally and then applied for asylum. Their presence is tolerated during the period necessary to process their applications; it has not been legitimated by any affirmative act. Such legitimation does occur when temporary parole is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>This distinction is consistent with the intent of Congress as reflected in its enactment of the Refugee Act. Congress intended to \u201cend[ ] the ... ad hoc use of the parole authority, which ha[d] been implemented by custom rather than clearly defined by law.\u201d S.Rep. No. 256, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 141, 145. Accordingly, the Act \u201celiminate[d] the piecemeal approach to the admission of refugees previously existing under \u00a7 203(a)(7) and \u00a7 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, [8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a)(7), 1182(d)(5),] and \u00a7 108 of the regulations, and ... established] a systematic scheme for admission and resettlement of refugees.\u201d <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2498-99, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). Under the new scheme, temporary parole is unavailable absent an individualized determination that \u201ccompelling reasons in the public interest with respect to that particular alien require that the alien be paroled into the United States rather than be admitted as a refugee under section 1157....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(B). As already pointed out, the INS generally requires aliens who apply for asylum at a border or a port of entry to remain outside the United States until their applications are granted. <em>See </em>INS Operations Instructions \u00a7 208.7, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiffs interpretation of section 602(a)(33) would seriously undermine this new scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-6\">Nor do we find that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of section 602(a)(33) is inconsistent with the administration of other welfare programs. Congress has used the operative language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33) as a test for eligibility under a variety of federal programs in addition to AFDC. These include establishing entitlement to SSI benefits, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(l)(B) (1982), and to unemployment compensation,see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(14)(A) (1982).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As originally passed by the House of Representatives, the SSI bill limited eligibility to aliens who were \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 231, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in, </em>1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4989, 5322. The full Senate added two amendments, one extending coverage to aliens who were \u201cotherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\u201d and another clarifying that the new phrase covered political refugees admitted into the United States as either conditional entrants or temporary parolees! <em>See </em>118 Cong.Rec. 33,959 (1972). The appellants maintain that by these amendments Congress adopted the principle that the federal government should bear responsibility for providing subsistence benefits to needy aliens whether invited into the country or not. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-8\">All the Senate amendments did was clarify that aliens allowed into the United States under the then-existing provisions for the admittance of refugees were eligible for welfare. The appellants, as pointed out above, occupy a different position. The SSI history therefore lends no support to their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-9\">The eligibility standards for federal unemployment compensation similarly fail to advance the appellants\u2019 cause. Aliens may become eligible for unemployment benefits, provided that \u201ccompensation shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by an alien unless such alien ... was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed....\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(14)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-10\">The appellants focus on the language in section 3304(a)(14)(A) allowing benefits to aliens \u201clawfully present for performing such services.\u201d Because an asylum applicant may be granted work authorization, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4 (1985), such an applicant, the plaintiffs insist, is \u201clawfully present for purposes of performing such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>services.\u201d The legislative history indicates that Congress intended to extend benefits to nonresident aliens who are lawfully present to work in the United States for temporary periods while excluding illegal aliens from coverage. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 67, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 14-15, <em>reprinted in, </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 79, 91; H.R.Conf.Rep. 158, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 11, <em>reprinted in, </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 98, 103. No similar concern animated Congress\u2019s allocation of AFDC benefits, and as a consequence, no similar language exists in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1588-5\">We conclude that the Secretary\u2019s assertion that Congress never intended to extend welfare benefits to aliens whose presence in the United States is unlawful and whose sole claim to entitlement rests on their filing applications for asylum with the INS is reasonable and, accordingly, permissible. The district court did not misapprehend the law in concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate any success on the merits of their claimed eligibility for AFDC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-7\">EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">Even if 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33) excludes asylum applicants from eligibility for AFDC benefits, the appellants maintain that the Department\u2019s denial of benefits to aliens in the plaintiffs\u2019 class is unconstitutional. The district court, finding that the state had merely adopted a federal policy regarding the treatment of asylum applicants, applied the rational basis test and concluded that the challenged classification was valid. The appellants insist that the use of the rational basis test was improper. They maintain that either the strict scrutiny test (state classifications based on alienage, <em>see Bernal v. Fainter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2312, 2316, 81 L.Ed.2d 175 (1984); <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971)), or the intermediate level of scrutiny (state laws discriminating against illegal aliens, <em>see Plyler v.

Judicial review of the decisions made by the political branches is fairly narrow. <em>Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 81-82, 96 S.Ct. at 1892; <em>Harisiades v.

Mauclet, </em>432 U.S. 1, 7 n. 8, 97 S.Ct. 2120, 2124 n. 8, 53 L.Ed.2d 63 (1977); <em>Mow Sun Wong v.

Federal classifications distinguishing among groups of aliens thus are valid unless \u201cwholly irrational.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 83, 96 S.Ct. at 1893. No one contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>the classification at issue here is \u201cwholly irrational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-4\">It is true, of course, that states lack similar powers over immigration. <em>Takahashi, </em>334 U.S. at 419, 68 S.Ct. at 1142. \u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment and the laws adopted under its authority thus embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide \u2018in any state\u2019 on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 68 S.Ct. at 1143. To justify a law disadvantaging aliens \u2014 like any law discriminating against a \u201csuspect class\u201d \u2014 a state must demonstrate \u201cthat its classification has been precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>Plyler v.

And state laws discriminating against illegal aliens must be shown to further at least a substantial interest of the state. <em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 217-218, 230, 102 S.Ct. at 2395, 2401. The appellants assert that, despite the necessity to make such a showing, the defendants have shown neither here. The defendants respond by asserting that it is not necessary to make such a showing because California has merely adopted a federal classification which is subject only to the rational basis standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-7\">The appellants\u2019 argue that, while the states are precluded from applying <em>more restrictive </em>eligibility standards than those required by federal law,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> nothing prevents a state from adopting more liberal eligibility standards \u201cso long as the grant in these cases is derived exclusively from state funding.\u201d <em>See Darces v. Woods, </em>35 Cal.3d 871, 679 P.2d 458, 474, 201 Cal.Rptr. 807, 823 (1984); <em>Ottman v. Fisher, </em>319 A.2d 56, 62 (Me.1974); <em>see also Engelman v.

On this foundation they then argue that a state\u2019s refusal to adopt more liberal eligibility standards is a matter of state, not federal, policy. This refusal, therefore, must withstand either strict scrutiny or, at least, the intermediate scrutiny applied to state classifications resting on illegal alienage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>We disagree. To so hold would amount to compelling the states to adopt each and every more generous classification which, on its face, is not irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\"><em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982), does not support the appellants\u2019 position. There, the Supreme Court invalidated a state law that denied free public education to the children of illegal aliens. The Court\u2019s decision rested substantially on the fact that the state had employed the federal classification \u201cfor <em>its own </em>discriminatory policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 102 S.Ct. at 2399 (emphasis added). The state\u2019s practice did not correspond to any identifiable congressional policy respecting education and in fact did not operate harmoniously with the overall federal approach to immigration. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26, 102 S.Ct. at 2399. Had there been an articulable federal policy, the Court makes clear, the situation would have been different:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVeJ\">With respect to the actions of the Federal Government, alienage classifications may be intimately related to the conduct of foreign policy, to the federal prerogative to control access to the United States, and to the plenary federal power to determine who has sufficiently manifested his allegiance to become a citizen of the Nation. No State may independently exercise a like power. <em>But if the Federal Government has by uniform rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien subclass, the States may, of course, follow the federal direction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. at 2396 n. 19 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">In the instant case, the state employed both a federal classification <em>and </em>a uniform federal policy regarding the appropriate treatment of a particular subclass of aliens. Section 602(a)(33), indeed, <em>requires </em>participating states to provide that in order for an individual to qualify as a person whose needs should be taken into account in determining AFDC eligibility, \u201csuch individual <em>must be ... </em>[inter alia] an alien ... permanently residing in the United States under color of law____\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, the statute apparently requires states not only to grant benefits to eligible aliens but also to <em>deny </em>benefits to aliens who do not satisfy the section 602(a)(33) test. California has indeed \u201cfollowed the federal direction.\u201d It would make no sense to say that Congress has plenary power in the area of immigration and naturalization and then hold that the Constitution impels the states to refrain from adhering to the federal guidelines. The district court correctly applied the relaxed scrutiny standard to the law in upholding the denial of benefits to asylum applicants. <em>See also Monmouth Medical Center v. Hau Kwok, </em>183 N.J.Super. 494, 444 A.2d 610 (1982) (upholding state regulation excluding illegal aliens from coverage of joint federal/state Medicaid program, where pertinent federal regulations required such exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-11\">We also are unpersuaded that the federal classification, to which the states must adhere, is unconstitutional because it authorizes states to violate the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 641, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1335, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969). The Court in <em>Shapiro, </em>while holding invalid a state law conditioning welfare assistance on a one-year residency requirement, suggested in dictum that if Congress had authorized such an unconstitutional state requirement, then Congress\u2019s own legislation would be invalid. <em>Id. </em>Here, however, the classification Congress has created is valid because of its plenary power over immigration. Moreover, Congress has enacted a <em>uniform </em>policy regarding the eligibility of asylum applicants for welfare benefits. This makes inapplicable the suggestion in <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 382, 91 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>1848, 1857, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), that <em>Shapiro </em>may require the invalidation of congressional enactments permitting states to adopt divergent laws regarding the eligibility of aliens for federally supported welfare programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-5\">The denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1581-16\">.

To repeat, for consideration in the determination of AFDC benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33) requires that an alien must be either \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" or \"otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law.\u201d The plaintiffs do not contend at this stage that they are \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d The question presented, then, concerns the contours of the second phrase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1584-5\">. In addition to its reference to the asylum provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, section 602(a)(33) mentions three other immigration statutes.

We reject the appellants\u2019 contention that a consent judgment and subsequent order entered against the Secretary in <em>Berger v. Secretary of the Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. CV-76-1420 (E.D.N.Y. May 14, 1984), binds the Secretary to a more flexible eligibility standard that embraces asylum applicants. <em>Berger </em>involved the eligibility of aliens for SSI benefits under a statutory provision limiting eligibility to aliens who are \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law.\" <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(1)(B) (1982). In the original consent judgment, entered in 1978, the Secretary\u2019s predecessor agreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1584-7\">[a]ny other alien residing in the United States <em>with the knowledge and permission of the [INS] and whose departure from the United States the [INS] does not contemplate enforcing </em>is also permanently residing in the United States under color of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1584-13\">(emphasis added). In 1984, the court denied the Secretary\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5). The appellants submit that asylum applicants reside in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS and that the INS does not contemplate enforcing the applicants' departures until the application process has run its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-14\">To implement the consent judgment, the Secretary promulgated a revised Program Operations Manual System (POMS) in October, 1984. By its terms, the revised POMS exclude asylum applicants from the coverage of the <em>Berger </em>formulation. A note on page 9 of the transmittal containing the revised POMS indicates that\u2014 with one exception of no relevance to the instant case \u2014 the mere filing of an application for a change in status, standing alone, does <em>not </em>constitute a sufficient basis to find that an alien is permanently residing in the United States under color of law. As the POMS expressly provide that aliens <em>granted </em>asylum are eligible for SSI, <em>see </em>Revised POMS GN E00303.070B.2i (Transmittal No. 7, SSA Pub. No. 68-0200303, Oct. 24, 1984), this note reflects the Secretary\u2019s interpretation that <em>applicants </em>for asylum status are <em>not </em>eligible. Thus, even if the Secretary were bound to the standard imposed by the <em>Berger </em>consent judgment, we conclude that asylum applicants would not be entitled to benefits under that standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1585-10\">. The court considered a version of \u00a7 233.50 that antedated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33).

The appellants also cite a variety of cases finding aliens who have applied for but not yet received a change of status eligible for welfare benefits under various programs employing the operative language of \u00a7 602(a)(33). In <em>Antillon v. Department of Employment Sec., </em>688 P.2d 455 (Utah 1984), for example, an illegal alien claimed unemployment benefits under a state welfare program. Antillon had filed for permanent residency. After a long period of inaction, the INS granted him one month to leave the country voluntarily. After overstaying that period, Antillon applied for a suspension of deportation. The INS took no further action. <em>Id. </em>at 457. The Utah Supreme Court decided that Antillon was entitled to benefits. His \"residence was ... under color of law because the INS knew of it and acquiesced in it by exercising its discretion not to enforce the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. Intermediate courts in New York employed identical reasoning in <em>Papadopoulos v. Shang, </em>67 A.D.2d 84, 414 N.Y.S.2d 152 (1979) (alien found entitled to Medicaid benefits during pend-ency of her application for change of status) and in <em>St. Francis Hosp. v.

The same test was used in administering the Food Stamp program, <em>see 7 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 271.1(e) (1976), until Congress tightened the requirements for eligibility in 1977, <em>see 7 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2015(f) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1588-8\">. The appellants\u2019 reliance on regulations defining food stamp eligibility prior to Congress' revision of the food stamp program in 1977, <em>see </em>Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-113, \u00a7 1301(6)(f), 1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News (91 Stat.) 913, 966-67 (codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2015(f)), is similarly unavailing. Admittedly, the regulation, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.1(e) (1976), used the language at issue here. The House committee that drafted the new statute in 1977, however, read that regulation as limiting eligibility to the specific categories of aliens enumerated there. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 464, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 146, <em>reprinted in, </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1704, 1978, 2116. Although those categories included aliens temporarily paroled into the United States and aliens granted indefinite stays of deportation or indefinite voluntary departure, this offers no support to the plaintiffs' position. As has been discussed, aliens who apply for asylum and temporary parolees do not occupy comparable positions. In addition, that aliens granted indefinite stays of deportation or indefinite voluntary departure meet the requirements for AFDC eligibility comports with the Secretary\u2019s view of section 602(aj(33).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1589-8\">. The Supreme Court has struck down state laws that are inconsistent with federal welfare provisions only in situations where the state law denied benefits to individuals who were otherwise eligible under federal standards. <em>See, e.g., Carleson v. Remillard, </em>406 U.S. 598, 92 S.Ct. 1932, 32 L.Ed.2d 352 (1972); <em>Townsend v. Swank, </em>404 U.S. 282, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971); <em>Rosado v.

And <em>King </em>invalidated a state regulation denying benefits to the children of a mother who \"cohabited\u201d with a man without regard to whether that man bore any legal obligation to support the children as conflicting with federal law conferring eligibility where one parent is continually absent and defining \"parent\u201d to include only adults having a legal support obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1589-10\">. The appellants raise and reject two interests served by the Department\u2019s classification: preservation of the public fisc and deference of illegal immigration. The plaintiffs correctly point out that a concern for fiscal integrity is not a compelling justification for an otherwise invidious classification. <em>See Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 375, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1853, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971). Moreover, such a concern, standing alone, would not justify a state law discriminating against illegal aliens. <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 227, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2400, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). Finally, even if the state has a substantial interest in deterring illegal immigration, the plaintiffs assert that no evidence indicates that denying AFDC benefits to asylum applicants would further this goal. <em>See id. </em>at 228-29, 102 S.Ct. at 2400-01 (rejecting similar argument offered in support of a state law denying free public education to the children of illegal aliens).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1590-7\">. <em>See also id. </em>at 225, 102 S.Ct. at 2399 (''[T]he States do have some authority to act with respect to illegal aliens, at least where such action mirrors federal objectives and furthers a legitimate state goal.\u201d); <em>DeCanas v.

We are dealing here with a group of plaintiffs who have entered this country illegally or who have overstayed their visas after entering legally. They have applied for asylum, which our statutes authorize for those who cannot or will not return to their own countries \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). The government form on which they made their applications advises them: \u201cYou may remain in the United States until a final decision is made on your case (or you are notified otherwise by [the Immigration and Naturalization] Service).\u201d Some 45 days after their applications are received, they are subjected to a preliminary INS interview to discourage frivolous applications. Th\u00e9n they wait \u2014 currently from three to six years \u2014 for their asylum applications to be processed. While they wait, they cannot work unless they are granted a work permit, issued in the discretion of the INS. None of the named plaintiffs has received a work permit. More than one-fourth of the applicants, if present figures hold true, will ultimately be granted asylum. It is fair to say that all hope to. Yet, they are denied the wherewithal to eat during this three to six year period because, under the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33), they are not \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law.\u201d I cannot accept the Secretary\u2019s interpretation as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-9\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, contrary to the contention of the Secretary, that plaintiffs are here \u201cunder color of law.\u201d Plaintiffs remain in this country with the knowledge and express acquiescence of our government. That is enough; \u201cunder color of law\u201d is clearly intended to be more expansive than the term \u201clawfully admitted,\u201d which appears in the same statutory section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-11\">Where I part company with both the majority and the Secretary is in the interpretation of \u201cpermanently.\u201d As the majority concedes and the Second Circuit has decided, \u201cpermanently\u201d in this statutory context does not mean \u201cforever.\u201d <em>See Holley v. Lavine, </em>553 F.2d 845, 851 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 947, 98 S.Ct. 1532, 55 L.Ed.2d 545 (1978). \u201cPermanent\u201d as defined in the Immigration Act means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">a relationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the United States or of the individual, in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(31) (1982). Under the facts of this case, plaintiffs\u2019 residence in this country is \u201cof continuing or lasting nature.\u201d At the minimum, it will last three to six years; for over one-fourth of the plaintiff class, it will last much longer. Most important, plaintiffs\u2019 status is easily \u201cdistinguished from temporary,\u201d as the statute specifies. \u201cTemporary\u201d or \u201ctemporarily\u201d is used in \u00a7 1101(a) of the Act in reference to students admitted to pursue a course of study (15)(F)(1), to tourists and business visitors, (15)(B), to workers admitted for particular jobs, (15)(H)(i), (ii) and (iii), (15)(J), and to those in programs designated by the State Department for teaching or research, (15)(J). The common characteristics of all of these temporary relationships is that they exist for a defined purpose with a defined end, and there is never any intention of abandoning the country of origin as a home. None of the temporary relationships is similar in character to that of plaintiffs, whose applications for asylum are necessarily premised on their being \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>return to their countries. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Plaintiffs are here in an indefinite status awaiting a ruling on their application for yet another status of indefinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">It is not quite accurate to suggest, as the majority opinion does, that the plaintiffs\u2019 residence is temporary because their \u201ccontinued presence is solely dependent upon the possibility of having [their] application^] for asylum acted upon favorably.\u201d Supra, p. 1462. The plaintiffs have been informed by the INS that they will be allowed to remain in this country until their applications are acted upon. Their continued presence ends (for about three-fourths of them) upon <em>un </em>favorable action by the Attorney General or his delegate. In this regard, plaintiffs\u2019 status is most analogous to that of temporary parolees and conditional entrants, both of whom are included among those eligible for AFDC as \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-5\">The majority opinion states that the status of temporary parolees is different because they have been admitted into the country by an official act of the Attorney General, and that the discretion of the Attorney General to admit such parolees is quite limited. But, as the majority acknowledges, prior to the Refugee Act of 1980, temporary parole was used <em>ad </em>hoc to permit large groups of aliens physically to enter the United States pending determination of their admissibility, for asylum or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Kavazanjian, </em>623 F.2d 730, 732-35 (1st Cir.1980). No individual determination or legitimation of status occurred at the time of parole, but the parolees were eligible for AFDC. As the majority opinion points out, the Refugee Act largely replaced these wholesale paroles of asylum applicants with a system where aliens within the country could apply for asylum. While their applications are pending, the INS assures them that they will be allowed to remain in the country. Their status is so nearly identical to that of the pre-1980 parolees that I cannot conclude that Congress intended different treatment under the AFDC laws which preexisted the Refugee Act. Certainly nothing that Congress said or wrote in the Refugee Act or in its legislative history expressly requires that such a distinction be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-7\">Plaintiffs are also at least as permanent in their status as are aliens who have been granted an indefinite stay of deportation or an indefinite voluntary departure. The latter two groups are eligible for SSI benefits as aliens \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1618(a)(5) and (6). They, too, may remain in the country until, and only until, the INS takes action to end their indefinite stays.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-8\">I conclude, therefore, that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of section 602(a)(33) is not a reasonable one, and that plaintiffs are \u201cpermanently residing in the United States under color of law\u201d within the meaning of that statute. It is true that such a determination has large consequences. The Service makes much of the fact that nearly three-fourths of the asylum applicants will ultimately be unsuccessful. No figures are given as to how many temporary parolees, conditional entrants, or aliens under indefinite stays of deportation are also ultimately unsuccessful in remaining in this country, but all of those groups are eligible for federally-assisted benefits while they are allowed to be here. But even if the Service is conceded its point, what of the more than one-fourth of these applications whose applicants will ultimately be successful? They will be persons who cannot return to their countries because of persecution or the well-founded fear of it. This country will have recognized that fact and will have given them asylum, but only after a period of three to six years during which they were permitted to remain in the United States, were for the most part forbidden to work, and were denied the means to feed, clothe and house their families. I cannot ascribe to Congress, in passing the Refugee Act for clearly humanitarian purposes, an intent to require victims of persecution to run that kind of gauntlet. I accordingly dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
