Because the administrative law judge (AU) applied the wrong legal standard in determining that Jason\u2019s impairments were not severe, the district court\u2019s order affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision is vacated and the district court is ordered to remand this case to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">On January 20, 1981, Jason filed his initial application for disability benefits asserting that as of October 15, 1971, at the age of 25, he became disabled due to a nerve condition, stomach problems, headaches, and arthritis. Jason\u2019s request was denied initially, and upon reconsideration. After a de novo hearing before an AU, Jason\u2019s claim was again rejected. Jason appealed and the Appeals Council remanded the claim to the AU for a second hearing. The remand was necessary because, at the first hearing, the AU had failed to give proper notice that Jason\u2019s disability had to be established as of June 30, 1975. After rehearing, the AU again denied Jason\u2019s claim for disability benefits finding that \u201cthe claimant has failed to establish any \u2018severe\u2019 impairment on or before June 30, 1975, after which he did not have the requisite \u2018insured status.\u2019 \u201d The decision of the AU was upheld by the Appeals Council on direct review, and after additional medical evidence had been submitted by Jason. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s denial of disability benefits. Jason filed a timely notice of appeal, and the district court certified that Jason was entitled to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and that the appeal was taken in good faith. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">In order to determine if a claimant is disabled, the Secretary undertakes a sequential analysis of the claimant\u2019s condition. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1984). If the claimant is found to be disabled or not disabled at any step in the evaluation, the remaining steps are not considered. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">Initially, if the claimant is, at the time of the review, engaged in substantial gainful employment, the inquiry ceases and the claimant is determined not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b) (1984). The second step requires the factfinder to decide whether a claimant\u2019s impairment is severe, irrespective of age, education, or work experience. If the claimant\u2019s impairment is determined to be nonsevere, the claimant is considered not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1520(c) (1984). If the claimant\u2019s impairment is severe, meets the durational requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), and is listed in Appendix I or is determined to be the medical equivalent of a listed impairment, a finding of disabled is mandatory without additional inquiry. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d) (1984). If the claimant\u2019s impairment is severe but is not listed in the Appendix, then the Secretary must determine what the claimant can do despite his or her limitations. This is known as determining the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a) (1984). <em>See Ransom v. Heckler, </em>715 F.2d 989, 991 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). If the Secretary determines that the claimant can still meet the physical and mental demands of his or her previous job, a finding of not disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>is mandated. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e) (1984). If, however, the claimant is no longer able to engage in his past job activities, then the Secretary must determine if the claimant is capable of performing other types of substantial gainful activity. In making this determination, the Secretary must examine the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work experience in conjunction with the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f) (1984). If the claimant, considering his age, education, work experience, and functional level, can engage in some kind of substantial gainful employment, there is no disability; if not, the claimant is considered disabled. <em>Ransom, </em>715 F.2d at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The AU found that Jason\u2019s impairments were not severe and, thus, the sequential evaluation ended at step 2. Judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision denying disability benefits is statutorily limited to determining whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision that Jason\u2019s impairments are not severe. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>See Davis v. Heckler, </em>759 F.2d 432, 434 (5th Cir.1985). However, the AU\u2019s determination of nonseverity must be based on a correct legal standard. <em>See Davis v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Estran v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 340, 340-41 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam). Because the AU applied an incorrect legal standard, and thus failed to meet the requirements of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099, 1106 (5th Cir.1985), the district court\u2019s order must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In <em>Estran </em>this Court, after a review of the 1968 definition of a nonsevere impairment and subsequent legislation and regulations regarding that definition, concluded that the 1968 definition has not been abrogated and that the current regulations defining a nonsevere impairment must be read in light of the 1968 definition. 745 F.2d at 340-42.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After considering the 1968 definition, the Court established the following standard for determining whether a claimant\u2019s impairment is nonsevere:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">[A]n impairment can be considered as not severe only if it is a slight abnormality which has such minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341 (quoting <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920 (11th Cir.1984)). The case was then remanded to the Secretary for reconsideration in light of that standard. <em>See also Barbara Davis, </em>748 F.2d at 296-97; <em>Martin v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1027, 1032 (5th Cir.1984). <em>U i</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In <em>Stone, </em>this Court reviewed the holding of <em>Estran </em>in light of arguments by the Secretary and the recent amendments to the Social Security Act. 752 F.2d at 1103-05. The Court reaffirmed <em>Estran </em>and further concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">In view of both the Secretary\u2019s position in this case and our recent experience with cases where the disposition has been on the basis of nonseverity, we will in the future assume that the AU and Appeals Council have applied an incorrect standard to the severity requirement unless the correct standard is set forth by reference to this opinion or another of the same effect, or by an express statement that the construction we give to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (1984) is used. Unless the correct standard is used, the claim must be remanded to the Secretary for reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">In <em>Davis, </em>this Court followed the explicit mandate of <em>Stone. </em>The Court found that the only definition of severe which was employed by the AU and adopted by the Secretary was the definition in the current regulations, p. 435. The Court further found that since \u201cneither the AU nor the Secretary referred to the \u2018slight abnormality\u2019 standard of the 1968 regulations, ... \u2018the claim must be remanded to the Secretary for reconsideration.\u2019 \u201d p. 436 (quoting <em>Stone, </em>752 F.2d at 1106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">In evaluating the severity of Jason\u2019s alleged impairments, the AU explicitly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>lied only on the current definition of non-severe. This definition provides that \u201c[a]n impairment is not severe if it does not significantly limit your physical or mental abilities to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1520(e). Neither the AU nor the Secretary referred to the \u201cslight abnormality\u201d standard of the 1968 regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Because under <em>Stone </em>and <em>Davis, </em>the wrong standard was used in evaluating the severity of Jason\u2019s alleged impairments, the judgment of the district court is vacated and this case is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the Secretary for reconsideration of the facts in the light of <em>Stone, </em>after considering any further evidence as may be offered by either Jason or the Secretary. Because this case must be remanded to the Secretary for further consideration, Jason\u2019s remaining allegations of error are not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\">. The 1968 regulations defined a nonsevere impairment as \"a slight neurosis, slight impairment of sight or hearing, or other slight abnormality or combination of abnormalities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502(a) (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-15\">. Because the AO clearly relied on the wrong legal standard, we do not address the question of retroactivity of Stone\u2019s assumption of incorrectness, an issue raised by the Secretary in her supplementary brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
