Bell also argues the district court\u2019s <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> responses to two questions from the jury were inconsistent and an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. We affirm Bell\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">On May 6, 1984 Bell was taken into custody by Kenneth Drags Wolf, Jr., a police officer employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in New Town, North Dakota. Bell allegedly was intoxicated and was in a domestic quarrel with his wife and children. As Bell and Drags Wolf exited Bell\u2019s home, Bell slammed the door in Drags Wolf\u2019s face, and began to run. Drags Wolf caught Bell, and Bell \u201cswung his right hand toward [the officer] * <em>* </em>*.\u201d The two wrestled to the ground. Bell shook Drags Wolf loose, ran to the top of a nearby hill, and got in his pick-up truck. Thinking Bell would drive the truck down the northbound road, Officer Drags Wolf abandoned the chase and turned back down the hill to his police car. Suddenly, Bell made a 180 degree turn, and drove the pick-up down the hill at Drags Wolf. Drags Wolf tripped, fell, and rolled away as Bell sped past, missing Drags Wolf by a mere six inches. Bell was arrested two miles away when his truck ran out of gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">After a jury trial, Bell was convicted on one count of assaulting with a dangerous weapon a federal officer engaged in the performance of his official duty and one count of assaulting and forcibly resisting and opposing a federal officer engaged in the performance of his official duty. He received a sentence of five years on the first count and a suspended sentence on the second count. Bell appeals only his conviction on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">Count two of the indictment charges Bell \u201cwillfully and forcibly did assault, resist, and oppose a Bureau of Indian Affairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>officer, Kenneth Drags Wolf * * * while Kenneth Drags Wolf was engaged in the performance of his official duties in that he struck at Officer Drags Wolf with his fists.\u201d Bell argues his conviction should be overturned because the evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that Bell used his fists to assault Drags Wolf.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We find Bell\u2019s argument unpersuasive. There was sufficient evidence to find Bell struck or attempted to strike Officer Drags Wolf with his hand. The officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">A. Okay. He came toward me and he swung his right hand toward me, and I blocked that * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Q. Did he strike you before you fell to the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Q. How many times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">A. Once.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The government was not required to prove any more than it did. There was clear evidence the assault took place, and whether Bell used his open hand or his fist in the initial scuffle is immaterial. The language in count two stating Bell \u201cstruck Officer Drags Wolf with his fists\u201d is surplusage, and not an element of the charged offense. The indictment sufficiently charges an assault without the descriptive phrase. Harmless surplusage in Bell\u2019s indictment does not require a reversal of his conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mohr, </em>728 F.2d 1132, 1134 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 148, 83 L.Ed.2d 87 (1984); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>604 F.2d 557, 560 (8th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Archer, </em>455 F.2d 193, 194 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 856, 93 S.Ct. 135, 34 L.Ed.2d 100 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">District Court\u2019s Response to Jury Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">Bell also contends his conviction on count two should be overturned because the district court abused its discretion in giving inconsistent and misleading responses to two questions from the jury. The two exchanges between the district court and the jury occurred approximately one and one half hours apart with the following notes being exchanged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-19\">(JURY) Q. Do we judge on assault or the method of assault? The <em>indictment </em>says use of fists for assault. <em>Verdict </em>just says assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-20\">(THE COURT) A. The reference in the verdict is just a shorthand reference. The obligation of the United States is to prove every element of the offense which is recited in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">(JURY) Q. Are we obliged under the law to find the defendant \u201cnot guilty\u201d if the evidence presented does not prove the specific type of assault (fists)? Or can we find him guilty of the charge if the evidence never presented this specific fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-22\">(THE COURT) A. The essential elements required to be proved in Count 2 are recited in instruction No. 14. In determining whether an assault occurred, you may consider all of the evidence received by the Court to that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-23\">We agree with the defendant the clear implication of the first answer of the district court was that the use of \u201cfists for assault\u201d set forth in the indictment was an element of the offense and had to be proved by the government. In contrast, the district court\u2019s answer to the second question told the jury the government only needed to prove the elements of the offense as set forth in instruction 14,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and omitted any reference to the means by which the assault took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">Notwithstanding the inconsistency of the district court\u2019s responses, we affirm Bell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>conviction on count two. There was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to infer Bell used his fist to strike Officer Drags Wolf. More importantly, the indictment\u2019s reference to Bell\u2019s use of his fists was surplusage. The court\u2019s first response indicating the government had to prove use of fists was thus harmless error, favoring rather than hurting Bell. If the defendant was convicted on the basis of the district court\u2019s response to the first question, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict reflects that it found the defendant guilty of using his fists. If the jury determined that the court\u2019s second response did not require them to find that fists were used, then the jury properly disregarded the court\u2019s first response and found Bell assaulted the officer. Either finding is supported sufficiently by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Bell argues that if the jury found an assault on count two and did not find that he had used his fists, then the jury was misled and may have based its finding on Bell\u2019s assault on the officer with the truck. Bell urges that both his assault convictions thus may have been founded on the same act. We disagree. The jury\u2019s questions to the district court demonstrate the jury was not concerned with the evidence relating to the first count, but was weighing only the proof going to count two. Further, instruction 14, referred to in the district court\u2019s second response, set forth only the elements of the offense charged in count two. We do not believe the jury was confused as to which evidence related to each of the two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Bell\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\">.
