(\u201cShallowford\u201d). In granting summary judgment, the district court affirmed a decision of the bankruptcy court which held that Miller\u2019s claim for insurance proceeds under the Georgia no-fault insurance law, although asserted after the commencement of Miller\u2019s bankruptcy case and subsequent to his discharge in bankruptcy, was property of the debtor\u2019s estate within the meaning of 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541(a)(1). Thus, the courts below held such proceeds were available to Miller\u2019s creditors upon Shallow-ford\u2019s petition to reopen the bankruptcy proceeding. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1681-13\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1681-14\">The undisputed facts of this case are as follows. On March 30, 1979, Atlanta Casualty Co. (\u201cAtlanta Casualty\u201d) issued an automobile insurance policy to Miller. Under the Georgia no-fault insurance law, Atlanta Casualty was required to make available on an optional basis up to $50,000 of personal injury protection insurance (\u201coptional PIP\u201d) per insured, including the statutory minimum of $5,000 PIP insurance. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-3404b(a)(l). Atlanta Casualty did not include on Miller\u2019s application for insurance the statutorily required spaces for the insured to indicate his acceptance or rejection of optional PIP benefits as was required by Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-3404b(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1681-15\">On September 25, 1979, Miller was involved in a serious car accident. Miller was admitted to Shallowford and was treated there for injuries suffered in the car accident. He incurred a substantial debt to Shallowford. On November 20, 1979, Atlanta Casualty, consistent with the terms of its insurance contract with Miller, paid to Miller and Shallowford $5,000 in standard PIP insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1681-16\">On October 22, 1980, the Georgia Court of Appeals decided <em>Jones v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>156 Ga.App. 230, 274 S.E.2d 623 (1980). In <em>Jones, </em>the court held that under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 56-3404b(a)(l) and (b) every application for no-fault insurance was required to contain separate spaces next to each optional coverage which under the law had to be offered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under <em>Jones, </em>in order to effective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>ly reject or accept optional coverages, the signature of the insured would have to appear in the separate designated spaces. If the contract was not so signed, the insured was deemed to have a \u201ccontinuing offer\u201d to accept or reject the optional coverages within 30 days after the notice of an offer for such coverages had been mailed to the insured under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-3404b(c). If after the 30-day period the insured had not responded to the insurer\u2019s notice of offer for optional coverages, such offer was deemed rejected. However, if the insured did not receive proper notice or if he responded within the 30-day period, he was entitled under <em>Jones </em>to accept the \u201ccontinuing offer\u201d simply by tendering the additional premium required for the optional coverage desired. <em>See Jones, </em>274 S.E.2d at 626-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1682-4\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that Miller\u2019s insurance form did not contain the separate spaces required under \u00a7 56-3404b(b). Moreover, there is no allegation that proper notice was sent to Miller under \u00a7 56-3404b(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Miller did not tender an additional premium when the <em>Jones </em>case was decided and, therefore, he did not receive optional PIP coverage at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1682-8\">On March 18, 1982, Miller filed his bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978. On June 25, 1982, Miller received his general discharge in bankruptcy, including discharge of his primary debt to Shallowford. On July 27, 1982, the bankruptcy court closed Miller\u2019s case. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 350(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1682-9\">On December 1, 1982, the Georgia Court of Appeals overrule^, its prior decision in <em>Jones </em>and held that separate spaces for acceptance or rejection next to each optional coverage were not required by \u00a7 56-3404b(b). <em>Atlanta Casualty Co. v. Flewellen, </em>164 Ga.App. 885, 300 S.E.2d 166 (1982). However, on March 3, 1983, the Georgia Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals\u2019 decision. <em>Flewellen v. Atlanta Casualty Co., </em>250 Ga. 709, 300 S.E.2d 673 (1983). The supreme court held, as had the court of appeals in <em>Jones, </em>that a signature in the appropriate space next to each optional coverage offered was necessary in order to reject such coverage. <em>Id. </em>300 S.E.2d at 676. Instead of embracing the <em>Jones </em>court\u2019s notion of a \u201ccontinuing offer,\u201d however, the supreme court held that if optional PIP coverage was not effectively \u201cwaived,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>rejected, by the insured the policy would from its inception provide for the maximum coverage of $50,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>which by statute had to be offered to all insureds. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, under <em>Flewellen, </em>if optional PIP coverage is not effectively rejected an \u201cinsured has the right to demand and receive the benefit of $50,000 coverage upon tender by the insured of such additional premium as may be due and filing of proof of loss by the injured party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1683-5\">On May 23, 1983, Miller\u2019s attorney demanded optional PIP benefits by tendering the additional premium owed and submitting proof of loss to Atlanta Casualty. On June 20, 1983, Atlanta Casualty responded to Miller\u2019s demand by issuing a joint check payable to Miller, Miller\u2019s attorney and Shallowford for approximately $45,000 (the $50,000 maximum PIP coverage less $5,000 in PIP coverage already paid under the policy). Shallowford refused to endorse the check to Miller and on June 27, 1983 it filed an application in the bankruptcy court to reopen Miller\u2019s Chapter 7 proceeding. In addition, Shallowford filed a complaint to revoke the discharge of Miller\u2019s debt to Shallowford, claiming that it was due $19,-095.50. The theory underlying Shallow-ford\u2019s claim was that, at the time Miller filed his Chapter 7 petition, Miller had an asset which was not reflected on his bankruptcy schedules and, therefore, the bankruptcy trustee was unable to secure such asset on behalf of Miller\u2019s creditors. This asset was in the form of a contractual right to or a cause of action for the maximum optional PIP benefits as established in the <em>Jones </em>case. Shallowford argued that these additional insurance proceeds could have been recovered and distributed to the creditors if the trustee had been aware of this asset during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1683-6\">On June 30, 1983, the bankruptcy court ordered the reopening of Miller\u2019s case. On June 11, 1984, the bankruptcy court ruled that the proceeds of Miller\u2019s claim against Atlanta Casualty were property of the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541(a)(1), agreeing with Shallowford that Miller\u2019s right to optional PIP benefits existed at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed. Therefore, the bankruptcy court ordered the trustee to distribute the proceeds of the optional PIP benefits as was necessary to satisfy the claims of Miller\u2019s creditors. . On November 6, 1984, the district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1683-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1683-13\">The Bankruptcy Code broadly defines the property of a debtor\u2019s estate to include \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor and property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541(a)(1). The legislative history indicates that this definition includes causes of action existing at the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy action. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 82, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5787, 5868; H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 367, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6323. It is clear, then, that the trustee in bankruptcy succeeds to all causes of action held by the debtor at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed, including actions \u201carising from contract\u201d such as any rights Miller may have had under his contract of insurance with Atlanta Casualty. <em>See </em>4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 541.10[5] (15th ed. 1985). The sole issue in this case, therefore, is whether Miller had a cause of action for optional PIP benefits at a time he commenced his bankruptcy proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1683-14\">Miller filed his bankruptcy petition in March of 1982. At that time, <em>Jones v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. </em>was the authoritative interpretation of \u00a7 56-3404b(b) of the Georgia no-fault automobile insurance law. As indicated above, under <em>Jones, </em>Miller could have simply tendered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>additional premium for the maximum optional PIP coverage, and thereby accepted Atlanta Casualty\u2019s \u201ccontinuing offer\u201d of optional PIP coverage under its contract of insurance with Miller. There is no question in this case that the contract of insurance did not conform to the requirements of \u00a7 56-3404b(b), as interpreted by the <em>Jones </em>court. Thus, if Atlanta Casualty had refused Miller\u2019s acceptance of its \u201ccontinuing offer,\u201d Miller could have successfully pursued a cause of action under <em>Jones. </em>Although the bankruptcy trustee in this case was not aware of Miller's Jones-based cause of action because it was not listed on Miller\u2019s schedule of assets, that does not mean the asset should be unavailable to creditors once the asset is discovered. <em>See </em>4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 350.03[2] &amp; cases cited (regarding \u201creopening of the case to administer newly discovered assets\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1684-4\">Miller argues that he should not be deemed to have had a Jones-based cause of action at the commencement of the bankruptcy case because in the aftermath of the <em>Jones </em>case the law under \u00a7 56-3404b(b) was confused and unclear. In this regard, Miller points to the court of appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Flewellen </em>overruling <em>Jones, </em>and to an affidavit from a claims attorney of Atlanta Casualty stating that Miller\u2019s /ones-based claim for optional PIP benefits would not have been paid prior to the <em>Flewellen </em>decision in the Georgia Supreme Court. In addition, Miller relies on the case of <em>Cotton States Mutual Ins. Co. v. McFather, </em>251 Ga. 739, 309 S.E.2d 799 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2336, 80 L.Ed.2d 811 (1984), in which the Georgia Supreme Court held that insurers would not be subjected to bad faith penalties for not paying <em>Jones </em>claims during the period after <em>Jones </em>and before <em>Flewellen </em>was decided in the Georgia Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>309 S.E.2d at 802-03. The <em>McFather </em>court so ruled because of the arguable confusion in the law between the <em>Jones </em>decision in the court of appeals and the <em>Flewellen </em>decision in the supreme court. <em>Id. </em>at 803. Miller claims that it is unfair to subject insureds to a <em>pre-Flewellen </em>understanding of <em>Jones, </em>while insurers under <em>McFather </em>are not required to have such an understanding. Thus, Miller argues that his cause of action for optional PIP coverage accrued when the Georgia Supreme Court decided <em>Flewellen </em>and as such is \u201cafter acquired\u201d property, <em>i.e., </em>not property of the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 541(a)(1) because it was acquired after the commencement of Miller\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1684-10\">Upon analysis, Miller\u2019s argument misses the mark. The question in this case is not whether the law <em>post-Jones </em>was arguably confusing to insurers and insureds; but, rather, whether Miller in fact had a cause of action at the time his bankruptcy proceeding commenced. Indeed, if the <em>Jones </em>decision had been crystal clear and Miller was aware of his cause of action at the time the bankruptcy proceeding commenced, the asset not only would be considered property of the estate, but he could also be subjected to penalties under the Bankruptcy Code for concealing assets and defrauding creditors. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 727(a), (d)(2); <em>see also Chalik v. Moorefield, </em>748 F.2d 616 (11th Cir.1984) (debtor\u2019s concealment of assets, even if worthless, warrants loss of discharge in bankruptcy). <em>But see infra </em>note 6. Assuming, however, that the state of the law was somewhat confused after <em>Jones,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is nevertheless clear that Miller had a cause of action for optional PIP coverage when <em>Jones </em>was decided. The Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Flewellen, </em>after deciding to return to the <em>Jones </em>multiple signature requirement, carefully considered the argument that its ruling should be prospective only. <em>Flewellen v. Atlanta Casualty Co., </em>300 S.E.2d at 676-78. The <em>Flewellen </em>court rejected this argument and held that <em>Flewellen/Jones </em>claims would be retroactive to the effective date of the Georgia no-fault law. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>678 (\u201cThe law had been in effect since 1975, Ga.L.1974, p. 113, and the insurer proceeded at its own risk in failing to comply with the statute when issuing this policy in 1979\u201d). This represents a definitive statement by the Georgia court that claims such as Miller\u2019s came into existence before <em>Jones </em>was decided, and <em>not </em>when <em>Flewellen </em>was decided in the Georgia Supreme Court. Indeed, this is the implicit meaning of <em>McFather. </em>Although <em>McFather </em>held that insurers would not be subject to bad faith penalties for nonpayment of benefits between the <em>Jones </em>and <em>Flewellen </em>decisions, such a decision is necessarily premised on an understanding that the insured had at the least a cause of action in that interim period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1685-5\">We hold that Miller\u2019s Jones-based claim to optional PIP coverage existed at the time Miller filed his Chapter 7 petition and, thus, such claim was property of his bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541(a)(1). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Shallowford is</p>\n<p id=\"b1685-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1681-12\">. In the text we have cited the relevant provisions of the Georgia no-fault statute in effect at the time Miller\u2019s insurance policy was issued. Since then, the Georgia Code has been recodified and the relevant provisions of the Georgia no-fault statute now appear in Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 33-34-5. Subsequent to the recodification, \u00a7 33-34-5(b), the primary provision of the Georgia no-fault statute of concern in the instant case, was amended in 1983. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 33 \u2014 34\u20145(b) (Michie Supp.1984). We need not address the significance of this amendment since the amendment explicitly limits its applicability to applications for motor vehicle insurance sold in \"Georgia after November 1, 1982, and, thus, can have no retroactive effect with respect to Miller\u2019s policy issued in March of 1979. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1681-18\"><em>. </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-3404b, in effect at the time of the issuance of Miller\u2019s insurance policy, read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1681-19\">\n<em>Optional Coverages.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1681-20\">(a) Each insurer shall also make available on an optional basis the following coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5s\">(1) An aggregate limit of benefits payable without regard to fault up to $50,000.00 per person, which may be rejected to reduce to not less than an aggregate limit of benefits payable without regard to fault of $5,000.00 per person by written consent of the policy holder____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Ur\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>(b) Each application for a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance sold in this state must contain separate spaces for the insured to indicate his acceptance or rejection of each of the optional coverages listed in subsection (a) of this Code section and no such policy shall be issued in this state unless these spaces are completed and signed by the prospective insured.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1682-6\">.

The notice provision quoted above was pri-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX3\">marily designed to provide a mechanism whereby insurers could offer to their insureds who had policies in existence prior to the effective date of the Georgia no-fault law the statutorily required opportunity to contract for the optional insurance benefits. The Georgia Supreme Court has held that the notice under \u00a7 56-3404b(c) had to contain written information clearly stating the optional coverages and a means for the insured to make a written acceptance or rejection of each coverage. However, the insured need not have provided a signature indicating acceptance or rejection of each optional coverage, as the <em>Jones </em>case required with respect to initial applications for optional insurance coverages under \u00a7 56-3404b(b). <em>See generally Wiard v. Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>251 Ga. 698, 310 S.E.2d 221 (1983).

District Court Order, Record, vol. 2 at 90. We need not decide, of course, whether, on a <em>McFather </em>rationale, a debtor-insured would be immune from fraud penalties in a bankruptcy proceeding for failure to schedule a <em>Jones </em>claim prior to the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mewellen. </em>Nevertheless, the above-quoted portion of the district court order is illuminating because it makes clear how the issue addressed in <em>McFather </em>differs from the issue in the instant case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
