Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7311<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, strike participants are barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>from federal employment. With respect to air traffic controllers who were discharged for participating in the 1981 strike, the President alleviated the total debarment to the extent of permitting reemployment of such persons in positions \u201coutside the scope of their former employing agency.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.201 <em>et seq., </em>OPM is charged with responsibility for determining the eligibility of applicants for various government positions, including former FAA controllers. OPM interpreted the President\u2019s directive as precluding employment of a former FAA controller in FAA and in certain air traffic controller positions in the Department of Defense (DOD). In accordance with this understanding, OPM requested FAA to compile a list of DOD facilities which were determined to have significant \u201cinterface\u201d with FAA operations and, thus, not \u201coutside the scope\u201d of FAA. Petitioner applied for a controller position at the Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, N.C., one of the facilities on the list, and OPM rated him ineligible for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Petitioner appealed to the MSPB, which held that OPM had to prove that its rating of ineligibility would promote the efficiency of the service. Petitioner argued that he had been certified for Griffiss AFB and that OPM had not shown how his employment at Cherry Point would negatively affect the air traffic control system. The presiding officer agreed, finding that OPM had failed to show that there is a \u201csignificant interface or close relationship\u201d between Cherry Point and FAA controllers to support the rating of ineligibility. In support of its action, OPM had submitted evidence that, unlike Griffiss AFB, the Cherry Point facility is a tower with instrument flight rules (IFR) and that FAA controllers telephone IFR towers to pass off aircraft at the 31,000 foot level to DOD controllers. However, the presiding official found \u201ca telephone contact of this nature\u201d insuffieient to bar employment as an air traffic controller at Cherry Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The board granted a petition for review submitted by OPM and reversed the presiding official\u2019s decision, relying upon its holding in <em>Caruso v. OPM, </em>22 M.S.P.R. 162 (1984), a similar case (decided the same day) involving negative suitability determinations for former controllers applying for positions at DOD\u2019s Point Magu, California, facility, also on FAA\u2019s prohibited list. Contrary to the finding of the presiding official, the board found that OPM\u2019s evidence of the interface between controllers in the Cherry Point IFR tower with FAA controllers, coupled with evidence of petitioner\u2019s strike participation (which had been sustained by the board), established by preponderant evidence that the negative rating given to petitioner promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Petitioner, appearing <em>pro se, </em>contends that his case should have been decided on its own merits, that the Cherry Point facility is not the same as the Point Magu facility, that FAA and DOD have separate airspace, that FAA\u2019s list should be disregarded since <em>all </em>control towers (not merely IFR towers) require interface and coordination with FAA facilities, that the board failed to take into account personal mitigating factors, and that \u201cthere has not been a single [adverse] incident between former and current controllers.\u201d Petitioner also proffers a second list of facilities he recently received which apparently differs from the first list (although both Cherry Point and Point Magu appear on both lists), as an indication of purported confusion on the part of OPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">As petitioner recognizes in his reply brief, our review of agency action is limited; we must sustain such action unless it is found to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-5\">(3) unsupported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APF\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Though petitioner challenges the \u201cexpertise\u201d of the agencies involved, we are unconvinced that the compilation of the debarment list, and the application of that list to petitioner\u2019s employment application, violated the above criteria. OPM correctly acted within the President\u2019s directive in barring controllers removed for striking, not only from all FAA positions, but also from positions which interface with FAA as well. Substantial evidence supports OPM\u2019s determination that Cherry Point is such a facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Accordingly, the board\u2019s decision, that OPM met its burden of establishing that its negative suitability determination with respect to petitioner promoted the efficiency of the service, is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-16\">.
