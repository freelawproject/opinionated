The proposal would require the Institute to correct all in-house cost estimate data, compiled to determine the comparative cost of assigning work to federal employees or contracting out to the private sector, which the union demonstrates is either invalid or not prepared in accordance with existing directives. The Authority cross-appeals for enforcement of its order, and the union intervenes on the Authority\u2019s behalf. Because the proposal improperly affects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>authority reserved to management under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B), we decline to enforce the Authority\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ACG\">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101-7135 (1982), establishes a collective bargaining system to govern labor-management relations in the federal sector. Federal agencies and employee unions share a duty to bargain in good faith over \u201cconditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7103(a)(12). The Act broadly defines \u201cconditions of employment\u201d to include \u201cpersonnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7103(a)(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-6\">This duty to bargain is not without limit. Certain prerogatives are reserved to management. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a). In particular, management has the authority \u201cto make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B). But the <em>procedures </em>observed by management in exercising its reserved authority are subject to negotiation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(b)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-8\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW Except for functions that are \u201cinherently Governmental in nature,\u201d the stated policy of the federal government is to rely on private enterprise to supply its needs, if doing so is cost-effective. OMB Circular A-76 (the Circular), 48 Fed.Reg. 37, 110 (1983). This policy requires the Institute to conduct comparative cost analyses to determine whether it should obtain necessary goods and services from the private sector or \u201cin-house\u201d from government personnel. A Cost Comparison Handbook supplements the Circular and outlines procedures to be followed in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-14\">In August 1982, the Institute and the union signed a collective bargaining agreement. The agreement contained a provision concerning the contracting out of Institute work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1523-15\">Subsequent to opening of the bid and before a contract is awarded, the Union shall be provided all data concerning the \u201cin-house\u201d estimate of cost of the work to be performed. The Union will be given ten (10) workdays, which may be extended upon request, to review the \u201cin-house\u201d estimate and other pertinent data and to comment on and/or challenge the validity of the data. <em>All data mil be corrected where the union demonstrates that it is not valid or prepared in accordance with existing directives.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1523-16\">(emphasis added). The parties\u2019 dispute concerns the underscored portion of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-17\">The Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command reviewed the agreement and determined that the portion of the proposal requiring the correction of invalid or improperly prepared data was non-negotiable because it interfered with management\u2019s reserved authority to make determinations to contract out. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(c) (agreements are subject to approval by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>head of the agency). The union petitioned the Authority to review the disapproval. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7117(c). The Authority ruled in favor of the union, finding that the proposal was not inconsistent with the Institute\u2019s reserved right to make determinations concerning contracting out and that the proposal did not conflict with the procedures established in the Circular. <em>See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1263 and Defense Language Institute, </em>14 FLRA No. 101, at 3-4 (1984). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-6\">The parties\u2019 dispute centers on the relationship between sections 7106(a) and 7106(b) of Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)-(b). The substantive rights reserved to management under section 7106(a) are not negotiable, but the procedures by which that authority is exercised are subject to negotiation. <em>EEOC v. FLRA, </em>744 F.2d 842, 845 (D.C.Cir. 1984), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3497, 87 L.Ed.2d 629 (1985); <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1151-52 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982). This statutory structure, when projected against the deeply rooted legal distinction between substance and procedure with which we are all familiar, suggests that the issue before us is whether the challenged provision is substantive or procedural. This formulation is misleading, however. The true issue is whether the challenged provision constitutes, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(2), \u201cprocedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section.\u201d \u201cAuthority\u201d exercisable under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106 includes the right \u201cto make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B). Our. task is to interpret section 7106 so as to give each part its proper meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-11\">The Authority maintains that the challenged provision imposes no particular limitation on management\u2019s right to make contraeting-out determinations. Rather, it merely concerns procedures that management will observe in exercising its authority to contract out. Management may use only valid data prepared in compliance with existing external limitations on its discretion, including the Circular.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1263 and Defense Language Institute, </em>14 FLRA No. 101, at 3 (1984). The Authority concludes, in effect, that the challenged proposal constitutes a \u201cprocedure\u201d within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) and as such is subject to negotiation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>In rendering its negotiability ruling, the Authority \u201cexercise[d] its \u2018special function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities\u2019 of federal labor relations.\u201d <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms v. FLRA, </em>464 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 439, 444, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., </em>373 U.S. 221, 236, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 1150, 10 L.Ed.2d 308 (1963)). Its determination therefore deserves considerable deference. <em>Id. </em>But we cannot rubber-stamp a decision that fails to give a proper construction of a pertinent statute or that frustrates an underlying congressional policy. <em>Id. </em>We believe this case requires that we invoke this deference-limiting principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-4\">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act reflects an accommodation of twin policies. Undeniably, Congress intended to expand \u201cthe statutory protection of the right of [federal] employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(a)(1) (statement of findings and purpose). At the same time, however, Congress strove to preserve the ability of the federal government to operate in an efficient and effective manner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the very terms of the Act require interpretation of its provisions \u201cin a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-5\">The Authority\u2019s interpretation does not do this. It subjects all contracting-out determinations to the grievance mechanism provided by the Act, to arbitral review, and \u2014 ultimately\u2014to review by the Authority. Judicial review thereafter may be unavailable. <em>See EEOC v. FLRA, </em>744 F.2d at 860 n. 17 (MacKinnon, J., dissenting). If adopted as a result of negotiation, the union\u2019s proposal would allow review by an arbitrator and by the Authority of the data underlying management\u2019s \u201cin-house\u201d cost estimate for compliance with the Circular. But because the Circular lacks meaningful standards to guide management\u2019s discretion, the Authority\u2019s review would confront the same difficulty that has led courts to hold that judicial review of an agency\u2019s contracting-out determination and of the underlying studies and cost estimates is unavailable. <em>See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2017 v. Brown, </em>680 F.2d 722 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1104, 103 S.Ct. 728, 74 L.Ed.2d 952 (1983); <em>Local 2855, AFGE v. United States, </em>602 F.2d 574, 580-83 (3d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-9\">Determining the most efficient configuration of government employees and resources or determining whether certain expenses are legitimate costs of an in-house operation inevitably involve \u201c \u2018questions of judgment requiring close analysis and nice choices\u2019 \u201d which are properly committed to the informed discretion of management. <em>See AGFE, Local 2017 v. Brown, </em>680 F.2d at 727 (quoting <em>Panama Canal Co. v. Grace Line, Inc., </em>356 U.S. 309, 318, 78 S.Ct. 752, 757, 2 L.Ed.2d 788 (1958)). The Circular\u2019s lack of definite guidelines to shape the exercise of this discretion will result in arbitral review in which the arbitrator can substitute his judgment for that of the agency. This second judgment, in turn, may be set aside in favor of that of the Authority. The potential for long delays is obvious. More than delay is involved, however. <em>See Department of Defense, </em>659 F.2d at 1153-58 (rejecting contention that proposals resulting in delay infringe management\u2019s reserved rights). The operative effect of the union\u2019s proposal is to divest management of the essence of its statutory authority to contract out. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>der its view, the powers of management become a very small pit of a very large piece of fruit, the succulent part of which is \u201cprocedures\u201d to be observed by management. We therefore reject the Authority\u2019s contention that the proposal \u201cimposes no particular limitation on management's right to make contracting-out determinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-4\">The Authority, relying again on <em>EEOC v. FLRA, </em>asserts that the Act would allow grievances alleging errors in management\u2019s cost estimate data even in the absence of a specific provision in the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See </em>744 F.2d at 849-51. \u201cGrievance,\u201d the Authority asserts, is defined expansively to include \u201cany claimed violation, interpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii). Moreover, the Act expressly excludes only five subjects from the grievance mechanism\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This broad definition, the Authority maintains, embraces grievances challenging management\u2019s comparative cost analysis. We reject this contention for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-5\">First, we find it incredible that the parties would so strenuously dispute a proposal that gives the union nothing it did not already possess and deprives management of nothing it had not already lost. Second, and more important, the express language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106 contradicts the Authority\u2019s position. Section 7106 provides that, except for 7106(b), <em>\u201cnothing in this chapter shall affect </em>the authority of any management official of any agency ... in accordance with applicable laws ... to make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). By its terms, this proscription applies to the Act\u2019s grievance mechanism.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>EEOC v. FLRA, </em>744 F.2d at 857 (MacKinnon, J., dissenting). Having decided that the union\u2019s proposal violates rights reserved to management under section 7106(a), our inquiry is at an end.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1526-16\">We deny the Authority\u2019s request to enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-17\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1523-9\">. The Authority had jurisdiction to determine whether the Institute\u2019s duty to bargain embraced the disputed proposal under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7117(c). This court has jurisdiction over the Institute\u2019s timely petition for review and the Authority's cross-petition for enforcement under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a)-(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1523-10\">.

In past decisions, the Authority has applied two distinct tests to classify proposals as concerning negotiable procedures under section 7106(b) or nonegotiable substantive rights under section 7106(a). Proposals which \"stand close to the uncertain border between procedure and substance\" are nonnegotiable if their adoption would \"directly interfere\" with management's reserved rights. <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1159 (D.C.Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982); <em>accord Navy Pub. Works Center v. FLRA, </em>678 F.2d 97, 100 n. 3 (9th Cir.1982). Such proposals, while cast in procedural language, specify substantive criteria to govern decisions protected by section 7106(a). <em>Department of Defense, </em>659 F.2d at 1152. Alternatively, more pristinely procedural proposals are negotiable unless implementation would prevent management from \"acting at all.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1153; <em>accord Navy Pub. Works Center, </em>678 F.2d at 100 n. 3. The Authority offers no explanation for why it declined to apply either test and opted instead to focus on the degree of discretion retained by the agency. We note that the Authority finds some support in recent case law. <em>See EEOC </em>v. <em>FLRA, </em>744 F.2d at 848 n. 12. But we do not reach the issue because we conclude that the union\u2019s proposal fails under all three formulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1524-13\">. The Authority relies primarily on a recent decision of the District of Columbia Circuit upholding the Authority\u2019s determination that a proposal requiring management to comply with the Circular and other applicable laws concerning contracting out was bargainable. <em>See EEOC v. FLRA, </em>744 F.2d at 842. The court reasoned that the proposal did not define any substantive criteria guiding the contracting-out decision, but rather \u201dechoe[d] the statutory requirement that contracting-out determinations be made in accordance with applicable laws\u201d; the proposal therefore did not trench upon management\u2019s reserved rights under section 7106. <em>See id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>848.

In <em>EEOC v.

The court reasoned that the Act's grievance mechanism would cover complaints that management failed to make contracting-out determinations \"in accordance with applicable law,\u201d as required by section 7106(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>Such complaints would be grievable even in the absence of the contract proposal. <em>Id. </em>at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-14\">In effect, the <em>EEOC </em>court construed the phrase \u201capplicable law\u201d to include the Act\u2019s grievance provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 857 (MacKinnon, J., dissenting). It may be that Congress intended to shield management\u2019s reserved rights from bargaining but not from the grievance mechanism and ultimate review through arbitration. But we agree with the dissent that, had Congress intended contracting-out decisions to be grievable, it was \"singularly inept\u201d in articulating its purpose. <em>See id. </em>(MacKinnon, J., dissenting).
