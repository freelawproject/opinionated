The motion is based on the movant\u2019s having received an Official Action of the United States Patent and Trademark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Office (PTO) which cites as authority the district court\u2019s decision from which this appeal was taken, and concern that the PTO might continue to cite that district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The PTO was supplied a copy of this court\u2019s February 15, 1985 opinion. That this court reversed the decision of the district court will be reported in Federal Reporter 2d.
