Appellants were indicted for conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute marijuana under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 955a(a), 955c and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. Pri- or to entering their pleas, all appellants joined in a motion to dismiss the indictments, asserting that the boat was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 955b(d) because the boat was validly registered in Venezuela. The district court held an evidentiary hearing on appellants\u2019 motion and thereafter denied the motion, holding that the appellants\u2019 boat was \u201cstateless\u201d and, thus, subject to United States jurisdiction under \u00a7 955b(d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>Record, vol. 2 at 73-77. Then, pursuant to a plea agreement, appellants pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count and the government agreed to dismiss the. substantive count, subject to appellants\u2019 rights to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 78-79. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-5\">At the evidentiary hearing on appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss, Coast Guard Seaman Eddie Rolon testified on behalf of the government and appellant Jose Saavedra testified on behalf of the appellants. The facts which follow are taken from the district court\u2019s findings of fact which are not challenged on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1636-6\">On May 19, 1984, the Coast Guard cutter DILIGENCE approached the BISMARK, the ship occupied by appellants. A conversation occurred over the ships\u2019 radios between Rolon and an individual who identified himself as the acting captain of the BISMARK. The acting captain\u2019s responses to specific questions from Rolon indicated that all the members of the crew were Colombian and that the ship was of Colombian registry. After receiving these answers, Rolon asked the acting captain to display a flag or some evidence of the nationality of the vessel. At this point, the acting captain directed that a Colombian flag be displayed from the bridge of the vessel, and a flag was displayed. The district court received the flag in evidence and determined that it was in fact a Colombian flag. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. After the Coast Guard boarded the BISMARK, a \u201chybrid\u201d flag was found in the crew\u2019s quarters. The flag incorporated characteristics of both the Venezuelan flag and the Colombian flag. The district court also found that the BISMARK did not have a registry vessel number, a home port, or its name painted on its hull. Rather, \u201c[tjhere was a nameplate that was portable and/or removable that was hung over the side or some prominent portion of the vessel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-10\">Appellants argue, as they did in the district court, that the BISMARK was not subject to United States jurisdiction and, therefore, their convictions are invalid. It is illegal for persons \u201con board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States on the high seas\u201d to possess or to conspire to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 955a(a), 955c. \u201cVessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is defined by statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1636-11\">\u201cVessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d includes a vessel without nationality or a vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality, in accordance with paragraph (2) of article 6 of the Convention on the High Seas, 1958.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1636-12\">21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 955b(d). The above-quoted statutory language permits the exercise of jurisdiction over vessels which are \u201cstateless.\u201d The question in this case, then, is whether the BISMARK was \u201cstateless\u201d within the meaning of the statute and relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-13\">There is no question that the BISMARK was not \u201ca vessel without nationality\u201d because it is undisputed that the BISMARK was validly registered in Venezuela. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 2 at 6. We must determine, however, whether the BISMARK was \u201ca vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality\u201d within the meaning of the relevant portions of the Convention on the High Seas. Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Convention on the High Seas of 1958 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1636-14\">A ship which sails under the flags of two or more States, using them according to convenience, may not claim any of the nationalities in question with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>to any other State, and may be assimilated to a ship without nationality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT-\"><em>Reprinted in </em>13 U.S.T. at 2315. In <em>United States v. Batista, </em>731 F.2d 765 (11th Cir. 1984), this court interpreted the above-quoted language as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1637-5\">A vessel which sails under the authority of two or more states, and uses them according to convenience, such as in this case flying one flag and claiming nationality under another, will be deemed a stateless vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1637-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 767; <em>see also United States v. Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d 1373 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Pauth-Arzuza v. United States, </em>459 U.S. 1114, 103 S.Ct. 748, 74 L.Ed.2d 967 (1983). A brief examination of the facts as found by the district court lead us inescapably to the conclusion that the BISMARK was sailing under the authority of two nations. The BISMARK\u2019s acting captain stated that the crewmembers were Colombians and the crew presented a valid Colombian flag. However, when asked to present the vessel\u2019s registration, the crew produced Venezuelan registration papers. The BISMARK\u2019s lack of permanent indicia of name and home port on its hull is also a clear indication that the crew wanted to be able to manipulate the vessel\u2019s \u201cnationality\u201d on short notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-7\">Appellants argue that the Convention on the High Seas and relevant binding case law does not establish United States jurisdiction over a vessel if, as in this case, the vessel is validly registered in a foreign country. Appellants claim that a ship may only be considered \u201cassimilated to a ship without nationality\u201d if it sails under the authority of two or more States, using them according to convenience, <em>and </em>it is not validly registered in any foreign nation. We need only look to the ease of <em>United States v. Marino-Garcia </em>in order to reject this argument. In <em>Marino-Garcia, </em>the crewmembers of the FOUR ROSES were indicted under the same drug laws at issue in this case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1637-8\">We note that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the determination that the FOUR ROSES was a stateless vessel. A vessel will be deemed stateless where it sails under the authority of two or more States and uses them according to convenience____ The FOUR ROSES appears to have been registered in Honduras under the name JENNY CONNOR. When approached by the Coast Guard cutter DEPENDABLE, however, the vessel displayed no indicia of Honduran authority. In fact, the name of the vessel had been altered and the words \u201cMiami, Florida\u201d stenciled on the bow to indicate the home port. Additionally, crewmen told Coast Guard personnel that the vessel\u2019s nationality was \u201cMiami, Florida.\u201d Thus the vessel was registered under one nationality but asserting a false nationality when encountered by the Coast Guard cutter DEPENDABLE. Under Section 955a, the vessel was clearly characterizable as stateless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1637-12\"><em>Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d at 1378 n. 3. In both <em>Marino-Garcia </em>and in the instant case, the marijuana-laden ships were validly registered in a foreign country, while the crewmembers displayed various indicia of nationality in another country. Although in <em>Marino-Gareia </em>the \u201csecond country\u201d was the United States, this factor cannot and should not logically make any difference. The most reasonable inference from the facts of this case is that the crewmembers of the BISMARK were hoping, if worse came to worst, that they could evade the jurisdictions of the United States, Venezuela and Colombia through the clever use of registration papers and various other indicia of nationality. This is precisely what 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 955b(d) and Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Convention of the High Seas were designed to prevent. <em>See generally Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d at 1379-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-13\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss is</p>\n<p id=\"ATBG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1636-7\">. The district court\u2019s findings of fact indicate that the court basically adopted Rolon's testimony. To the extent that Saavedra's testimony was inconsistent with Rolon's testimony, the district court explicitly credited Rolon. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 2 at 75. This credibility finding was, of course, fully within the province of the district court and such finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
