S. T. 77, 100-101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, addresses communication between an individual and his consular officers when the individual is detained by authorities in a foreign country. These consolidated cases concern the availability of judicial relief for violations of Article 36. We are confronted with three questions. <em>First, </em>does Article 36 create rights that defendants may invoke against the detaining authorities in a criminal trial or in a postconviction proceeding? <em>Second, </em>does a violation of Article 36 require suppression of a defendant\u2019s statements to police? <em>Third, </em>may a State, in a postconviction proceeding, treat a defendant\u2019s Article 36 claim as defaulted because he failed to raise the claim at trial? We conclude, even assuming the Convention creates judicially enforceable rights, that suppression is not an appropriate remedy for a violation of Article 36, and that a State may apply its regular rules of procedural default to Article 36 claims. We therefore affirm the decisions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The Vienna Convention was drafted in 1963 with the purpose, evident in its preamble, of \u201ccontributing] to the development of friendly relations among nations, irrespective of their differing constitutional and social systems.\u201d 21 U. S. T., at 79. The Convention consists of 79 articles regulating various aspects of consular activities. At present, 170 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>countries are party to the Convention. The United States, upon the advice and consent of the Senate, ratified the Convention in 1969. <em>Id., </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Article 36 of the Convention concerns consular officers\u2019 access to their nationals detained by authorities in a foreign country. The article provides that \u201cif he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner.\u201d Art. 36(l)(b), <em>id., </em>at 101.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, when a national of one country is detained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>authorities in another, the authorities must notify the consular officers of the detainee\u2019s home country if the detainee so requests. Article 36(l)(b) further states that \u201c[t]he said authorities shall inform the person concerned [L <em>e., </em>the detainee] without delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Convention also provides guidance regarding how these requirements, and the other requirements of Article 36, are to be implemented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cThe rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended.\u201d Art. 36(2), <em>ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Along with the Vienna Convention, the United States ratified the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes (Optional Protocol or Protocol), Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The Optional Protocol provides that \u201c[disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice [(ICJ)],\u201d and allows parties to the Protocol to bring such disputes before the ICJ. <em>Id., </em>at 326. The United States gave notice of its withdrawal from the Optional Protocol on March 7, 2005. Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, to Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Petitioner Mois\u00e9s Sanchez-Llamas is a Mexican national. In December 1999, he was involved in an exchange of gunfire with police in which one officer suffered a gunshot wound in the leg. Police arrested Sanchez-Llamas and gave him warnings under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>both English and Spanish. At no time, however, did they inform him that he could ask to have the Mexican Consulate notified of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Shortly after the arrest and <em>Miranda </em>warnings, police interrogated Sanchez-Llamas with the assistance of an interpreter. In the course of the interrogation, Sanchez-Llamas made several incriminating statements regarding the shootout with police. He was charged with attempted aggravated murder, attempted murder, and several other offenses. Before trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress the statements he made to police. He argued that suppression was warranted because the statements were made involuntarily and because the authorities had failed to comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. The trial court denied the motion. The case proceeded to trial, and Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced to 2OV2 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">He appealed, again arguing that the Vienna Convention violation required suppression of his statements. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. Judgt. order reported at 191 Ore. App. 399, 84 P. 3d 1133 (2004). The Oregon Supreme Court also affirmed, concluding that Article 36 \u201cdoes not create rights to consular access or notification that are enforceable by detained individuals in a judicial proceeding.\u201d 338 Ore. 267, 276, 108 P. 3d 573, 578 (2005) (en banc). We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. 1001 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Petitioner Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was with several other men at a restaurant in Springfield, Virginia, on the night of December 10, 1997. That evening, outside the restaurant, James Merry was struck in the head with a baseball bat as he stood smoking a cigarette. He died several days later. Several witnesses at the scene identified Bustillo as the assailant. Police arrested Bustillo the morning after the attack and eventually charged him with mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>der. Authorities never informed him that he could request to have the Honduran Consulate notified of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">At trial, the defense pursued a theory that another man, known as \u201cSirena,\u201d was responsible for the attack. Two defense witnesses testified that Bustillo was not the killer. One of the witnesses specifically identified the attacker as Sirena. In addition, a third defense witness stated that she had seen Sirena on a flight to Honduras the day after the victim died. In its closing argument before the jury, the prosecution dismissed the defense theory about Sirena. See App. in No. 05-51, p. 21 (\u201cThis whole Sirena thing, I don\u2019t want to dwell on it too much. It\u2019s very convenient that Mr. Sirena apparently isn\u2019t available\u201d). A jury convicted Bustillo of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After his conviction became final, Bustillo filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. There, for the first time, he argued that authorities had violated his right to consular notification under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. He claimed that if he had been advised of his right to confer with the Honduran Consulate, he \u201cwould have done so without delay.\u201d App. in No. 05-51, at 60. Moreover, the Honduran Consulate executed an affidavit stating that \u201cit would have endeavoured to help Mr. Bustillo in his defense\u201d had it learned of his detention prior to trial. <em>Id., </em>at 74. Bustillo insisted that the consulate could have helped him locate Sirena prior to trial. His habeas petition also argued, as part of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, that his attorney should have advised him of his right to notify the Honduran Consulate of his arrest and detention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The state habeas court dismissed Bustillo\u2019s Vienna Convention claim as \u201cprocedurally barred\u201d because he had failed to raise the issue at trial or on appeal. App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 05-51, p. 43a. The court also denied Bustillo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, ruling that his belated claim that counsel should have informed him of his Vienna Convention rights was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and also meritless under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U. S. 668 (1984). App. in No. 05-51, at 132. In an order refusing Bustillo\u2019s petition for appeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia found \u201cno reversible error\u201d in the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the Vienna Convention claim. App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 05-51, at la. We granted certiorari to consider the Vienna Convention issue. 546 U. S. 1001 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We granted certiorari as to three questions presented in these cases: (1) whether Article 36 of the Vienna Convention grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a judicial proceeding; (2) whether suppression of evidence is a proper remedy for a violation of Article 36; and (3) whether an Article 36 claim may be deemed forfeited under state procedural rules because a defendant failed to raise the claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As a predicate to their claims for relief, Sanchez-Llamas and Bustillo each argue that Article 36 grants them an individually enforceable right to request that their consular officers be notified of their detention, and an accompanying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>right to be informed by authorities of the availability of consular notification. Respondents and the United States, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>strongly dispute this contention. They argue that \u201cthere is a presumption that a treaty will be enforced through political and diplomatic channels, rather than through the courts.\u201d Brief for United States 11; <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Head Money Cases, </em>112 U. S. 580, 598 (1884) (a treaty \u201c \u2018is primarily a compact between independent nations,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018depends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and the honor of the governments which are parties to it\u2019\u201d)). Because we conclude that Sanchez-Llamas and Bustillo are not in any event entitled to relief on their claims, we find it unnecessary to resolve the question whether the Vienna Convention grants individuals enforceable rights. Therefore, for purposes of addressing petitioners\u2019 claims, we assume, without deciding, that Article 36 does grant Bustillo and Sanchez-Llamas such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Sanchez-Llamas argues that the trial court was required to suppress his statements to police because authorities never told him of his rights under Article 36. He refrains, however, from arguing that the Vienna Convention itself mandates suppression. We think this a wise concession. The Convention does not prescribe specific remedies for violations of Article 36. Rather, it expressly leaves the implementation of Article 36 to domestic law: Rights under Article 36 are to \u201cbe exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. As far as the text of the Convention is concerned, the question of the availability of the exclusionary rule for Article 36 violations is a matter of domestic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">It would be startling if the Convention were read to require suppression. The exclusionary rule as we know it is an entirely American legal creation. See <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U. S. 388, 415 (1971) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(Burger, C. J., dissenting) (the exclusionary rule \u201cis unique to American jurisprudence\u201d). More than 40 years after the drafting of the Convention, the automatic exclusionary rule applied in our courts is still \u201cuniversally rejected\u201d by other countries. Bradley, <em>Mapp </em>Goes Abroad, 52 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 375, 399-400 (2001); see also <em>Zicherman </em>v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co., </em>516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996) (postratification understanding \u201ctraditionally considered\u201d as an aid to treaty interpretation). It is implausible that other signatories to the Convention thought it to require a remedy that nearly all refuse to recognize as a matter of domestic law. There is no reason to suppose that Sanchez-Llamas would be afforded the relief he seeks here in any of the other 169 countries party to the Vienna Convention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>For good reason then, Sanchez-Llamas argues only that suppression is required because it is the appropriate remedy for an Article 36 violation under United States law, and urges us to require suppression for Article 36 violations as a matter of our \u201cauthority to develop remedies for the enforcement of federal law in state-court criminal proceedings.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 04-10566, p. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">For their part, the State of Oregon and the United States, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>contend that we lack any such authority over state-court proceedings. They argue that our cases suppressing evidence obtained in violation of federal statutes are grounded in our supervisory authority over the federal courts\u2014an authority that does not extend to state-court proceedings. Brief for Respondent in No. 04-10566, pp. 42-43; Brief for United States 32-34; see <em>McNabb </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U. S. 332, 341 (1943) (suppressing evidence for violation of federal statute requiring persons arrested without a warrant to be promptly presented to a judicial officer); <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 449 (1957) (suppressing evidence for violation of similar requirement of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a)); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U. S. 301 (1958) (suppressing evidence obtained incident to an arrest that violated 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3109). Unless required to do so by the Convention itself, they argue, we cannot direct Oregon courts to exclude Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 statements from his criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">To the extent Sanchez-Llamas argues that we should invoke our supervisory authority, the law is clear: \u201cIt is beyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power over the courts of the several States.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U. S. 428, 438 (2000); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U. S. 209, 221 (1982) (\u201cFederal courts hold no supervisory authority over state judicial proceedings and may intervene only to correct wrongs of constitutional dimension\u201d). The cases on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>which Sanchez-Llamas principally relies are inapplicable in light of the limited reach of our supervisory powers. <em>Mallory </em>and <em>McNabb </em>plainly rest on our supervisory authority. <em>Mallory, supra, </em>at 453; <em>McNabb, supra, </em>at 340. And while <em>Miller </em>is not clear about its authority for requiring suppression, we have understood it to have a similar basis. See <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 31 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We also agree with the State of Oregon and the United States that our authority to create a judicial remedy applicable in state court must lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself. Under the Constitution, the President has the power, \u201cby and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties.\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The United States ratified the Convention with the expectation that it would be interpreted according to its terms. See 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 325(1) (1986) (\u201cAn international agreement is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\u201d). If we were to require suppression for Article 36 violations without some authority in the Convention, we would in effect be supplementing those terms by enlarging the obligations of the United States under the Convention. This is entirely inconsistent with the judicial function. Cf. <em>The Amiable Isabella, </em>6 Wheat. 1, 71 (1821) (Story, J.) (\u201c[T]o alter, amend, or add to any treaty, by inserting any clause, whether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our part an usurpation of power, and not an exercise of judicial functions. It would be to make, and not to construe a treaty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Of course, it is well established that a self-executing treaty binds the States pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, and that the States therefore must recognize the force of the treaty in the course of adjudicating the rights of litigants. See, <em>e. g., Hauenstein </em>v. <em>Lynham, </em>100 U. S. 483 (1880). And where a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>there is no issue of intruding on the constitutional prerogatives of the States or the other federal branches. Courts must apply the remedy as a requirement of federal law. Cf. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2515; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>416 U. S. 505, 524-525 (1974). But where a treaty does not provide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for the federal courts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Sanchez-Llamas argues that the language of the Convention implicitly requires a judicial remedy because it states that the laws and regulations governing the exercise of Article 36 rights \u201cmust enable <em>full effect </em>to be given to the purposes for which the rights ... are intended,\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). In his view, although \u201cfull effect\u201d may not automatically require an exclusionary rule, it does require an appropriate judicial remedy of <em>some </em>kind. There is reason to doubt this interpretation. In particular, there is little indication that other parties to the Convention have interpreted Article 36 to require a judicial remedy in the context of criminal prosecutions. See Department of State Answers to Questions Posed by the First Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nai Fook Li, </em>No. 97-2034 etc., p. A-9 (Oct. 15, 1999) (\u201cWe are unaware of any country party to the [Vienna Convention] that provides remedies for violations of consular notification through its domestic criminal justice system\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Nevertheless, even if Sanchez-Llamas is correct that Article 36 implicitly requires a judicial remedy, the Convention equally states that Article 36 rights \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. Under our domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not a remedy we apply lightly. \u201c[0]ur cases have repeatedly emphasized that the rule\u2019s \u2018costly toll\u2019 upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging application of the rule.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Scott, </em>524 U. S. 357, 364-365 (1998). Because the rule\u2019s social costs are considerable, suppression is warranted only where the rule\u2019s \u201c \u2018remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U. S. 897, 908 (1984) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We have applied the exclusionary rule primarily to deter constitutional violations. In particular, we have ruled that the Constitution requires the exclusion of evidence obtained by certain violations of the Fourth Amendment, see <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>457 U. S. 687, 694 (1982) (arrests in violation of the Fourth Amendment); <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 655-657 (1961) (unconstitutional searches and seizures), and confessions exacted by police in violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination or due process, see <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U. S., at 435 (failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings); <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>356 U. S. 560, 568 (1958) (involuntary confessions).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The few cases in which we have suppressed evidence for statutory violations do not help Sanchez-Llamas. In those cases, the excluded evidence arose directly out of statutory violations that implicated important Fourth and Fifth Amendment interests. <em>McNdbb, </em>for example, involved the suppression of incriminating statements obtained during a prolonged detention of the defendants, in violation of a statute requiring persons arrested without a warrant to be promptly presented to a judicial officer. We noted that the statutory right was intended to \u201cavoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime,\u201d 318 U. S., at 344, and later stated that <em>McNabb </em>was \u201cresponsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that . . . face[d] us ... as to the States\u201d in <em>Miranda, </em>384 U. S., at 463. Similarly, in <em>Miller, </em>we required suppression of evidence that was the product of a search incident to an unlawful arrest. 357 U. S., at 305; see <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D, </em>499 U. S. 621, 624 (1991) (\u201cWe have long understood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against 'unreasonable . . . seizures\u2019 includes seizure of the person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The violation of the right to consular notification, in contrast, is at best remotely connected to the gathering of evidence. Article 36 has nothing whatsoever to do with searches or interrogations. Indeed, Article 36 does not guarantee defendants <em>any </em>assistance at all. The provision secures only a right of foreign nationals to have their consulate <em>informed </em>of their arrest or detention\u2014not to have their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement authorities cease their investigation pending any such notice or intervention. In most circumstances, there is likely to be little connection between an Article 36 violation and evidence or statements obtained by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Moreover, the reasons we often require suppression for Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations are entirely absent from the consular notification context. We require exclusion of coerced confessions both because we disapprove of such coercion and because such confessions tend to be unreliable. Watkins v. <em>Sowders, </em>449 U. S. 341, 347 (1981). We exclude the fruits of unreasonable searches on the theory that without a strong deterrent, the constraints of the Fourth Amendment might be too easily disregarded by law enforcement. <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 206, 217 (1960). The situation here is quite different. The failure to inform a defendant of his Article 36 rights is unlikely, with any frequency, to produce unreliable confessions. And unlike the search-and-seizure context\u2014where the need to obtain valuable evidence may tempt authorities to transgress Fourth Amendment limitations\u2014police win little, if any, practical advantage from violating Article 36. Suppression would be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an Article 36 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Sanchez-Llamas counters that the failure to inform defendants of their right to consular notification gives them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201ca misleadingly incomplete picture of [their] legal options,\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 04-10566, p. 42, and that suppression will give authorities an incentive to abide by Article 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Leaving aside the suggestion that it is the role of police generally to advise defendants of their legal options, we think other constitutional and statutory requirements effectively protect the interests served, in Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 view, by Article 36. A foreign national detained on suspicion of crime, like anyone else in our country, enjoys under our system the protections of the Due Process Clause. Among other things, he is entitled to an attorney, and is protected against compelled self-incrimination. See <em>Wong Wing </em>v. <em>United States, </em>163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896) (\u201c[A]ll persons within the territory of the United States are entitled to the protection guaranteed by\u201d the Fifth and Sixth Amendments). Article 36 adds little to these \u201clegal options,\u201d and we think it unnecessary to apply the exclusionary rule where other constitutional and statutory protections\u2014many of them already enforced by the exclusionary rule\u2014safeguard the same interests Sanchez-Llamas claims are advanced by Article 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Finally, suppression is not the only means of vindicating Vienna Convention rights. A defendant can raise an Article 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the voluntariness of his statements to police. If he raises an Article 36 violation at trial, a court can make appropriate accommodations to ensure that the defendant secures, to the extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance. Of course, diplomatic avenues\u2014the primary means of enforcing the Convention\u2014 also remain open.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In sum, neither the Vienna Convention itself nor our precedents applying the exclusionary rule support suppression of Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 statements to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The Virginia courts denied petitioner Bustillo\u2019s Article 36 claim on the ground that he failed to raise it at trial or on direct appeal. The general rule in federal habeas cases is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral review. See <em>Massaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003); <em>Bousley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>523 U. S. 614, 621 (1998). There is an exception if a defendant can demonstrate both \u201ccause\u201d for not raising the claim at trial, and \u201cprejudice\u201d from not having done so. <em>Massaro, supra, </em>at 504. Like many States, Virginia applies a similar rule in state postconviction proceedings, and did so here to bar Bustillo\u2019s Vienna Convention claim. Normally, in our review of state-court judgments, such rules constitute an adequate and independent state-law ground preventing us from reviewing the federal claim. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991). Bustillo contends, however, that state procedural default rules cannot apply to Article 36 claims. He argues that the Convention requires that Article 36 rights be given \u201c\u2018full effect\u2019\u201d and that Virginia\u2019s procedural default rules \u201cprevented any effect (much less \u2018full effect\u2019) from being given to\u201d those rights. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-51, p. 35 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This is not the first time we have been asked to set aside procedural default rules for a Vienna Convention claim. Respondent Johnson and the United States persuasively argue that this question is controlled by our decision in <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>523 U. S. 371 (1998) <em>(per curiam). </em>In <em>Breard, </em>the petitioner failed to raise an Article 36 claim in state court\u2014 at trial or on collateral review\u2014and then sought to have the claim heard in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding. <em>Id., </em>at 375. He argued that \u201cthe Convention is the \u2018supreme law of the land\u2019 and thus trumps the procedural default doctrine.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We rejected this argument as \u201cplainly incorrect,\u201d for two reasons. <em>Ibid. </em>First, we observed, \u201cit has been recognized in international law that, absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, we reasoned that while treaty protections such as Article 36 may constitute supreme federal law, this is \u201cno less true of provisions of the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tion itself, to which rules of procedural default apply.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 376. In light of <em>Breard\u2019s </em>holding, Bustillo faces an uphill task in arguing that the Convention requires States to set aside their procedural default rules for Article 36 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Bustillo offers two reasons why <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>does not control his case. He first argues that <em>Breard\u2019s </em>holding concerning procedural default was \u201cunnecessary to the result,\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-51, at 45, because the petitioner there could not demonstrate prejudice from the default and because, in any event, a subsequent federal statute\u2014the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,110 Stat. 1214\u2014superseded any right the petitioner had under the Vienna Convention to have his claim heard on collateral review. We find Bustillo\u2019s contention unpersuasive. Our resolution of the procedural default question in <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>was the principal reason for the denial of the petitioner\u2019s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied the bulk of our reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375-377. It is no answer to argue, as Bustillo does, that the holding in <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>was \u201cunnecessary\u201d simply because the petitioner in that case had several ways to lose. See <em>Richmond Screw Anchor Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U. S. 331, 340 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Bustillo\u2019s second reason is less easily dismissed. He argues that since <em>Brear\u00e1, </em>the ICJ has interpreted the Vienna Convention to preclude the application of procedural default rules to Article 36 claims. The <em>LaGrand Case (F. R. G. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27) <em>(LaGrand), </em>and the <em>Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>2004 I. C. J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) <em>(Avena), </em>were brought before the ICJ by the governments of Germany and Mexico, respectively, on behalf of several of their nationals facing death sentences in the United States. The foreign governments claimed that their nationals had not been informed of their right to consular notification. They further argued that application of the procedural default rule to their nationals\u2019 Vienna Convention claims failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to the purposes of the Convention, as required by Article 36. The ICJ agreed, explaining that the defendants had procedurally defaulted their claims \u201cbecause of the failure of the American authorities to comply with their obligation under Article 36.\u201d <em>LaGrand, supra, </em>at 497, \u00b6 91; see also <em>Avena, supra, </em>at 57, \u00b6 113. Application of the procedural default rule in such circumstances, the ICJ reasoned, \u201cprevented [courts] from attaching any legal significance\u201d to the fact that the violation of Article 36 kept the foreign governments from assisting in their nationals\u2019 defense. <em>LaGrand, supra, </em>at 497, \u00b6 91; see also <em>Avena, supra, </em>at 57, \u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Bustillo argues that <em>LaGrand </em>and <em>Avena </em>warrant revisiting the procedural default holding of <em>Breard. </em>In a similar vein, several <em>amici </em>contend that \u201cthe United States is <em>obligated </em>to comply with the Convention, <em>as interpreted by the ICJ.\u201d </em>Brief for ICJ Experts 11 (emphasis added). We disagree. Although the ICJ\u2019s interpretation deserves \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d <em>Breard, supra, </em>at 375, we conclude that it does not compel us to reconsider our understanding of the Convention in <em>Breard.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Under our Constitution, \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United States\u201d is \u201cvested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d Art. Ill, \u00a7 1. That \u201cjudicial Power ... extend[s] to . . . Treaties.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 2. And, as Chief Justice Marshall famously explained, that judicial power includes the duty \u201cto say what the law is.\u201d <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). If treaties are to be given effect as federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>under our legal system, determining their meaning as a matter of federal law \u201cis emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,\u201d headed by the \u201cone supreme Court\u201d established by the Constitution. <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U. S. 362, 378-379 (2000) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (\u201cAt the core of [the judicial] power is the federal courts\u2019 independent responsibility\u2014independent from its coequal branches in the Federal Government, and independent from the separate authority of the several States\u2014 to interpret federal law\u201d). It is against this background that the United States ratified, and the Senate gave its advice and consent to, the various agreements that govern referral of Vienna Convention disputes to the ICJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Nothing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on our courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ICJ\u2019s decisions have <em>\u201cno binding force </em>except between the parties and in respect of that particular case,\u201d Statute of the International Court of Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (emphasis added). Any interpretation of law the ICJ renders in the course of resolving particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>lar disputes is thus not binding precedent <em>even as to the ICJ itself; </em>there is accordingly little reason to think that such interpretations were intended to be controlling on our courts. The ICJ\u2019s principal purpose is to arbitrate particular disputes between national governments. Art. 1, <em>id., </em>at 1055 (ICJ is \u201cthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations\u201d); see also Art. 34, <em>id., </em>at 1059 (\u201cOnly states [i <em>e., </em>countries] may be parties in cases before the Court\u201d). While each member of the United Nations has agreed to comply with decisions of the ICJ \u201cin any case to which it is a party,\u201d United Nations Charter, Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 993 (1945), the Charter\u2019s procedure for noncompliance\u2014 referral to the Security Council by the aggrieved state\u2014 contemplates quintessential^ <em>international </em>remedies, Art. 94(2), <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In addition, \u201c[w]hile courts interpret treaties for themselves, the meaning given them by the departments of government particularly charged with their negotiation and enforcement is given great weight.\u201d <em>Kolovrat </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U. S. 187, 194 (1961). Although the United States has agreed to \u201cdischarge its international obligations\u201d in having state courts give effect to the decision in <em>Avena, </em>it has not taken the view that the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36 is binding on our courts. President Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Medellin </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>O. T. 2004, No. 04-5928, p. 9a. Moreover, shortly after <em>Avena, </em>the United States withdrew from the Optional Protocol concerning Vienna Convention disputes. Whatever the effect of <em>Avena </em>and <em>LaGrand </em>before this withdrawal, it is doubtful that our courts should give decisive weight to the interpretation of a tribunal whose jurisdiction in this area is no longer recognized by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\"><em>LaGrand </em>and <em>Avena </em>are therefore entitled only to the \u201crespectful consideration\u201d due an interpretation of an international agreement by an international court. <em>Breard, </em>523 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>U. S., at 375. Even according such consideration, the ICJ\u2019s interpretation cannot overcome the plain import of Article 36. As we explained in <em>Brear\u00e1, </em>the procedural rules of domestic law generally govern the implementation of an international treaty. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, Article 36 makes clear that the rights it provides \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State\u201d provided that \u201cfull effect... be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. In the United States, this means that the rule of procedural default\u2014which applies even to claimed violations of our Constitution, see <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982)\u2014applies also to Vienna Convention claims. Bustillo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36 or in the contemporary practice of other signatories that undermines this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The IC J concluded that where a defendant was not notified of his rights under Article 36, application of the procedural default rule failed to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to the purposes of Article 36 because it prevented courts from attaching \u201clegal significance\u201d to the Article 36 violation. <em>LaGrand, </em>2001 I. C. J., at 497-498, \u00b6\u00b6 90-91. This reasoning overlooks the importance of procedural default rules in an adversary system, which relies chiefly on the <em>parties </em>to raise significant issues and present them to the courts in the appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adjudication. See <em>Castro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>540 U. S. 375, 386 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cOur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief\u201d). Procedural default rules are designed to encourage parties to raise their claims promptly and to vindicate \u201cthe law\u2019s important interest in the finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Massaro, </em>538 U. S., at 504. The consequence of failing to raise a claim for adjudication at the proper time is generally forfeiture of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>claim. As a result, rules such as procedural default routinely deny \u201clegal significance\u201d\u2014in the <em>Avena </em>and <em>LaGrand </em>sense\u2014to otherwise viable legal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Procedural default rules generally take on greater importance in an adversary system such as ours than in the sort of magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system characteristic of many of the other countries that are signatories to the Vienna Convention. \u201cWhat makes a system adversarial rather than inquisitorial is . . . the presence of a judge who does not (as an inquisitor does) conduct the factual and legal investigation himself, but instead decides on the basis of facts and arguments pro and con adduced by the parties.\u201d <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>501 U. S. 171, 181, n. 2 (1991). In an inquisitorial system, the failure to raise a legal error can in part be attributed to the magistrate, and thus to the state itself. In our system, however, the responsibility for failing to raise an issue generally rests with the parties themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36 is inconsistent with the basic framework of an adversary system. Under the ICJ\u2019s reading of \u201cfull effect,\u201d Article 36 claims could trump not only procedural default rules, but any number of other rules requiring parties to present their legal claims at the appropriate time for adjudication. If the state\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of his Article 36 rights generally excuses the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with relevant procedural rules, then presumably rules such as statutes of limitations and prohibitions against filing successive habeas petitions must also yield in the face of Article 36 claims. This sweeps too broadly, for it reads the \u201cfull effect\u201d proviso in a way that leaves little room for Article 36\u2019s clear instruction that Article 36 rights \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Much as Sanchez-Llamas cannot show that suppression is an appropriate remedy for Article 36 violations under domestic law principles, so too Bustillo cannot show that normally applicable procedural default rules should be suspended in light of the type of right he claims. In this regard, a comparison of Article 36 and a suspect\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda </em>disposes of Bustillo\u2019s claim. Bustillo contends that applying procedural default rules to Article 36 rights denies such rights \u201cfull effect\u201d because the violation itself\u2014-1 <em>e., </em>the failure to inform defendants of their right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>consular notification\u2014prevents them from becoming aware of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at trial. Of course, precisely the same thing is true of rights under <em>Miranda. </em>Police are required to advise suspects that they have a right to remain silent and a right to an attorney. See <em>Miranda, </em>384 U. S., at 479; see also <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U. S., at 435. If police do not give such warnings, and counsel fails to object, it is equally true that a suspect may not be \u201caware he even <em>had </em>such rights until well after his trial had concluded.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-51, at 35. Nevertheless, it is well established that where a defendant fails to raise a <em>Miranda </em>claim at trial, procedural default rules may bar him from raising the claim in a subsequent postconviction proceeding. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Bustillo responds that an Article 36 claim more closely resembles a claim, under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 83 (1963), that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence\u2014a type of claim that often can be asserted for the first time only in postconviction proceedings. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U. S. 74, 83, n. 9 (2004). The analogy is inapt. In the case of a <em>Brady </em>claim, it is impossible for the defendant to know as a <em>factual </em>matter that a violation has occurred before the exculpatory evidence is disclosed. By contrast, a defendant is well aware of the fact that he was not informed of his Article 36 rights, even if the <em>legal </em>significance of that fact eludes him.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Finally, relying on <em>Massaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>538 U. S. 500 (2003), Bustillo argues that Article 36 claims \u201care most appropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-51, at 39. <em>Massaro </em>held that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised for the first time in a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2255. That decision, however, involved the question of the proper forum for <em>federal </em>habeas claims. Bustillo, by contrast, asks us to require the <em>States </em>to hear Vienna Convention claims raised for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>first time in <em>state </em>postconviction proceedings. Given that the Convention itself imposes no such requirement, we do not perceive any grounds for us to revise state procedural rules in this fashion. See <em>Dickerson, supra, </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We therefore conclude, as we did in <em>Brear\u00e1, </em>that claims under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention may be subjected to the same procedural default rules that apply generally to other federal-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Although these cases involve the delicate question of the application of an international treaty, the issues in many ways turn on established principles of domestic law. Our holding in no way disparages the importance of the Vienna Convention. The relief petitioners request is, by any measure, extraordinary. Sanchez-Llamas seeks a suppression remedy for an asserted right with little if any connection to the gathering of evidence; Bustillo requests an exception to procedural rules that is accorded to almost no other right, including many of our most fundamental constitutional protections. It is no slight to the Convention to deny petitioners\u2019 claims under the same principles we would apply to an Act of Congress, or to the Constitution itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oregon and the Supreme Court of Virginia are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">It <em>is so ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> In its entirety, Article 36 of the Vienna Convention states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201c1.

Many of the cited opinions merely refer to, or briefly describe, ICJ decisions without in any way relying on them as authority. See, <em>e. g., Committee of United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>859 F. 2d 929, 932, 935 (CADC 1988); <em>Conservation Law Foundation of New England </em>v. <em>Secretary of Interior, </em>790 F. 2d 965, 967 (CA1 1986); <em>Narenji </em>v. <em>Civiletti, </em>617 F. 2d 745, 748 (CADC 1979); <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>555 F. 2d 848, 849 (CADC 1976); <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S.

But both <em>LaGrand </em>and <em>Avena </em>indicate that the availability of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is <em>not </em>an adequate remedy for an Article 36 violation. See <em>LaGrand Case (F. R. G. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>2001 I. C. J. 466, 497, \u00b6 91 (Judgment of June 27) (requiring suspension of state procedural default rule even though \u201cUnited States courts could and did examine the professional competence of counsel assigned to the indigent LaGrands by reference to United States constitutional standards\u201d); see also <em>Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>2004 I. C. J. 12, 63, \u00b6 134 (Judgment of Mar. 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">To the extent the dissent suggests that the ICJ\u2019s decisions could be read to prevent application of procedural default rules where a defendant\u2019s attorney is unaware of Article 36, see <em>post, </em>at 387-388 (opinion of Breyer, J.), this interpretation of the Convention is in sharp conflict with the role of counsel in our system. \u201cAttorney ignorance or inadvertence is not \u2018cause\u2019 because the attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must \u2018bear the risk of attorney error.\u2019\u201d <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>501 U. S. 722, 753 (1991) (quoting <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)). Under our system, an attorney\u2019s lack of knowledge does not excuse the defendant\u2019s default, unless the attorney\u2019s overall representation falls below what is required by the Sixth Amendment. In any event, Bustillo himself does not argue that the applicability of procedural default rules hinges on whether a foreign national\u2019s attorney was aware of Article 36. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-51, p. 38 (\u201cA lawyer may not, consistent with the purposes of Article 36, unilaterally forfeit a foreign national\u2019s opportunity to communicate with his consulate\u201d). In fact, Bustillo has conceded that his \u201cattorney at trial was aware of his client\u2019s rights under the Vienna Convention.\u201d App. in No. 05-51, at 203, n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b388-10\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"AsV\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">I agree that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention grants rights that may be invoked by an individual in a judicial proceeding, and therefore join Part II of Justice Breyer\u2019s dissenting opinion. As to the suppression and procedural default issues, I join the Court\u2019s judgment. The dissenting opinion veers aWay from the two cases here for review, imagining other situations unlike those at hand. In neither of the cases before us would I remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>I turn first to the question whether a violation of Article 36 requires suppression of statements to police officers in Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 case and others like it. Shortly after his arrest and in advance of any police interrogation, Sanchez-Llamas received the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish. Tr. 122 (Nov. 16, 2000). He indicated that he understood those warnings, <em>id., </em>at 123, telling the police that he had lived in the United States for approximately 11 years, <em>id., </em>at 124, 143, 177. After a break in questioning, Sanchez-Llamas again received <em>Miranda </em>warnings in Spanish, and again indicated that he understood them. Tr. 129, 176. Sanchez-Llamas, with his life experience in the United States, scarcely resembles the uncomprehending detainee imagined by Justice Breyer, <em>post, </em>at 393. Such a detainee would have little need to invoke the Vienna Convention, for <em>Miranda </em>warnings a defendant is unable to comprehend give the police no green light for interrogation. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U. S. 412, 421 (1986) (a defendant\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cthe product of a free and deliberate choice . . . made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garibay, </em>143 F. 3d 534, 537-540 (CA9 1998) (defendant, who had difficulty understanding English, did not knowingly and intelligently waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights where the police recited the <em>Miranda </em>warnings only in English); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Short, </em>790 F. 2d 464, 469 (CA6 1986) (defendant\u2019s limited comprehension of English cast substantial doubt on the validity of her <em>Miranda </em>waiver).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In contrast to <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which must be given on the spot before the police interrogate, Article 36 of the Vienna Convention does not require the arresting authority to contact the consular post instantly. See <em>Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U S.), </em>2004 I. C. J. 12, \u00b6 97 (Judgment of Mar. 31) <em>(Avena) </em>(United States\u2019s notification of Mexican consulate within three working days of detainee\u2019s arrest satisfied Article 36(l)(b)\u2019s \u201cwithout delay\u201d requirement); U.

Dept. of State, Consular Notification and Access 20, http://travel.state.gov/pdf/ CNA_book.pdf (as visited June 26, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (directing federal, state, and local law enforcement officials to notify the appropriate consular post \u201cwithin 24 hours, and certainly within 72 hours\u201d of a foreign national\u2019s request that such notification be made). Nor does that article demand that questioning await notice to, and a response from, consular officials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is unsurprising, therefore, that the well researched dissenting opinion has not found even a single case in which any court, any place has <em>in fact </em>found suppression an appropriate remedy based on no provision of domestic law, but solely on an arresting officer\u2019s failure to comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. See <em>post, </em>at 395-396; <em>ante, </em>at 344-345, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The Court points out, and I agree, that in fitting circumstances, a defendant might successfully \u201craise an Article 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the voluntariness of [a detainee\u2019s] statements to police.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 350. In that way, \u201cfull effect\u201d could be given to Article 36 in a manner consistent with U. S. rules and regulations. But the question presented here is whether suppression is warranted simply because the State\u2019s authorities failed to comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. Neither the Convention itself nor the practice of our treaty partners establishes Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 entitlement to such a remedy. See <em>El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Tsui Yuan Tseng, </em>525 U. S. 155, 175-176 (1999) (construing the Warsaw Convention in accord with the views of the United States\u2019s treaty partners).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As to the procedural default issue, I note first two anomalies. The Court explains, and I agree, that it would be extraordinary to hold that defendants, unaware of their <em>Miranda </em>rights because the police failed to convey the required warnings, would be subject to a State\u2019s procedural default rules, but defendants not told of Article 36 rights would face no such hindrance. See <em>ante, </em>at 359. Furthermore, as the dissent apparently recognizes, in the federal-court system, a later-in-time statute, codifying a federal procedural default rule, would \u201csupersed[e] any inconsistent provision in the Convention.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 388 (citing <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>523 U. S. 371 (1998) <em>(per curiam)). </em>In my view, it would be unseemly, to say the least, for this Court to command state courts to relax their identical, or even less stringent procedural default rules, while federal courts operate without constraint in this regard. <em>Post, </em>at 388-389. That state of affairs, surely productive of friction in our federal system, should be resisted if there is a plausible choice, <em>i. e., </em>if a reasonable interpretation of the federal statute and international accord would avoid the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Critical for me, Bustillo has conceded that his \u201cattorney at trial was aware of his client\u2019s rights under the Vienna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Convention.\u201d App. in No. 05-51, p. 203, n. 5. Given the knowledge of the Vienna Convention that Bustillo\u2019s lawyer possessed, this case fails to meet the dissent\u2019s (and the International Court of Justice\u2019s) first condition for overriding a State\u2019s ordinary procedural default rules: \u201c[T]he [Vienna] Convention forbids American States to apply a procedural default rule to bar assertion of a Convention violation claim \u2018where it has been the failure of the United States [or of a State] itself to inform that may have precluded counsel from being in a position to have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 381 (quoting <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 57, \u00b6 113; emphasis deleted); accord <em>post, </em>at 370, 379, 382, 386. Nothing the State did or omitted to do here \u201cprecluded counsel from . .. raising] the question of a violation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 386. Had counsel done so, the trial court could have made \u201cappropriate accommodations to ensure that the defendant secure[d], to the extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 350.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In short, if there are some times when a Convention violation, standing alone, might warrant suppression, or the displacement of a State\u2019s ordinarily applicable procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>default rules, neither Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 case nor Bustillo\u2019s belongs in that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">For the reasons stated, I would not disturb the judgments of the Supreme Court of Oregon and the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Souter join, and with whom Justice Ginsburg joins as to Part II, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention) provides that when the police of a signatory nation arrest a foreign national, the detaining \u201cauthorities shall inform\u201d the foreign national \u201cwithout delay\u201d of his \u201crigh[t]\u201d to communicate with his nation\u2019s consular officers.

We granted certiorari in these cases to consider three related questions: (1) May a criminal defendant raise a claim (at trial or in a postconviction proceeding) that state officials violated this provision? (2) May a State apply its usual procedural default rules to Convention claims, thereby denying the defendant the right to raise the claim in a postconviction proceeding on the ground that the defendant failed to raise the claim at trial? And (3) is suppression of a defendant\u2019s confession (made to police after a violation of the Convention) an appropriate remedy?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The Court assumes, but does not decide, that the answer to the first question is \u201cyes.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 343. It answers the second question by holding that a State always may apply its ordinary procedural default rules to a defendant\u2019s claim of a Convention violation. <em>Ante, </em>at 350-360. Its answer to the third question is that suppression is never an appropriate remedy for a Convention violation. <em>Ante, </em>at 343-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Unlike the majority, I would decide the first question and answer it affirmatively. A criminal defendant may, at trial or in a postconviction proceeding, raise the claim that state authorities violated the Convention in his case. My answer to the second question is that <em>sometimes </em>state procedural default rules must yield to the Convention\u2019s insistence that domestic laws \u201cenable full effect to be given to the purposes for which\u201d Article 36\u2019s \u201crights ... are intended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. And my answer to the third question is that suppression may <em>sometimes </em>provide an appropriate remedy. After answering these questions, I would remand these cases, thereby permitting the States to apply their own procedural and remedial laws, but with the understanding that the Federal Constitution requires that the application of those laws be consistent with the Convention\u2019s demand for an effective remedy for an Article 36 violation. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2 (\u201c[A]ll Treaties made . . . under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The Vienna Convention is an international treaty that governs relations between individual nations and foreign consular officials. The United States and 169 other nations have ratified the Convention. Its adoption in 1963 was perhaps \u201cthe single most important event in the entire history of the consular institution.\u201d L. Lee, Consular Law and Practice 26 (2d ed. 1991). The Convention defines consular functions to include \u201cprotecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals,\u201d and \u201chelping and assisting nationals ... of the sending State.\u201d Arts. 5(a), (e), 21 U.

The United States ratified the Convention in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Article 36 of the Convention governs relations between a consulate and its nationals, particularly those who have been arrested by the host country. Its object is to assure consular communication and assistance to such nationals, who may not fully understand the host country\u2019s legal regime or even speak its language. Article 36 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201c1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions relating to nationals of the sending State:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201c(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the sending State and to have access to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the same freedom with respect to communication with and access to consular officers of the sending State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be forwarded by the said authorities without delay. <em>The said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201c2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended.\u201d 21 U. S. T., at 100-101 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The U. S. State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual has long stressed the importance the United States places upon these provisions. It says, \u201c[0]ne of the basic functions of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>consular officer has been to provide a \u2018cultural bridge\u2019 between the host community and the [U. S. national]. No one needs that cultural bridge more than the individual U. S. citizen who has been arrested in a foreign country or imprisoned in a foreign jail.\u201d 7 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a7 401 (1984); see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7401-426 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In 1969, the United States also ratified (but the President has since withdrawn from) an Optional Protocol to the Convention. See Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes (Optional Protocol), Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S.

C. J., at 493, \u00b6 76, It held instead that (1) if an arrested foreign national is prejudiced by the host country\u2019s failure to inform him of his Article 36 rights, and (2) if that individual has \u201cbeen subjected to prolonged detention or convicted and sentenced to severe penalties,\u201d then a diplomatic apology alone is not a sufficient remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 513-514, \u00b6 125. Rather, the Convention requires the host country, in that case the United States, \u201cto allow the review and reconsideration of the\u201d foreign national\u2019s \u201cconviction and sentence by taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 514, \u00b6 125. The ICJ added that \u201c[t]he choice of means\u201d for providing this review \u201cmust be left to the United States.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the ICJ stated that in the case before it, application of a procedural default rule (that is, the rule that the LaGrands could not bring their Convention claims in habeas proceedings because they had not raised those claims at trial) violated Article 36(2) of the Convention because it \u201chad the effect of preventing \u2018full effect [from being] given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this article are intended.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 498, \u00b6 91 (quoting Art. 36(2), 21 U.

In the ICJ\u2019s view, it was \u201cthe failure of the American authorities to comply\u201d with Article 36 that prevented the LaGrands from raising their claims earlier. <em>LaGrand, supra, </em>at 497, \u00b6 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In Mexico\u2019s case, the ICJ reiterated its view that Article 36, in addition to imposing obligations on member nations, also allows foreign nationals to bring claims based on those violations in domestic judicial proceedings. The ICJ noted that, as a matter of international law, breach of a treaty ordinarily \u201c \u2018involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.\u2019 \u201d <em>Avena, supra, </em>at 59, \u00b6 119 (quoting <em>Factory at Chorz\u00f3w, Jurisdiction, </em>1927, R C. I. J., ser. A, No. 9, p. 21). Applying that principle to the Convention, the ICJ concluded that \u201cthe remedy to make good . .. violations [of Article 36] should consist in an obligation on the United States to permit review and reconsideration of these nationals\u2019 cases by the United States courts ... with a view to ascertaining whether in each ease the violation .. . <em>caused actual prejudice </em>to the defendant in the process of administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 60, \u00b6 121 (emphasis added). The court added that this \u201c \u2018review and reconsideration,\u2019 \u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>be \u201ceffective,\u201d must \u201cfully examinfe] and tak[e] into account\u201d any such prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id., </em>at 65, \u00b6 138. The ICJ declined to specify the means by which American courts should provide such \u201creview and reconsideration.\u201d Instead, the ICJ said, the appropriate remedy depends upon an examination of \u201cthe concrete circumstances of each case\u201d and should be determined \u201cby the United States courts concerned in the process of their review and reconsideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 61, \u00b6 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In respect to procedural default, the ICJ referenced what it said in <em>LaGrand, </em>while adding the critically important qualification that the cases in which the Convention blocked application of a procedural default rule were those in which it was \u201cthe failure of the United States itself to inform\u201d an arrested foreign national of his right to contact the consulate that \u201cprecluded counsel from being in a position to have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d <em>Avena, supra, </em>at 57, \u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">For present purposes, the key sections of the Convention are (1) the provision that requires the United States to \u201cinform\u201d an arrested person \u201cwithout delay\u201d of his Article 36 rights, including the right to \u201ccommunicat[e]\u201d with his \u201cconsular post,\u201d and (2) the provision that says domestic laws and regulations \u201cmust enable full effect to be given\u201d to the purposes underlying those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The key ICJ holdings are its determinations (1) that the Convention obligates a member nation to inform an arrested foreign national without delay that he may contact his consulate; (2) that the Convention requires the United States to provide some process for its courts to \u201creview and recon-side[r]\u201d criminal convictions where there has been a prejudicial violation of this obligation; and (3) that this \u201creview and reconsideration\u201d cannot be foreclosed on the ground that the foreign national did not raise the violation at trial <em>where the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>authorities\u2019 failure to inform the foreign national of his rights prevented him from timely raising his claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The first question presented is whether a criminal defendant may raise a claim (at trial or in a postconviction proceeding) that state officials violated Article 36 of the Convention. The Court assumes that the answer to this question is \u201cyes,\u201d but it does not decide the matter because it concludes in any event that the petitioners are not entitled to the remedies they seek. As explained below, I would resolve those remedial questions differently. Hence, I must decide, rather than assume, the answer to the first question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Regardless, the first question raises an important issue of federal law that has arisen hundreds of times in the lower federal and state courts. See generally Wooster, Construction and Application of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), Requiring That Foreign Consulate Be Notified When One of Its Nationals Is Arrested, 175 A. L. R. Fed. 243 (2002) (collecting federal cases). Those courts have divided as to the proper answer. Compare <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>405 F. 3d 244 (CA5 2005) (defendant cannot bring Convention claim in judicial proceeding); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Emueghunam, </em>268 F. 3d 377 (CA6 2001) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>2001-NMSC-029, 33 P. 3d 267 (same); 338 Ore. 267, 108 P. 3d 573 (2005) (same); <em>Shackleford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 547 S. E. 2d 899 (2001) (same), with <em>Jogi </em>v. <em>Voges, </em>425 F. 3d 367 (CA7 2005) (defendant can bring Convention claim in judicial proceeding). And the issue often arises in a legal context where statutes or procedural requirements arguably block this Court\u2019s speedy review. See <em>Medell\u00edn </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>544 U. S. 660 (2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>We granted the petitions for certiorari in significant part in order to decide this question. And, given its importance, we should do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In answering the question, it is common ground that the Convention is \u201cself-executi[ng].\u201d See S. Exec. Rep. No. 91-9, p. 5 (1969); see also Brief for Respondent in No. 04-10566, pp. 9-10; Brief for Respondent in No. 05-51, p. 23. That is to say, the Convention \u201coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829). The parties also agree that we need not decide whether the Convention creates a \u201cprivate right of action,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>a private right that would allow an individual to bring a lawsuit for enforcement of the Convention or for damages based on its violation. Rather, the question here is whether the Convention provides, in these cases, law applicable in legal proceedings that might have been brought irrespective of the Vienna Convention claim, here an ordinary criminal appeal and an ordinary postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Bustillo, for example, has brought an action under a Virginia statute that allows any convicted person to seek release from custody on the ground that \u201che is detained without lawful authority.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-654(A)(1) (Lexis Supp. 2006). Sanchez-Llamas has challenged his state criminal conviction on direct appeal, and in that proceeding he is entitled to claim that his conviction violates state or federal law. In both cases, the petitioners argue that a court decision favoring the prosecution would violate the Convention (as properly interpreted), and therefore the Constitution forbids any such decision. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. This argument in effect claims that the Convention itself provides applicable law that here would favor the petitioners if, but only if, they are correct as to their interpretation of the Convention (which is, of course, a different matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The petitioners must be right in respect to their claim that the Convention provides law that here courts could apply in their respective proceedings. The Convention is a treaty. And \u201call Treaties made ... under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Chief Justice Marshall long ago explained, under the Supremacy Clause a treaty is \u201cto be regarded in Courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\u201d <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Directly to the point, this Court stated long ago that a treaty \u201cis a law of the land as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or subject may be determined. And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice,\u201d in such a case the court is to \u201cresor[t] to the treaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it would to a statute.\u201d <em>Head Money Cases, </em>112 U. S. 580, 598-599 (1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As noted above, see <em>supra, </em>at 372, the parties agree that the Convention \u201coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\u201d <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314. The question, then, is the one this Court set forth in the <em>Head Money Cases: </em>Does the Convention set forth a \u201claw\u201d with the legal stature of an Act of Congress? And as the Court explained, we are to answer that question by asking, does the Convention \u201cprescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen . . . may be determined\u201d? Are the obligations set forth in Article 36(l)(b) \u201cof a nature to be enforced in a court of justice\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The \u201cnature\u201d of the Convention provisions raised by the petitioners indicates that they are intended to set forth standards that are judicially enforceable. Those provisions consist of the rights of a foreign national \u201carrested\u201d or \u201cdetained in any other manner\u201d (1) to have, on his \u201cre-ques[t],\u201d the \u201cconsular post\u201d \u201cinform[ed]\u201d of that arrest or detention; (2) to have forwarded \u201cwithout delay\u201d any \u201ccommunication addressed to the consular post\u201d; and (3) to be \u201cinform[ed] . . . without delay\u201d of those two \u201crights.\u201d Art. 36(l)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. These rights do not differ in their \u201cnature\u201d from other procedural rights that courts commonly enforce. Cf. U. S. Const., Arndt. 6 (\u201cIn all criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u201d); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence\u201d); <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Moreover, the language of Article 36 speaks directly of the \u201crights\u201d of the individual foreign national. See Art. 36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (\u201cThe said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of <em>his rights </em>under this sub-paragraph\u201d (emphasis added)). Article 36 thus stands in stark contrast to other provisions of the Convention, which speak in terms of the rights of the member nations or consular officials. Cf. Art. 9, <em>id., </em>at 86 (discussing \u201cthe <em>right of </em>any of the <em>Contracting Parties </em>to fix the designation of consular officers\u201d (emphasis added)); Art. 34, <em>id., </em>at 98 (consular officials shall have \u201cfreedom of movement and travel\u201d); Art. 35(1), <em>id., </em>at 99 (consular officials shall have \u201cfreedom of communication\u201d); Art. 41(1), <em>id., </em>at 103 (\u201cConsular officers shall not be liable to arrest or detention pending trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Suppose that a <em>pre-Miranda </em>federal statute had said that arresting authorities \u201cshall inform a detained person without delay of his right to counsel.\u201d Would courts not have automatically assumed that this statute created applicable law that a criminal defendant could invoke at trial? What more would the statute have to say? See <em>Medell\u00edn, </em>544 U. S., at 687 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cAnd if a statute were to provide, for example, that arresting authorities \u2018shall inform a detained person without delay of his right to counsel,\u2019\u201d what \u201cmore would be required\u201d to permit \u201ca defendant\u201d to \u201cinvoke that statute\u201d?).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Further, this Court has routinely permitted individuals to enforce treaty provisions similar to Article 36 in domestic judicial proceedings. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rauscher, </em>119 U. S. 407, 410-411 (1886), for example, this Court concluded that the defendant could raise as a defense in his federal criminal trial the violation of an extradition treaty that said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is agreed that the United States and Her Britannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them . . . deliver up to justice all persons\u2019\u201d charged with certain crimes in the other country. Similarly, in <em>Kolovrat </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U. S. 187, 191, n. 6 (1961), the Court held that foreign nationals could challenge a state law limiting their right to recover an inheritance based on a treaty providing that \u201c\u2018[i]n all that concerns the right of acquiring, possessing or disposing of every kind of property . . . citizens of [each country who reside in the other] shall enjoy the rights which the respective laws grant... in each of these states to the subjects of the most favored nation.\u2019\u201d And in <em>Asakura </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>265 U. S. 332, 340 (1924), the Court allowed a foreign national to challenge a city ordinance forbidding noncitizens from working as pawnbrokers under a treaty stating that \u201c \u2018citizens or subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties shall have liberty ... to carry on trade\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native citizens or subjects.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In all these cases, the Court recognized that (1) a treaty obligated the United States to treat foreign nationals in a certain manner; (2) the obligation had been breached by the Government\u2019s conduct; and (3) the foreign national could therefore seek redress for that breach in a judicial proceeding, even though the treaty did not specifically mention judicial enforcement of its guarantees or even expressly state that its provisions were intended to confer rights on the foreign national. Language and context argue yet more strongly here in favor of permitting a criminal defendant in an appropriate case to find in the Convention a law to apply in the proceeding against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In addition, the Government concedes that individual consular officials may enforce <em>other </em>provisions of the Convention in American courts. For example, Article 43(1) grants consular officials immunity from \u201cthe jurisdiction of the\u201d host country\u2019s \u201cjudicial or administrative authorities\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cacts performed in the exercise of consular functions.\u201d 21 U. S. T., at 104. The federal courts have held that a consular official may raise Article 48(1) in a judicial proceeding, even though that provision does not expressly mention a judicial remedy. See, <em>e. g., Risk </em>v. <em>Halvorsen, </em>936 F. 2d 393, 397 (CA9 1991); <em>Gerritsen </em>v. <em>de la Madrid Hurtado, </em>819 F. 2d 1511, 1515-1516 (CA9 1987); see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>14, n. 2 (citing with approval these cases). What in Article 36 warrants treating it differently in this respect?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Finally, the international tribunal that the United States agreed would resolve disputes about the interpretation of the Convention, the ICJ, has twice ruled that an arrested foreign national may raise a violation of the arresting authorities\u2019 obligation to \u201cinform [him] without delay of his rights under\u201d Article 36(1) in an American judicial proceeding. See <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J. 12; <em>LaGrand, </em>2001 1. C. J. 466. That conclusion, as an \u201cinterpretation of an international agreement by an international court\u201d deserves our \u201c'respectful consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 355 (opinion of the Court). That \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d for reasons I shall explain, see <em>infra, </em>at 382-385, counsels in favor of an interpretation that is consistent with the ICJ\u2019s reading of the Convention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Government says to the contrary that Article 36 is \u201caddressed solely to the rights of States and not private individuals\u201d; hence, a foreign national may not claim in an American court that a State has convicted him without the consular notification that Article 36 requires. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>7. But its arguments are not persuasive. The Government rests this conclusion primarily upon its claim that there is a \u201clong-established presumption that treaties and other international agreements do not create judicially enforceable individual rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The problem with that argument is that no such presumption exists. The Government cites three cases in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>its position, <em>Charlton </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>229 U. S. 447, 474 (1913); <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>124 U. S. 190, 195 (1888); and <em>Foster, </em>2 Pet., at 306-307. The first of these, <em>Charlton, </em>says that the question whether a treaty has been abrogated by another nation\u2019s violations is a matter with which \u201c\u2018judicial tribunals have nothing to do.\u2019\u201d 229 U. S., at 474. The second, <em>Whitney, </em>says that whether a subsequent federal statute that abrogates a treaty violates the United States\u2019 treaty obligations is a matter that has \u201cnot been confided to the judiciary.\u201d 124 U. S., at 195. The third, <em>Foster, </em>says that in \u201ca controversy between two nations concerning national boundary, it is scarcely possible that the Courts of either should refuse to abide by the measures adopted by its own government.\u201d 2 Pet., at 306-307. What have these issues to do with the present one? How do these cases support the presumption that the Government claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Regardless, as I have just said, see <em>supra, </em>at 373, the <em>Head Money Cases </em>make clear that a treaty may confer certain enforceable \u201crights upon the citizens or subjects of one of the nations residing in the territorial limits of the other.\u201d 112 U. S., at 598; see also 2 Restatement (Third) on Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 907 (1986) (hereinafter Restatement) (\u201cA private person having rights against the United States under an international agreement may assert those rights in courts in the United States\u201d). And the language of the Convention makes clear that it is such a treaty. Indeed, to my knowledge no other nation\u2019s courts (or perhaps no more than one) have held to the contrary. The cases cited by the respondents and the Government do not say otherwise. See Judgment of Nov. 7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116 (Germany) (deciding in light of <em>LaGrand </em>that the Convention creates individual rights, but declining to suppress confession); <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Abbrederis </em>(1981) 51 F. L. R. 99, 115 (Ct. Crim. App. New South Wales (Australia)) (deciding that Convention does not \u201caffect the carrying out of an investigation by interrogation of a foreign person coming to this country\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>But see <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Van Bergen, </em>[2000] 261 A. R. 387, 390 (Ct. App. Alberta (Canada)) (noting <em>in dictum </em>that the Convention \u201ccreates an obligation between states and is not one owed to the national,\u201d but affirming denial of suppression motion on the ground that \u201cthere was in any event no proven prejudice to\u201d the defendant). See also <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Partak, </em>[2001] 160 C. C. C. 3d 553 (Ont. Super. Ct. of J.) (applying <em>Van Bergen\u2019s </em>\u201cserious prejudice\u201d test to conclude that the defendant\u2019s statements were admissible); compare cases cited <em>infra, </em>at 394-395.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The Government also points out that the Executive Branch\u2019s interpretation of treaty provisions is entitled to \u201cgreat weight.\u201d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, </em>457 U. S. 176, 184, 185 (1982). I agree with this presumption. But the Executive\u2019s views on our treaty obligations are \u201cnot conclusive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 184; see <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Elg, </em>307 U. S. 325, 328, 337-342 (1939) (declining to adopt Executive\u2019s treaty interpretation); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>205 U. S. 309, 319-321 (1907) (same); <em>De Lima </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>182 U. S. 1, 181, 194-199 (1901) (same). Where language, the nature of the right, and the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of the treaty taken separately or together so strongly point to an intent to confer enforceable rights upon an individual, I cannot find in the simple fact of the Executive Branch\u2019s contrary view sufficient reason to adopt the Government\u2019s interpretation of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Accordingly, I would allow the petitioners to raise their claims based on violations of the Convention in their respective state-court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The more difficult issue, I believe, concerns the nature of the Convention\u2019s requirements as to remedy. In particular, Bustillo\u2019s case concerns a state procedural default rule. When, if ever, does the Convention require a state court to set aside such a rule in order to hear a criminal defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>claim that the police did not \u201cinform\u201d him of his \u201cright\u201d to communicate with his \u201cconsular post\u201d? Art. 36(l)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. The Court says that the answer is \u201cnever.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 350-360. In its view, the Convention does not under any circumstances trump a State\u2019s ordinary procedural rules requiring a defendant to assert his claims at trial or lose them forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In my view, Article 36 of the Convention requires a less absolute answer. Article 36 says that the rights it sets forth \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State,\u201d but it instantly adds, \u201csubject to the proviso . . . that the said laws and regulations must enable <em>full effect </em>to be given to the purposes for which the [Article 36] rights are ... intended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). The proviso means that a State\u2019s ordinary procedural default rules apply <em>unless </em>(1) the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a Convention matter <em>(e. g., </em>that police failed to inform him of his Article 36 rights) can itself be traced to the failure of the police (or other governmental authorities) to inform the defendant of those Convention rights, <em>and </em>(2) state law does not provide any other effective way for the defendant to raise that issue (say, through a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, as I have just noted, Article 36 says both that its rights \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with\u201d the host country\u2019s \u201claws and regulations\u201d and that those \u201claws and regulations must enable full effect to be given\u201d to the purposes for which those rights \u201care intended.\u201d This interpretation makes <em>both </em>the \u201cconformity\u201d requirement and the \u201cfull effect\u201d requirement meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Second, the Convention\u2019s drafting history supports this interpretation. The first draft of the Vienna Convention was written by the International Law Commission. Article 36(2) of that draft required only that domestic laws \u201cnot nullify\u201d the rights afforded by the Convention. Draft Articles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>on Consular Relations Adopted by the International Law Commission at its Thirteenth Session, Art. 36(2), reprinted in L. Lee, Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 237 (1966). A later amendment substituted the \u201cfull effect\u201d phrase over the strenuous objection of several negotiating countries whose delegates argued that the phrase would \u201cmodify the criminal laws and regulations or the criminal procedure of the receiving State.\u201d 1 United Nations Conference on Consular Relations, Official Records, Summary records of plenary meetings and of the meetings of the First and Second Committees, U. N. Doc. A/CONF.25/16, \u00b626, p. 38 (1963) (statement of Romania).

But rights could be seriously impaired without becoming completely inoperative. . . .

In <em>LaGrand </em>and <em>Avena, </em>the ICJ read the Convention as authorizing an individual foreign national to raise an Article 36 violation at trial or in a postconviction proceeding. See <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 59-60, \u00b6 121; <em>LaGrand, </em>2001 I. C. J., at 513-514, \u00b6 125. The ICJ added that the Convention requires member states to provide \u201ceffective\u201d remedies in their courts for Convention violations. See <em>Avena, supra, </em>at 65, \u00b6 138. And the ICJ made two critical statements in respect to procedural default rules. In <em>La-Grand, </em>the court said that in \u201citself, the [procedural default] rule does <em>not </em>violate Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.\u201d 20011. C. J., at 497, \u00b6 90 (emphasis added). Rather, the \u201cproblem arises when the procedural default rule does not allow the detained individual to challenge a conviction and sentence by claiming ... that the competent national authorities failed to comply with their obligation to provide the requisite consular information \u2018without delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And the ICJ later specified that the Convention forbids American States to apply a procedural default rule to bar assertion of a Convention violation claim <em>\u201cwhere it has been the failure of the United States [or of a State] itself to inform that may have precluded counsel from being in a position to have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d Avena, </em>20041. C. J., at 57, \u00b6 113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>This last statement indicates that the ICJ understood the Convention to prevent application of a procedural default rule only where the arresting authorities\u2019 failure to inform the foreign national of his Convention rights brought about the procedural default in the first place. Taken together, the above statements make clear that the ICJ read the Convention simply to require an effective remedy. It stated repeatedly that it did not dictate what that remedy would be, as long as it was offered as part of the \u201cjudicial process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 65-66, \u00b6\u00b6 140-141. Hence, if the State provides <em>some other effective remedy, </em>for example, review for prejudice through a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, then the Convention would not forbid application of ordinary procedural default rules. See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.6 (rev. ed. Feb. 2003) (discussing defense counsel\u2019s obligation to seek consular assistance); <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 P. 3d 703, 710 (Okla. Crim. App. 2002) (granting postconviction relief to a defendant who had failed to raise a Vienna Convention violation at trial, because he showed that his lawyer \u201ccould have obtained financial, legal and investigative assistance from his consulate\u201d that would have produced important new evidence); see also <em>Ledezma </em>v. <em>State, </em>626 N. W. 2d 134, 152 (Iowa 2001) (concluding that \u201call criminal defense attorneys representing foreign nationals should be aware of the right to consular access as provided by Article 36, and should advise their clients of this right\u201d because local counsel \u201care not equipped to provide the same services as the local consulate\u201d); cf. <em>Rompilla </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>545 U. S. 374 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">I will assume that the ICJ\u2019s interpretation does not bind this Court in this case. Statute of the International Court of Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (ICJ decisions have \u201cbinding force\u201d only \u201cbetween the parties and in respect of that particular case\u201d). But as the majority points out, the ICJ\u2019s decisions on this issue nonetheless warrant our \u201c'respectful consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 355. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201crespectful consideration\u201d reflects the understanding that uniformity is an important goal of treaty interpretation. See <em>Olympic Airways </em>v. <em>Husain, </em>540 U. S. 644, 660 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]t is reasonable to impute to the parties an intent that their respective courts strive to interpret the treaty consistently\u201d). And the ICJ\u2019s position as an international court specifically charged with the duty to interpret numerous international treaties (including the Convention) provides a natural point of reference for national courts seeking that uniformity. See Counter-Memorial of the United States in <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J. No. 128, p. 61, n. 128 (Nov. 3, 2003) (even if ICJ decision binds only in particular case, \u201cit is well-settled\u201d that an ICJ decision \u201cmay serve as authority beyond a particular case\u201d; citing authorities); Ordonez &amp; Reilly, Effect of the Jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice on National Courts, in International Law Decisions in National Courts 335, 365 (T. Franck &amp; G. Fox eds. 1996) (noting that ICJ cases interpreting treaties \u201care routinely cited by domestic judges\u201d in many countries \u201cas evidence of international law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">That \u201crespectful consideration\u201d also reflects an understanding of the ICJ\u2019s expertise in matters of treaty interpretation, a branch of international law. The ICJ\u2019s opinions \u201care persuasive evidence\u201d of what \u201c[international] law is.\u201d 1 Restatement \u00a7 103, at 37, Comment <em>b; </em>see also Morrison, Treaties as a Source of Jurisdiction, Especially in U.

See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>475 U. S. 89, 99-100 (1986) (referring to the <em>Fisheries Case (United Kingdom </em>v. <em>Norway), </em>1951 I. C.

In creating this last mentioned conflict, as far as I can tell, the Court\u2019s decision is unprecedented.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The Court supports its interpretation in three basic ways. First, the majority says that \u201crespectful consideration\u201d does not require us to agree with a decision that is clearly wrong. And, it says, the ICJ\u2019s decision is clearly wrong. The ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36, the majority says, would permit a Convention violation claim to \u201ctrump not only procedural default rules, but any number of other rules requiring parties to present their legal claims at the appropriate time for adjudication.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 357. That interpretation, it adds, \u201coverlooks the importance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,\u201d and is \u201cinconsistent with the basic framework\u201d of that \u201csystem.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 356-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The majority\u2019s argument, however, overlooks what the ICJ actually said, overstates what it actually meant, and is inconsistent with what it actually did. In <em>Avena </em>and <em>LaGrand, </em>the ICJ did not say that the Convention necessarily trumps any, let alone all, procedural rules that would otherwise bar assertion of a Convention violation claim. Nor did it say that the Convention necessarily trumps all procedural default rules. Rather, it said that the Convention prohibits application of those rules to a Convention violation claim only \u201cwhere it has been the <em>failure </em>of the United States [or of a State] itself <em>to inform </em>that may have precluded counsel from being in a position to have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 57, \u00b6 113 (emphasis added). Thus, Article 36(2) precludes procedural default only <em>where the defendant\u2019s failure to bring his claim sooner is the result of the underlying violation. </em>Since procedural default rules themselves typically excuse defaults where a defendant shows \u201ccause and prejudice,\u201d it is difficult to see how this statement \u201coverlooks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the importance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,\u201d or is \u201cinconsistent with the basic framework\u201d of that \u201csystem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Moreover, <em>Avena </em>and <em>LaGrand </em>make clear what the ICJ\u2019s language taken in context means: The Convention requires effective national remedies; hence local procedural rules must give way (to the Convention\u2019s \u201cfull effect\u201d requirement) when, but only when, it is the failure of the arresting authorities to inform the defendant of his Convention rights that prevented the defendant from bringing his claim sooner. The opinions nowhere suggest that a State must provide a procedural remedy to a defendant who, for example, sleeps on his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Consider, too, what the IC J did in <em>Avena, </em>a case that clarified the court\u2019s earlier <em>LaGrand </em>opinion. It did not hold that American courts must ignore their procedural default rules in each of the 54 individual cases at issue. Rather, it held that domestic courts must provide \u201creview and reconsideration\u201d in each case. <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 72, \u00b6 153(9). It nowhere forbids a state court conducting such a \u201creview\u201d to bar claims not timely made provided that the violation did not itself cause the delay. See <em>id., </em>at 65, \u00b6 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Perhaps the ICJ\u2019s opinions are open to different interpretations. But how does reading those opinions as creating an extreme rule of law, as reflecting a lack of understanding of the \u201cadversary system,\u201d show \u201crespectful consideration\u201d? To show that kind of respect, we must read the opinions in light of the Convention\u2019s underlying language and purposes and ask whether, or to what extent, they require modification of a State\u2019s ordinary procedural rules. See Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (laws and regulations \u201cmust enable full effect to be given <em>to the purposes </em>for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Nothing in <em>Avena </em>suggests, for example, that an arrested foreign national who was already aware of his rights under Article 36, or who had a lawyer who was aware of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>rights, necessarily would be entitled to an exemption from the State\u2019s procedural default rules under Article 36(2). Instead, as I have explained, see <em>supra, </em>at 381-382, 387, <em>Avena </em>says only that Article 36(2) requires a state court to excuse a procedural default rule where the State failed to inform the defendant of his consular access rights, <em>and </em>the defendant was not aware of those rights, <em>and </em>the State is unwilling to provide some other effective remedy, for example (if the lawyer acts incompetently in respect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was aware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The Court\u2019s reluctance to give <em>LaGrand </em>and <em>Avena </em>this perfectly reasonable interpretation reflects a failure to provide in practice the \u201crespectful consideration\u201d that we all believe the law demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The Court also relies on <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>523 U. S. 371 (1998) <em>(per curiam). </em>In that case, a foreign national, claiming a Convention violation, sought federal habeas corpus. This Court upheld a denial of relief on the ground that the lower courts had correctly found that Breard procedurally defaulted his Convention violation claim by failing to timely raise it in his state-court proceedings. In reaching its conclusion, the Court rejected Breard\u2019s claim that the Convention trumped the procedural default rule. Its reasons were (1) that \u201cit has been recognized in international law that, absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 375; (2) that this principle is \u201cembodied in the Vienna Convention itself, which provides that the rights expressed in the Convention \u2018shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State,\u2019\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>and (3) that the federal procedural default rule, as a later-in-time federal statute, superseded any inconsistent provision in the Convention, <em>id., </em>at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">I do not believe that <em>Breard </em>controls the outcome of these cases. With respect to the third ground for the Court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>sion, <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>concerned <em>a federal, </em>rather than (as in Bustillo\u2019s case) a <em>state, </em>procedural default rule. Those different kinds of rules are treated differently under the Supremacy Clause. See <em>ibid, </em>(applying the rule that \u201c \u2018an Act of Congress ... is on a full parity with a treaty, and .. . when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null\u2019 \u201d). Contrary to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s view, then, <em>ante, </em>at 363 (opinion concurring in judgment), there is no anomaly in treating state law differently from federal law for these purposes, if Congress chooses to enact legislation binding only the Federal Government in respect to a matter covered by a treaty that binds both the Federal Government and the States. Therefore, reading the Convention to require the state courts to set aside Virginia\u2019s procedural default rule in Bustillo\u2019s case (assuming for argument\u2019s sake that his case meets the criteria I have described, see <em>supra, </em>at 379) would not call into question, let alone overrule, \u201cBrear\u00e1\u2019s plain holding that the Convention does not trump the <em>[federal] </em>procedural default doctrine,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 353, n. 4 (opinion of the Court), even if that ruling on its own terms is still good law after <em>Avena </em>and <em>LaGrand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Moreover, the ICJ decided <em>Avena </em>and <em>LaGrand </em>after this Court decided <em>Brear\u00e1. </em>And it is not difficult to reconcile those cases with <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>because they do not directly conflict with Brear\u00e1\u2019s result. Rather, they interpret Article 36(2) to require state procedural default rules <em>sometimes </em>to give way to the Convention, namely, when those rules prevent effective remedy by barring assertion of a claim because of a delay caused by the Convention violation itself. I would read <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>as consistent with this interpretation, <em>i. e., </em>as not saying that the Convention <em>never </em>trumps any procedural default rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The Court complains that this treatment of <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>fails to give our own opinions \u201c\u2018respectful consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 353, n. 4. In fact, our opinions are entitled to far more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>than respectful consideration; they are entitled to full <em>stare decisis </em>effect. But, as I have explained, reading <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>not to decide the outcome in this case would neither overrule Brear\u00e1\u2019s holding, nor reject outright its reading of the Convention. And, in any event, as a matter of the law of <em>stare decisis, </em>a modified reading of <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>is appropriate in light of the fact that the ICJ\u2019s later decisions amount to a \u201csignificant... subsequent development\u201d of the law sufficient to lead to a reconsideration of past precedent. <em>Agostini </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Percheman, </em>7 Pet. 51 (1833) (revisiting prior treaty interpretation when new international law has come to light); see also <em>Medellin, </em>544 U. S., at 689 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cIn the past the Court has revisited its interpretation of a treaty when new international law has come to light\u201d (citing <em>Percheman, supra, </em>at 89)). Indeed, the Court seems to recognize as much, in that it spends several pages explaining why the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of the Convention is incorrect, see <em>ante, </em>at 356-357, rather than simply rejecting Bustillo\u2019s argument on the ground that \u201c \u2018respectful consideration\u2019 of precedent should begin at home,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 353, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">And there are other reasons not to place too much reliance on the breadth of Brear\u00e1\u2019s language. <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>is a <em>per curiam </em>decision that the Court had to reach within the few hours available between the time a petition for certiorari was filed and a scheduled execution, the decision is fairly recent, and the modification to which I refer requires no more than reading an exception into Brear\u00e1\u2019s language, language that in any event was not central to the Court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The modification is appropriate too because the \u201cfull effect\u201d proviso in Article 36(2) provides a \u201cclear and express statement\u201d that sometimes the Convention might trump a domestic procedural rule. And in any event, it is not even clear that such a clear statement rule actually exists. Brear\u00e1\u2019s statement of a presumption that only a treaty pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>vision with a \u201cclear and express statement\u201d can trump \u201cthe procedural rules of the forum State,\u201d 523 U. S., at 375, is in tension with more fundamental interpretive rules in this area. See, <em>e. g., Jordan </em>v. <em>Toshiro, </em>278 U. S. 123, 127 (1928) (treaties must be construed liberally to protect substantial rights); <em>Asakura, </em>265 U. S., at 342 (same); see also Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature May 23, 1969, Art. 27, 1115 U. N. T. S. 331, T. S. No. 58 (1980), 8 I. L. M. 679 (1969) (treaty parties may not invoke domestic law as an excuse for failing to conform to their treaty obligations).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Indeed, the cases <em>Breard </em>cites for the proposition that a clear and express statement is required to trump a domestic procedural rule seem not to establish it. <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Workman, </em>486 U. S. 717, 723 (1988) (Court said only that it was a \u201crule in international law at the time the Constitution was adopted\u201d that procedural rules \u201cmay be governed by forum law even when the substance of the claim must be governed by another State\u2019s law\u201d; case involved domestic law and the Constitution\u2019s Full Faith and Credit Clause); <em>Le Roy </em>v. <em>Crowninshield, </em>15 F. Cas. 362, 365, 371 (No. 8,269) (Mass. 1820) (case involved conflict of laws, not an international treaty); <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft </em>v. <em>Schlunk, </em>486 U. S. 694, 700 (1988) (case said that \u201cwe almost necessarily must refer to the internal law of the forum state\u201d to find a service of process standard if a treaty \u201cdoes not prescribe\u201d it); <em>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Industrielle A\u00e9rospatiale </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, </em>482 U. S. 522, 539-540, and n. 25 (1987) (case involving a specific treaty, not a general interpretive standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Finally, the Court says it would be odd to treat Convention rights more favorably than rights protected by the U. S. Constitution. <em>Ante, </em>at 358-360. But \u201c[a] treaty is in its nature a contract between two nations,\u201d <em>Foster, </em>2 Pet., at 314, and nations are of course free to agree to grant one another\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>citizens protections that differ from the protections enjoyed by citizens at home, particularly when circumstances call for differential treatment. See <em>infra, </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In sum, I find strong reasons for interpreting the Convention as sometimes prohibiting a state court from applying its ordinarily procedural default rule to a Convention violation claim. The fact that the IC J reached a similar conclusion in <em>LaGrand </em>and <em>Avena </em>adds strength to those reasons. And I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Consequently, I would remand No. 05-51 so that Bustillo can argue to the Virginia state courts that they should modify their ordinary procedural default requirements. I would leave it to the state courts to determine in the first instance whether state law has provided Bustillo the effective remedy that the Convention requires and how it has done so (whether through \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exceptions, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, or other ways). Cf. <em>LaGrand, </em>2001 I. C. J., at 513, \u00b6 125 (the \u201cchoice of [implementing] means must be left to the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The final question presented asks whether a Convention violation \u201cresult[s] in the suppression\u201d of the evidence, say, a confession, that a foreign national provided police before being informed of his Convention rights. Pet. for Cert, in No. 04-10566, p. i. The majority answers in absolute terms, stating that \u201csuppression is not an appropriate remedy for a violation of [the Convention].\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 337. I agree with the majority insofar as it rejects the argument that the Convention creates a Miranda-style \u201cautomatic exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 344; see also <em>Miranda, </em>384 U. S., at 471; cf., <em>e. g., Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643 (1961); <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U. S. 154 (1978). But I do not agree with the absolute nature of its statement. Rather, <em>sometimes </em>suppression could prove the only effective remedy. And, if that is so, then the Convention, which insists upon effective remedies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>would require suppression in an appropriate case. Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Much depends upon the circumstances. It may be true that in \u201cmost circumstances, there is likely to be little connection between an Article 36 violation and evidence or statements obtained by police.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 349. <em>Miranda </em>surely helps, for it guarantees that police will inform an arrested foreign national of his right to contact a lawyer. But one cannot guarantee in advance that <em>Miranda </em>will adequately cure <em>every </em>seriously prejudicial failure to inform an arrested person of his right to contact his consular post. One can imagine a case, for example, involving a foreign national who speaks little English, who comes from a country where confessions made to the police cannot be used in court as evidence, who does not understand that a state-provided lawyer can provide him crucial assistance in an interrogation, and whose native community has great fear of police abuse. Indeed, Sanchez-Llamas made allegations similar to these in his case. Brief for Petitioner Sanchez-Llamas 5-7; see also Brief for the Government of the United Mexican States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">While Justice Ginsburg is correct that a defendant who is prejudiced under the Convention may be able to show that his confession is involuntary under <em>Miranda, ante, </em>at 361, I am not persuaded that this will always be so. A person who fully understands his <em>Miranda </em>rights but does not fully understand the implications of these rights for our legal system may or may not be able to show that his confession was involuntary under <em>Miranda, </em>but he will certainly have a claim under the Vienna Convention. In such a case, suppression of a confession may prove the only effective remedy. I would not rule out the existence of such cases in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Furthermore, the majority is wrong to say that it would \u201cbe startling if the Convention were read to require suppression\u201d in such cases because suppression \u201cis an entirely American legal creation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 343. I put to the side the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that \u201csuppression\u201d is in origin a British, not an American, remedy. See <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U. S. 428, 433 (2000) (noting that \u201c[t]he roots of the <em>[Miranda] </em>test developed in the common law\u201d and citing English cases); see also <em>King </em>v. <em>Warickshall, </em>1 Leach 263, 263-264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (1783) (coerced confessions are inadmissible in British courts). Regardless, it is not \u201cstartling\u201d to read the Convention as <em>sometimes </em>requiring suppression. That is because those who wrote the Convention were fully aware that the criminal justice systems of different nations differ in important ways. They did not list particular remedies. They used general language. That language requires every member nation to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to Article 36(l)\u2019s \u201cpurposes.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. That language leaves it up to each nation to determine how to implement Article 36(l)\u2019s requirements. <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 61, \u00b6 127; <em>LaGrand, supra, </em>at 513-514, \u00b6 125. But as a matter of logic and purpose that language must also insist upon the use of suppression if and when there are circumstances in which suppression provides the only <em>effective remedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">These differences may also help to explain what the majority says is the disturbing circumstance that \u201cnearly all\u201d other signatories to the Convention \u201crefuse to recognize\u201d suppression \u201cas a matter of domestic law,\u201d and therefore that \u201cSanchez-Llamas would [not] be afforded the relief he seeks here in any of the other 169 countries party to the Vienna Convention.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 344. In fact, there are several cases from common-law jurisdictions suggesting that suppression is an appropriate remedy for a Convention violation. See, <em>e. g., Tan Seng Kiah </em>v. <em>Queen </em>(2001) 160 F. L. R. 26 (Crim. App. N. Terr.) (Australian case suppressing confession obtained in violation of statute requiring police to notify defendant of right to contact consulate upon arrest); <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Tan </em>[2001] W. A. S. C. 275 (Sup. Ct. W. Aus. in Crim.) (Australian case considering but declining to suppress evidence based on violation of same statute); <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Partak, </em>160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>C. C. C. 3d, at \u00b6 63 (Canada) (concluding that suppression is inappropriate, not because it was never a proper remedy under the Vienna Convention but because the defendant \u201ccompletely failed to demonstrate any prejudice arising from the failure of the police to notify him of his consular rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">I concede the absence of such cases from civil-law jurisdictions. But the criminal justice systems in those nations differ from our own in significant ways. Civil-law nations, for example, typically rely more heavily than do we upon judicial investigation, questioning by a neutral magistrate, the compiling of all evidence into a dossier, and later review of that dossier at trial by judges who may sit without our type of jury. In such a system, formal suppression proceedings may prove less frequent. Judges, as a matter of practice, may simply disregard improperly obtained evidence, they may discount the significance of that evidence, or they may adjust the nature of future proceedings or even the final sentence accordingly. See Damaska, Evidentiary Barriers to Conviction and Two Models of Criminal Procedure: A Comparative Study, 121 U. Pa. L. Rev. 506, 522 (1972) (explaining why many civil law system \u201cprovisions regulating the interrogation of defendants are silent as to the admissibility of testimony obtained in violation of proper interrogation procedures\u201d); see also Van Kessel, European Perspectives on the Accused as a Source of Testimonial Evidence, 100 W. Va. L. Rev. 799, 831 (1997) (\u201cBecause [civil-law] courts decide both questions of law and of fact, exclusionary rules in [those] courts are more appropriately described as rules of decision than rules of exclusion\u2014what evidence the fact-finder may use to support its decision, rather than what evidence may be presented to the fact-finder. The presiding judge is well acquainted with all evidence in the dossier and often must 'put aside\u2019 or 'forget about\u2019 evidence which legally cannot be used to support the judgment\u201d); Bradley, The Exclusionary Rule in Germany, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1032, 1065 (1982) (noting that in the German inquisitorial system, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>many police violations, \u201cthe fact that evidence was legally or illegally obtained is not dispositive\u201d; instead, the \u201cdecision to admit or suppress will be determined by balancing the relative importance of the defendant\u2019s privacy rights against the seriousness of the offense charged\u201d); Declaration of Professor Thomas Weigend, Annex 3 to Counter-Memorial of the United States, in <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J. No. 128, p. A367, \u00b6 20 (Oct. 22, 2003) (noting that in the German and Dutch legal systems, a procedural violation can lead to a reduced sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Thus, the <em>absence </em>of reported decisions formally suppressing confessions obtained in violation of the Convention tells us nothing at all about whether such nations give \u201cfull effect\u201d to the \u201cpurposes\u201d of Article 36(1). The existence of cases in such nations where a court denies a defense request to suppress, of course, might well shed light on that nation\u2019s readiness to provide an effective remedy. The Solicitor General cites one (and only one) such case. See Judgment of Nov. 7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116 (deciding in light of <em>LaGrand </em>that the Convention creates individual rights, but declining to suppress confession). That is the only support I have found for the claim that somehow the petitioners here are asking the United States to provide that which other countries deny, an effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The United States joined the Vienna Convention, and urged other nations to join, in order to promote \u201cthe orderly and effective conduct of consular relations between States,\u201d and to guarantee \u201cthe protection of our citizens abroad.\u201d Vienna Convention on Consular Relations with Optional Protocol, S. Exec. Doe. No. E, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 60, 75 (1969). In doing so, the United States, along with the other 169 nations that ratified the Convention, undertook a complex task. They sought not only to protect their consular posts, but also to assure that their nationals would have access to those posts when arrested abroad. But how to enforce those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>rights poses a difficult question because the enforcement mechanism inevitably will vary depending upon the details of a nation\u2019s legal system. For practical, legal, and political reasons, it is difficult to write enforcement details into an international treaty. Yet without any such guarantees it may prove difficult to prevent an individual nation, through application of its system\u2019s details, from denying in practice the rights that the treaty sought to assure.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Convention deals with this problem by including a general provision that <em>both </em>severely limits the treaty\u2019s intrusion into the functioning of a domestic legal system <em>and also </em>safeguards consular access rights from serious domestic neglect. It does so by stating that those rights shall \u201cbe exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State,\u201d <em>provided that </em>those laws and regulations give \u201cfull effect\u201d to Article 36(l)\u2019s purposes. Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T, at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Applying this provision to our own legal system, I would seek to minimize the Convention\u2019s intrusion and federal intrusion into the workings of state legal systems while simultaneously keeping faith with the Convention\u2019s basic objectives. That is why I believe that the Convention here requires individual States to make an exception (akin to a \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception) to a state procedural default rule if (1) the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a claim of a Convention violation in a timely manner itself was a product of that violation, and (2) state law provides no other procedural means through which the State\u2019s courts can provide \u201creview,\u201d \u201creconsideration,\u201d and effective relief. Similarly, I would hold that whether the Convention requires a state court to suppress a confession obtained after an Article 36 violation depends on whether suppression is the only remedy available that will effectively cure related prejudice. And because neither state court applied this standard below, I would remand each case for that initial consideration. See 338 Ore., at 269, 108 P. 3d, at 574 (rejecting Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>request for suppression remedy solely on the ground that the Convention \u201cdoes not create rights that individual foreign nationals may assert in a criminal proceeding\u201d); App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a (rejecting Bustillo\u2019s request for state postconviction relief based on a standard different from that set forth here).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The interpretation of the Convention that I would adopt is consistent with the ICJ\u2019s own interpretation and should not impose significant new burdens upon state criminal justice systems. America\u2019s legal traditions have long included detailed rules for discovering and curing prejudicial legal errors. Indeed, many States already have \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exceptions likely broad enough to provide the \u201ceffective\u201d relief the Convention demands. And, in any event, it leaves the States free to apply their own judicial remedies in light of, and bounded by, the Convention\u2019s general instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Court, I fear, does not rise to the interpretive challenge. Rather than seek to apply Article 36\u2019s language and purposes to the federal-state relationships that characterize America\u2019s legal system, it simply rejects the notion that Article 36(2) sets forth any relevant requirement. That approach leaves States free to deny effective relief for Convention violations, despite America\u2019s promise to provide just such relief. That approach risks weakening respect abroad for the rights of foreign nationals, a respect that America, in 1969, sought to make effective throughout the world. And it increases the difficulties faced by the United States and other nations who would, through binding treaties, strengthen the role that law can play in assuring all citizens, including American citizens, fair treatment throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\"> Before trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress his statements to police on voluntariness grounds.
