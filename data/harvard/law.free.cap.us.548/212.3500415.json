The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>trial court applied a 3-year firearm enhancement to respondent\u2019s sentence based on its own factual findings, in violation of <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U. S. 296 (2004). On appeal, the Supreme Court of Washington vacated the sentence, concluding that <em>Blakely </em>violations can never be harmless. We granted certiorari to review this conclusion, 546 U. S. 960 (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On September 18, 1999, respondent fought with his wife, Amy Recuenco. After screaming at her and smashing their stove, he threatened her with a gun. Based on this incident, the State of Washington charged respondent with assault in the second degree, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cintentiona[l] assault . . . with a deadly weapon, to-wit: a handgun.\u201d App. 3. Defense counsel proposed, and the court accepted, a special verdict form that directed the jury to make a specific finding whether respondent was \u201carmed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13. A \u201cfirearm\u201d qualifies as a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d under Washington law. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a79.94A.602 (2004). But nothing in the verdict form specifically required the jury to find that respondent had engaged in assault with a \u201cfirearm,\u201d as opposed to any other kind of \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of assault in the second degree, and answered the special verdict question in the affirmative. App. 10, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">At sentencing, the State sought the low end of the standard range sentence for assault in the second degree (three months). It also sought a mandatory 3-year enhancement because respondent was armed with a \u201cfirearm,\u201d \u00a7 9.94A.533(3)(b), rather than requesting the 1-year enhancement that would attend the jury\u2019s finding that respondent was armed with a deadly weapon, \u00a7 9.94A.533(4)(b). The trial court concluded that respondent satisfied the condition for the firearm enhancement, and accordingly imposed a total sentence of 39 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Before the Supreme Court of Washington heard respondent\u2019s appeal, we decided <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U. S. 466 (2000), and <em>Blakely, supra. </em>In <em>Apprendi, </em>we held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U. S., at 490. In <em>Blakely, </em>we clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d </em>542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis in original). Because the trial court in this case could not have subjected respondent to a firearm enhancement based only on the jury\u2019s finding that respondent was armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d the State conceded before the Supreme Court of Washington that a Sixth Amendment violation occurred under <em>Blakely. </em>154 Wash. 2d 156, 162-163, 110 P. 3d 188, 191 (2005). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The State urged the Supreme Court of Washington to find the <em>Blakely </em>error harmless and, accordingly, to affirm the sentence. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>154 Wash. 2d 118, 110 P. 3d 192 (2005), however, decided the same day as the present case, the Supreme Court of Washington declared <em>Blakely </em>error to be \u201c\u2018structural\u2019 erro[r]\u201d which \u201c\u2018will always invalidate the conviction.\u2019 \u201d 154 Wash. 2d, at 142, 110 P. 3d, at 205 (quoting <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>508 U. S. 275, 279 (1993)). As a result, the court refused to apply harmless-error analysis to the <em>Blakely </em>error infecting respondent\u2019s sentence. Instead, it vacated his sentence and remanded for sentencing based solely on the deadly weapon enhancement. 154 Wash. 2d, at 164, 110 P. 3d, at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Before reaching the merits, we must address respondent\u2019s argument that we are without power to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>judgment rested on adequate and independent state-law grounds. Respondent claims that at the time of his conviction, Washington state law provided no procedure for a jury to determine whether a defendant was armed with a firearm. Therefore, he contends, it is impossible to conduct harmless-error analysis on the <em>Blakely </em>error in his case. Respondent bases his position on <em>Hughes, </em>in which the Supreme Court of Washington refused to \u201ccreate a procedure to empanel juries on remand to find aggravating factors because the legislature did not provide such a procedure and, instead, explicitly assigned such findings to the trial court.\u201d 154 Wash. 2d, at 151, 110 P. 3d, at 209. Respondent contends that, likewise, the Washington Legislature provided no procedure by which a jury could decide at trial whether a defendant was armed with a firearm, as opposed to a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It is far from clear that respondent\u2019s interpretation of Washington law is correct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pharr, </em>131 Wash. App. 119, 124-125, 126 R 3d 66, 69 (2006) (affirming the trial court\u2019s imposition of a firearm enhancement when the jury\u2019s special verdict reflected a finding that the defendant was armed with a firearm). In <em>Hughes, </em>the Supreme Court of Washington carefully avoided reaching the conclusion respondent now advocates, instead expressly recognizing that \u201c[w]e are presented only with the question of the appropriate remedy on remand\u2014we do not decide here whether juries may be given special verdict forms or interrogatories to determine aggravating factors at trial.\u201d 154 Wash. 2d, at 149, 110 R 3d, at 208. Accordingly, <em>Hughes </em>does not appear to foreclose the possibility that an error could be found harmless because the jury which convicted the defendant would have concluded, if given the opportunity, that a defendant was armed with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The correctness of respondent\u2019s interpretation of Washington law, however, is not determinative of the question that the Supreme Court of Washington decided and on which we granted review, <em>i. e., </em>whether <em>Blakely </em>error can ever be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>deemed harmless. If respondent is correct that Washington law does not provide for a procedure by which his jury could have made a finding pertaining to his possession of a firearm, that merely suggests that respondent will be able to demonstrate that the <em>Blakely </em>violation <em>in this particular case </em>was not harmless. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967). But that does not mean that <em>Blakely </em>error\u2014which is of the same nature, whether it involves a fact that state law permits to be submitted to the jury or not\u2014is structural, or that we are precluded from deciding that question. Thus, we need not resolve this open question of Washington law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We have repeatedly recognized that the commission of a constitutional error at trial alone does not entitle a defendant to automatic reversal. Instead, \u201c \u2018most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U. S. 1, 8 (1999) (quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U. S. 279, 306 (1991)). \u201c \u2018[I]f the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other [constitutional] errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis.\u2019 \u201d 527 U. S., at 8 (quoting <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U. S. 570, 579 (1986)). Only in rare cases has this Court held that an error is structural, and thus requires automatic reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In such cases, the error \u201cneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>sarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Neder, supra, </em>at 9 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We recently considered whether an error similar to that which occurred here was structural in <em>Neder, supra. </em>Neder was charged with mail fraud, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1341; wire fraud, in violation of \u00a7 1343; bank fraud, in violation of \u00a7 1344; and filing a false income tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(1). 527 U. S., at 6. At Neder\u2019s trial, the District Court instructed the jury that it \u201c\u2018need not consider\u2019\u201d the materiality of any false statements to convict Neder of the tax offenses or bank fraud, because materiality \u201c\u2018is not a question for the jury to decide.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court also failed to include materiality as an element of the offenses of mail fraud and wire fraud. <em>Ibid. </em>We determined that the District Court erred because under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin, </em>515 U. S. 506 (1995), materiality is an element of the tax offense that must be found by the jury. We further determined that materiality is an element of the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes, and thus must be submitted to the jury to support conviction of those crimes as well. <em>Neder, </em>527 U. S., at 20. We nonetheless held that harmless-error analysis applied to these errors, because \u201can instruction that omits an element of the offense does not <em>necessarily </em>render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 9. See also <em>Schriro </em>v. <em>Summerlin, </em>542 U. S. 348, 355-356 (2004) (rejecting the claim that <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>536 U. S. 584 (2002), which applied <em>Apprendi </em>to hold that a jury must find the existence of aggravating factors necessary to impose the death penalty, was a \u201c \u2018 \u201cwatershed rul[e] of criminal procedure\u201d implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding,\u2019\u201d in part because we could not \u201cconfidently say that judicial factfinding <em>seriously </em>diminishes accuracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The State and the United States urge that this case is indistinguishable from <em>Neder. </em>We agree. Our decision in <em>Apprendi </em>makes clear that \u201c[a]ny possible distinction between an \u2018element\u2019 of a felony offense and a \u2018sentencing factor\u2019 was unknown to the practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by court as it existed during the years surrounding our Nation\u2019s founding.\u201d 530 U. S., at 478 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we have treated sentencing factors, like elements, as facts that have to be tried to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id., </em>at 483-484. The only difference between this case and <em>Neder </em>is that in <em>Neder, </em>the prosecution failed to prove the element of materiality to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, while here the prosecution failed to prove the sentencing factor of \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Assigning this distinction constitutional significance cannot be reconciled with our recognition in <em>Apprendi </em>that elements and sentencing factors must be treated the same for Sixth Amendment purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Respondent attempts to distinguish <em>Neder </em>on the ground that, in that case, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the offense for which the defendant was sentenced. Here, in contrast, the jury returned a guilty verdict only on the offense of assault in the second degree, and an affirmative answer to the sentencing question whether respondent was armed with a deadly weapon. Accordingly, respondent ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>gues, the trial court\u2019s action in his case was the equivalent of a directed verdict of guilt on an offense (assault in the second degree while armed with a firearm) greater than the one for which the jury convicted him (assault in the second degree while armed with any deadly weapon). Rather than asking whether the jury would have returned the same verdict absent the error, as in <em>Neder, </em>respondent contends that applying harmless-error analysis here would \u201c \u2018hypothesize a guilty verdict that [was] never in fact rendered,\u2019 \u201d in violation of the jury-trial guarantee. Brief for Respondent 27 (quoting <em>Sullivan, </em>508 U. S., at 279).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We find this distinction unpersuasive. Certainly, in <em>Neder, </em>the jury purported to have convicted the defendant of the crimes with which he was charged and for which he was sentenced. However, the jury was precluded \u201cfrom making a finding on the <em>actual </em>element of the offense.\u201d 527 U. S., at 10. Because Neder\u2019s jury did not find him guilty of each of the elements of the offenses with which he was charged, its verdict is no more fairly described as a complete finding of guilt of the crimes for which the defendant was sentenced than is the verdict here. See <em>id., </em>at 31 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[S]ince all crimes require proof of more than one element to establish guilt... it follows that trial by jury means determination by a jury that <em>all elements </em>were proved. The Court does not contest this\u201d). Put another way, we concluded that the error in <em>Neder </em>was subject to harmless-error analysis, even though the District Court there not only failed to submit the question of materiality to the jury, but also mistakenly concluded that the jury\u2019s verdict was a complete verdict of guilt on the charges and imposed sentence accordingly. Thus, in order to find for respondent, we would have to conclude that harmless-error analysis would apply if Washington had a crime labeled \u201cassault in the second degree while armed with a firearm,\u201d and the trial court erroneously instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>jury that it was not required to find a deadly weapon or a firearm to convict, while harmless error does not apply in the present case. This result defies logic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Failure to submit a sentencing factor to the jury, like failure to submit an element to the jury, is not structural error. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> Respondent\u2019s argument that, as a matter of <em>state </em>law, the <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.

Brief for Respondent 16-19. Because the Supreme Court of Washington treated the error as one of the latter type, we treat it similarly. See 154 Wash. 2d 156, 159-161, 110 P. 3d 188, 189-190 (2005) (considering \u201cwhether imposition of a firearm enhancement without a jury finding that Recuenco was armed with a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt violated Recueneo\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as defined by <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U. S. 466 [(2000)], and its progeny,\u201d and whether the <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>error, if uninvited, could \u201cbe deemed harmless\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> The Supreme Court of Washington reached the contrary conclusion based on language from <em>Sullivan. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>154 Wash. 2d 118, 144, 110 P. 3d 192, 205 (2005) (\u201c \u2018There being no jury verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt, the question whether the <em>same </em>verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless.

Here, as in <em>Neder, </em>\u201cthis strand of reasoning in <em>Sullivan </em>does provide support for [respondent]\u2019s position.\u201d 527 U. S., at 11.

S. 398 (2006), and <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Marsh, ante, </em>p. 163, this is a case in which the Court has granted review in order to make sure that a State\u2019s highest court has not granted its citizens any greater protection than the bare minimum required by the Federal Constitution. Ironically, the issue in this case is not whether respondent\u2019s federal constitutional rights were violated\u2014that is admitted\u2014it is whether the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s chosen remedy for the violation is mandated by federal law. As the discussion in Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion demonstrates, whether we even have jurisdiction to decide that question is not entirely clear. But even if our expansionist <em>post-Michigan </em>v. <em>Long </em>jurisprudence supports our jurisdiction to review the decision below, see 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), there was surely no need to reach out to decide this case. The Washington Supreme Court can, of course, reinstate the same judgment on remand, either for the reasons discussed in Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion, see <em>ante, </em>at 217-218, and n. 1, or because that court chooses, as a matter of state law, to adhere to its view that the proper remedy for <em>Blakely </em>errors, see <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U. S. 296 (2004), is automatic reversal of the unconstitutional portion of a defendant\u2019s sentence. Moreover, because the Court does not address the strongest argument in respondent\u2019s favor\u2014namely, that <em>Blakely </em>errors are structural because they deprive criminal defendants of sufficient notice regarding the charges they must defend against, see <em>ante, </em>at 220, n. 3\u2014this decision will have a limited impact on other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">As I did in <em>Brigham City </em>and <em>Marsh, </em>I voted to deny certiorari in this case.

In connection with the enhancement, the judge gave the jurors a special verdict form and instructed them to answer \u201cYes or No\u201d to one question only: \u201cWas the defendant . . . armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime of Assault in the Second Degree?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13. The jury answered: \u201cYes.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Because the deadly weapon Recuenco held was in fact a handgun, the prosecutor might have charged, as an alternative to the deadly weapon enhancement, that at the time of the assault, Recuenco was \u201carmed with a firearm.\u201d That enhancement would have added three mandatory years to the assault sentence. \u00a7 9.94A.533(3)(b). The information charging Recuenco, however, did not allege the firearm enhancement. The jury received no instruction on it and was given no special verdict form posing the question: Was the defendant armed with a firearm at the time of the commission of the crime of Assault in the Second Degree? See 154 Wash. 2d 156, 160, 110 P. 3d 188, 190 (2005) (\u201cThe jury was not asked to, and therefore did not, return a special verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>that Recuenco committed the assault while armed with a firearm.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The prosecutor not only failed to charge Recuenco with assault while armed with a firearm and to request a special verdict tied to the firearm enhancement. He also informed the court, after the jury\u2019s verdict and in response to the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate: \u201cThe method under which the state is alleging and the jury found the assaul[t] committed was by use of a deadly weapon.\u201d App. 35. Leaving no doubt, the prosecutor further clarified: \u201c[I]n the crime charged and the enhancement the state alleged, there is no elemen[t] of a firearm. The element is assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Recuenco was thus properly charged, tried, and convicted of second-degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon. It was a solid case; no gap was left to fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Nevertheless, at sentencing, the prosecutor requested, and the trial judge imposed, a three-year mandatory enhancement for use of a firearm. <em>Ibid. </em>Recuenco objected to imposition of the firearm enhancement \u201cwithout notice .. . and a jury finding.\u201d 154 Wash. 2d, at 161, 110 R 3d, at 190. Determining that there was no warrant for elevation of the charge once the trial was over, the Washington Supreme Court \u201cremand[ed] for resentencing based solely on the deadly weapon enhancement which is supported by the jury\u2019s special verdict.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 164, 110 R 3d, at 192. I would affirm that judgment. No error marred the case presented at trial. The prosecutor charged, and the jury found Recuenco guilty of, a complete and clearly delineated offense: \u201cassault in the second degree, being armed with a deadly weapon.\u201d The \u201charmless-error\u201d doctrine was not designed to allow dislodgment of that error-free jury determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Under Washington law and practice, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with a firearm are discrete charges, at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tended by discrete instructions. As the Court observes, <em>ante, </em>at 215, a charge of second-degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon, \u00a7 9.94A.533(4)(b), subjects a defendant to an additional year in prison, and a charge of second-degree assault while armed with a firearm, \u00a7 9.94A.533(3)(b), calls for an additional term of three years. \u201cDeadly weapon,\u201d Washington law provides, encompasses any \u201cimplement or instrument which has the capacity to inflict death and from the manner in which it is used, is likely to produce or may easily and readily produce death,\u201d including, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cpistol, revolver, or any other firearm.\u201d \u00a79.94A.602. \u201cFirearm\u201d is defined, more particularly, to mean \u201ca weapon or device from which a projectile or projectiles may be fired by an explosive such as gunpowder.\u201d \u00a79.41.010(1). A handgun (the weapon Recuenco held), it thus appears, might have been placed in both categories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Washington Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal (WPIC) (West Supp. 2005), set out three instructions for cases in which \u201can enhanced sentence is sought on the basis that the defendant was armed with a \u2018deadly weapon,\u2019\u201d WPIC \u00a72.06 (note on use): Deadly Weapon\u2014General, \u00a72.07; Deadly Weapon\u2014Knife, \u00a7 2.07.01; Deadly Weapon\u2014Firearm, \u00a7 2.07.02. When the prosecutor seeks an enhancement based on the charge that \u201cthe defendant was armed with a \u2018firearm,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7 2.06, trial courts are directed to a different instruction, one keyed to the elevated enhancement, \u00a72.10.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Matching special verdict forms for trial-court use are also framed in the WPIC. When a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d charge is made, whether generally or with a knife or firearm, the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>scribed form asks the jury: \u201cWas the defendant (defendant\u2019s name) armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime [in Count \u2014]?\u201d \u00a7190.01. When a \u201cfirearm\u201d charge is made, the jury is asked: \u201cWas the defendant (defendant\u2019s name) armed with a firearm at the time of the commission of the crime [in Count \u2014]?\u201d \u00a7 190.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In Recuenco\u2019s case, the jury was instructed, in line with the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d charge made by the prosecutor, App. 6-7, and the special verdict form given to the jury matched that instruction. The form read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cWe, the jury, return a special verdict by answering as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cWas the defendant ARTURO R. RECUENCO armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime of Assault in the Second Degree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201cANSWER: [YES] (Yes or No).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">No \u201cfirearm\u201d instruction, WPIC \u00a72.10.01 (West Supp. 2005), was given to Recuenco\u2019s jury, nor was the jury given the special verdict form matching that instruction, \u00a7 190.02; see <em>supra, </em>at 226, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">In the Court\u2019s view, \u201cthis case is indistinguishable from <em>Neder </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>527 U. S. 1 (1999)].\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 220. In that case, the trial judge made a finding necessary to fill a gap in an incomplete jury verdict. One of the offenses involved was tax fraud; the element missing from the jury\u2019s instruction was the materiality of the defendant\u2019s alleged misstatements. Under the mistaken impression that materiality was a question reserved for the court, the trial judge made the finding himself. In fact in <em>Neder, </em>materiality was not in dispute. See 527 U. S., at 7; see also <em>id., </em>at 15 (Neder \u201cd[id] not suggest that he would introduce any evidence bearing upon the issue of materiality if so allowed.\u201d). \u201cReversal without any consideration of the effect of the error upon the verdict would [have] sen[t] the case back for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>trial\u2014a retrial not focused at all on the issue of materiality, but on contested issues on which the jury [had been] properly instructed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court concluded that the Sixth Amendment did not command that recycling.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Here, in contrast to <em>Neder, </em>the charge, jury instructions, and special verdict contained no omissions; they set out completely all ingredients of the crime of second-degree assault with a deadly weapon. There is no occasion for any retrial, and no cause to displace the jury\u2019s entirely complete verdict with, in essence, a conviction on an uncharged greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The standard form judgment completed and signed by the trial judge in this case included the following segment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\u201cSPECIAL VERDICT or FINDING(S):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201c(b) [ ] A special verdict/finding for being armed with a Firearm was rendered on Count(s) \u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">\u201c(c) [X] A special verdict/finding for being armed with a Deadly Weapon other than a firearm was rendered on Count(s) I.\u201d App. 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Count I was identified on the judgment form as \u201cASSAULT IN THE 2ND DEGREE.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Despite the \u201cX\u201d placed next to the \u201cDeadly Weapon\u201d special verdict/finding, and the blanks left unfilled in the \u201cFirearm\u201d special verdict/finding lines, the trial judge imposed a sentence of 39 months (3 months for the assault, 36 months as the enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Had the prosecutor alternatively charged both enhancements, and had the judge accurately and adequately instructed on both, giving the jury a special verdict form on each of the two enhancements, the jury would have had the prerogative to choose the lower enhancement. Specifically, the jury could have answered \u201cYes\u201d (as it in fact did, see <em>supra, </em>at 227) to the \u201carmed with a deadly weapon\u201d inquiry while returning no response to the alternative \u201cfirearm\u201d inquiry. See <em>supra, </em>at 226, and n. 2 (Washington\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d overlaps definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U. S. 564, 573 (1977) (\u201c[R]egardless of how overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction!, t]he trial judge is . . . barred from attempting to override or interfere with the jurors\u2019 independent judgment in a manner contrary to the interests of the accused.\u201d). Today\u2019s decision, advancing a greater excluded (from jury control) offense notion, diminishes the jury\u2019s historic capacity \u201cto prevent the punishment from getting too far out of line with the crime.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maybury, </em>274 F. 2d 899, 902 (CA2 1960) (Friendly, J.); see also <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U. S. 296, 306 (2004) (recognizing jury\u2019s role \u201cas circuitbreaker in the State\u2019s machinery of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In sum, Recuenco, charged with one crime (assault with a deadly weapon), was convicted of another (assault with a firearm), <em>sans </em>charge, jury instruction, or jury verdict. That disposition, I would hold, is incompatible with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> Since Recuenco was charged, some of the relevant statutory provisions have been renumbered, without material revision. For convenience, we follow the Court\u2019s and the parties\u2019 citation practice and refer to the current provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> But see App. 38. When the prosecutor, post-trial but presentence, made it plain that he was seeking the three-year firearm enhancement rather than the one-year deadly weapon enhancement, Recuenco objected that the statutory definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d had not been read to the jury, and that the prosecutor had submitted no evidence showing that Reeuenco\u2019s handgun was \u201cdesigned to fire a projectile by explosive such as gunpowder.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
