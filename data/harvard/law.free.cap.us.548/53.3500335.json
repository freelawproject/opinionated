L. 88-352, \u00a7704, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). A separate section of the Act\u2014its antiretaliation provision\u2014prohibits an employer from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against\u201d an employee or job applicant because that individual \u201copposed any practice\u201d made unlawful by Title VII or \u201cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\u201d a Title VII proceeding or investigation. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclusions about the scope of the Act\u2019s antiretaliation provision, particularly the reach of its phrase \u201cdiscriminate against.\u201d Does that provision confine actionable retaliation to activity that affects the terms and conditions of employment? And how harmful must the adverse actions be to fall within its scope?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We conclude that the antiretaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace. We also conclude that the provision covers those (and only those) employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant. In the present context that means that the employer\u2019s actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">This case arises out of actions that supervisors at petitioner Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company took against respondent Sheila White, the only woman working in the Maintenance of Way department at Burlington\u2019s Tennessee Yard. In June 1997, Burlington\u2019s roadmaster, Marvin Brown, interviewed White and expressed interest in her previous experience operating forklifts. Burlington hired White as a \u201ctrack laborer,\u201d a job that involves removing and replacing track components, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way. Soon after White arrived on the job, a co-worker who had previously operated the forklift chose to assume other responsibilities. Brown immediately assigned White to operate the forklift. While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was White\u2019s primary responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>In September 1997, White complained to Burlington officials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department. Joiner, White said, had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her in front of her male colleagues. After an internal investigation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and ordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training session.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner\u2019s discipline. At the same time, he told White that he was removing her from forklift duty and assigning her to perform only standard track laborer tasks. Brown explained that the reassignment reflected co-workers\u2019 complaints that, in fairness, a \u201c\u2018more senior man\u2019\u201d should have the \u201cless arduous and cleaner job\u201d of forklift operator. 364 F. 3d 789, 792 (CA6 2004) (case below).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On October 10, White filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission). She claimed that the reassignment of her duties amounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and retaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner. In early December, White filed a second retaliation charge with the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her daily activities. That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should transport White from one location to another. The specific facts of the disagreement are in dispute, but the upshot is that Sharkey told Brown later that afternoon that White had been insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White without pay. White invoked internal grievance procedures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had <em>not </em>been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her backpay for the 37 days she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>suspended. White filed an additional retaliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed this Title VII action against Burlington in federal court. As relevant here, she claimed that Burlington\u2019s actions\u2014(1) changing her job responsibilities, and (2) suspending her for 37 days without pay\u2014amounted to unlawful retaliation in violation of Title VIL \u00a72000e~3(a). A jury found in White\u2019s favor on both of these claims. It awarded her $43,500 in compensatory damages, including $3,250 in medical expenses. The District Court denied Burlington\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Initially, a divided Sixth Circuit panel reversed the judgment and found in Burlington\u2019s favor on the retaliation claims. 310 F. 3d 443 (2002). The full Court of Appeals vacated the panel\u2019s decision, however, and heard the matter en banc. The court then affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment in White\u2019s favor on both retaliation claims. While all members of the en banc court voted to uphold the District Court\u2019s judgment, they differed as to the proper standard to apply. Compare 364 F. 3d, at 795-800, with <em>id., </em>at 809 (Clay, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Title VIPs antiretaliation provision forbids employer actions that \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d an employee (or job applicant) because he has \u201copposed\u201d a practice that Title VII forbids or has \u201cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\u201d a Title VII \u201cinvestigation, proceeding, or hearing.\u201d \u00a72000e-3(a). No one doubts that the term \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167, 174 (2005); <em>Price Water-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>house </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U. S. 228, 244 (1989) (plurality opinion); see also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 758 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 3b). But different Circuits have come to different conclusions about whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace related and about how harmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Some Circuits have insisted upon a close relationship between the retaliatory action and employment. The Sixth Circuit majority in this case, for example, said that a plaintiff must show an \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d which it defined as a \u201cmaterially adverse change in the terms and conditions\u201d of employment. 364 F. 3d, at 795 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Sixth Circuit has thus joined those Courts of Appeals that apply the same standard for retaliation that they apply to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that the challenged action must \u201cresul[t] in an adverse effect on the \u2018terms, conditions, or benefits\u2019 of employment.\u201d <em>Von Gunten </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>243 F. 3d 858, 866 (CA4 2001); see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh, </em>120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits have adopted a more restrictive approach. They employ an \u201cultimate employment decision\u201d standard, which limits actionable retaliatory conduct to acts \u201c \u2018such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\u2019\u201d <em>Mattern </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>104 F. 3d 702, 707 (CA5 1997); see <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>127 F. 3d 686, 692 (CA8 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Other Circuits have not so limited the scope of the provision. The Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits have said that the plaintiff must show that the \u201cemployer\u2019s challenged action would have been material to a reasonable employee,\u201d which in contexts like the present one means that it would likely have \u201cdissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Illinois Dept. of Revenue, </em>420 F. 3d 658, 662 (CA7 2005); see <em>Rochon </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>438 F. 3d 1211, 1217-1218 (CADC 2006). And the Ninth Circuit, following EEOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>guidance, has said that the plaintiff must simply establish \u201c\u2018adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity.\u2019\u201d <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>217 F. 3d 1234, 1242-1243 (2000). The concurring judges below would have applied this last mentioned standard. 364 F. 3d, at 809 (opinion of Clay, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We granted certiorari to resolve this disagreement. To do so requires us to decide whether Title VIPs antiretaliation provision forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace. And we must characterize how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Petitioner and the Solicitor General both argue that the Sixth Circuit is correct to require a link between the challenged retaliatory action and the terms, conditions, or status of employment. They note that Title VIPs substantive anti-discrimination provision protects an individual only from employment-related discrimination. They add that the anti-retaliation provision should be read <em>in pari materia </em>with the antidiscrimination provision. And they conclude that the employer actions prohibited by the antiretaliation provision should similarly be limited to conduct that \u201caffects the employee\u2019s \u2018compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u2019\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13 (quoting \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l)); see Brief for Petitioner 13 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We cannot agree. The language of the substantive provision differs from that of the antiretaliation provision in important ways. Section 703(a) sets forth Title VIPs core antidiscrimination provision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201c(1) <em>to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge </em>any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual <em>with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, </em>because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way <em>which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, </em>because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d \u00a72000e-2(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Section 704(a) sets forth Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer <em>to discriminate against </em>any of his employees or applicants for employment... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The italicized words in the substantive provision\u2014\u201chire,\u201d \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\u201d \u201cemployment opportunities,\u201d and \u201cstatus as an employee\u201d\u2014explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace. No such limiting words appear in the antiretaliation provision. Given these linguistic differences, the question here is not whether identical or similar words should be read <em>in pari materia </em>to mean the same thing. See, <em>e. g., Pasquantino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 349, 355, n. 2 (2005); <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>512 U. S. 849, 858 (1994); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Everhart, </em>494 U. S. 83, 92 (1990). Rather, the question is whether Congress intended its different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>words to make a legal difference. We normally presume that, where words differ as they differ here, \u201c \u2018Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences that its language suggests, for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well. The antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status. See <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U. S. 792, 800-801 (1973). The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\u2019s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\u2019s basic guarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <em>i. e., </em>their status. The antiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <em>i. e., </em>their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other than employment-related discrimination. The substantive provision\u2019s basic objective of \u201cequality of employment opportunities\u201d and the elimination of practices that tend to bring about \u201cstratified job environments,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 800, would be achieved were all employment-related discrimination miraculously eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer actions and harm that concern employment and the workplace. Were all such actions and harms eliminated, the antiretaliation provision\u2019s objective would <em>not </em>be achieved. An employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <em>outside </em>the workplace. See, <em>e. g., Rochon, </em>438 F. 3d, at 1213 (Federal Bureau of Investigation retaliation against employee \u201ctook the form of the FBI\u2019s refusal, contrary to policy, to investigate death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>threats a federal prisoner made against [the agent] and his wife\u201d); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Stevinson Chevrolet, </em>74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996) (finding actionable retaliation where employer filed false criminal charges against former employee who complained about discrimination). A provision limited to employment-related actions would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take. Hence, such a limited construction would fail to fully achieve the antiretaliation provision\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose,\u201d namely, \u201cMaintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U. S. 337, 346 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Thus, purpose reinforces what language already indicates, namely, that the antiretaliation provision, unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment. Cf. <em>Wachovia Bank, N. A. </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>546 U. S. 303, 319 (2006) (rejecting statutory construction that would \u201c[t]rea[t] venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <em>in pari materia\u201d </em>because doing so would \u201co ver loo [k] the discrete offices of those concepts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Our precedent does not compel a contrary conclusion. Indeed, we have found no case in this Court that offers petitioner or the United States significant support. <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U. S. 742 (1998), as petitioner notes, speaks of a Title VII requirement that violations involve \u201ctangible employment action\u201d such as \u201chiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 761. But <em>Ellerth </em>does so only to \u201cidentify a class of [hostile work environment] cases\u201d in which an employer should be held vicariously liable (without an affirmative defense) for the acts of supervisors. <em>Id., </em>at 760; see also <em>Pennsylvania State Police </em>v. <em>Suders, </em>542 U. S. 129, 143 (2004) (explaining holdings in <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher </em>v. <em>Boca Raton, </em>524 U. S. 775 (1998), as dividing hostile work environment claims into two categories, one in which the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>is strictly liable because a tangible employment action is taken and one in which the employer can make an affirmative defense). <em>Ellerth </em>did not discuss the scope of the general antidiscrimination provision. See 524 U. S., at 761 (using \u201cconcept of a tangible employment action [that] appears in numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals\u201d only \u201cfor resolution of the vicarious liability issue\u201d). And <em>Ellerth </em>did not mention Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision at all. At most, <em>Ellerth </em>sets forth a standard that petitioner and the Solicitor General believe the antiretaliation provision ought to contain. But it does not compel acceptance of their view.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Nor can we find significant support for their view in the EEOC\u2019s interpretations of the provision. We concede that the EEOC stated in its 1991 and 1988 Compliance Manuals that the antiretaliation provision is limited to \u201cadverse employment-related action.\u201d 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1991) (hereinafter EEOC 1991 Manual); EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 614.1(d), p. 614-5 (1988) (hereinafter EEOC 1988 Manual). But in those same manuals the EEOC lists the \u201c[e]ssential [elements\u201d of a retaliation claim along with language suggesting a broader interpretation. EEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7 614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (complainant must show \u201cthat (s)he was in some manner subjected to adverse treatment by the respondent because of the protest or opposition\u201d); EEOC 1988 Manual \u00a7 614.3(d), pp. 614-8 to 614-9 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Moreover, both before and after publication of the 1991 and 1988 manuals, the EEOC similarly expressed a broad interpretation of the antiretaliation provision. Compare EEOC Interpretive Manual, Reference Manual to Title VII Law for Compliance Personnel \u00a7491.2 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Reference Manual) (\u00a7 704(a) \u201cis intended to provide \u2018exceptionally broad protection\u2019 for protestors of discriminatory employment practices\u201d), with 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 8, p. 8-13 (1998) (hereinafter EEOC 1998 Manual), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>visited June 20, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (\u00a7 704(a) \u201cprohibits] any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity\u201d). And the EEOC 1998 Manual, which offers the Commission\u2019s <em>only </em>direct statement on the question of whether the antiretaliation provision is limited to the same employment-related activity covered by the antidiscrimination provision, answers that question in the negative\u2014directly contrary to petitioner\u2019s reading of the Act. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Finally, we do not accept petitioner\u2019s and the Solicitor General\u2019s view that it is \u201canomalous\u201d to read the statute to provide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for those whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect, namely, victims of race-based, ethnic-based, religion-based, or gender-based discrimination. Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>14-15. Congress has provided similar kinds of protection from retaliation in comparable statutes without any judicial suggestion that those provisions are limited to the conduct prohibited by the primary substantive provisions. The National Labor Relations Act, to which this Court has \u201cdrawn analogies ... in other Title VII contexts,\u201d <em>Hishon </em>v. <em>King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U. S. 69, 76, n. 8 (1984), provides an illustrative example. Compare 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) (substantive provision prohibiting employer \u201cdiscrimination in regard to ... any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization\u201d) with \u00a7 158(a)(4) (retaliation provision making it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdischarge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this subchapter\u201d); see also <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>461 U. S. 731, 740 (1983) (construing antiretaliation provision to \u201cprohibit] a wide variety of employer conduct that is intended to restrain, or that has the likely effect of restraining, employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>in the exercise of protected activities,\u201d including the retaliatory filing of a lawsuit against an employee); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Scrivener, </em>405 U. S. 117, 121-122 (1972) (purpose of the anti-retaliation provision is to ensure that employees are \u201c \u2018completely free from coercion against reporting\u2019\u201d unlawful practices).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In any event, as we have explained, differences in the purpose of the two provisions remove any perceived \u201canomaly,\u201d for they justify this difference of interpretation. See <em>supra, </em>at 63-64. Title VII depends for its enforcement upon the cooperation of employees who are willing to file complaints and act as witnesses. \u201cPlainly, effective enforcement could thus only be expected if employees felt free to approach officials with their grievances.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., </em>361 U. S. 288, 292 (1960). Interpreting the antiretaliation provision to provide broad protection from retaliation helps ensure the cooperation upon which accomplishment of the Act\u2019s primary objective depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that Title VII\u2019s substantive provision and its antiretaliation provision are not coterminous. The scope of the antiretaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm. We therefore reject the standards applied in the Courts of Appeals that have treated the antiretaliation provision as forbidding the same conduct prohibited by the antidiscrimination provision and that have limited actionable retaliation to so-called \u201cultimate employment decisions.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The antiretaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm. As we have explained, the Courts of Appeals have used differing language to describe the level of seriousness to which this harm must rise before it becomes actionable retaliation. We agree with the formulation set forth by the Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, \u201cwhich in this context means it well might have \u2018dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rochon, </em>438 F. 3d, at 1219 (quoting <em>Washington, </em>420 F. 3d, at 662).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We speak of <em>material </em>adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms. Title VII, we have said, does not set forth \u201ca general civility code for the American workplace.\u201d <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em>523 U. S. 75, 80 (1998); see <em>Faragher, </em>524 U. S., at 788 (judicial standards for sexual harassment must \u201cfilter out complaints attacking \u2018the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing\u2019\u201d). An employee\u2019s decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience. See 1 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 669 (3d ed. 1996) (noting that \u201ccourts have held that personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy\u201d and \u201c\u2018snubbing\u2019 by supervisors and co-workers\u201d are not actionable under \u00a7 704(a)). The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with \u201cunfettered access\u201d to Title VII\u2019s remedial mechanisms. <em>Robinson, </em>519 U. S., at 346. It does so by prohibiting employer actions that are likely \u201cto deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC,\u201d the courts, and their employers. <em>Ibid. </em>And normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such deterrence. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a7 8, p. 8-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We refer to reactions of a <em>reasonable </em>employee because we believe that the provision\u2019s standard for judging harm must be objective. An objective standard is judicially administrable. It avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tiff\u2019s unusual subjective feelings. We have emphasized the need for objective standards in other Title VII contexts, and those same concerns animate our decision here. See, <em>e. g., Suders, </em>542 U. S., at 141 (constructive discharge doctrine); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Forklift Systems, Inc., </em>510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (hostile work environment doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We phrase the standard in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters. \u201cThe real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.\u201d <em>Oncale, supra, </em>at 81-82. A schedule change in an employee\u2019s work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school-age children. Cf., <em>e. g., Washington, supra, </em>at 662 (finding flex-time schedule critical to employee with disabled child). A supervisor\u2019s refusal to invite an employee to lunch is normally trivial, a nonactionable petty slight. But to retaliate by excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch that contributes significantly to the employee\u2019s professional advancement might well deter a reasonable employee from complaining about discrimination. See 2 EEOC 1998 Manual \u00a7 8, p. 8-14. Hence, a legal standard that speaks in general terms rather than specific prohibited acts is preferable, for an \u201cact that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.\u201d <em>Washington, supra, </em>at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Finally, we note that contrary to the claim of the concurrence, this standard does <em>not </em>require a reviewing court or jury to consider \u201cthe nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 78 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment). Rather, the standard is tied to the challenged retaliatory act, not the underlying conduct that forms the basis of the Title VII complaint. By focusing on the materiality of the challenged action and the perspective of a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>able person in the plaintiff\u2019s position, we believe this standard will screen out trivial conduct while effectively capturing those acts that are likely to dissuade employees from complaining or assisting in complaints about discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we believe that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jury\u2019s verdict on White\u2019s retaliation claim. See <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U. S. 133, 150-151 (2000). The jury found that two of Burlington\u2019s actions amounted to retaliation: the reassignment of White from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks and the 37-day suspension without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Burlington does not question the jury\u2019s determination that the motivation for these acts was retaliatory. But it does question the statutory significance of the harm these acts caused. The District Court instructed the jury to determine whether respondent \u201csuffered a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of her employment,\u201d App. 63, and the Sixth Circuit upheld the jury\u2019s finding based on that same stringent interpretation of the antiretaliation provision (the interpretation that limits \u00a7704 to the same employment-related conduct forbidden by \u00a7 703). Our holding today makes clear that the jury was not required to find that the challenged actions were related to the terms or conditions of employment. And insofar as the jury also found that the actions were \u201cmaterially adverse,\u201d its findings are adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">First, Burlington argues that a reassignment of duties cannot constitute retaliatory discrimination where, as here, both the former and present duties fall within the same job description. Brief for Petitioner 24-25. We do not see why that is so. Almost every job category involves some responsibilities and duties that are less desirable than others. Common sense suggests that one good way to discourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>an employee such as White from bringing discrimination charges would be to insist that she spend more time performing the more arduous duties and less time performing those that are easier or more agreeable. That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently found \u201c[Retaliatory work assignments\u201d to be a classic and \u201cwidely recognized\u201d example of \u201cforbidden retaliation.\u201d 2 EEOC 1991 Manual \u00a7 614.7, pp. 614-31 to 614-32; see also 1972 Reference Manual \u00a7 495.2 (noting Commission decision involving an employer\u2019s ordering an employee \u201cto do an unpleasant work assignment in retaliation\u201d for filing racial discrimination complaint); Dec. No. 74-77, CCH EEOC Decisions (1983) \u00b6 6417 (1974) (\u201cEmployers have been enjoined\u201d under Title VII \u201cfrom imposing unpleasant work assignments upon an employee for filing charges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">To be sure, reassignment of job duties is not automatically actionable. Whether a particular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and \u201cshould be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position, considering \u2018all the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Oncale, </em>523 U. S., at 81. But. here, the jury had before it considerable evidence that the track laborer duties were \u201cby all accounts more arduous and dirtier\u201d; that the \u201cforklift operator position required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige\u201d; and that \u201cthe forklift operator position was objectively considered a better job and the male employees resented White for occupying it.\u201d 364 F. 3d, at 803 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on this record, a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Second, Burlington argues that the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance because Burlington ultimately reinstated White with backpay. Burlington says that \u201cit defies reason to believe that Congress would have considered a rescinded investigatory suspension with full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>back pay\u201d to be unlawful, particularly because Title VII, throughout much of its history, provided no relief in an equitable action for victims in White\u2019s position. Brief for Petitioner 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We do not find Burlington\u2019s last mentioned reference to the nature of Title VII\u2019s remedies convincing. After all, throughout its history, Title VII has provided for injunctions to \u201cbar like discrimination in the future,\u201d <em>Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted), an important form of relief. Pub. L. 88-352, \u00a7 706(g), 78 Stat. 261, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g). And we have no reason to believe that a court could not have issued an injunction where an employer suspended an employee for retaliatory purposes, even if that employer later provided backpay. In any event, Congress amended Title VII in 1991 to permit victims of intentional discrimination to recover compensatory (as White received here) and punitive damages, concluding that the additional remedies were necessary to \u201c\u2018help make victims whole.\u2019\u201d <em>West </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>527 U. S. 212, 219 (1999) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991)); see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981a(a)(1), (b). We would undermine the significance of that congressional judgment were we to conclude that employers could avoid liability in these circumstances. .</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Neither do we find convincing any claim of insufficient evidence. White did receive backpay. But White and her family had to live for 37 days without income. They did not know during that time whether or when White could return to work. Many reasonable employees would find a month without a paycheck to be a serious hardship. And White described to the jury the physical and emotional hardship that 37 days of having \u201cno income, no money\u201d in fact caused. Brief for Respondent 4, n. 13 (\u201c \u2018That was the worst Christmas I had out of my life. No income, no money, and that made all of us feel bad.... I got very depressed\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, she obtained medical treatment for her emotional distress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>A reasonable employee facing the choice between retaining her job (and paycheck) and filing a discrimination complaint might well choose the former. That is to say, an indefinite suspension without pay could well act as a deterrent, even if the suspended employee eventually received backpay. Cf. <em>Mitchell, </em>361 U. S., at 292 (\u201c[I]t needs no argument to show that fear of economic retaliation might often operate to induce aggrieved employees quietly to accept substandard conditions\u201d). Thus, the jury\u2019s conclusion that the 37-day suspension without pay was materially adverse was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b101-8\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">I concur in the judgment, but I disagree with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the antiretaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 704(a), 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-3(a). The majority\u2019s interpretation has no basis in the statutory language and will, I fear, lead to practical problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Two provisions of Title VII are important here. Section 703(a) prohibits a broad range of discriminatory employment practices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other things, \u00a7 703(a) makes it unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>for an employer <em>\u201cto discriminate against </em>any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">A complementary and closely related provision, \u00a7 704(a), makes it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate against\u201d an employee for retaliatory purposes. Section 704(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to <em>discriminate against </em>any of his employees or applicants for employment... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In this case, we must ascertain the meaning of the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Two possible interpretations are suggested by the language of \u00a7\u00a7 703(a) and 704(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The first is the interpretation that immediately springs to mind if \u00a7 704(a) is read by <em>itself\u2014i. e., </em>that the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d in \u00a7 704(a) means what the term literally means, to treat differently. Respondent staunchly defends this interpretation, which the majority does not embrace, but this interpretation presents problems that are at least sufficient to raise doubts about its correctness. Respondent\u2019s interpretation makes \u00a7 703(a) narrower in scope than \u00a7 704(a) and thus implies that the persons whom Title VII is principally designed to protect\u2014victims of discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, or religion\u2014receive less protection than victims of retaliation. In addition, respondent\u2019s interpretation \u201cmakes a federal case\u201d out of any small difier<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ence in the way an employee who has engaged in protected conduct is treated. On respondent\u2019s view, a retaliation claim must go to the jury if the employee creates a genuine issue on such questions as whether the employee was given any more or less work than others, was subjected to any more or less supervision, or was treated in a somewhat less friendly manner because of his protected activity. There is reason to doubt that Congress meant to burden the federal courts with claims involving relatively trivial differences in treatment. See <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em>523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998); <em>Faragher </em>v. <em>Boca Raton, </em>524 U. S. 775, 786-788 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The other plausible interpretation, and the one I favor, reads \u00a7\u00a7 703(a) and 704(a) together. Under this reading, \u201cdiscrimination]\u201d under \u00a7 704(a) means the discriminatory acts reached by \u00a7 703(a)\u2014chiefly, discrimination \u201cwith respect to ... compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d This is not, admittedly, the most straightforward reading of the bare language of \u00a7 704(a), but it is a reasonable reading that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7 703(a) and 704(a). It also provides an objective standard that permits insignificant claims to be weeded out at the summary judgment stage, while providing ample protection for employees who are subjected to real retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Courts of Appeals that have interpreted \u00a7 704(a) in this way state that it requires a materially adverse employment action. See, <em>e. g., Von Gunten </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>243 F. 3d 858, 865 (CA4 2001); <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F. 3d 571, 587 (CA11 2000), cert. denied, 531 U. S. 1076 (2001); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh, </em>120 F. 3d 1286, 1300 (CA3 1997). In <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U. S. 742, 761-762 (1998), we \u201cimport[ed]\u201d this test for use in a different context\u2014to define the term \u201ctangible employment action,\u201d a concept we used to limit an employer\u2019s liability for harassment carried out by its supervisors. We explained that \u201c[a] tangible employment action constitutes a significant change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The majority does not adopt either of the two interpretations noted above. In Part II-A of its opinion, the majority criticizes the interpretation that harmonizes \u00a7\u00a7 703(a) and 704(a) as not sufficiently faithful to the language of \u00a7 704(a). Although we found the materially adverse employment action test worthy of \u201cimport[ation]\u201d in <em>Ellerth, </em>the majority now argues that this test is too narrow because it permits employers to take retaliatory measures outside the workplace. <em>Ante, </em>at 63-64 (citing <em>Rochon </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>438 F. 3d 1211, 1213 (CADC 2006); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Stevinson Chevrolet, </em>74 F. 3d 980, 984, 986 (CA10 1996)). But the majority\u2019s concern is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">First, an employer who wishes to retaliate against an employee for engaging in protected conduct is much more likely to do so on the job. There are far more opportunities for retaliation in that setting, and many forms of retaliation off the job constitute crimes and are therefore especially risky.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Second, the materially adverse employment action test is not limited to on-the-job retaliation, as <em>Rochon, </em>one of the cases cited by the majority, illustrates. There, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent claimed that the Bureau had retaliated against him by failing to provide the off-duty security that would otherwise have been furnished. See 438 F. 3d, at 1213-1214. But, for an FBI agent whose life may be threatened during off-duty hours, providing security easily qualifies as a term, condition, or privilege of employment. Certainly, if the FBI had a policy of denying protection to agents of a particular race, such discrimination would be actionable under \u00a7 703(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">But in Part II-B, rather than adopting the more literal interpretation based on the language of \u00a7 704(a) alone, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>majority instead puts that language aside and adopts a third interpretation\u2014one that has no grounding in the statutory language. According to the majority, \u00a7 704(a) does not reach all retaliatory differences in treatment but only those retaliatory acts that \u201cwell might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">I see no sound basis for this test. The language of \u00a7 704(a), which employs the unadorned term \u201cdiscriminate,\u201d does not support this test. The unstated premise of the majority\u2019s reasoning seems to be that \u00a7 704(a)\u2019s only purpose is to prevent employers from taking those actions that are likely to stop employees from complaining about discrimination, but this unstated premise is unfounded. While surely <em>one of the purposes </em>of \u00a7 704(a) is to prevent employers from engaging in retaliatory measures that dissuade employees from engaging in protected conduct, there is no reason to suppose that this is \u00a7 704(a)\u2019s only purpose. Indeed, the majority itself identifies another purpose of the antiretaliation provision: \u201cto prevent harm to individuals\u201d who assert their rights. <em>Ante, </em>at 63. Under the majority\u2019s test, however, employer conduct that causes harm to an employee is permitted so long as the employer conduct is not so severe as to dissuade a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The practical consequences of the test that the majority adopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">First, the majority\u2019s test leads logically to perverse results. Under the majority\u2019s test, \u00a7 704(a) reaches retaliation that well might dissuade an employee from making or supporting \u201ca charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted). I take it that the phrase \u201ca charge of discrimination\u201d means the particular charge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the employee in question filed <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and if that is the proper interpretation, the nature of the discrimination that led to the filing of the charge must be taken into account in applying \u00a7 704(a). Specifically, the majority\u2019s interpretation logically implies that the degree of protection afforded to a victim of retaliation is inversely proportional to the severity of the original act of discrimination that prompted the retaliation. A reasonable employee who is subjected to the most severe discrimination will not easily be dissuaded from filing a charge by the threat of retaliation; the costs of filing the charge, including possible retaliation, will have to be great to outweigh the benefits, such as preventing the continuation of the discrimination in the future and obtaining damages and other relief for past discrimination. Because the possibility of relatively severe retaliation will not easily dissuade this employee, the employer will be able to engage in relatively severe retaliation without incurring liability under \u00a7 704(a). On the other hand, an employee who is subjected to a much milder form of discrimination will be much more easily dissuaded. For this employee, the costs of complaining, including possible retaliation, will not have to be great to outweigh the lesser benefits that might be obtained by filing a charge. These topsy-turvy results make no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Second, the majority\u2019s conception of a reasonable worker is unclear. Although the majority first states that its test is whether a \u201creasonable worker\u201d might well be dissuaded, <em>ante, </em>at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted), it later sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>gests that at least some individual characteristics of the actual retaliation victim must be taken into account. The majority comments that \u201cthe significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances,\u201d and provides the following illustration: \u201cA schedule change in an employee\u2019s work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school-age children.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">This illustration suggests that the majority\u2019s test is not whether an act of retaliation well might dissuade the average reasonable worker, putting aside all individual characteristics, but, rather, whether the act well might dissuade a reasonable worker who shares at least some individual characteristics with the actual victim. The majority\u2019s illustration introduces three individual characteristics: age, gender, and family responsibilities. How many more individual characteristics a court or jury may or must consider is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s interpretation contains a loose and unfamiliar causation standard. As noted, the majority\u2019s test asks whether an employer\u2019s retaliatory act <em>\u201cwell might have dissuaded </em>a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Especially in an area of the law in which standards of causation are already complex, the introduction of this new and unclear standard is unwelcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">For these reasons, I would not adopt the majority\u2019s test but would hold that \u00a7 704(a) reaches only those discriminatory practices covered by \u00a7 703(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Applying this interpretation, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. The actions taken against respondent\u2014her assignment to new and substantially less desirable duties and her suspension without pay\u2014fall within the definition of an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>With respect to respondent\u2019s reassignment, <em>Ellerth </em>specifically identified a \u201creassignment with significantly different responsibilities\u201d as a \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d 524 U. S., at 761. Here, as the Court of Appeals stated, \u201c[i]n essence, . . . the reassignment was a demotion.\u201d 364 F. 3d 789, 803 (CA6 2004). The \u201cnew position was by all accounts more arduous and \u2018dirtier,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid., </em>and petitioner\u2019s sole stated rationale for the reassignment was that respondent\u2019s prior duties were better suited for someone with greater seniority. This was virtually an admission that respondent was demoted when those responsibilities were taken away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">I would hold that respondent\u2019s suspension without pay likewise satisfied the materially adverse employment action test. Accordingly, although I would hold that a plaintiff asserting a \u00a7 704(a) retaliation claim must show the same type of materially adverse employment action that is required for a \u00a7 703(a) discrimination claim, I would hold that respondent met that standard in this case, and I, therefore, concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\"> Section 703(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">\u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or <em>otherwise to discriminate against </em>any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-15\">\u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e-2(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\"> The alternative interpretation\u2014that \u201ca charge\u201d does not mean the specific charge filed by the employee but an average or generic charge\u2014would be unworkable. Without gauging the severity of the initial alleged discrimination, a jury cannot possibly compare the costs and benefits of filing a charge and, thus, cannot possibly decide whether the employer\u2019s alleged retaliatory conduct is severe enough to dissuade the filing of a charge. A jury will have no way of assessing the severity of the average alleged act of discrimination that leads to the filing of a charge, and, therefore, if \u201ca charge\u201d means an average or generic charge, the majority\u2019s test will leave juries hopelessly at sea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
