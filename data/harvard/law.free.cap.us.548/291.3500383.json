Ill Stat. 92, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). We granted certiorari to decide whether this fee-shifting provision authorizes prevailing parents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>recover fees for services rendered by experts in IDEA actions. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Respondents Pearl and Theodore Murphy filed an action under the IDEA on behalf of their son, Joseph Murphy, seeking to require petitioner Arlington Central School District Board of Education to pay for their son\u2019s private school tuition for specified school years. Respondents prevailed in the District Court, 86 F. Supp. 2d 354 (SDNY 2000), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 297 F. 3d 195 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">As prevailing parents, respondents then sought $29,350 in fees for the services of an educational consultant, Marilyn Arons, who assisted respondents throughout the IDEA proceedings. The District Court granted respondents\u2019 request in part. It held that only the value of Arons\u2019 time spent between the hearing request and the ruling in respondents\u2019 favor could properly be considered charges incurred in an \u201caction or proceeding brought\u201d under the Act, see 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). 2003 WL 21694398, *9 (SDNY, July 22, 2003). This reduced the maximum recovery to $8,650. The District Court also held that Arons, a nonlawyer, could be compensated only for time spent on expert consulting services, not for time spent on legal representation, <em>id., </em>at *4, but it concluded that all the relevant time could be characterized as falling within the compensable category, and thus allowed compensation for the full $8,650, <em>id., </em>at *10.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 402 F. 3d 332 (2005). Acknowledging that other Circuits had taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that \u201cCongress intended to and did authorize the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA actions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336. The court began by discussing two decisions of this Court holding that expert fees could not be recovered as taxed costs under particular cost- or fee-shifting provisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>See <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>J. T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920); <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1988 ed.)). According to these decisions, the court noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read to permit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without \u201c \u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019 indicating that Congress intended for that sort of fee-shifting.\u201d 402 F. 3d, at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by a statement in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) and by a footnote in <em>Casey </em>that made reference to that Report. 402 F. 3d, at 336-337 (citing H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, p. 5 (1986)). Based on these authorities, the court concluded that it was required to interpret the IDEA to authorize the award of the costs that prevailing parents incur in hiring experts. 402 F. 3d, at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. 1085 (2006), to resolve the conflict among the Circuits with respect to whether Congress authorized the compensation of expert fees to prevailing parents in IDEA actions. Compare <em>Goldring </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>416 F. 3d 70, 73-77 (CADC 2005); <em>Neosho R-V School Dist. </em>v. <em>Clark ex rel. Clark, </em>315 F. 3d 1022, 1031-1033 (CA8 2003); <em>T. D. </em>v. <em>LaGrange School Dist. No. 102, </em>349 F. 3d 469, 480-482 (CA7 2003), with 402 F. 3d 332 (CA2 2005). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Our resolution of the question presented in this case is guided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; see <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast, </em>546 U. S. 49 (2005). Like its statutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to assist state and local agencies in educating children with disabilities \u201cand conditions such funding upon a State\u2019s compliance with extensive goals and procedures.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U. S. 176, 179 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States, see, <em>e. g., South Dakota </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>488 U. S. 203, 206-207 (1987), but when Congress attaches conditions to a State\u2019s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must be set out \u201cunambiguously,\u201d see <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); <em>Rowley, supra, </em>at 204, n. 26. \u201c[LJegislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract,\u201d and therefore, to be bound by \u201cfederally imposed conditions,\u201d recipients of federal funds must accept them \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly.\u201d <em>Pennhurst, </em>451 U. S., at 17. States cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are \u201cunaware\u201d or which they are \u201cunable to ascertain.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, in the present case, we must view the IDEA from the perspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept IDEA funds and the obligations that go with those funds. We must ask whether such a state official would clearly understand that one of the obligations of the Act is the obligation to compensate prevailing parents for expert fees. In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In considering whether the IDEA provides clear notice, we begin with the text. We have \u201cstated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u201d <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992). When the statutory \u201clanguage is plain, the sole function of the courts\u2014at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Planters Bank, N. A., </em>530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989), in turn quoting <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>242 U. S. 470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The governing provision of the IDEA, 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to the parents of \u201ca child with a disability\u201d who is the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d While this provision provides for an award of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d this provision does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for services rendered by experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Respondents contend that we should interpret the term \u201ccosts\u201d in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage and that \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to \u201cauthorize reimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA proceedings, including expert costs.\u201d Brief for Respondents 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">This argument has multiple flaws. For one thing, as the Court of Appeals in this case acknowledged, \u201c\u2018costs\u2019 is a term of art that generally does not include expert fees.\u201d 402 F. 3d, at 336. The use of this term of art, rather than a term such as \u201cexpenses,\u201d strongly suggests that \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provision that makes participating States liable for all expenses incurred by prevailing parents in connection with an IDEA case\u2014for example, travel and lodging expenses or lost wages due to time taken off from work. Moreover, contrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion, \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) does not say that a court may award \u201ccosts\u201d to prevailing parents; rather, it says that a court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the costs\u201d to prevailing parents. This language simply adds reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that prevailing parents are otherwise entitled to recover. This list of otherwise recoverable costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>is obviously the list set out in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920, the general statute governing the taxation of costs in federal court, and the recovery of witness fees under \u00a7 1920 is strictly limited by \u00a7 1821, which authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40 per diem. Thus, the text of 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize an award of any additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to provide the clear notice that is required under the Spending Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in the same direction. While authorizing the award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that are designed to ensure that such awards are indeed reasonable. See \u00a7\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(C)-(G). The absence of any comparable provisions relating to expert fees strongly suggests that recovery of expert fees is not authorized. Moreover, the lack of any reference to expert fees in \u00a7 1415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference. This provision, which generally requires that parents receive \u201ca full explanation of the procedural safeguards\u201d available under \u00a71415 and refers expressly to \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d makes no mention of expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Respondents contend that their interpretation of \u00a7 1415(i) (3)(B) is supported by a provision of the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 that required the General Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data, \u00a7 4(b)(3), 100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision), but this provision is of little significance for present purposes. The GAO study provision directed the Comptroller General, acting through the GAO, to compile data on, among other things: \u201c(A) the specific amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party\u201d in IDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) \u201cthe number of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys and consultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and expenses incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>by the parents and the State educational agency and local educational agency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 797-798.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Subparagraph (A) would provide some support for respondents\u2019 position if it directed the GAO to compile data on awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring consultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says. Subparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or experts or their fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help respondents. Subparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study \u201cthe number of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel, including . . . consultants,\u201d says nothing about the award of fees to such consultants. Just because Congress directed the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by consultants in IDEA cases, it does not follow that Congress meant for States to compensate prevailing parties for the fees billed by these consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Respondents maintain that \u201cCongress\u2019 direction to the GAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate that the expenses for \u2018consultants\u2019 would be recoverable,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Brief for Respondents 19, but this is incorrect. There are many reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO to gather data on expenses that were not to be taxed as costs. Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might be useful in considering future procedural amendments (which might affect these costs) or a future amendment regarding fee shifting. And, in fact, it is apparent that the GAO study provision covered expenses that could not be taxed as costs. For example, the GAO was instructed to compile statistics on the hours spent by all attorneys involved in an IDEA action or proceeding, even though the Act did not provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a prevailing state or local educational agency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, the GAO was directed to compile data on \u201cexpenses incurred by the parents,\u201d not just those parents who prevail and are thus eligible to recover taxed costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly support the conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the costs of experts or consultants. Certainly the terms of the IDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed to attach such a condition to a State\u2019s receipt of IDEA funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Thus far, we have considered only the text of the IDEA, but perhaps the strongest support for our interpretation of the IDEA is supplied by our decisions and reasoning in <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>482 U. S. 437, and <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S. 83. In light of those decisions, we do not see how it can be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>that the IDEA gives a State unambiguous notice regarding liability for expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>the Court rejected an argument very similar to respondents\u2019 argument that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an open-ended reference to prevailing parents\u2019 expenses. It was argued in <em>Crawford Fitting </em>that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), which provides for the award of \u201ccosts\u201d to a prevailing party, authorizes the award of costs not listed in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1821. 482 U. S., at 439. The Court held, however, that Rule 54(d) does not give a district judge \u201cdiscretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate\u201d; rather, the term \u201ccosts\u201d in Rule 54(d) is defined by the list set out in \u00a7 1920. <em>Id., </em>at 441. Because the recovery of witness fees, see \u00a7 1920(3), is strictly limited by \u00a7 1821, the Court observed, a broader interpretation of Rule 54(d) would mean that the Rule implicitly effected a partial repeal of those provisions. <em>Id., </em>at 442. But, the Court warned, \u201c[w]e will not lightly infer that Congress has repealed \u00a7\u00a7 1920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or any other provision not referring explicitly to witness fees.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The reasoning of <em>Crawford Fitting </em>strongly supports the conclusion that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recognized in <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>that no statute will be construed as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as costs unless the statute \u201crefer[s] explicitly to witness fees.\u201d 482 U. S., at 445; see also <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[Ajbsent explicit statutory or contractual authorization for the taxation of the expenses of a litigant\u2019s witness as costs, federal courts are bound by the limitations set out in 28 U.S. C. \u00a71821 and \u00a71920\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Our decision in <em>Casey </em>confirms even more dramatically that the IDEA does not authorize an award of expert fees. In <em>Casey, </em>as noted above, we interpreted a fee-shifting pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>vision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988, the relevant wording of which was virtually identical to the wording of 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). Compare <em>ibid, </em>(authorizing the award of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to prevailing parents) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1988 ed.) (permitting prevailing parties in certain civil rights actions to be awarded \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d). We held that \u00a7 1988 did not empower a district court to award expert fees to a prevailing party. <em>Casey, supra, </em>at 102. To decide in favor of respondents here, we would have to interpret the virtually identical language in 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415 as having exactly the opposite meaning. Indeed, we would have to go further and hold that the relevant language in the IDEA <em>unambiguously means </em>exactly the opposite of what the nearly identical language in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 was held to mean in <em>Casey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was heavily influenced by a <em>Casey </em>footnote, see 402 F. 3d, at 336-337 (quoting 499 U. S., at 91-92, n. 5), but the court misunderstood the footnote\u2019s meaning. The text accompanying the footnote argued, based on an analysis of several fee-shifting statutes, that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d does not include expert fees. <em>Id., </em>at 88-91. In the footnote, we commented on petitioners\u2019 invocation of the Conference Committee Report relating to 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), which stated: \u201c \u2018The conferees intendfed] that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the . . . case.\u2019\u201d 499 U. S., at 91-92, n. 5 (quoting H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, at 5; ellipsis in original). This statement, the footnote commented, was \u201can apparent effort to <em>depart </em>from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art.\u201d 499 U. S., at 92, n. 5. The footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set out the correct interpretation of \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), much less that the Report was sufficient, despite the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>guage of the statute, to provide the clear notice required under the Spending Clause. The thrust of the footnote was simply that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d standing alone, is generally not understood as encompassing expert fees. Thus, <em>Crawford Fitting </em>and <em>Casey </em>strongly reinforce the conclusion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Respondents make several arguments that are not based on the text of the IDEA, but these arguments do not show that the IDEA provides clear notice regarding the award of expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Respondents argue that their interpretation of the IDEA furthers the Act\u2019s overarching goal of \u201censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A), as well as the goal of \u201csafeguard[ing] the rights of parents to challenge school decisions that adversely affect their child.\u201d Brief for Respondents 20. These goals, however, are too general to provide much support for respondents\u2019 reading of the terms of the IDEA. The IDEA obviously does not seek to promote these goals at the expense of all other considerations, including fiscal considerations. Because the IDEA is not intended in all instances to further the broad goals identified by respondents at the expense of fiscal considerations, the goals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argument on the narrow question presented here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Finally, respondents vigorously argue that Congress clearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated for expert fees. They rely on the legislative history of \u00a7 1415 and in particular on the following statement in the Conference Committee Report, discussed above: \u201cThe conferees intend that the term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019 include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the . . . case.\u201d H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Whatever weight this legislative history would merit in another context, it is not sufficient here. Putting the legislative history aside, we see virtually no support for respondents\u2019 position. Under these circumstances, where everything other than the legislative history overwhelmingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered, the legislative history is simply not enough. In a Spending Clause case, the key is not what a majority of the Members of both Houses intend but what the States are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of those funds. Here, in the face of the unambiguous text of the IDEA and the reasoning in <em>Crawford Fitting </em>and <em>Casey, </em>we cannot say that the legislative history on which respondents rely is sufficient to provide the requisite fair notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> Because subparagraph (A) refers to both \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d awarded to prevailing parties and because it is generally presumed that statutory language is not superfluous, it could be argued that this provision manifests the expectation that prevailing parties would be awarded certain \u201cexpenses\u201d not included in the list of \u201ccosts\u201d set out in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920 and that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumerated \u201cexpenses.\u201d This argument fails because, whatever expectation this language might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes the award of any \u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts.\u201d Recognizing this, respondents argue not that they are entitled to recover \u201cexpenses\u201d that are not \u201ccosts,\u201d but that expert fees <em>are </em>recoverable \u201ccosts.\u201d As a result, the reference to awards of both \u201cexpenses\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d does not support respondents\u2019 position. The reference to \u201cexpenses\u201d may relate to IDEA actions brought in state court, \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), where \u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts\u201d might be receivable. Or the reference may be surplusage. While it is generally presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage, instances of surplusage are not unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> In 2000, the attorney\u2019s fees provision provided only an award to prevailing parents.

The Court extracts from <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>tal </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981), a \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement, and deems it applicable in this case because Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as it did the legislation at issue in <em>Pennhurst, </em>pursuant to the Spending Clause. <em>Ante, </em>at 296. That extraction, in my judgment, is unwarranted. <em>Pennhursts </em>\u201cclear notice\u201d requirement should not be unmoored from its context. The Court there confronted a plea to impose \u201can unexpected condition for compliance\u2014a new [programmatic] obligation for participating States.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>461 U. S. 773, 790, n. 17 (1983). The controversy here is lower key: It concerns not the educational programs IDEA directs school districts to provide, but \u201cthe remedies available against a noncomplying [district].\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>post, </em>at 316-318 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The Court\u2019s repeated references to a Spending Clause derived \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement, see <em>ante, </em>at 295-296, 298, 300, 303, and n. 3, are questionable on other grounds as well. For one thing, IDEA was enacted not only pursuant to Congress\u2019 Spending Clause authority, but also pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>468 U. S. 992, 1009 (1984) (IDEA\u2019S predecessor, the Education of the Handicapped Act, was \u201cset up by Congress to aid the States in complying with their constitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped children.\u201d). Furthermore, no \u201cclear notice\u201d prop is needed in this case given the twin pillars on which the Court\u2019s judgment securely rests. First, as the Court explains, <em>ante, </em>at 297-298, the specific, attorneys\u2019-fees-oriented, provisions of IDEA, <em>i. e., </em>20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)-(G); \u00a7 1415(d)(2)(L) (2000 ed., Supp. V), \u201coverwhelmingly support the conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the costs of experts or consultants,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 300. Those provisions place controls on fees recoverable for attorneys\u2019 services, without mentioning costs parents might incur for other professional services and controls geared to those costs. Second, as the Court develops, prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>decisions closely in point \u201cstrongly suppor[t],\u201d even \u201cconfir[m] ... dramatically,\u201d today\u2019s holding that IDEA trains on attorneys\u2019 fees and does not authorize an award covering amounts paid or payable for the services of an educational consultant. <em>Ante, </em>at 301 (citing <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>J. T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U. S. 437 (1987), and <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S. 83 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">For the contrary conclusion, Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent relies dominantly on a Conference Report stating the conferees\u2019 view that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d includes \u201cexpenses and fees of expert witnesses\u201d and payments for tests necessary for the preparation of a case. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, p. 5 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Including costs of consultants and tests in \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) would make good sense in light of IDEA\u2019S overarching goal, <em>i. e., </em>to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to children with disabilities, \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A). See <em>post, </em>at 313-316 (Breyer, J., dissenting). But Congress did not compose \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)\u2019s text,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as it did the texts of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>statutes too numerous and varied to ignore, to alter the common import of the terms \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d in the context of expense-allocation legislation. See, <em>e. g., </em>42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988(c) (added, in 19'91 specifically to \u201cinclude expert fees as part of the attorney\u2019s fee\u201d); <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S., at 88-92, and n. 4 (citing variously composed <em>statutes </em>that \u201cexplicitly shift expert. . . fees <em>as well as </em>attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). Given the constant meaning of the formulation \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d in federal legislation, we are not at liberty to rewrite \u201cthe statutory text adopted by both Houses of Congress and submitted to the President,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 98, to add several words Congress wisely might have included. The ball, I conclude, is properly left in Congress\u2019 court to provide, if it so elects, for consultant fees and testing expenses beyond those IDEA and its implementing regulations already authorize,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> along with any specifications, conditions, or limitations geared to those fees and expenses Congress may deem appropriate. Cf. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)-(G); \u00a7 1415(d)(2)(L) (listing only attorneys\u2019 fees, not expert or consulting fees, among the procedural safeguards about which school districts must inform parents).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In sum, although I disagree with the Court\u2019s rationale to the extent that it invokes a \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement tied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>to the Spending Clause, I agree with the Court\u2019s discussion of IDEA\u2019S terms, <em>ante, </em>at 296-298, and of our decisions in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Casey, ante, </em>at 300-303. Accordingly, I concur in part in the Court\u2019s opinion, and join the Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\"> The relevant statement from the Conference Report reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">\u201cThe conferees intend that the term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs' include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding, as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating a case.\u201d H.

In <em>Smith, </em>the Court held that, under the statute as then designed, prevailing parents were not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. See 132 Cong. Rec. 16823 (1986) (remarks of Sen.

Beyond that, I emphasize the importance for me of \u00a74 of the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986,100 Stat. 797, note following 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415 (1988 ed.), which mandated the study by what is now known as the Government Accountability Office.

Unlike the Court, I believe that the word \u201ccosts\u201d includes, and authorizes payment of, the costs of experts. The word \u201ccosts\u201d does not define its own scope. Neither does the phrase \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of costs.\u201d But Members of Congress did make clear their intent by, among other things, approving a Conference Report that specified that \u201cthe term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019 include[s] reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>guardian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding.\u201d H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, p. 5 (1986), Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>at 326. No Senator or Representative voiced <em>any </em>opposition to this statement in the discussion preceding the vote on the Conference Report\u2014the last vote on the bill before it was sent to the President. I can find no good reason for this Court to interpret the language of this statute as meaning the precise opposite of what Congress told us it intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">There are two strong reasons for interpreting the statutory phrase to include the award of expert fees. First, that is what Congress said it intended by the phrase. Second, that interpretation furthers the IDEA\u2019S statutorily defined purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Congress added the IDEA\u2019S cost-shifting provision when it enacted the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 (HCPA), 100 Stat. 796. Senator Lowell Weicker introduced the relevant bill in 1985. 131 Cong. Rec. 1979-1980 (1985). As introduced, it sought to overturn this Court\u2019s determination that the then-current version of the IDEA (and other civil rights statutes) did not authorize courts to award attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parents in IDEA cases. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>468 U. S. 992 (1984). The bill provided that \u201c \u2018[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion, may award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs to a parent or legal representative of a handicapped child or youth who is the prevailing party.\u2019\u201d 131 Cong. Rec. 1980; see S. Rep. No. 99-112, p. 2 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">After hearings and debate, several Senators introduced a new bill in the Senate that would have put a cap on attorney\u2019s fees for legal services lawyers, but at the same time would have explicitly authorized the award of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, reasonable witness fees, and <em>other reasonable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>expenses of the civil action, </em>in addition to the costs to a parent . . . who is the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7 (some emphasis deleted). While no Senator objected to the latter provision, some objected to the cap. See, <em>e. g., id., </em>at 17-18 (additional views of Sens. Kerry, Kennedy, Pell, Dodd, Simon, Metzenbaum, and Matsunaga) (accepting cost-shifting provision, but objecting to cap and other aspects of the bill). A bipartisan group of Senators, led by Senators Hatch and Weicker, proposed an alternative bill that authorized courts to award \u201c \u2018a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in addition to the costs to a parent\u2019 \u201d who prevailed. <em>Id., </em>at 15-16 (additional views of Sens. Hatch, Weicker, Stafford, Dole, Pell, Matsunaga, Simon, Kerry, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, Dodd, and Grassley); 131 Cong. Rec. 21389.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Senator Weicker explained that the bill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cwill enable courts to compensate parents for <em>whatever reasonable costs they had to incur to fully secure what was guaranteed to them by the [Education of the Handicapped Act], </em>As in other fee shifting statutes, it is our intent that such awards will include, at the discretion of the court, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, <em>necessary expert witness fees, and other reasonable expenses which were necessary for parents to vindicate their claim to a free appropriate public education for their handicapped child.'\u201d Id., </em>at 21390 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Not a word of opposition to this statement (or the provision) was voiced on the Senate floor, and S. 415 passed without a recorded vote. <em>Id., </em>at 21393.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The House version of the bill also reflected an intention to authorize recovery of expert costs. Following the House hearings, the Committee on Education and Labor produced a substitute bill that authorized courts to \u201c \u2018award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>expenses, and costs\u2019 \u201d </em>to prevailing parents. H. R. Rep. No. 99-296, pp. 1, 5 (1985) (emphasis added). The House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201cThe phrase \u2018expenses and costs\u2019 includes <em>expenses of expert witnesses; the reasonable costs of any study, report, test, or project which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s due process hearing, state administrative review or civil action; </em>as well as traditional costs and expenses incurred in the course of litigating a case <em>(e. g., </em>depositions and interrogatories).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 6 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">No one objected to this statement. By the time H. R. 1523 reached the floor, another substitute bill was introduced. 131 Cong. Rec. 31369 (1985). This new bill did not change in any respect the text of the authorization of expenses and costs. It did add a provision, however, that directed the General Accounting Office (GAO)\u2014now known as the Government Accountability Office, see note following 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 731 (2000 ed., Supp. IV)\u2014to study and report to Congress on the fiscal impact of the cost-shifting provision. See 131 Cong. Rec. 31369-31370. The newly substituted bill passed the House without a recorded vote. <em>Id., </em>at 31377.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Members of the House and Senate (including all of the primary sponsors of the HCPA) then met in conference to work out certain differences. At the conclusion of those negotiations, they produced a Conference Report, which contained the text of the agreed-upon bill and a \u201cJoint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference.\u201d See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-687, at 5, Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>at 325. The Conference accepted the House bill\u2019s GAO provision with \u201can amendment expanding the data collection requirements of the GAO study to include information regarding the amount of funds expended by local educational agencies and state educational agencies on civil actions and administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7, Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>at 327-328. And it accepted (with minor changes) the cost-shifting provisions provided in both the Senate and House versions. The conferees explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cWith slightly different wording, both the Senate bill and the House amendment provide for the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cThe Senate recedes to the House and the House recedes to the Senate with an amendment clarifying that \u2018the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs . . . \u2019 This change in wording incorporates the Supreme Courtfs] <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Chesnyi, </em>473 U. S. 1 (1985),] decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\"><em>\u201cThe conferees intend that the term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019 include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding, as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating a case.\u201d Id., </em>at 5, Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>at 326 (emphasis added; citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Conference Report was returned to the Senate and the House. A motion was put to each to adopt the Conference Report, and both the Senate and the House agreed to the Conference Report by voice votes. See Appendix B, <em>infra, </em>at 329 (Senate); Appendix C, <em>infra, </em>at 330 (House). No objection was raised to the Conference Report\u2019s statement that the cost-shifting provision was intended to authorize expert costs. I concede that \u201csponsors of the legislation did not mention anything on the floor about expert or consultant fees\u201d at the time the Conference Report was submitted. <em>Ante, </em>at 306, n. 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But I do not believe that silence is significant in light of the fact that <em>every </em>Senator and <em>three of the five </em>Representatives who spoke on the floor had previously <em>signed his name </em>to the Conference Report\u2014a Report that made Congress\u2019 intent clear on the first page of its explanation. See Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>at 325. And every Senator and Representative who took the floor preceding the votes voiced his strong support for the Conference Report. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>132 Cong. Rec. 16823-16825 (1986) (Senate); <em>id., </em>at 17607-17612 (House). The upshot is that Members of both Houses of Congress voted to adopt both the statutory text before us and the Conference Report that made clear that the statute\u2019s words include the expert costs here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The Act\u2019s basic purpose further supports interpreting the provision\u2019s language to include expert costs. The IDEA guarantees a \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d public education for \u201call\u201d children with disabilities. 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V); see also \u00a71401(9)(A) (defining \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d as one \u201cprovided at public expense,\u201d \u201cwithout charge\u201d); \u00a71401(29) (defining \u201cspecial education\u201d as \u201cspecially designed instruction, at <em>no cost </em>to parents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Parents have every right to become involved in the Act\u2019s efforts to provide that education; indeed, the Act encourages their participation. \u00a7 1400(c)(5)(B) (IDEA \u201censur[es] that families of [disabled] children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school\u201d). It assures parents that they may question a school district\u2019s decisions about what is \u201cappropriate\u201d for their child. And in doing so, they may secure the help of experts. \u00a7 1415(h)(1) (parents have \u201cthe right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities\u201d); see generally <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast, </em>546 U. S. 49, 53-54 (2005) (detailing Act\u2019s procedures); <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U. S. 176, 205-206 (1982) (emphasizing importance of Act\u2019s procedural guarantees).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The practical significance of the Act\u2019s participatory rights and procedural protections may be seriously diminished if parents are unable to obtain reimbursement for the costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>their experts. In IDEA cases, experts are necessary. See Kuriloff &amp; Goldberg, Is Mediation a Fair Way to Resolve Special Education Disputes? First Empirical Findings, 2 Harv. Negotiation L.

Prob. 89, 100-101, 109 (1985) (same); see also Brief for National Disability Rights Network et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>6-15 (collecting sources); cf. <em>Schaffer, supra, </em>at 66-67 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledge about the educational resources available to their child and the sophistication to mount an effective case against a district-proposed\u201d individualized education program (IEP) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Experts are also expensive. See Brief for Respondents 28, n. 17 (collecting District Court decisions awarding expert costs ranging from $200 to $7,600, and noting three reported cases in which expert awards exceeded $10,000). The costs of experts may not make much of a dent in a school district\u2019s budget, as many of the experts they use in IDEA proceedings are already on the staff. Cf. <em>Oberti </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. Clementon School Dist., </em>995 F. 2d 1204, 1219 (CA3 1993). But to parents, the award of costs may matter enormously. Without potential reimbursement, parents may well lack the services of experts entirely. See Dept. of Education, M. Wagner et al., The Individual and Household Characteristics of Youth With Disabilities: A Report from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2), p. 3-10 (Aug. 2003) (prepared by SRI International), online at http://www. nlts2.org/reports/2003_08/nlts2_report_2003_08_complete.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 23, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (finding that 25% of disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>children live in poverty and 65% live in households with incomes less than $50,000); see Dept, of Education, M.

That is why this Court has previously avoided interpretations that would bring about this kind of result. See <em>School Comm. of Burlington </em>v. <em>Department of Ed. of Mass., </em>471 U. S. 359 (1985) (construing IDEA provision granting equitable authority to courts to include the power to order reimbursement for parents who switch their child to private schools if that decision later proves correct); <em>id., </em>at 370 (without cost reimbursement for prevailing parents, \u201cthe child\u2019s right to a <em>free </em>appropriate public education, the parents\u2019 right to participate fully in developing a proper IEP, and all of the procedural safeguards would be less than complete\u201d); <em>Florence County School Dist. Four </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>510 U. S. 7, 13 (1993) (holding that prevailing parents are not barred from reimbursement for switching their child to a private school that does not meet the IDEA\u2019S definition of a free and appropriate education). In <em>Carter, </em>we explained: \u201cIDEA was intended to ensure that children with disabilities receive an education that is both appropriate and free. To read the provisions of \u00a7 1401(a)(18) to bar reimbursement in the circumstances of this case would defeat this statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13-14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">To read the word \u201ccosts\u201d as requiring successful parents to bear their own expenses for experts suffers from the same problem. Today\u2019s result will leave many parents and guardians \u201cwithout an expert with the firepower to match the op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>position,\u201d <em>Schaffer, </em>546 U. S., at 61, a far cry from the level playing field that Congress envisioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The majority makes essentially three arguments against this interpretation. It says that the statute\u2019s purpose and \u201clegislative history is simply not enough\u201d to overcome: (1) the fact that this is a Spending Clause case; (2) the text of the statute; and (3) our prior cases which hold that the term \u201ccosts\u201d does not include expert costs. <em>Ante, </em>at 304. I do not find these arguments convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">At the outset the majority says that it \u201cis guided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 295. \u201cIn a Spending Clause case,\u201d the majority adds, \u201cthe key is not what a majority of the Members of both Houses intend but what the States are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of those funds.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 304. Thus, the statute\u2019s \u201cconditions must be set out \u2018unambiguously.\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 296 (citing <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981), and <em>Rowley, </em>458 U. S., at 204, n. 26). And \u201cwe must ask\u201d whether the statute \u201cfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">I agree that the statute on its face does not <em>clearly </em>tell the States that they must pay expert fees to prevailing parents. But I do not agree that the majority has posed the right question. For one thing, we have repeatedly examined the nature and extent of the financial burdens that the IDEA imposes without reference to the Spending Clause or any \u201cclear-statement rule.\u201d See, <em>e. g., Burlington, supra, </em>at 369 (private school fees); <em>Carter, supra, </em>at 13 (same); <em>Smith, </em>468 U. S., at 1010-1011 (attorney\u2019s fees); <em>Cedar Rapids Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Garret F., </em>526 U. S. 66, 76-79 (1999) (continuous nursing service); but see <em>id., </em>at 83 (Thomas, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>joined by Kennedy, J., dissenting). Those cases did not ask whether the statute \u201cfurnishes clear notice\u201d to the affirmative obligation or liability at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">For another thing, neither <em>Pennhurst </em>nor any other case suggests that <em>every spending detail </em>of a Spending Clause statute must be spelled out with unusual clarity. To the contrary, we have held that Pennhurst\u2019s requirement that Congress \u201cunambiguously\u201d set out \u201ca condition on the grant of federal money\u201d does <em>not </em>necessarily apply to legislation setting forth <em>\u201cthe remedies available against a noncomplying State.\u201d Bell </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>461 U. S. 773, 790, n. 17 (1983) (emphasis added) (rejecting Pennhurst-based argument that Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 did not unambiguously provide that the Secretary could recover federal funds that are misused by a State). We have added that <em>Pennhurst </em>does not require Congress \u201cspecifically\u201d to \u201cidentify\u201d and \u201cproscribe <em>each </em>condition in [Spending Clause] legislation.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed., </em>544 U. S. 167, 183 (2005) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (rejecting argument that <em>Pennhurst </em>precluded interpreting Title IX\u2019s private cause of action to encompass retaliation); see also <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Kentucky Dept. of Ed., </em>470 U. S. 656, 665-666 (1985). And we have denied any implication that \u201csuits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to <em>all </em>issues that they raise.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>536 U. S. 181, 188-189, n. 2 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">These statements and holdings are not surprising. After all, the basic objective of Pennhurst\u2019s clear-statement requirement does not demand textual clarity in respect to every detail. That is because ambiguity about the precise nature of a statutory program\u2019s details\u2014particularly where they are of a kind that States might have anticipated\u2014is rarely relevant to the basic question: Would the States have accepted the Federal Government\u2019s funds <em>had they only known </em>the nature of the accompanying conditions? Often, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the later filling-in of details through judicial interpretation will not lead one to wonder whether funding recipients would have agreed to enter the basic program at all. Given the nature of such details, it is clear that the States would have entered the program regardless. At the same time, to view each statutory detail of a highly complex federal/state program (involving, say, transportation, schools, the environment) simply through the lens of linguistic clarity, rather than to assess its meanings in terms of basic legislative purpose, is to risk a set of judicial interpretations that can prevent the program, overall, from achieving its basic objectives or that might well reduce a program in its details to incoherence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">This case is about just such a detail. Permitting parents to recover expert fees will not lead to awards of \u201cindeterminate magnitude, untethered to compensable harm\u201d and consequently will not \u201cpose a concern that recipients of federal funding could not reasonably have anticipated.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>536 U. S., at 190-191 (SOUTER, J., joined by O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike, say, punitive damages, an award of costs to expert parties is neither \u201cunorthodox\u201d nor \u201cindeterminate,\u201d and thus does not throw into doubt whether the States would have entered into the program. <em>Id., </em>at 188. If determinations as to whether the IDEA requires States to provide continuing nursing services, <em>Cedar Rapids, supra, </em>or reimbursement for private school tuition, <em>Burlington, </em>471 U. S. 359, do not call for linguistic clarity, then the precise content of recoverable \u201ccosts\u201d does not call for such clarity here <em>a fortiori.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">If the Court believes that the statute\u2019s language is unambiguous, I must disagree. The provision at issue says that a court \u201cmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to parents who prevail in an action brought under the Act. 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). The statute neither defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the word \u201ccosts\u201d nor points to any other source of law for a definition. And the word \u201ccosts,\u201d alone, says nothing at all about which costs fall within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Neither does the statutory phrase\u2014\u201cas part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party\u201d\u2014taken in its entirety unambiguously foreclose an award of expert fees. I agree that, read literally, that provision does not clearly grant authority to award any costs at all. And one might read'it, as the Court does, as referencing another federal statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920, which provides that authority. See <em>ante, </em>at 297-298; see also \u00a7 1920 (federal taxation of cost statute). But such a reading is not inevitable. The provision (indeed, the entire Act) says nothing about that other statute. And one can, consistent with the language, read the provision as both embodying a general authority to award costs while also specifying the inclusion of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d as part of those costs (as saying, for example, that a court \u201cmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of [a] costs [award]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">This latter reading, while linguistically the less natural, is legislatively the more likely. The majority\u2019s alternative reading, by cross-referencing only the federal general cost-awarding statute (which applies solely <em>in federal </em>courts), would produce a jumble of different cost definitions applicable to similar IDEA administrative and state-court proceedings in different States. See \u00a7 1920 (\u201cA judge or clerk of <em>any court of the United States </em>may tax as costs the following ...\u201d (emphasis added)). This result is particularly odd, as all IDEA actions must begin in state due process hearings, where the federal cost statute clearly does not apply, and the overwhelming majority of these actions are never appealed to <em>any </em>court. See GAO, Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, U. S. Senate, Special Education: Numbers of Formal Disputes Are Generally Low and States Are Using Mediation and Other Strategies to Resolve Conflicts (GAO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>03-897), p. 13 (Sept. 2003), online at http://www.gao.gov/new. items/d03897.pdf (approximately 3,000 administrative hearings annually; under 10% appealed to state or federal court); see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>907 F. 2d 165, 166 (CADC 1990) (en banc) (joining other Circuits in holding that IDEA authorizes an \u201caward of attorney fees to a parent who prevails in [IDEA] administrative proceedings\u201d). And when parents do appeal, they can file their actions in either state or federal courts. 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Would Congress \u201cobviously\u201d have wanted the content of the word \u201ccosts\u201d to vary from State to State, proceeding to proceeding? <em>Ante, </em>at 297-298. Why? At most, the majority\u2019s reading of the text is plausible; it is not the only possible reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The majority\u2019s most persuasive argument does not focus on either the Spending Clause or lack of statutory ambiguity. Rather, the majority says that \u201ccosts\u201d is a term of art. In light of the law\u2019s long practice of excluding expert fees from the scope of the word \u201ccosts,\u201d along with this Court\u2019s cases interpreting the word similarly in other statutes, the \u201clegislative history is simply not enough.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">I am perfectly willing to assume that the majority is correct about the traditional scope of the word \u201ccosts.\u201d In two cases this Court has held that the word \u201ccosts\u201d is limited to the list set forth in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920 and does not include fees paid to experts. See <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>J. T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d)); <em>West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988 (1988 ed.)). But Congress is free to redefine terms of art. See, <em>e. g., Casey, </em>499 U. S., at 88-90 (citing examples of statutes that shift \u201c\u2018costs of litigation (including . . . expert witness fees)\u2019\u201d). And we have suggested that it might well do so through a statutory provision worded in a manner similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the statute here\u2014indeed, we cited the Conference Report language here at issue. <em>Id., </em>at 91-92, n. 5 (characterizing language as an \u201capparent effort to <em>depart </em>from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art\u201d and noting that Congress made no such \u201ceffort\u201d in respect to 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Regardless, here the statute itself indicates that Congress did not intend to use the word \u201ccosts\u201d as a term of art. The HCPA, which added the cost-shifting provision (in \u00a7 2) to the IDEA, also added another provision (in \u00a74) directing the GAO to \u201cconduct a study of the impact of the amendments to the [IDEA] made by section 2\u201d over a 3V6-year period following the Act\u2019s effective date. \u00a7 4(a), 100 Stat. 797. To determine the fiscal impact of \u00a72 (the cost-shifting provision), \u00a74 ordered the GAO to submit a report to Congress containing, among other things, the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cData, for a geographically representative select sample of States, indicating (A) <em>the specific amount of attorneys\u2019fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party, </em>in each action and proceeding under [\u00a7 2] from the date of the enactment of this Act through fiscal year 1988, <em>and </em>the range of such <em>fees, costs and expenses </em>awarded in the actions and proceedings under such section, categorized by type of complaint and (B) for the same sample as in (A) <em>the number of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys and consultants, </em>involved in the action or proceeding, and expenses incurred by the parents and the State educational agency and local educational agency.\u201d \u00a7 4(b)(3), <em>id., </em>at 797-798 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">If Congress intended the word \u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a7 2 to authorize an award of only those costs listed in the federal cost statute, why did it use the word \u201cexpenses\u201d in \u00a7 4(b)(3)(A) as part of the \u201camount . . . awarded to the prevailing party\u201d? When used as a term of art, after all, \u201ccosts\u201d does not cover expenses. Nor does the federal costs statute cover any ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>penses\u2014at least not any that Congress could have wanted the GAO to study. Cf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1920 (referring only once to \u201cexpenses,\u201d and doing so solely to refer to special interpretation services provided in actions initiated by the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Further, why did Congress, when asking the GAO (in the statute itself) to study the \u201cnumber of hours spent by personnel,\u201d include among those personnel both attorneys <em>\u201cand consultants\u201d? </em>Who but experts could those consultants be? Why would Congress want the GAO to study the hours that those experts \u201cspent,\u201d unless it thought that it would help keep track of the \u201ccosts\u201d that the statute imposed?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Of course, one might, through speculation, find other answers to these questions. One might, for example, imagine that Congress wanted the GAO to study the expenses that payment of expert fees engendered in state-court proceedings where state, but not federal, law requires that \u201c\u2018expenses\u2019 other than \u2018costs\u2019 might be receivable.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 299, n. 1; but see <em>supra, </em>at 319-320. Or one might think that the word \u201cexpenses\u201d is surplusage. <em>Ante, </em>at 299, n. 1; but see <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (expressing Court\u2019s \u201c\u2018reluctante] to treat statutory terms as surplusage\u2019 in any setting,\u201d but especially when they play \u201cso pivotal a place in the statutory scheme\u201d). Or one might believe that Congress was interested in the hours these experts spent, but not in the fees they obtained. <em>Ante, </em>at 299. But these answers are not necessarily consistent with the purpose of the GAO study provision, a purpose revealed by the language of the provision and its position in the statute. Its placement and its reference to \u00a7 2 indicate that Congress ordered the study to help it keep track of the magnitude of the reimbursements that an earlier part of the new statute (namely, \u00a7 2) mandated. See 100 Stat. 797 (stating that purpose of GAO study was to determine the \u201cimpact\u201d of \u201csection 2\u201d). And the <em>only </em>reimbursement requirement that \u00a72 mandates is the payment of \u201ccosts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>But why speculate about this? We <em>know </em>what Congress intended the GAO study to cover. It <em>told </em>the GAO in its Conference Report that the word \u201ccosts\u201d included the costs of experts. And, not surprisingly, the GAO made clear that it understood precisely what Congress asked it to do. In its final report, the GAO wrote: \u201cParents can receive reimbursement from state or local education agencies for some or all of their attorney fees <em>and related expenses </em>if they are the prevailing party in part or all of administrative hearings or court proceedings. <em>Expert witness fees, cost of tests or evaluations found to be necessary during the case, and court costs for services rendered during administrative and court proceedings are examples of reimbursable expenses.\u201d </em>GAO, Briefing Report to Congressional Requesters, Special Education: The Attorney Fees Provision of Public Law 99-372 (GAO/HRD-90-22BR), p. 13 (Nov. 1989) (emphasis added), online at http://archive.gao.gov/d26t7/140084.pdf. At the very least, this amounts to <em>some </em>indication that Congress intended the word \u201ccosts,\u201d not as a term of art, not as it was used in the statutes at issue in <em>Casey </em>and <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>but rather as including certain additional \u201cexpenses.\u201d If that is so, the claims of tradition, of the interpretation this Court has given other statutes, cannot be so strong as to prevent us from examining the legislative history. And that history could not be more clear about the matter: Congress intended the statutory phrase \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to include the costs of experts. See Part I, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">For the reasons I have set forth, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion. Even less can I agree with its failure to consider fully the statute\u2019s legislative history. That history makes Congress\u2019 purpose clear. And our ultimate judicial goal is to interpret language in light of the statute\u2019s purpose. Only by seeking that purpose can we avoid the substitution of judicial for legislative will. Only by reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>language in its light can we maintain the democratic link between voters, legislators, statutes, and ultimate implementation, upon which the legitimacy of our constitutional system rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In my view, to keep faith with that interpretive goal, we must retain all traditional interpretive tools\u2014text, structure, history, and purpose. And, because faithful interpretation is art as well as science, we cannot, through rule or canon, rule out the use of any of these tools, automatically and in advance. Cf. <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>69 F. 2d 809, 810-811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Nothing in the Constitution forbids us to give significant weight to legislative history. By disregarding a clear statement in a legislative Report adopted without opposition in both Houses of Congress, the majority has reached a result no Member of Congress expected or overtly desired. It has adopted an interpretation that undercuts, rather than furthers, the statute\u2019s purpose, a \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d public education for \u201call\u201d children with disabilities. See <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U. S. 105, 133 (2001) (Stevens, J., joined by Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., dissenting) (\u201cA method of statutory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and hence unconstrained, may produce a result that is consistent with a court\u2019s own views of how things should be, but it may also defeat the very purpose for which a provision was enacted\u201d). And it has adopted an approach that, I fear, divorces law from life.

The differences between the Senate bill and the House amendment and the substitute agreed to in the conference, are noted below, except for clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clarifying changes.</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">1. The Senate bill provides for \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKR\">The House amendment provides for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARS\">The Senate recedes.</p>\n<p id=\"AuR\">2. With slightly different wording, both the Senate bill and the House amendment provide for the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"ARv\">The Senate recedes to the House and the House recedes to the Senate with an amendment clarifying that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs . . .\u201d This change in wording incorporates the Supreme Court <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Chesny </em>decision (87 L. Ed. 2d 1).</p>\n<p id=\"A7d\">The conferees intend that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding, as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating a case.</p>\n<p id=\"A_p\">3. The Senate bill provides for the .award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cto a parent or legal representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMY\">The House amendment provides for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cto the parents or guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqC\">The Senate recedes.</p>\n<p id=\"AjW\">4. The Senate bill limits the amount of the fee awarded whenever a parent or legal representative is represented by a publicly funded organization which provides legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"AoX\">The House amendment provides that fee awards shall be based on prevailing rates in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"ALX\">The House recedes to the Senate and the Senate recedes to the House with an amendment clarifying that \u201cfees awarded under this subsection shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.\u201d See, <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424 (1983); <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Chesny, </em>87 L. Ed 2d 1 (1985); and <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, </em>104 S. Ct. 1541 (1984). However, no such awards of attorneys\u2019 fees shall be calculated by using bonuses or multipliers. The conferees want to make it clear that the inclusion of the prohibition against calculation of fees using bonuses and multipliers is limited to cases brought only under part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act. The conferees do not intend in any way to diminish the applicability of interpretation by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding bonuses and multipliers to other statutes such as 42 U.S.C. 1988. See, <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, Evans </em>v. <em>Jeff D., </em>106 S. Ct. 1531 (1986). In addition, several new sections would be added to clarify that under part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>no award of attorneys\u2019 fees and related costs subject to the provision of the act may be made for services performed subsequent to the time a written offer of settlement is made to a party (if the offer is made at least 10 days prior to the date of the action or proceeding) if the offer is not accepted within ten days and a court or administrative officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the party is not more favorable to the parent or guardian than the offer of settlement. However, attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded to a prevailing parent or guardian who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer. Furthermore, the court shall reduce accordingly the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they determine that:</p>\n<p id=\"AUh\">(1) the parent or guardian, during the course of the action or proceeding unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy;</p>\n<p id=\"AYj\">(2) the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees otherwise authorized to be awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable-skills experience and reputation; or</p>\n<p id=\"AKx\">(3) the time spent and legal services furnished were excessive considering the nature of the action or proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"AZy\">Finally, the preceding situations in which the court reduces the amount of fees and related expenses otherwise allowable shall not apply if the local or state educational agency is determined to have unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or if a violation of section 615 of the Education of the Handicapped Act is found.</p>\n<p id=\"A5_\">The conferees intend that this provision clarify the application of the <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Chesny </em>decision to the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act. One exception is made to the applicability of the <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Chesny </em>decision. When the parent or guardian is substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer, the <em>Marek </em>v. <em>Chesny </em>decision would not apply. Substantial justification for rejection would include relevant pending court decisions which could have an impact on the case in question.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">In enumerating three conditions under which the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees would be reduced, the committee intends to protect against excessive reimbursement. The second condition is a codification of the policy for awarding fees in footnote 11 of <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0O\">5. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, specifies that fees, expenses, and costs awarded to the prevailing party may not be paid with the funds provided under part B of EHA. The report accompanying the Senate\u2019s bill restates existing policy that bars the payment of such fees and the costs under part B.</p>\n<p id=\"A2P\">The House recedes. The conferees wish to emphasize that existing law bars payment of attorneys\u2019 fees with funds appropriated under B of EHA.</p>\n<p id=\"A-R\">6. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, provides for a GAO study of the impact of the bill authorizing the awarding of fees and costs. The Senate recedes to the House with an amendment expanding the data collection requirements of the GAO study to include infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>mation regarding the amount of funds expended by local educational agencies and state educational agencies on civil actions and administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AdX\">7. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, sunsets the court\u2019s authority to award fees at the administrative level after a period of time specified in the legislation. The House recedes.</p>\n<p id=\"ApM\">8. With slightly different wording, both the Senate bill and the House amendment authorize the filing of civil actions under legal authorities other than part B of EHA so long as parents first exhaust administrative remedies available under part B of EHA to the same extent as would be required under that part.</p>\n<p id=\"ApvZ\">The House recedes. It is the conferees\u2019 intent that actions brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 are governed by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">9. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, requires public access to hearing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">The House recedes. The conferees wish to emphasize that public access to hearing decisions is existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahv\">10. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, requires that the public educational agency provide parents with an opportunity to meet informally in an attempt to resolve a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"ACF\">The House recedes.</p>\n<p id=\"ACZ\">11. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, includes an anti-retaliation provision.</p>\n<p id=\"ATq\">The House recedes. It is the conferees\u2019 intent that no person may discharge, intimidate, retaliate, threaten, coerce, or otherwise take an adverse action against any person because such person has filed a complaint, testified, furnished information, assisted or participated in any manner in a meeting, hearing, review, investigation, or other activity related to the administration of, exercise of authority under, or right secured by part B of EHA. The term \u201cperson\u201d the first time it is used means a state educational agency, local educational agency, intermediate educational unit or any official or employee thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">12. The House amendment, but not the Senate bill, makes retroactive its provision regarding the effect of EHA on other laws (section 3).</p>\n<p id=\"AT8\">The House recedes.</p>\n<p id=\"ALV\">Augustus F.
