Defendant gave a signal for a left turn and after two cars had passed through the intersection in an easterly direction he proceeded to turn left through the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">The car in which plaintiff was riding, without reduction of speed, proceeded into the intersection swerving a bit to the right. When defendant realized that this car was not going to stop he applied his brakes, striking the left rear fender of the automobile containing plaintiff, causing her serious personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s sole contention is that the evidence is insufficient to support a judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">This contention is devoid of merit. It is obvious from the facts related above which were sustained by the evidence that the jury\u2019s implied finding that defendant was not negligent in the operation of his car finds ample support.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">Moore, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
