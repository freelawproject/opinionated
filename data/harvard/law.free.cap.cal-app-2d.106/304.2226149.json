Appellant Boggess owned the plane, which was demolished, and sued in the same action for its value. Miller had judgment for $1,093.80, while Boggess was denied a recovery. Both the county and Boggess appeal on the same record.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Miller is a licensed pilot who had been flying from that field since June, 1947, and had more than 100 flying hours experience. He had taken up aviation \u201cin lieu of a hobby, and partly to conduct business.\u201d He and others had made a group flight and were returning to the airport shortly after noon. The plane was a single-engine \u201cAeronca Chief\u201d which had been rented by Miller from Boggess on that Sunday as on other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The area designated for landing was runway 32, which was about 4,600 feet long. Its \u201cimproved\u201d strip was 150 feet wide and had a hard, paved surface. Adjoining and paralleling it on each side had been a shoulder of oiled dirt 75 feet wide, but these 75-foot shoulders had just been widened by the county to 105 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In grading the additional 30-foot strips the machines had left a mound of dirt running along the outer edges thereof for their entire length. These mounds were of uneven height, varying from 6 to 18 inches. Boggess testified that \u201cThe dirt was left where it fell off the blade of the grader along the edge of the shoulder.\u201d It had solidified and was completely concealed by weeds about <em>2y2 </em>feet high. Miller testified that he had received no warning of this condition orally, by bulletin, red flag, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">As he flew in, Miller set his plane down on runway 32 and after taxiing in the usual way down the center thereof for about 100 feet the plane suddenly veered to the left and went into a ground-loop, out of directional control. He was being followed onto the runway by other planes which created a hazard to all concerned, and instead of letting his plane \u201cride out\u201d the ground-loop and risk collision with those following, he gave it \u201cfull throttle\u201d in an attempt to regain the air and make a new landing. This application of full power caused the plane to taxi, at an angle of approximately 80 degrees left of the runway\u2019s center line, across the runway, the 75-foot shoulder, and its new 30-foot addition. Just before reaching the mound of dirt at the outermost edge the plane became air-borne, but, although a few inches off the ground it still had not enough altitude to clear the mound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>of dirt. Its undercarriage struck the mound, which caused the plane to stall and crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>The County\u2019s Appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The county denied any negligence and pleaded Miller\u2019s contributory negligence. It contends that he lost control through his own negligence\u201d and used \u201cerroneous recovery tactics. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>James Granger, Inc., </em>4 Cal.2d 668, 677 [52 P.2d 226] (followed by <em>Pignet </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, </em>29 Cal.App.2d 286, 287 [84 P.2d 166]) holds that in the absence of legislation the standard of care in airport cases such as this is to be judged by the general laws and rules of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">First, with respect to the county\u2019s negligence:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The county concedes that Miller was its invitee but attempts to limit that status to certain parts only of the 530-acre field.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The court found that the plane \u201cran into and collided with a mound of dirt which paralleled said runway . . . ; that said mound of dirt was negligently and carelessly maintained by said defendant, and plaintiff . . . had no notice or knowledge of its existence; that the airplane . . . was caused to strike said mound of dirt as a proximate result of the carelessness of said defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The grading of the widened shoulders started on September 15th. Two days later, on the 17th, a girl student-flyer \u201cveered off the shoulder just slightly, and started out toward the weeds, and hit the mound of dirt on that north-south runway, and peeled the landing gear off.\u201d (This was not runway 32, but both runways were being widened.) Boggess, who owned her plane, vehemently complained to the airport manager. Notice of the dangerous condition, then, had been brought home to the county nine days before Miller\u2019s crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">The airport manager admitted that the mound of dirt was a hazard, but qualified his answer by saying \u201cbut it was completely off the runway.\u201d After admitting that he knew student-pilots were using the runways and \u201cfrequently went into ground-loops\u201d he was asked \u201cAnd you felt that that mound of dirt then was a definite hazard, did you not, and it should be properly flagged?\u201d and answered \u201cYes, sir, that is why we notified all fixed base operators of that fact.\u201d He then testified that \u201c. . . the job was not completed at the time of the second accident [Miller\u2019s]. . . . We were working continuously there, trying to get the scrapings to feather out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>but because of the straw and weeds, and everything like that, we were having trouble in getting them to feather out into the field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The county admits that it was its duty \u201cto warn respondent of known dangers and to exercise ordinary care in keeping the land in a reasonably safe condition,\u201d but it contends that such duty \u201capplies only to that portion thereof where the invitee would, under the circumstances and conditions of his invitation, <em>naturally </em>be likely to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">However, Boggess testified that \"The ground rules at Buchanan Field specify the landing area to include the shoulders . . . the hard surface and shoulders\u201d and this was not contradicted. He testified also that the widening of the 75-foot shoulders had been completed and \u201cthere was no differentiating there between the old and new shoulders, when you are talking about landing areas.\u201d He was asked \u201cAnd in the area that is plowed, are planes able to taxi over the area?\u201d and answered \u201cIt is not the normal thing. However, in a recovery from a situation like this, that area could be utilized for recovery under normal conditions\u201d which testimony was not contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">All this testimony was clearly sufficient to support an implied finding of fact that, as was said in <em>Gastine </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>65 Cal.App.2d 131, 140-1 [150 P.2d 266], \u201cthe invitation, express or implied, included that part of the premises where the injury occurred.\u201d After all, it occurred on the very borderline of the over-all landing area (according to the \u201cground rules\u201d) and not within the plowed area, which, in any ease, was also available under the \u201cAny port in a storm\u201d theory testified to by Boggess.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">With respect to proximate cause:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In electing to try to regain the air, Miller, according to all the witnesses, did it the hard way, as the saying goes, but the fact remains that he almost succeeded. After the crash the airport manager retraced the plane\u2019s path and found that it had become air-borne about 10 feet before it reached the mound of dirt. Since the mound of dirt intercepted the plane\u2019s undercarriage, it is fair to say that had it not been there, Miller would have safely completed his difficult, emergency \u201ctake-off.\u201d The finding that the mound of dirt was a proximate cause of the crash is thus amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">With respect to Miller\u2019s contributory negligence:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The court found that at the time of the collision plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cwas exercising ordinary care for his own safety, and no negligence on the part of plaintiff . . . proximately, or in any manner, contributed to the happening of said accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It is self-evident that plaintiff was confronted with a sudden emergency when his plane veered and went into the ground-loop. He was being followed into the airport by several other planes and he had their safety and his own to consider. Nobody could tell where the ground-loop, willynilly, would take him. The record shows that he then had two alternatives\u2014either to \u201cride out\u201d the ground-loop, or to attempt to regain the air, and it is undisputed that the latter was the more difficult of the- two.  Under the imminent peril rule it was a question for the trier of fact to determine whether the alternative which he chose would have been the choice of a reasonable man in his predicament <em>(Kirk </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Ry. Corp., </em>26 Cal.2d 833, 841 [161 P.2d 673, 164 A.L.R. 1]; 19 Cal.Jur. 598, 599-600).  Boggess testified \u201cif there were a mound of dirt there, I certainly would probably do what he did.\u201d This testimony, given by an experienced flyer (who conducted a flying school at this field), was sufficient to support the implied finding that Miller\u2019s choice was that of a reasonable man under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The finding that Miller was not negligent also settles the county\u2019s contention that Miller was negligent in relaxing the back pressure on the controls while on the runway and that this might have thrown him into the ground-loop in the first place. Plaintiff attributed his loss of directional control to \u201cthe quartering gust of wind.\u201d Various theories are advanced as to what caused the ground-loop, but it seems to be one of those things which cannot be determined with any degree of certainty in the absence of a mechanical failure, of which, it is conceded, there was none. Boggess, when questioned about a ground-loop testified that \u201cyou get it in any airport\u201d which, we take it, is a flyer\u2019s way of saying that it is a mishap which might befall the best of pilots and planes from some cause or other, difficult to pin down or analyze. Prom plaintiff\u2019s testimony the court could have found that the plane was sent into the loop by \u201cthe quartering gust of wind,\u201d which would be neither \u201cpilot error\u201d nor negligence. On appeal, it goes without saying, the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the respondent. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony supports the findings in this respect, with only speculations opposed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Following the rule of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>James Granger, Inc., supra, </em>and applying the standard rules of negligence, it must be concluded that the findings are fully supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>The Boggess Appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">There was no plea of contributory negligence on this branch of the case. Nevertheless the court found that Boggess, with knowledge of the mound of dirt, was negligent in failing to warn Miller of it, and that \u201csuch negligence . . . proximately contributed to the happening of said accident. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The principal basis for this finding was the testimony of appellant himself, elicited by questions asked by the judge while Boggess was under direct examination by Miller\u2019s counsel as a witness for <em>both plaintiffs. </em>The questions and their answers were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201cThe Court: Q. You knew . . . that dirt was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cA. Yes. I found it out the hard way 2 weeks before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cThe Court. Q. You didn\u2019t tell Mr. Miller about the dirt, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t recall whether I did or not.\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cThe Court: Q. And you didn\u2019t say anything to Miller about this pile of dirt being there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201cA. Sir, I wouldn\u2019t say yes or no to that\u201d . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">\u201cThe Court. Q. Were you there when he came there to get the plane that morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Appellant contends that as contributory negligence was not pleaded, it was not in issue, hence the court erred in asking these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">There was no error or impropriety in the questions <em>(McClure </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>33 Cal.2d 717, 736 [205 P.2d 17]; <em>Estate of Dupont, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 276, 290 [140 P.2d 866], and cases cited; 27 Cal.Jur. \u00a7 49, pp. 65-66). Moreover, there was no objection and \u201cit is too late to urge it as error for the first time on the appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ottey, </em>5 Cal.2d 714, 721 [56 P.2d 193], and cases cited.) All four questions were relevant to the inquiry whether Miller (whose case was being tried with that of Boggess) had knowledge or notice of the hazard, and their answers tended to corroborate Miller\u2019s testimony that he had no knowledge or notice. The plaintiffs elected to combine their cases in one action and Boggess was testifying for <em>both plaintiffs. </em>Had the two cases, been tried separately the present problem might never have arisen, or if it had, it would have been more sharply defined than it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>now. The answers, while relevant to Miller\u2019s ease, tended at the same time to establish Boggess\u2019 negligence in not warning Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of negligence against Boggess, but we are not satisfied that it was sufficient to support the finding that his negligence \u201cproximately contribtued to the . . . accident. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We have already discussed Miller\u2019s peril and the two alternatives he had. Under cross-examination Miller was asked: \u201c. . . As a matter of fact, in the position that you were attempting to take off there, it was a completely improper position for that runway, was it not?\u201d and answered \u201cnot in the condition that was existing.\u201d Further: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t take off at the side of the runway?\u201d and answered \u201cWell, if it is a matter of your life or death, you take off in any direction you can, sir. If it is your neck, you are going to do the thing you think best to do.\u201d He then spoke of the peril which was present because of the planes following him onto the field, describing what might have happened had he ridden out the ground-loop and concluded with the remark \u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d which is readily understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The inquiry whether Boggess\u2019 failure to warn Miller was a proximate cause of the crash naturally raises the question whether <em>with </em>warning Miller would have acted any differently. There is no evidence to indicate that he would have, and in its absence the question remains within the realm of speculation and conjecture. If Boggess had warned Miller or if a line of red flags had told him of the hazard, he might still have weighed one danger against the other, and done exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Appellant Boggess was cross-examined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201cQ. And his recovery from the ground loop is contrary to what you would instruct a student to do ? A. Contrary to what I teach\u2014not contrary to what some instructors teach. As I sav. it is an elective thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">\u201cThe Court: It is a matter of opinion? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">\u201cMr. Porlier: Q. It is contrary to what you teach, however ? A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">\u201cMr. Porlier: Q. It is your opinion that the better thing to do in that instance is to let it roll itself out of the loop? A. Is to ride it through, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">On redirect the examination was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-14\">\u201cQ. Having in mind the mound of dirt there, and you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>were veering off toward that mound of dirt, would you give any\u2014having in mind the condition of the field, would you give different instructions? A. Well, if there were a mound of dirt there, I certainly would probably do what he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2T\">For whatever it was worth, there was thus before the court without objection the testimony of an expert flier that even with full knowledge of the mound of dirt there he \u2018 \u2018 certainly would probably do what he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">That part of the judgment which awards respondent Miller $1,093.80 and costs is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">That part of the judgment which denies appellant Boggess a recovery is reversed, with the direction to the trial court to make a finding that Boggess\u2019 negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident, and to enter judgment in his favor against the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Both plaintiffs to have their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Nourse, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
