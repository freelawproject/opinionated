Ella Lucas made her will. After her death the will was offered for probate, and contest filed. The contest was heard by the court without a jury. Proof of due execution of the will was ample and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Decedent was a widow, with no living issue; and, so far as the record shows, no heirs. Her only son served as an officer in the first world war and died in Sawtelle Veterans\u2019 Hospital in 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Contestant\u2019s case may be summed up as follows: Decedent stated to several witnesses that she had a godchild, Jane Reese (who was no relative of the blood) to whom she wanted to will all her property. Decedent asked a real estate broker to prepare a will for her, leaving her property to her godchild. The broker prepared an extraordinary document, which, after it was signed by decedent, her godchild, two friends, and a notary public\u2014who appended his jurat and seal\u2014reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cLos Angeles, Calif.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">July 2, 1946</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">\u2018 \u2018 To Whom It May Concern ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">\u201cI will place everything I Possess into Jane Reese\u2019s hands, (my GOD child.)

(Seal)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Proponent\u2019s case may be summed up as follows: A little over three years after the real estate broker\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d was made, and while Mrs. Lucas was in the hospital suffering from her last illness, she asked her doctor to get a lawyer for her. This was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Mrs. Lucas told her lawyer she wanted him to prepare a will for her, leaving all of her property to a long-time friend, Isabel Kittrell. The will was prepared and taken to the hospital, and, without reciting details, there duly executed according to the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Witnesses for proponent testified that at the time decedent subscribed her will she was of sound and disposing mind and memory; also that she had told them she wanted all of her property to go to Isabel Kittrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The probate court held that the will should be admitted to probate, and that the broker\u2019s document should be denied probate. From the judgment which followed contestant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">No argument appears in the briefs as to the effect as a will of the document prepared by the real estate broker. Assuming it to have been testamentary in character <em>(Estate of Pagel, </em>52 Cal.App.2d 38 [125 P.2d 853]; <em>Estate of Wunderle, </em>30 Cal.2d 274 [181 P.2d 874]), the probate court\u2019s finding that the will admitted to probate was duly and properly executed, signed and published as decedent\u2019s last will and testament is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Contestant\u2019s argument that the judgment should be reversed because of newly discovered evidence is not tenable. Due consideration was given by the probate court to the affidavits presented on contestant\u2019s motion for a new trial on this ground. The motion was denied, and no abuse of discretion appears. The granting of a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence is largely a matter of discretipn. <em>(Lundy </em>v. <em>Lakin, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 221 [215 P.2d 61].) The action of the trial court in such cases will not be disturbed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>(Rockwell </em>v. <em>Italian-Swiss Colony, </em>10 Cal.App. 633 [103 P. 162]; and see cases digested in 17 McKinney 936.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Doran, Acting P. J., and Hanson, J. pro tern., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
