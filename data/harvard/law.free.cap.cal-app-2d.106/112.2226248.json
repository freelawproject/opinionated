Recht for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-12\">DRAPEAU, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqH\">Plaintiff was driving his automobile west-on Van Owen Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley. He was on his own right hand side of the street, as far over as he could get, against a dirt embankment thrown up by a ditch digger.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Defendant was driving a pickup truck in the other direction, drifting from side to side of the street. Defendant ran into the side of plaintiff\u2019s car, but he didn\u2019t stop; he just kept on going.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Plaintiff got out of his car and. into another one going east on Van Owen. After chasing defendant for a mile or so they caught him, and headed him into the curb. The driver of the pursuing car left to call the police; plaintiff went to defendant\u2019s pickup to get his license number.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The door of the cab on the pickup was open. Plaintiff put his foot on the attenuated running board, or door, sill, of the truck. Plaintiff had a pad of paper on his knee and a pencil in his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Then, without warning, defendant gunned his truck and started it with a jerk. The open door struck plaintiff.' To save himself further injury he grabbed the side of the cab' and swung himself into the rear of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Plaintiff beat on the top of the cab to stop defendant, but he only went faster. Without stopping for a boulevard sign, defendant rounded a corner at high speed and ran full tilt into a telephone pole. Plaintiff was thrown out of the truck, was seriously injured, and was in Birmingham Veterans\u2019 Hospital for two months. \u2022 . .</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The arresting officer tested defendant for sobriety, and testified that in his opinion defendant was under.the influence of liquor. A witness who saw defendant\u2019s driving, and observed him after the accident testified to the same opinion. Defendant admitted he had been drinking. ' :</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Defendant appeals from the judgment rendered against him. He argues that plaintiff comes within the category \u201cnor any other person\u201d in Vehicle Code, section 503, and, therefore, as a guest in the pickup may not recover; also that the judgment against the coowner of the truck is without support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">In the circumstances of this case section 403 of the Vehicle Code has no application. <em>(Kastel </em>v. <em>Stieber, 215 </em>Cal. 37 [8 P.2d 474].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Section 402(a) of the Vehicle Code fixes the liability of the coowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">The evidence supports the findings, and the findings support the judgment in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred. \u2019 '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
