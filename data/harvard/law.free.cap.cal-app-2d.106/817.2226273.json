The franchised premises had been acquired by the city under a state grant, and are described as lying 376 feet along the line of ordinary high tide and extending 600 feet southerly into the Pacific Ocean. As a part of the consideration Neptune conveyed to the city two parcels of land, namely a 396-foot strip (east and west) and 2 feet in width, along the high tide line, and a second strip conveyed for sidewalk purposes 396 feet long (east and west) and 25 feet wide, lying immediately north of a 64-foot strip owned by Neptune. The lease franchise contained no provision for renewal or extension of the term, and required Neptune to remove all structures prior to the expiration date \u201cat its own expense and surrender the same to the City of Long Beach. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">On May 7, 1914 appellant Neptune subleased a portion of said premises to the respondent Coaster Company for a similar period of 35 years, which period was later shortened so that the sublease would expire November 25, 1948, or five days before the expiration of Neptune\u2019s basic lease-franchise. Upon this subleased property the Coaster Company erected a roller coaster which was demolished in 1930, a new structure of similar nature being then constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Title to the roller coaster at the expiration of the sublease is now claimed by the Neptune Company. This claim is predicated upon a sublease provision that Coaster Company \u201cshall, at the expiration of the term herein limited, or upon sooner termination of this lease, at its option (1) turn over to (appellant) . . . the said demised premises with all structures and improvements in good and safe condition, or (2) at its own expense clear said demised premises and leave the same\u201d in their original condition. Appellant Neptune was given a right of entry for conditions broken, but the sublease contained no express provisions relative to method, manner or time by which respondent Coaster Company was to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the option. There was evidence that removal of the extensive roller coaster structure would require 75 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In 1944-45, it appears that sublessee Coaster Company attempted without success to negotiate some arrangement with Neptune for a renewal of the sublease at its termination in 1948 so that Coaster\u2019s investment would be protected. Coaster offered to cooperate in securing a new basic lease from the city. Failing in these efforts, Coaster, in May, 1946, wrote the city manager of Long Beach: \u201cCoaster Company has been unable to obtain from Neptune any expression of its intention relative to applying for a new franchise lease and has therefore determined to seek a lease-franchise from the City covering the space now occupied by its operations and upon which it has expended over $250,000.\u201d Coaster proposed a payment of $20,000 to the city \u201cproviding Coaster Company has obtained the franchise and is in full possession of its improvements\u2014the City to waive the removal of Coaster Company\u2019s improvements as required in Neptune\u2019s franchise. \u2019'</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Thereafter, according to appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cThe City in disregard of Plaintiff\u2019s tenancy and reversionary interest entered into a new lease with Coaster Company for the operation of the coaster for twenty-one years beginning December 1,1948.\u201d There is evidence indicating that the city requested information from Neptune relative to the latter\u2019s intention to apply for a new franchise, but. that such information was not furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">On July 15, 1947 the electors approved the granting of the new franchise to Coaster. A resolution was passed by the city extending the time for removal of the structure \u201cto the date of termination of the (new) lease franchise granted to Coaster Company.\u201d Appellant claims that this was done without notice to Neptune; there is also evidence indicating that Neptune could hardly have been ignorant of what was going on in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">A conspiracy between the city and Coaster \u201cto deprive Plaintiff of its contract and property rights,\u201d and to prevent Neptune from obtaining the valuable improvements, is alleged. Coaster Company is said to have \u201cfraudulently\u201d written Neptune that Coaster \u201cwill at its own expense clear said demised premises,\u201d etc., whereas Coaster never intended to so remove the structure, and in fact never did remove it. It is Neptune\u2019s contention that \u201cUpon vesting of the reversion and Coaster Company\u2019s refusal to avail itself of the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>for removal of the structures, plaintiff (Neptune) became entitled to the exclusive possession and right of disposition of the structures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The trial court found that Coaster\u2019s sublease came to an end on November 25,1948, but that \u201cRespondent Coaster still had the right of ingress and egress for the purpose of removing the structures it had placed on the subleased property.\u201d It was also found that although Coaster had hired armed guards and had thus prevented Neptune from taking possession, there was reasonable and justifiable cause to engage and maintain such guards, and that \u201cnone of them did or performed any act or engaged in any activity that was not reasonably necessary to protect the structures and improvements on the subleased premises.\u201d The trial court concluded that Neptune had suffered no damage and was entitled to no relief. It is maintained by the respondents that the findings and judgment are amply sustained by the record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">It is pointed out in a brief filed by the city of Long Beach that \u201cThe City has never exercised any dominion\u201d over the coaster structure, and claims no interest whatever in the improvements.\u201d It is also noted that the city, as the owner of the property, \u201chad the right to re-lease it at the termination of Neptune\u2019s lease-franchise without undue or unnecessary delay or loss of income. Neptune had no priority right to be considered ahead of others. However Neptune appears to take the position that it was the city\u2019s duty to do nothing with its property, but to sit idly' by and await a determination of a dispute between it and Coaster as to which owned the improvements. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Although various decisions have been cited in support of appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in its decision, such cases do no more than reiterate certain fundamental rules about which there can be no serious controversy. For example, the general rights, duties and liabilities of landlords, tenants and subtenants are well established and can hardly be questioned at this late date. It is to be noted that none of the cited cases involve a factual situation in any way comparable with that here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Although, as appellant maintains, the Coaster Company possessed only the limited rights of a sublessee, it must be borne in mind that Neptune itself was a mere lessee of the city under a lease which makes no provision for renewal or extension. Without some renewal or extension, and Neptune appears to have done nothing to secure any reinstatement of its tenancy status, its tenancy rights came to an end only five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>days after termination of Coaster\u2019s sublease. As noted in the city\u2019s brief, the Neptune Company possessed no \u201cpriority right\u201d so far as relates to the granting of a new franchise-lease by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">As hereinbefore indicated, the fundamental question litigated at the trial and now made one of the chief issues on appeal, concerns the ownership and disposition of the structures erected by the sublessee. It is apparent that this coaster structure was primarily valuable as a going concern, and that such value was to a very great extent dependent upon two contributing factors\u2014namely the favorable amusement-beach location, and the long term continuance of the enterprise. The city of Long Beach by way of a franchise lease, was obviously the fountainhead of both of these elements. The Neptune Company, itself a lessee, occupied the position of a middleman. Neptune contributed nothing towards construction or maintenance of the roller coaster, and, it may be noted, apparently made no claim of ownership prior to the final controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Renewal of the basic franchise at the close of Neptune\u2019s term was a matter important to both Neptune and Coaster, yet it seems that Neptune made no effort towards securing a renewal of this basic right. Under one view of the evidence it might reasonably be inferred that Neptune was primarily concerned with securing title to this valuable asset before negotiating any new arrangement with the city. Coaster, on the other hand, was determined that \u201cThe Neptune Pier Company was not going to steal the coaster,\u201d and failing to secure cooperation from Neptune, proceeded to make its own arrangement with the city of Long Beach for the purpose of protecting its large investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The matter of removal of the roller coaster at the expiration of the sublease was not one which could be effected in a few hours or even in a few days. There was evidence that such removal would require a period of 75 days. If it be assumed, as appellant\u2019s position seems to require, that Coaster must either have the structure removed before the expiration date of the sublease, or lose title thereto, it necessarily follows that the Coaster Company would be compelled to start such removal activities 75 days before the expiration date. Financially, then, the last two and one-half months of the sublease period would be a total loss so far as income is concerned. The sublease, however, contains no such requirement, but merely provides that \u201cat the expiration of the term\u201d Coaster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>shall exercise its option of turning over to Neptune the structure in question, or shall \u201cat its own expense clear said demised premises. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">By notice given, the Coaster Company made a formal election to remove the structure, although as appellant states, no removal was ever made and it is questionable whether Coaster ever intended to remove it. It is at least clear that Coaster had no intention of turning over the property to Neptune. As already noted, however, the sublease was silent as to the exact method, manner or time in which Coaster was to perform. Detailed and express provisions governing such an important matter might well have been contained in the instrument. Such foresight might have rendered the present litigation unnecessary or at least have clarified the issues as to the exact rights, duties and liabilities of the various parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The alleged conspiracy between Coaster and the city, designed to defeat Neptune\u2019s right to take over the structure, was one of appellant\u2019s affirmative allegations, therefore the burden of proving such fact rested upon appellant\u2019s shoulders. The fact that Coaster had offered the city $20,000 \u201cprovided Coaster Company has obtained the franchise and is in full possession of its improvements\u2014the .city to waive removal of . . . improvements as required in Neptune\u2019s franchise,\u201d can hardly be said to establish such a conspiracy, standing alone. Whether a conspiracy did exist, involving an unlawful act or a lawful act done in an unlawful manner, was clearly a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The trial court was confronted with appellant\u2019s theory that Coaster and the city had unlawfully combined to \u201cfreeze out\u201d Neptune, and on the other hand with respondent\u2019s theory that following Neptune\u2019s noncooperation, Coaster had merely sought to protect its rights and insure future operation, by opening direct negotiations with the city. Certainly the record discloses evidence from which the trial court could draw the latter conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The record also affords substantial evidence in support of the trial\u2019s court\u2019s finding that Neptune had suffered no damage. In this connection the court found that \u201cthe reversionary interest of Neptune in the premises referred to in Coaster\u2019s sublease on or after November 26, 1948, was of no market value,\u201d and that Neptune\u2019s nearby fee property \u201cwas not damaged or depreciated in value by virtue of the maintenance and operation of the structures and improvements referred to in Coaster\u2019s sublease on November 26, 1948, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>or at any time thereafter. \u2019 \u2019 The trial court also noted that had the roller coaster been turned over by Coaster, Neptune, under the basic lease with the city would have been obliged to remove such structure at great expense, thus rendering the possession of the coaster a detriment rather than a benefit to Neptune.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The most superficial examination of the voluminous record demonstrates that at almost every point, the trial court was confronted with conflicting evidence and diverse theories. Only in respect to the bare details of what finally happened is the record free from such confusion. More than 1,200 pages of testimony make it clear that the issues in question were thoroughly canvassed. While it is doubtless true that certain items of evidence may tend to support some of appellant\u2019s contentions, it is nevertheless certain that the trial court\u2019s findings against those contentions are adequately supported. Under the usual rules, the appellate court in such a situation is not empowered to weigh the evidence or enter into what amounts to a retrial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 13, 1951, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 13,1951. Schauer, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
