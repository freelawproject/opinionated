A contest has arisen which is likely to cause delay in granting letters, and which, therefore, makes advisable the appointment of a temporary administrator under \u00a7 26G8. Mr. Jacob W. Cornwell, who is named in the alleged will as one of the executors, petitions for his own appointment as temporary administrator. This application is opposed by the contestant, who charges him with unduly influencing the decedent in the making of the will. Under such circumstances I have several times held, in accordance with the suggestion in Howard v. Dougherty <em>(3 Redf., 535), </em>that ordinarily the person named as executor ought not to be appointed temporary administrator. There are exceptions to this rule of exclusion, but the case at bar comes within the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-7\">I am the more disposed to this view, because of the fact that no objection is urged by the moving party to the selection of Mr, G-eorge W. Weeks, who is named in the will as Mr. Cornwell\u2019s co-executor, and whose appointment would be satisfactory to the contestant. An order appointing Mr. Weeks as temporary administrator may, therefore, be presented for settlement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
