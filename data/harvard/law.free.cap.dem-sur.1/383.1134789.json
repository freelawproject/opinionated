P. Richardson, wife of George W. Richardson, the residue of his estate, by the following provision: \u201cI give and bequeath unto Ada E. P. Richardson, wife <em>of </em>G. Vif. Richardson, all the remaining property which I may have after my estate has been settled, and all of the above legacies complied with, to her and her child or children. Should the said Ada E. P. Richardson die without leaving any child or children, then the above legacy to be given to G. W.

She subsequently died in Westchester county, intestate, leaving some of this personal estate, and some of the real estate devised to her by Mr. Perry, and two children. Her husband administered on her estate, was appointed general guardian of the children* and subsequently died leaving a will, of which Harford B. Kirk was executor. David Cromwell, having been appointed to succeed Richardson as guardian of the minors, cited the executor of Richardson to account for the funds held by the deceased guardian. The executor claimed that Richardson, the husband, having survived his wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>took an interest in the real estate devised to her by Perry, as tenant by the curtesy; and also one third of the personal estate she derived from the same source. The general guardian disputed this, and claimed that, the mother dying, the children at once took the remainder by virtue of the will of Mr. Perry.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-4\">M.

She did leave two surviving her. It was only in the event of her leaving none,- that the, executory devise to her husband was to take effect. The Supreme Court, in Hatfield v. Sneden <em>(42 Barb., 615), </em>held that, where the devise and bequest was to a daughter absolutely, and was subsequently qualified by a provision to the effect that, if she had no children, or none living at her decease (which she had not), the real estate was devised to Hatfield, the daughter took a life estate only, with remainder to her issue, if any, as purchasers. The Court of Appeals <em>(54 N. Y., 280) </em>reversed this decision, holding that the fee was devised to the daughter. Here the estate is given to Mrs. Richardson <em>and </em>her child or children. It is limited to \u201cchild or children,\u201d and is not given to her <em>\u201c </em>heirs and assigns,\u201d and the children take as purchasers. It was only, as above remarked, in the event that she left no child, that the executory devise to Mr. Richardson was to take effect. Here the estate of Mrs. Richardson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>was not one of inheritance. It does not appear that she was, in any way, of the blood of Mr. Perry, and her interest was, at least, determinable and determined by a limitation, which not only deprived her husband of curtesy, but also deprived him of any share as distributee, because her interest was for life only. Had the clause read \u201cto her and her child or children, or her assigns,\u201d the estate created in the wife, as to the real property, would have been a fee simple absolute, as the word \u201cassigns \u201d clearly imports such fee, and she would also have had the absolute ownership of the personal property; but conceiving the plain intention of the testator to have been as indicated, and knowing of no rule of law applicable to the defeat of such intention, I must hold that the estate of George W. Richardson is liable to account to these wards, for property derived under the will of Mr. Perry.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">The case of Clarke v. Leupp <em>(88 N. Y., 228), </em>and the cases therein considered, are not in point. The wills there criticised, and construed, contained what are termed precatory words following the bequest. Here, there is no direction, suggestion, advice, or request made, as to how Mrs. Richards on should dispose of the property given to her. It is simply given to her for life, and then to her children, and, in case she left no child, then to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The accounting will proceed upon the basis above indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
