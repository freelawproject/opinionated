Historical Society. <em>In the matter of the probate of the last will and testament of </em>Thomas Wright, <em>deceased.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b616-8\">An <em>unincorporated </em>association, having power to take, under a will, a pecuniary legacy to be devoted to specified <em>pious </em>uses, has a right to intervene by attorney upon, and become a party to, the proceedings for probate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-9\">By a codicil to the will of decedent, he bequeathed <em>\u201c </em>to the Historical Society of the County of Westchester, of which James Wood is now president, the sum of one hundred dollars, to be used and applied to procuring and placing a suitable monument, to mark the spot where the soldiers, during the Revolution, were buried, at or near St. Mark\u2019s Church, in the town of Newcastle.\u201d The Society was also made a contingent devisee. Francis M. Carpenter, the executor, * propounded both will and codicil for probate. On the return of the citation, some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the heirs-at-law and next of kin filed objections against both; and the Historical Society, by attorney, asked leave to appear in support of the codicil. The. executor and St. Mark\u2019s Church objected that the Society was not legally incorporated, and could not, therefore, intervene and be permitted to become a party to the proceeding, inasmuch as it had no capacity to take as legatee or devisee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b617-4\">R.

Chapin, <em>6 Paige, 639; </em>De Witt v. Chandler, <em>11 Abb. Pr., 459; </em>Owens v. Missionary Soc., <em>14 N. </em>Y., <em>380). </em>Hence, the Society has a right to intervene and become a party to the probate proceeding as a legatee named in the codicil. It is unnecessary, therefore, to determine now the question discussed as to whether it is incorporated so as to be competent to take under the contingent devise contained in the codicil. The objection is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
