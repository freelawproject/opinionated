Woolley, the executor therein named. An opposing petition was presented by William McClure, formerly decedent\u2019s husband, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-4\">\u201cWilliam McClure, residing at No. 355 Branan street, in the city and county of San Francisco, State of California, herewith presents to said court his claim and demand to and for all of the property, of whatever nature or kind, in the possession or under the control of said Elizabeth B. McClure, deceased, at the time of her death, and asks this honorable court that no distribution of any of the property set forth or alluded to in the last will of said Elizabeth B. McClure, now on file in this court, be awarded, distributed or given to one James H. Woolley, named in said will, or to any other person or persons except myself and my present wife, residing with me in the city of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">\u201cAnd this petitioner and claimant begs to show that all and every of the property, estate, claim or demand of property or thing of value alluded to in the last will of the said Elizabeth B. McClure, or in her possession or under her control, at the time of her death, was, as this petitioner and claimant believes, the property of this petitioner and claimant and his present wife.

PL, par. 6: \u201cThere was no pleading corresponding to a demurrer with us. Instead of that, every pleading had to be submitted to the judge before it could be pleaded. If it was not objected to by the adverse party, it would generally be admitted as of course. If it was objected to, the judge would hear an argument and would then make an order admitting or rejecting the pleading, as the case might be.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-4\">The contestant\u2019s counsel opposed the motion as irregular and unauthorized by any rule of practice or statutory provision; and insisted that the objection raised was good under section 2624 of the Code, providing that \u201cif a party expressly puts in issue before the Surrogate the validity, construction or effect of any disposition of personal property contained in the will of a resident of the State, executed within the State, the Surrogate must determine the question upon rendering a decree. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-5\">Roger Foster, <em>for the motion.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-6\">Wm.

The paper filed as an objection does not, within the meaning of section 2624, \u201c put in issue the validity, construction or effect;,\u201d of a disposition, of personal property. It is not necessary, therefore, that this matter should go upon the calendar of contested cases. There need be no delay in the examination of the subscribing witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
