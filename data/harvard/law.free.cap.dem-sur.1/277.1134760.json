Julius, who is the petitioner in this proceeding, was about fifteen years of age. He attained his maj ority in December, 1881, while his father was yet alive. He now. asks for an order directing the executor, from whom he has already received part of his legacy of ten thousand dollars, to pay him the remainder. It is not disputed that his petition is correct in its averment that this legacy, if due, may now be fully discharged without jeoparding in the least the rights of the other beneficiaries under the will. Some of the executors resist his application, however, upon two grounds, which will be now considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\"><em>First. </em>They insist that the ten thousand dollar legacy, to which he lays claim, \u201clapsed\u201d because of his attaining his majority before the death of his father. The term \u201clapsed legacy\u201d is generally applied to a testamentary gift, which has become inoperative by reason of the death, in the lifetime of the testator, of the person named as legatee. The expression, however, is sometimes used in cases where a bequest has failed by the happening, in the testator\u2019s lifetime, of some event other than that of death, and upon the happening of which event his will has provided that the bequest shall cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">For example, it has been decided that a bequest to A. so long as she shall remain unmarried fails, and partakes of the nature of a lapsed legacy, upon the marriage of A. in the lifetime of the testator (see Andrew v. Andrew, <em>1 Coll. C., 690).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">I have been unable, however, to discover any case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>which a legacy has been held to have 1 \u2018 lapsed \u201d because an event, upon whose happening a legacy was made to <em>take effect </em>under a testator\u2019s will, had come to pass before his death. It is claimed, by the respondent executors, that this will must be deemed to speak from the death of its maker, and that, only in the contingency of his attaining his majority after that date, could Julius become entitled to his bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The case of Andrew v. Andrew <em>(supra), </em>and other cases which discuss the doctrine of the lapsing of legacies, so far as they are applicable at all to the present contention, suggest, it seems to me, a view precisely opposite to that upon which these respondents insist. Those cases say, in effect, that, although for most purposes the will of a testator must be held to speak from the day of his death, nevertheless, if he has burdened a legacy with <em>defeating </em>conditions, it shall not matter whether those conditions come into existence in his own lifetime or after his decease. In either event, the legacy must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Now, it seems to me to be well argued, by parity of reasoning, that, when a testator has attached to a legacy what may be called <em>enabling </em>conditions, it is an immaterial circumstance whether the conditions are fulfilled before his death or after.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Andrew v. Andrew <em>(supra) </em>decided that a legacy to A., \u201cso long as she should remain unmarried,\u201d was defeated by her marriage in the lifetime of the testator. It was evident that the testator, in using the words above quoted, had in his mind the fact that, at the time when he made the provision for her benefit, A. was unmarried, and he meant to declare that, by her retirement from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>that state of life, whenever such retirement might occur, she should deprive herself of all right to die legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The doctrine thus established by Andrew v. Andrew \u2014a case which concerned a legacy burdened with a defeating condition\u2014is supported by numerous decisions in cases where the condition, like that in the case at bar, is such as I have characterized an enabling condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Where, for example, a testator has made a bequest to one of his daughters, upon her marrying with the approval of his widow or his executor, or some other specified person or persons, it has often been held that the marriage of the daughter in the lifetime of her father, arid with his approbation, must be deemed a substantial compliance with the conditions created by the will (Clarke v. Berkley, <em>2 Vern., 720; </em>Parnell v. Lyon, <em>1 Ves. &amp; Bea., 479; </em>Wheeler v. Warner, <em>1 Sim &amp; Stu., 304; </em>Smith v. Cowdery, <em>2 Sim. &amp; Stu., 358).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">And this in recognition of a principle thus stated by Roper <em>[Legacies, p. 819): </em>\"The <em>proper marriage </em>of the legatee being the essence of the condition, the purpose is answered by the marriage under the eye and with the consent of the testator. The condition, it is true, is not performed according to the letter, but it is so in substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The peculiar facts, in the case last above cited, present this doctrine in the strongest possible light. A legacy was bequeathed to A. on the day of her marriage with any other than B.,but in case she should marry him, then over. Notwithstanding the fact that she actually married B., she was held entitled to the legacy, because such marriage took place in the lifetime of the testator, and with his knowledge and approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>It seems to me that the rule governing this class of cases, as it is laid down by Roper, <em>supra, </em>may be fairly stated, when applied to the case at bar, as follows: \u201cThe legatee\u2019s attainment of his majority being the essence of the condition, the purpose-is answered by his coming of age in the lifetime of the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">And it cannot fail to be remarked that this rule, as applied to such a state of facts as is here presented, does not need to be qualified, as it has been necessarily qualified in the cases heretofore cited, by the statement that, while it fails to recognize the necessity of literal obedience to conditions established by a testator, it nevertheless demands that they be substantially fulfilled. That a bequest conditional upon the legatee\u2019s attaining majority may fairly be governed by the rules of interpretation applicable to the case of a bequest dependent upon a legatee\u2019s marriage with approval seems evident upon the slightest consideration, for, in both cases, the condition is presumably imposed with a view of protecting the inexperience of youth. A testator who thinks it wise, in making provision for his minor children, to tie up the inheritance of a son during his minority, and to place similar restrictions upon his daughter, unless before coming of age she shall contract a suitable marriage, is likely to be quite indifferent as to whether the conditions which he has imposed are fulfilled before or after the day of his own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The existence of this close analogy, between the case of a legacy conditioned upon an approved' marriage, and of one conditioned upon attainment of majority, is emphasized in the will of this decedent, by the immediate association of the two in the very provision upon which this petition is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In the same clause, Mr. Eisner gives a bequest to each of two minor sons upon his becoming twenty-one years old, and to each of two minor daughters upon her attaining that age, <em>or </em>upon her marriage before that time, with her mother\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">I am at loss to see how any argument can be urged in favor of excluding the petitioner from enjoyment of his legacy, because of his fulfilling in decedent\u2019s lifetime the condition upon which that legacy was made dependent, which could not have been pressed with equal cogency against the claim of one of the/laughters, if she had married before her father\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In many cases, where testators have given bequests dependent upon the doing of what had already been done, or the happening of events which had already happened, the impossible conditions have been disregarded and the bequest sustained. For example, in the case of a legacy to A., \u201cif he remit the debt due to him from B.,\u201d the bequest has been pronounced absolute, where the debt was remitted prior to the date of the will. So, too, a legacy to A., upon the contingency of a particular vessel returning from a voyage, has been upheld upon the discovery that such vessel had already come into port (Roper on Legacies, 566).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In both of the last two cases, the event upon which the legacy was conditioned had actually taken place before the execution of the will, but if it had come to pass between that date and the day of the testator\u2019s death, the ruling would manifestly have been the same, because it would manifestly have been grounded upon the same principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The decided cases to which I have referred clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>establish that, in the interpretation of such a condition as the one under review, it is proper to inquire what purpose the testator had in imposing it, and that, in the absence of any language indicating a contrary intention, such condition should be deemed fulfilled whether it has been satisfied after the testator\u2019s death, or before that event and subsequently to the execution of the will, or even before such execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The good sense of this rule of interpretation can perhaps be no more effectually shown than by the manifest insufficiency of any other,ein dealing with such a will as was the subject of consideration in Tattersall v. Howell (2 <em>Meriv., 26). </em>A reference to the facts of that case may, therefore, serve a useful purpose, though the point involved in its decision was quite foreign to the present discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">A testatrix made this disposition in her will: \u201cProvided my son changes the course of life he has too long followed, and will give up all his low company and frequenting public houses and vices, I then leave him the interest of five thousand five hundred pounds out of my residue, for his life . . . but if he will not give them up entirely, then I only leave him fifty pounds a year for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Now, if the executor\u2019s contention in the present proceeding is correct, the son of the testatrix, in the case just cited, would have absolutely forfeited his legacy of \u00a35,500, if, in deference to his mother\u2019s manifest wishes, he had reformed in her lifetime. In other words, it was absolutely necessary for him, in order to entitle himself to the legacy, to continue his evil companionship and his resort to \u201cpublic houses and vices\u201d until the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>his mother. Such a construction of the will is manifestly absurd. But why? Simply because it utterly ignores the spirit and purpose of the condition. If that spirit and purpose may be sought for in a testator\u2019s words,' then it seems clear to me that, in the case at bar, the legacy to Julius Eisner is just as effectual as if he had but yesterday attained his majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><em>Second. </em>It is alleged by the objecting executors that the petitioner is charged, in certain account books of his father, \u201c with a check of $5,000, in like maimer as the testator on said books charged loans made by him to various business friends and acquaintances.\u201d The executors add that \u201c whether said $5,000 so charged is to be deemed a loan to be collected from the petitioner, or as an advancement, to await final distribution of the estate under the terms of the will,\u201d they are not informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The language of the testator, which occasions this controversy, is as follows: \u201cAll the residue ... of my estate which may remain at the death of my wife \u201e . . I give unto my children then living and to the issue of any who may have died . . . but in such final distribution of my estate, any sum by way of advancement theretofore received by any of my children, <em>either from me during my lifetime or under the provisions of this my will, </em>shall be deducted from the share of the one so receiving such advancement in such manner that each of my children shall receive, including such advancement, an equal share of my estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">It is conceded by the petitioner that he received from his father the sum of $5,000, and that the same was never repaid. Upon these facts, the question arises whether or not this $5,000 should be deemed an \u201cad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>vancement,\u201d within the meaning of that expression as used in the will, so as to justify the executors in paying the legacy which I have just held to be valid, and in delaying until the final distribution of the estate any efforts to call this petitioner to account for the $5,000 he received from his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">It is suggested, on behalf of the executor, that the word \u201cadvancement\u201d has a fixed and precise meaning in testamentary law, and that it is not sufficiently comprehensive to include a loan such as the transaction between the petitioner and his father may prove to have been. It is doubtless true that the word \u201cadvancement\u201d is a technical term, and that it must ordinarily be construed in its technical sense, when used by a father in connection with a testamentary provision for a child; but a strict interpretation is not always required, and may sometimes be quite inconsistent with surrounding circumstances. Such, indeed, seems to be the case here. The will itself contains internal evidence that the testator did not design to restrain the meaning of the term in question within its ordinary limits, for he directs that, for the purpose of ultimate equalization, advancements <em>\u201ctheretofore </em>received by either of my children\u201d (that, is, received by them before such final distribution) \u201cfrom me during my lifetime <em>or under the provisions of this my will,\u201d </em>shall be taken into account. These words can receive no possible interpretation, which does not necessitate the enlargement of the meaning of the word \u201cadvancement\u201d so as to cover all sums received by the beneficiary from the executors in the course of their administration of the estate, including, for example, the very legacy which is here the subject of controversy. It is clear, therefore, that the word \u201cad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>vancement\u201d is not to be limited to its strict technical sense, and I take it that, entirely apart from the consideration whether the \u00a75,000 which the petitioner received from his father was a loan or a gift, it was an \u201cadvancement,\u201d within the true meaning of that word as used by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The case of Chase v. Ewing <em>(51 </em>Barb., <em>597) </em>has been cited in support of the opposite view. The will there under consideration contained this clause: \u201cWhatever <em>advances </em>I have made to any of my children .... for which any receipts or other evidences of indebtedness may be found among my papers after my decease, I hereby give and devise to my said children, to each one the advance made to each, my intention being by this that such receipt or other evidence of indebtedness shall not be calculated or enforced against them or either of them who may have signed the same.\u201d The court held that \u201c the entire tenor and scope of the clause showed clearly that the testator had in view, not gifts and advancements previously made <em>as </em>such, but only advances in the nature of loans, for which the testator held vouchers whereby the claims could be enforced. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">This was simply a determination that, under the particular facts and circumstances there appearing, the word \u201cadvancesas used by the testator, was so limited in its meaning as not to include <em>\u201cadvancements\u201d </em>in the ordinary acceptation of that term. The case has little bearing here, but the tendency of the decision is rather for than against the conclusion which I have reached in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The petition herein is granted, and a decree may be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
