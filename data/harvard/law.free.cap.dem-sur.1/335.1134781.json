Bertine, the executor therein named, On December 23d, 1881, another paper, bearing date August 30th, 1881, was presented to the coui\u2019t by one Hubbell, named as executor therein, as the last will of the deceased, accompanied by a petition praying for the revocation of the probate of the former, one, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>later paper be admitted to probate as her last will and testament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\">After a contest, the later paper was decreed to be such last will, and the former probate was revoked.

I am inclined to think that, where the paper has already been admitted to probate, and a subsequent and successful effort, resisted by him in good faith, is made to revoke it and establish another paper as the last will, he is entitled to costs as in the former case. The reason for allowing costs in the one case is as strong as in the other, the spirit of the contest in both cases being the same. I think, therefore, the section warrants the allowance of costs to the contestant who was executor of the former will, the probate of which is now revoked, there being no doubt as to his having acted in good faith. The motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
