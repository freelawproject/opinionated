Y. Supp. 1054; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>12 Hun, 207; <em>Matter of De Pierris, </em>79 Hun, 279; <em>Matter of Patterson, </em>63 Hun, 529.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ASU\">Nothing in the order of the Supreme Court deprived the Surrogate\u2019s Court of its jurisdiction to direct the respondent-administratrix to account to the appellant. While that order fixed the amount of the appellant\u2019s lien and directed payment thereof out of the estate, the question remained whether and, if so, to what extent, the distributable estate was sufficient for that purpose after determination of the respective rights of the persons entitled to distribution. It was, therefore, error to dismiss the appellant\u2019s objections on the ground that he had no interest in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The order of the Appellate Division and the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should be reversed, with costs in all courts to the appellant, payable out of the estate, and the matter remitted to the Surrogate\u2019s Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Crane, Ch.
