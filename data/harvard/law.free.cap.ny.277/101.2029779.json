Minard </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>228 App. Div. 596; <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>64 N. Y. 471; <em>Clover Crest Stock Farms, Inc., </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. M. F. Ins.

The testimony as to the offer of dedication and acceptance by the village of the streets amply supports the findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>61 N. Y. 448.) No formal resolution adopting the map of the village of South Mount Vernon prepared by the surveyor, Burrowes, was necessary. No such formality was required of village trustees, and the fact of its acceptance was conclusively established by both documentary and paroi evidence. <em>(Stockwell </em>v. <em>Dunckel, </em>174 App. Div. 481; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>61 N.

They were located on property known as South Vernon Park which was owned by a Mr. Cranford and he regulated, graded and macadamized them. Prior to the annexation of this territory to the old city of New York in 1895, it was included within the village of South Mount Vernon in Westchester county. The name of the village had then been changed to village of Wakefield.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On July 8, 1890, the trustees of the village of South Mount Vernon had adopted a resolution calling for bids \u201c for the surveying and grading of all the streets and avenues of South Mount Vernon * * * with the exception of the Eingsbridge Road,\u201d and on July 14, 1890, they adopted a resolution awarding to Richard W. Burrowes the contract for such surveying and grading, the work to be done under the personal supervision of the committee on streets and sidewalks. In conformity with this resolution, Burrowes prepared the map of the village, was paid for it by the village and upon it appears these three streets as well as the other streets within the boundaries of the Cranford property. Although there is no formal resolution directing the filing of this map with the village clerk, there is oral evidence that, after the village had paid the surveyor, it was delivered into the possession of the clerk and used by him. This oral evidence does not contradict anything in the official minutes and we think that it was admissible. Upon this map appears the legend, \u201c Village of South Mount Vernon, R. W. Burrowes C. E. January 1891.\u201d There is documentary evidence that, prior to annexation to the city of New York, the trustees of the village caused additional water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>hydrants and lights to be installed on several of the streets included within the Cranford property, thus recognizing the streets included within that area and appearing upon the official village map prepared by Burrowes as part of the public street system. Such recognition of those particular streets must be deemed to apply to all the streets in that area which appear upon the village map. All or none were accepted as public streets. After annexation of the village to the city of New York, men employed by the city cleaned Osman Place, Vernon Parkway East and Vernon Parkway North, the three streets involved in this litigation and worked on and repaired many of the streets included within the map of the Cranford property. Prior and subsequent to annexation, Osman Place, Vernon Parkway East and Vernon Parkway North were used by the public for vehicular and pedestrial traffic. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Underhill (144 </em>N. Y. 316) there was no user; in <em>Matter of Wallace Avenue </em>(222 N. Y. 139) the private way never appeared upon an official map; in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>City of Niagara Falls </em>(230 N. Y. 77) the map was made and filed by the owner and not through the act of the municipal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The orders should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Grane, Ch. J., Lehman, Hubbs, Loughban, Finch and Rippey, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
