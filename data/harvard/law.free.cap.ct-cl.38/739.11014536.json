The claimant herein, a citizen of the1.United States, is secretary and disbursing agent of -the' Interstate Commerce Commission, and as such agent it becomes his duty to disburse the moneys appropriated by Congress from time to time to enable the Commission to carry out the provisions of the act of February 4, 1887, and amendments thereto. The disbursements were made under the . direction of the Commission, and the accounts therefor, together with itemized vouchers, approved by the chairman of the Commission, were presented to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department for the quarter and year ending June 30, 1899, and also his supplemental accounts, with vouchers so made out and approved, for the same year, among which were the accounts and itemized vouchers for $310.37 for money paid from time to time to the Western Union Telegraph Company and Postal Telegraph Cable Company for sundry dispatches sent over their lines under the direction of said Commission.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b761-11\">II. The accounts for money so expended for telegrams were disallowed by the Auditor for the State and other Departments, and on appeal to the Comptroller of the Treasury the decision of the Auditor was sustained on the ground that the claimant had not complied with the requirement of the Comptroller to furnish the original telegrams or copies thereof, or, if of a confidential nature, to furnish in lieu thereof a certificate to that effect signed by the chairman of the Commission.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In response to that ruling the claimant presented and filed with his said accounts the following order, issued by the Commission April 27, 1899:</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-4\">\u201cThat so much of the Comptroller\u2019s communication as requires copies of telegrams relating to the business of the Commission to accompany telegraph vouchers for which -credit is asked be disregarded by the secretary and disbursing agent, the Commission holding that such messages are so far 'confidential as to justify refusal to disclose their contents, and that the requirement for their production is unreasonable and against public interest.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-5\">.And that the Interstate Commerce Commission did, through their secretary, address to the 1-Ion. R. J. Tracewell, Comptroller of the Treasury, a letter dated Octob\u00e9r 4, 1900, containing an invitation to inspect the hooks, papers, and other matters relating to the accounts of the disbursing agent as follows, viz:</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-6\">\u201cBy the act of March 15, 1898, acts 1897-98, page 316, it is provided:</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-7\">\u201cSec. 5. All books, papers, and other matters relating to the accounts of officers of the Government in the District of Columbia shall at all times be subject to the inspection and examination by the Comptroller of the Treasury and Auditors of the Treasury authorized to settle such accounts or by the duly authorized agents of either of said officers.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-8\">\u201cI am authorized by the Commission to extend to the officers and agents referred to in this section the fullest opportunity of making such examination, in the offices of the Commission, of all such books, papers, and other matter relating to the accounts of the disbursing agents as they may see proper to examine, and among these all such telegrams as are embraced in the accounts of the disbursing agent. By this means the objections which the Commission have made to the undue publicity of their telegrams will in some measure be avoided, and the purposes of the auditing officers should be thereby fully attained.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-9\">But the decision of the Comptroller was adhered to.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AkQf\">III. The accounts and itemized vouchers were presented to the accounting officers in the form prescribed by statute \u2014 that is to say, that each telegram sent by the Commission and the cost thereof, and the dates, numbers of words, persons from and to whom sent, places from and to which sent, and the charge of each message transmitted were fully shown in a voucher approved by Martin A. Knapp, chairman \u2014 and the defendants concede the correctness of the several amounts so expended.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b762-12\">IV. After the disallowance of the claimant\u2019s accounts for the moneys so disbursed to the Western Union Telegraph Company and Postal Telegraph Cable Company, as aforesaid, and to avoid any balance being stated against him, he, under protest, paid into the Treasury of the United States the full amount of the sum so disallowed, to wit, $310.37.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>V. </em>That prior to January, 1899, the original telegrams, or copies thereof, or certificates that such telegrams were of a confidential character, were not required by the auditing officers of the Treasury to be produced by the disbursing officers of the Department of State, or the Post-Office Department, or the Navy Department, or the Interstate Commerce Commission, with the vouchers produced by these disbursing officers for the telegrams sent from such Departments on official business.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b763-5\">VI.
