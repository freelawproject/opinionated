The claimant was born in Canada, a subject of the British Crown. He declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States before the District Court of Woodbury County, Iowa, March 12, 1858. It is claimed that he was admitted to become a citizen of the United States by the District Court of the first judicial district of the Territory of Nebraska, within and for the county of Richardson, on the 25th day of September, 1863. The judge and clerk of said Territorial court died before the proceedings were had in March, 1897, for the <em>nvnopro tuna </em>order. To establish his citizenship the claimant relies exclusively upon the following-record, made by the District Court for the first judicial district of the State of Nebraska (successor of said District Court of the Territory), on application made March 29, 1897:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">\u201cBe it remembered that at a term of the District Court holden in and for said county, in Falls City therein, on the 29th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, the following among other proceedings were had, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">\u201cIn re Charles Gagnon, application and motion, nunc pro tunc, to supply record of naturalization as a citizen of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-11\">\u201cThis cause came on to be heard on motion of Charles Gagnon for an order nunc pro tunc to supply omission in the record wherein the judgment of naturalization of the said Charles Gagnon as a citizen of the United States pronounced by this court at its September term, A.

B-. King.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-16\">V. A search of the records of the District Court of Richardson County, Nebr., at Falls City, made by a special attorney of the Department of Justice, and admitted ats evidence - by agreement of parties, discloses the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-17\">From the organization of the court down \"to and including the year 1862, the records are complete and include an appearance docket, a trial calendar upon which is docketed eveiy case that was tried, and upon which also is shown the minutes made by the judge at the time the cases were heard. There are also journals of the. court in which are spread at length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the orders entered in the various cases tried. Subsequent to the year 1863 there are also appearance dockets, trial dockets, and journals, kept in practically the same form as at present, showing the action of the court, as in those prior to 1863. The appearance docket covering the year 1863 is one which was begun prior to that jmar, and which covers the year 1862. It also covers the year 1864 and several years subsquent thereto. This appearance docket, however, shows but the entry of five cases during the year 1863. The cases at that time were docketed three upon a page, and there are numerous blank pages after the docketing of the last five cases for 1863, before the docketing of the first case in 1864. The first trial docket made up after the year 1862 has upon it each of the five cases appearing upon the appearance docket for 1863, and also shows foidy-seven other cases docketed during the year 1863, but not appearing upon the appearance docket. Some of these show, however, that they are petitions for new trial, eases appealed from justice court, motions for confirmation of sheriff\u2019s sales, transfers of cases from other counties, and other proceedings which an inspection of the appearance docket shows it evidently was not the custom to place upon the appearance docket. Deducting matters of this nature from the full number of cases docketed upon the trial docket which had been filed in 1863 leaves such a number of cases as should have appeared upon the appearance docket as could be docketed upon the pages left blank in the appearance docket between the cases docketed in 1863 and those docketed in 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\">VI. There is no record or memorandum or other paper of any kind in the records of said court or among the files thereof showing or relating to an application by Charles Gagnon for naturalization before said District Court, nor was there an}r such paper in the records of said court on the 29th and 30th daj^s of March, 1897, when the proceedings for restoration of the record of naturalization were taken, nor does it appear that a certificate of naturalization was ever issued or delivered to the claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">VII. Upon the foregoing findings of fact the court finds the ultimate fact, so far as it is a question of fact, that the claimant, Charles Gagnon, was not at the time of the depreciation \u00e1 citizen of the United States. \u2019 '</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Mr. William K. Harvey </em>and <em>Mr. William B. King </em>for the claimants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-4\">It has been held both in the State courts and in the United States courts that naturalization proceedings regular on their face can not bo attacked. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Pease </em>(30 Barb. 588, 604) the court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">\u201cThe judge at the trial also suffered the party to attack the certificate of naturalization by evidence aliunde, and to show that it was procured by fraud; that its recitals were false,- and that the party was not entitled to be naturalized. The certificate was the legal evidence of the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction collaterally in question in the action. It was final and conclusive. It imported absolute verity, and could not, if valid on its face, be thus impeached in this action. When alienage is in issue, the judgment of the court admitting the alien to become a citizen is conclusive evidence upon that point. <em>{Ritchie </em>v. Putnam, 13 Wend., 524.) A record of naturalization can not be contradicted by extrinsic proof that no declaration of intention had in truth been made. <em>{Banks </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>3 Barb. Oh. Hep., 438.) Like any other judgment, it is complete evidence of its own validity. <em>{SprattY. Spratt, </em>4 Pet., 393.)\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">In the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Me Gowan </em>(77 Ill., 644, 646) the people offered to prove that McGowan had not declared his intention to become a citizen prior to the date of his naturalization, and other facts tending to show that he was not then qualified to be a citizen. This evidence was excluded by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">In the <em>State </em>v. <em>IFoeflinger </em>(35 Wis., 393, 400) the court held that the record of naturalization was conclusive upon the question in a collateral proceeding. \u201cIt was the record of a judgment and imports absolute verity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-8\">This doctrine has been carried to such an extent that United States courts have refused to cancel a certificate of naturalization because it had been obtained by fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-9\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gleason </em>(78 Fed. Rep., 396), in the Circuit Coui\u2019t for the eastern district of New York, an attempt was made to set aside a certificate of naturalization on the ground that it had been obtained upon false representations made to the court, but the bill was dismissed on the ground that the naturalization in the superior court of the city of New York must be held conclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The court, in its opinion, says, referring to the allegation that false statements had been made in procuring the decree of naturalization\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-4\">\u201cBut, whatever the fact was, the administration of the oaths and issuing of the certificate showed the satisfaction of the court as to the. requirements, constituting a judgment of admission to citizenship, with the force of such a judgment upon the status of the applicant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">\u201cIn <em>Gamphell </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(6 Cranch, 176), Washington, J., said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">\u201c \u2018But if the oath be administered and nothing appears tp the contrary, it must be presumed that the court before whom the oath was taken was satisfied as to the character of the applicant. The oath, when taken, confers upon him the rights of a citizen, and amounts to a judgment of the court for his admission to those rights.\u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">The court quotes the paragraph from <em>Spratt </em>v. <em>Spratt </em>(4 Pet., 392, <em>supra), </em>and continues:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">\u201cAnd in <em>JEx pa/rte Gregg </em>(2 Curt., 98 Fed.

The court\u2019s records of 1863 are not only silent as to what was done, but no paper or memorandum of any kind was among the records or before the court in 1897 from which the court could infer that such a proceeding had been commenced. The proceedings in 1897 therefore were not to amend a defective or incomplete record of which there was some basis to show a mistake, but were to supply an alleged omitted record in a matter wherein the record and files of the court not only fail to show that anjr proceedings were had, but fail to shoAV that any such proceedings had been commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Blackstone in his Commentaries (rol. 8, p. 407), in speaking of writs of error, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Formerly the suitors were much perplexed bjT writs of error brought upon very slight or trivial grounds, as misspelling and other mistakes of the clerks, all which might be amended at common law, while all the proceedings were in paper, for they were then considered as only <em>in fieri </em>and therefore subject to the control of the courts. But when once the record was made up it was formerly held that by the common law no amendment could be permitted, unless within the very terms in which the judicial act as recorded was done; for during the term the record is in the breast of the court, but afterwards it admitted of no alteration. But now the courts are becoming more liberal and, where justice requires it, will allow of amendments at any term while the suit is depending, notwithstanding the record be made up and the term be passed. For they at present consider the proceedings as <em>in fieri </em>until judgment is given, and therefore that till then they have power to permit amendments by the common law; but when judgment is once given and enrolled, no amendment is permitted in any subsequent term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The origin and history of the general doctrine of amendments as outlined in that Commentary, page 408, are well stated in the case of <em>Bilansky </em>v. <em>State of Minnesota </em>(3 Minnesota, 427-429).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In that case, which was a capital one, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">;\u2018If a jury is sworn according to law, or any other of the \u25a0ordinary proceedings take place in the progress of the trial of a cause, and the clerk omits to record the fact, we see no reason \\vh}T the record should not be made to conform to the truth, even after the term, when there exists no doubt about what the truth is. Every reason is in favor of such change being made; public justice demands it, as well for the punishment of the offender as for the protection of the accused, according as the nature of the proposed amendment may operate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Bishop on Criminal Law, section 1160, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201c When the term of the court has closed, it is too late to undo, at a subsequent term, what was done at the former term. A judgment of the court, for instance, can not then bo opened and modified or sot aside. Neither, it has been held, can the clerk at a subsequent term make an entiy of what truly transpired at the preceding term. But this refers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>to the power of the clerk, proceeding of his own motion. The court may order <em>nunopro tuno </em>entries, as they are called, to supply some'omission in the entry of what was done at the preceding term; yet this is a power the extent of which is limited and not easily defined. In general, mere clerical errors may be amended in this way. So of the mistake of the clerk in the name of the judge before whom the indictment was found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In the case of <em>In re Wight </em>(134 U.

An extensive list of authorities is cited in the footnote of Mr. Bishop, and among those which ' support the power of the court to make a record of some matter which was done at a former term, of which the clerk has made no entry, the following cases directly affirm that proposition: Galloway, Administrator, v. <em>McKeithen, </em>5 Ired. (Law), 12; <em>Hyde v. Curling, </em>10 Mo., 374; <em>State </em>v. Clark, 18 Mo., 432; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>3 McLean, 379, and <em>Blansky </em>v. <em>The State of Minnesota, </em>3 Minnesota, 427.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In the case of <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Curling (supra), </em>which was a civil suit, it was held, as stated in the syllabus, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cA court has power to order entries of proceedings had by the court at a previous term to be made <em>nunc pro inonc, </em>but where the court has omitted to make an order which it might or ought to have made, it can not at a subsequent term be made <em>mono pro tuncT</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">And in the case of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Barker (supra), </em>where an objection was made to the amendment on the ground that there was nothing to amend by, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201cAt common law the court could only give leave to amend when there was something to amend by, and anciently amendments were required to be made at the term at which the error occurred, but now an amendment may be made at any time before judgment, and in some cases after judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">But that ruling appears to' be based on section 32 of the judiciary act of 1789, known as the statute of jeofailes and amendments of the United States now embodied in Revised Statutes, section 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>So that tbe reliance by the claimant\u2019s counsel on the case of <em>In re Wight (supra) </em>to support the doctrine that the court is not restricted to record evidence in amending its record after the term at which the proceedings were had does not appear to be well founded, as the court, citing section 954, saying, \u201c it is as liberal in the powers which it confers on the courts to make amendments as any of those enacted in more modern times,\u201d adds that, \u201cwe are forced to the conclusion that the action of the Circuit Court in making the order for a <em>wane pro tunc </em>record, which showed that the case had been remanded from that court to the District Court prior to the tim\u00e9 when the sentence was passed upon the prisoner, was a legitimate exercise of power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">It will thus be seen that the language in that opinion, saying in effect that the court is not restricted to record evidence in amending its record at a subsequent term, must be read in connection with section 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The Supreme Court of Indiana has been uniform in its holding that after the expiration of the term <em>nune pro tunc </em>enti\u2019ies to amend .the. record of a proceeding at a prior term can only be made upon some record or memoradum paper or other minutes in the case from which it can be clearly shown what took place. <em>(Boyd </em>v.

Gutcheus, 18 Ill., 390, approved in 94 Ill., 525, and 165 Ill., 417.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">In the case of <em>Balch v. Shaw </em>(7 Cush., 282-284), in speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of the power of the courts during and after the term to correct clerical errors, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that it is competent for a court of record, under its general, inherent, and necessary authority, to correct the mistakes and supply the defect of its clerk or recording officer, so as to have the record conform to the actual facts and truth of the case, and that this may be done at any time as well after as during the term, <em>mine pro Pune. </em>The length of time in this case, between the granting of the license and. making up the record, does not take away the right or jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">But the court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201cThis was not a case of want of jurisdiction, in which the record can not be amended, because, there being an omission to act, there is nothing to record; in such case the defect is not in the record, but in the action of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The converse of that appears to us to apply to the present case; that is to say, there was nothing before the court making the <em>nunc pro tune </em>entry to show that it was the entry of an order previously made. There was no record or memo-r\u00e1ndum of any kind before the court from which it could be inferred that the procedings for the naturalization of the claimant had taken place or had ever been commenced, and for that reason the court\u2019s jurisdiction was wanting unless the omission of such record and paper can be supplied by the recollection of witnesses a generation thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Furthermore, the matter was not in the breast, of the court, for the judge who held the court in 1863, as well as the clerk thereof, had theretofore died.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The proposition that a record can not be amended after the term unless there is something in the record to amend bjr is supported by many cases, other than those cited, some of which are <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>6 Bush. (Ky.), 547; <em>Shackleford </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>63 Miss., 128; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>25 Pa., 218; <em>State ex rel. v. Prim, </em>61 Mo., 166, and many other cases which might be cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Such was the view of Bishop in regard to the manner of making amendments, for in his Criminal Procedure, section 1315, he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">\u201cThe better way is believed to be to make, in the record of the term at which the amendment is offered, an entry to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>effect that, <em>whereas on inspection of the record of the preceding term an error therein </em>appears, etc., it is considered that the same be corrected and amended, etc., setting out the amendment.\u2019'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">True, in the case of <em>Balch </em>v. <em>Shaw (supra) </em>it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">\u201cIt was further said in argument that th\u201eere was no sufficient material from which to make up the record. But the court of common pleas, having exclusive right and jurisdiction in the matter, were the proper judges of the necessity and propriety of extending the record, and of the proofs and of the sufficiency of the proofs txpon which to proceed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">That was said with reference to the issue in that case, which was one of law, there being no question of fact in dispute, and that was that \u201c if the court should be of the opinion that there was a sufficient record of the order of the court of common pleas, made at the October term, 1824, to sell the demanded premises, judgment should be rendered for the tenant,\u201d who was relying on the order then made to support his title acquired bjr purchase at the sale thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The court hold that there \u201cwas a sufficient record of the order of the court of common pleas\u201d to sell the premises, and hence there was no question of jurisdiction; and the coxirt of common pleas having, as the court say, \u201cthe exclusive right and jurisdiction in the matter,\u201d such eoiirt was the judge \u201cof the proofs and of the sufficiency of the proofs ivponwhich to proceed.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In the case of <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Wenzell </em>(8 Cush., 315), which was a case of assumpsit on a promissory note, where the juiy returned a verdict for the plaintiff and the defendant moved for a new trial, as appears from a written motion filed in the case, no entry of the motion appeared on the docket, but there was an indorsement on the motion for a new trial made by the judge before whom the motion was argued, directing, in substance, that the motion should be overruled and judgment be entered upon the verdict, but no entry thereof was made on the docket. After the indorsement of the motion as aforesaid the case was continued from term to term.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The plaintiff contended that the entry was erroneous and had been made by mistake, and offered p'arol evidence thereof in addition to the written motion and the indorsement thereon, while the defendant insisted that the memorandum on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>docket constituted the record of the proceedings in the case, and denied the authority of the court to alter and annul the record of the doings of the conrt at a former term, and also objected to the competency of the evidence offered by the plaintiff; but the presiding judge overruled the objections and received the evidence and entered on the docket the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">\u201cAnd now it appearing to the court here that the entry on the docket at the December term, 1848, \u2018verdict set aside, new trial granted,\u2019 is erroneous and was made by mistake, and that no such order was ever made by the court, it is now ordered that the said minute be struck out and erased; and it also fui\u2019ther appearing that the entry in the docket at the December, term, 1849, \u2018judgment on the verdict\u2019 is erroneous, and that the same ought to be arrested, it is ordered by the court here that the said minute be struck out and erased. And now at the present term of court it is ordered and determined by the court that the motion of the defendant for a new trial be overruled and disallowed, and that judgment be now entered on the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On appeal, the court, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201c In the present case the court of common pleas had the power to order this amendment of the record. The amount and kind of evidence requisite to satisfy that court, as to what was the real order of the court and what was the proper entry on the docket or extended record, must rest with that court. Having the authority to correct their own record, it is to be presumed that any amendment of the record made by them will be in accordance with the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">There it will be observed there were papers among the files and indorsements thereon which gave the court jurisdiction in the premises, and jurisdiction once acquired the court could admit such evidence, oral or otherwise, as it saw fit to ascertain the truth of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The claimant\u2019s counsel abty contend, and cite numerous authorities to support their contention, that a court of record has the inherent right and power to make <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entries to correct mistakes so as to conform its record to the actual truth of past transactions; and that contention, in view of the numerous authorities, both of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the several States, can not be controverted. But the authorities cited by the claimant, as well as others we have examined, are all in cases where it appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>from the record that a cause was pending, and in many cases there was some memorandum, minute, or indorsement on the records or on the papers among the files sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to proceed; and where there is sufficient substance the record may be supplemented by oral testimony, but where there is a total absence of substance \u2014 i. e., no record, paper, or memorandum \u2014 from which it could be inferred that any such proceeding was even commenced, there is nothing to amend. Hence the alleged certificate of naturalization in this case purporting to be \u201can order <em>mine pro tnne </em>to supply omission in the records wherein the judgment of naturalization of the claimant as a citizen of the United States pronounced by the court at its September term, 1863, and which it is claimed was through negligence or inadvertence of the clerk unrecorded, or if recorded, lost or destroyed, is not conclusive and may properly be attacked in this court. <em>(Thompson </em>v. Whitman, 18 Wall., 457; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>133 U. S., 107; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Saul, </em>138 U. S., 439, 448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">While lapse of time in a proper case may not take away the right or jurisdiction of a court to make <em>name fro tune </em>entries to conform its record to the truth, it is an element to be considered in this case, where there is a total absence of any record showing that the claimant ever applied to become a citizen, and hence the <em>name gyro tame </em>entry was rather an original order made now for then than an entry made now for then of an order previously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Coward </em>(3 Hill, S. C.) where the clerk had made no entiy on the minutes of the court of a judgment in summary process, it was held that there was nothing on which a <em>scire facias </em>to revive could issue; nor would amotion to amend by entering judgment <em>nunc gyro time </em>he granted for the reason that there was no judgment to amend; that \u201cwhere judicial proceedings are imperfect, the court to which they belong will amend them, as long as there is anything to.amend.\u201d That language is applicable to the present case. There is no substance upon which to ground a right to amend, especially after the lapse of a generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Therefore the authorities cited bjr the claimant in support of the proposition that the certified copy of the record of naturalization of an alien, like any other record of a court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>imports <em>verity, </em>are <em>not- in </em>point, for the reason that there was nothing in the record or among the files of the court to show that any such judgment had either been entered or ordered to be entered. There was nothing to amend \u2014 no mistake to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">No certificate of naturalization appears to have been issued to the claimant at the time he claims to have been naturalized, and hence the beginning of th e proceeding as well as the action of the' court rests solety in .the recollection of witnesses. Therefore, we arc not disposed to accept the certificate of the <em>nunc jpro tunc </em>judgment of naturalization as sufficient to establish the claimant\u2019s citizenship, and his petition will accordingly be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-5\">Howry, J., did not sit in this case and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
