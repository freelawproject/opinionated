He is, in fact, a lieutenant and entitled to a larger proportion of the bounty than he received. After he has been paid and the fund distributed he brings suit for the difference between the share of an ensign and a lieutenant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b74-8\">I. Where the distribution of a fund awarded to the officers and men of a vessel engaged in the destruction of a Spanish vessel has been made and an officer has accepted the amount awarded to him, it is too late for him to come in and claim a proportionate amount on higher rank than that awarded him.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b74-9\">II.

The force of the said Alphonso XII, excluding the shore batteries, was inferior to the force of the United States taking part in said engagement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-16\">Y. The number of men on board the said enemy\u2019s vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>destroyed, as stated in finding m, was at the commencement of the action 116.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">VI.

If he had been paid as lieutenant, junior grade, he would have been entitled to 1191.22.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-5\"><em>Air. WilUam B.

Upon the coming in of the report of the auditor he appeared in open court by-counsel (the same counsel also representing the other petitioners) and obtained the entry of an order directing that the decisions, rules, and findings of this court relating to the bounty, together with the list prepared by the auditor, be transmitted to the Navy Department for the purpose of having distribution made of the individual shares of the officers and enlisted men severally entitled thereto, as determined bjr the court in respect to their several cases, or as decided under like conditions in other cases of naval bounty. Thus, bj^ his own act, as well as by the act of the Department, it resulted that, plaintiff did not share in the bounty as a lieutenant of the junior grade, to which he was entitled to be promoted as of and preceding the day of the battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">There is no question but that plaintiff was underpaid. <em>(In re Engagement at Manila </em>Bay, 36 C. Cls. R., 208.) But the United States have paid $11,600, the total amount of bounty due for the destruction of the enemy\u2019s vessel off the coast of Cuba. The distribution has been made and plaintiff took the part assigned to him as an ensign.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The jurisdiction of the court can be invoked after failure of the accounting officers of the Treasury to do more exact justice <em>(Medbury </em>v. <em>United States, </em>173 U. S. R., 497), but not where a creditor has contributed by his conduct to mislead the accounting officers, assented to a schedule apportioning unto him a distributive share smaller than that he was entitled to receive, and afterwards accepting in payment a sum less' than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>that which he might have obtained had he been more careful in the assertion of his rights, at the same time permitting the only fund available for payment to be applied to the settlement of claims against it aggregating enough, with the amount apparently due to him, to absorb the entire fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">It would be difficult to find a more equitable case of estoppel <em>in pais. </em>It does not alter the situation to say that the error was the result of a clerical inadvertence, and that the auditor\u2019s report was never formally approved by the court. Nor does the intimation made at the argument that the report being on file only two days before its transmission to the Navy Department left plaintiff without adequate opportunity to object to the erroneously small award in his favor. Plaintiff\u2019s haste took the report to the proper department at the end of two days, where it lay some time before actual distribution of the fund. The report was based on the petition and roster, and was ratified by the action of the parties in interest as effectually as if the court had formally approved it. The Government having paid what it was legally required to pay can not be made to pay a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Plaintiff has lost his remedy, and his petition is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
