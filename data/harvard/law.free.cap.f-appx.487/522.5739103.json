The presentence investigation report concluded that he was a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov.1998). Because Jackson was a career offender and the offense carried a maximum life sentence, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 37. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1(A). After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, Jackson\u2019s total offense level was 34. As a career offender, Jackson\u2019s criminal history category was VI. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. The result was a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months in prison. The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced Jackson to 262 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Jackson \u00a1filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 to the guidelines had reduced his guidelines range. The district court denied Jackson\u2019s motion, concluding that it lacked authority to reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence because he had been sentenced under the career offender guideline. This is Jackson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The district court did not err in denying Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), we held that \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s [otherwise applicable] base offense level, but does not alter the [career offender] sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore </em>controls here. Amendment 750 reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine trafficking crimes, but it did not reduce the offense level for a career offender subject to a maximum life sentence. For that reason, Amendment 750 did not lower Jackson\u2019s career offender guidelines range, so the district court is not authorized to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[Section 3582(c)(2) ], the Sentencing Commission\u2019s corresponding policy statement, and the commentary to that policy statement all make it clear that a court cannot use an amendment to reduce a sentence in a particular case unless that amendment actually lowers the guidelines range in that case. It is that simple.\u201d). Jackson argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated our decision in <em>Moore, </em>but we have already rejected that argument in another case. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
