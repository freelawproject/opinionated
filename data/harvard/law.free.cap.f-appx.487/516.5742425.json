McGee, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Based on a report and recommendation by a magistrate judge, the district court dismissed McGee\u2019s petition on the basis that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and even if he had, his claims failed on the merits. On appeal, McGee contends that: (1) the district court violated his due process rights by not considering his timely filed objections to that magistrate judge\u2019s report; and (2) his \u00a7 2241 petition should not have been dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because he qualified for a \u201cfutility exception\u201d to that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">On September 8, 2011, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending dismissal of McGee\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and giving the parties 14 days after receiving the report to file any objections. On September 26, 14 days later, he timely delivered his objections to prison authorities for filing. <em>See Day v. Hall, </em>528 F.3d 1315, 1318 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cUnder the mailbox rule ... a prisoner\u2019s pleading is considered filed on the date the prisoner delivers such to prison authorities for filing.\u201d). On September 27, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report, finding that no objections had been filed. On September 28, McGee\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report were noted on the court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">McGee then filed a motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). However, the district court, \u201c[hjaving considered the Motions and the record\u201d and \u201c[ujpon reviewing] McGee\u2019s Motion and his Objections,\u201d denied McGee\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Bowers v. Keller, </em>651 F.3d 1277, 1291 (11th Cir.2011). And we review only for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>Although McGee contends the district court violated his due process rights by failing to consider his timely filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court\u2019s order denying McGee\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion subsequently considered and addressed the merits of those objections. Therefore, the district court did not deny McGee any rights to due process. <em>See United States v. Williamson, </em>339 F.3d 1295, 1305 n. 18 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">McGee also contends the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Relying on <em>Winck v. England, </em>327 F.3d 1296 (11th Cir.2003), he argues that he was not required to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cwhere it can be demonstrated that it is futile to exhaust administrative remedies before proceeding to Federal court.\u201d <em>Winck </em>held, however, that the \u201cfutility exception\u201d applied to remedies sought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, not those sought under \u00a7 2241 claims as McGee\u2019s. <em>Compare id. </em>at 1299, 1304 (\u201cWe have also expressly concluded that exhaustion is not a jurisdictional bar to habeas relief when seeking release from state custody pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.... Generally, exhaustion is not required [under \u00a7 2254] where ... an administrative appeal would be futile.\u201d (quotation marks and emphasis omitted)), <em>with id. </em>at 1300 n. 1. (\u201cBy contrast, exhaustion of administrative remedies is jurisdictional, when a petition for writ of habeas corpus is brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for release from a federal prison.\u201d (alteration and quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that \u201cprisoners seeking habeas relief, including relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241, are subject to administrative exhaustion requirements\u201d); <em>Cf. Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 1825 n. 6, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (\u201cThat Congress has mandated exhaustion in either case defeats the argument of Booth and supporting am-ici that this reading of [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1997e is at odds with traditional doctrines of administrative exhaustion, under which a litigant ... need not exhaust where doing so would otherwise be futile. Without getting into the force of this claim generally, we stress the point ... that we will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where Congress has provided otherwise.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted)). McGee has not cited any case establishing that there is a futility exception to the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies under \u00a7 2241 petition. Because McGee did not exhaust his administrative remedies, the district court did not have jurisdiction to review his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-4\">.
