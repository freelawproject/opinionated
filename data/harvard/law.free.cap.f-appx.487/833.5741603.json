Owenga also moves for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) decision influences the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of Owenga\u2019s request for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">Although we are not precluded from reviewing claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions, see \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Owenga has not demonstrated that the BIA\u2019s improper inclusion of a driving while intoxicated offense among his criminal convictions actually caused him prejudice. The BIA\u2019s decision makes clear that while it did consider Owenga\u2019s criminal history in totality, it gave particularly significant weight to Owenga\u2019s theft conviction and his conviction for evading arrest, noting the recency and the seriousness of both convictions. The BIA explicitly concluded that the fact that Owenga had committed two serious crimes within months of each other, had committed the evading arrest crime while on probation, and had placed the community at risk by engaging the police in a high-speed chase in order to evade arrest, had essentially cancelled out any positive equities that may have militated in favor of the grant of discretion. <em>See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s due process claim where she failed to allege that she suffered from substantial prejudice). Nor has Owenga shown that the BIA improperly relied upon errors made by the IJ. <em>See Zhu, </em>493 F.3d at 593; <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Owenga\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED, IN PART, FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION and DENIED, IN PART. Owenga\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
