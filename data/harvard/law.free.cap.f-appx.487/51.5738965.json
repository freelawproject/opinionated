Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-20\">In his <em>Bivens </em>action, Colon alleged that Appellee Frontino, an official at the United States Penitentiary-Allenwood, assaulted him in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. The Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation indicating that the action should be dismissed because Colon had not exhausted his administrative remedies. In an order entered June 11, 2012, the District Court adopted the report and recommendation, and dismissed the action without prejudice. Colon timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Jenkins v. Morton, </em>148 F.3d 257, 259 (3d Cir.1998). We may summarily affirm the decision of the District Court if no substantial question is presented on appealed Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-22\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) prohibits an inmate from bringing a civil rights suit alleging specific acts of unconstitutional conduct by prison officials \u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement applies to federal prisoners, like Colon, seeking relief through a <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>Nyhuis v. Reno, </em>204 F.3d 65, 69 (3d Cir.2000). Colon conceded in his complaint that, although he had commenced the inmate grievance process, it had not yet been completed. Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.^</p>\n<p id=\"b77-23\">Accordingly, because we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
