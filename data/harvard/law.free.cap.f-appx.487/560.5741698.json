Days before his trial began, the government gave Mr. Hill a CD with recordings of his conversations in jail. In order to review the CD, Mr. Hill asked the district court to continue the trial. The district court, as allowed by the Speedy Trial Act, granted Mr. Hill\u2019s request for a continuance. A jury later convicted Mr. Hill, and he now appeals his conviction. According to Mr. Hill, because the government waited so long to deliver the CD, the government forced his trial\u2019s postponement, and this postponement violated his right to a speedy trial. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Mr. Hill made an appearance before a magistrate judge and entered a plea of not guilty on August 12, 2010. The district court scheduled Mr. Hill\u2019s trial for October 4, 2010. The district court also issued a standing discovery order. The standing discovery order, in essence, dictated when and how the parties were to exchange evidence. Among other things, that order required the government to provide Mr. Hill with any recorded statements within its \u201cpossession, custody, and/or control\u201d and any evidence that it knew (or should have known) existed by August 27, 2010. <em>See </em>R. 1:28 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">As Mr. Hill sat in jail, the government began to record his telephone conversations. The standing discovery order demanded that both sides disclose, \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d any \u201cnewly discovered information or other material within the scope\u201d of the standing order, which included Mr. Hill\u2019s recorded conversations. <em>Id </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On October 1, 2010 \u2014 three days before trial was to begin \u2014 the government delivered a CD with the recorded conversations to Mr. Hill. Two days later, Mr. Hill\u2019s counsel filed a motion in which he asked that the district court bar the government from introducing any of Mr. Hill\u2019s recorded conversations as evidence at trial or, alternatively, to continue the trial. <em>See </em>R. 1:53 at 1. The standing discovery order apparently contemplated such a motion, for it allowed the court, upon a \u201csufficient showing,\u201d to restrict discovery or \u201cmake such orders as are appropriate.\u201d R. 1:28 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">On the day of trial, Mr. Hill\u2019s counsel made a second motion, this time moving to continue the trial until November 8, 2010, because he needed to review the \u201clengthy tape recordings.\u201d R. 1:55 at 1. The district court granted the motion because Mr. Hill needed \u201cadditional time to review evidence consisting of lengthy tape recordings\u201d and denied Mr. Hill\u2019s motion to exclude the CD evidence as moot. <em>See </em>R. 1:56. At no point before trial did Mr. Hill again move to exclude the CD. Trial began on November 9, 2010, and the jury convicted Mr. Hill on all charges. The government did not introduce any of the recorded conversations as evidence at trial. <em>See </em>R. 1:110.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Speedy Trial Act de novo. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>183 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.1999). And we review any \u201cfactual determinations as to what constitutes excludable time under the Speedy Trial Act\u201d for clear error. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 984 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">The Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-3174, sets deadlines that federal courts must follow in criminal cases. If trial does not timely commence under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Act, the results are severe \u201cand [can] include dismissal with prejudice of the charges against the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>528 F.3d 1294, 1295 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Where, as here, a defendant pleads not guilty, the Speedy Trial Act requires that his trial start within 70 days of two possible events. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). The 70-day clock begins to run on the day that the <em>government </em>files criminal charges through an indictment or information. See <em>id. </em>On the other hand, if the defendant appears before a judge \u201cof the court in which\u201d his charges are pending <em>after </em>the government files the charges, then the 70-day clock begins from that event. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Certain \u201cdays\u201d don\u2019t count as days at all under the Speedy Trial Act, however. When certain authorized delays occur, the days that constitute the delay in question do not count for the 70-day calculation. One of these delays is significant here. A period of delay does not count among the 70 days if (1) Mr. Hill or his attorney asked for a continuance, (2) the district court granted that continuance, and (3) the court granted it because \u201cthe ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A). \u201cIf the trial court determines that the \u2018ends of justice\u2019 require the grant of a continuance, and makes the required findings, <em>any </em>delay is excludable\u201d under the Speedy Trial Act. <em>United States v. Twitty, </em>107 F.3d 1482, 1489 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Here, Mr. Hill appeared before a magistrate judge on August 12, 2010. His trial began on November 9, 2010. That 89-day period would violate the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day limit if there was no excludable time. But the district court granted a continuance because it found that the continuance served the ends of justice (i.e., because Mr. Hill and his counsel needed more time to review the CD and prepare for trial), and this delay lasted 35 days. When these 35 excludable days are subtracted from the 89 total days, Mr. Hill\u2019s trial began 54 days after he first appeared before a judge. That is well within the 70 days allowed by the Speedy Trial Act. Hence, the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s time restrictions were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Mr. Hill contests this characterization of events. The district court, according to Mr. Hill, did not grant a continuance to further the ends of justice. The court, rather, granted a continuance because the government refused to obey the standing discovery order. Instead of obeying that order, Mr. Hill says, the government waited a month past the deadline and days before trial to deliver evidence in its possession. This caused a delay, which resulted from the government\u2019s lack of preparation, and federal courts cannot grant continuances because of \u201clack of diligent preparation\u201d by the government. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(7)(C). Therefore, Mr. Hill insists, the court improperly postponed the trial so as to give the government more time. Mr. Hill\u2019s argument, however, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Contrary to Mr. Hill\u2019s protestations, the district court did not postpone the trial because the government needed more time. As the court noted, it continued Mr. Hill\u2019s trial because Mr. Hill needed more \u201ctime to review evidence consisting of lengthy tape recordings.\u201d R. 1:56 at 2. It was Mr. Hill \u2014 and not the government\u2014 who asked for a trial continuance. And the court granted the motion specifically because the postponement served \u201cthe ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>True, Mr. Hill requested this extra time because the government furnished evidence days before trial, but he \u2014 and not the government\u2014 nonetheless requested the postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>If Mr. Hill felt that the government had ambushed him with this evidence, he had avenues of relief. For instance, district courts have broad authority to regulate discovery, and this authority includes the power to prevent the introduction at trial of improperly withheld evidence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 16(d); <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 995 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>871 F.2d 1574, 1580 (11th Cir.1989). And, in fact, Mr. Hill initially sought this form of relief, asking that the court bar the recorded conversations at trial. <em>See </em>R. l:Doc. 53 at 1-2. But Mr. Hill then abandoned this strategy and asked the court only for a continuance on the day the trial was to begin. <em>See </em>R. 1:55 at 1. He cannot now complain because the court granted his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Mr. Hill\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
