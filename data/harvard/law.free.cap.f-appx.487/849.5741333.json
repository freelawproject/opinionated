He alleged that his right to privacy was violated when he was subjected to a strip search in the presence of female correctional officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The district court dismissed Bryant\u2019s action as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) and denied Bryant leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Bryant now moves this court for leave to proceed IFP. His motion constitutes a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhen the prisoner opts to challenge the certification decision, the motion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Neither Bryant\u2019s IFP application nor his supporting affidavit addresses the district court\u2019s certification decision in any meaningful way. He asserts only that he believes in good faith that he is entitled to the relief he seeks. Because Bryant has failed to challenge the reasons for the district court\u2019s decision or show that the appeal raises a nonfrivolous issue, the IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See id. </em>at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">Both the dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bryant\u2019s complaint count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bryant is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g) while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b876-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
