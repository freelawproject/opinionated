McCorvey\u2019s sentence was enhanced under the ACCA, based on a prior drug offense and prior Florida convictions for felony battery and battery on a law enforcement officer. McCorvey contends the ACCA enhancement is inapplicable because the Supreme Court decided, after he was sentenced, that a prior battery conviction under Florida law is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-19\">Regarding denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, a district court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). McCorvey\u2019s contention that his \u201cactual-innocence\u201d claim is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition, by operation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d, is foreclosed by <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000), which held: petitioner\u2019s claim he is actually innocent of being a career offender is <em>not </em>the type of contention that warrants review under \u00a7 2241 because petitioner is not asserting he is actually innocent of the underlying crime for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
