Nelson challenges her within-Guidelines-range sentence of 50-months\u2019 imprisonment, imposed following her guilty-plea conviction of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349. Nelson contends the district court erred by, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.3, increasing her offense level by two, after finding she abused a position of private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission of her offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">Although post-J3oofcer, the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Here, review is only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Pruett, </em>681 F.3d 232, 248 (5th Cir.2012) (\u201cA district court\u2019s application of [Guideline \u00a7 ] 3B1.3 is a sophisticated factual determination that an appellate court reviews for clear error.\u201d (internal alterations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and quotations marks omitted)). \u201cThere is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">American National Bank of Texas (ANB) employed Nelson as a marketing communications specialist. In that capacity, Nelson, <em>inter alia, </em>worked with marketing vendors and advertising agencies and communicated with ANB branches regarding their marketing needs. She would take requests from the branches for marketing products and services, order those needed, and submit the vendors\u2019 invoices to ANB\u2019s accounts-payable department. Nelson was required to have invoices of $1,000 or less approved by her supervisor; those over $1,000, approved by a more senior supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In January 2005, Nelson began submitting fictitious invoices with her supervisor\u2019s forged signature. Nelson kept the amount of each fraudulent invoice below $1,000, and thus had to forge only her supervisor\u2019s signature, and not that of a more senior supervisor. Between January 2005 and July 2006, Nelson created and submitted over 300 fraudulent invoices, resulting in a loss to ANB of over $275,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In calculating Nelson\u2019s total offense level, the district court applied, over Nelson\u2019s objections, the above-described two-level increase under Guideline \u00a7 3B1.3 for abusing a position of private trust. Nelson maintains the district court erred when it interpreted \u00a7 3B1.3 \u201cto apply on the basis of mere knowledge\u201d. In that regard, she contends: she possessed nothing more than knowledge of the bank\u2019s operations; and this knowledge alone did not merit application of the offense-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Nevertheless, the district court found that it was Nelson\u2019s <em>position, </em>as a liaison between ANB and marketing vendors, <em>combined </em>with her specialized knowledge of ANB\u2019s invoice-process for marketing services, that provided her with the means and discretion to submit and receive payment for fraudulent invoices. Nelson has failed to show the district court <em>clearly erred </em>in finding that these facts merited imposition of the two-level increase under Guideline \u00a7 3B1.3. <em>See United States v. Ehrlich, </em>902 F.2d 327, 330-31 (5th Cir.1990) (similar facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
