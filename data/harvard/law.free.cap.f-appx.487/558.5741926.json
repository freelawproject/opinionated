(BR-111) and Appellee Tri\u00e1ngulo Pi-sos E Paineis, LTDA (Tri\u00e1ngulo) agreed to have all disputes finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. At the conclusion of a hearing held before the International Court of Arbitration, the arbitration tribunal requested post-hearing submissions from both parties. BR-111 contended that Tri\u00e1ngulo\u2019s submission included new evidence and arguments and requested an opportunity to respond. The arbitration tribunal denied this request because it found that the submission did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>include new evidence or arguments. The arbitration tribunal concluded that BR111 owed Tri\u00e1ngulo for unpaid invoices with interest and attorneys fees. The tribunal also determined that Tri\u00e1ngulo owed BR111 for outstanding warranty claims with interest. Tri\u00e1ngulo field a Motion to Confirm Final Arbitral Award in the district court and BR111 filed a Motion to Vacate Final Award. The district court denied BR-lll\u2019s motion and granted Tri\u00e1ngulo\u2019s motion. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We review a district court\u2019s order confirming or vacating an arbitration award <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Gianelli Money Purchase Plan &amp; Trust v. ADM Investor Servs., Inc., </em>146 F.8d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.1998). Both parties accept that there is a strong presumption in favor of confirming the arbitration award. However, the parties disagree on which principles govern challenges to the arbitration award. BR111 contends that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs; whereas, Tri\u00e1ngulo contends that the Inter-American Convention (Panama Convention) governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Even assuming we apply the FAA, as BR111 wishes, the arbitration award will still stand. Under the FAA, the party seeking to vacate an arbitration award must show that the award falls into one of the statutory bases for vacatur. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10. BR111 contends that the arbitration tribunal \u201crefus[ed] to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy,\u201d and therefore the award must be vacated. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. However, the district court correctly found that the arbitration tribunal noted in the Final Award that both parties responded to the panel\u2019s post-hearing request. Additionally, the arbitration tribunal found that none of Tri\u00e1ngulo\u2019s submissions presented new evidence or arguments that required BR-lll\u2019s response. Thus, the arbitration tribunal did not refuse to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy. BR-111 was given a full opportunity to present its case during a full hearing and in the post-hearing submissions. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Tri\u00e1ngulo\u2019s Motion to Confirm and denying BR-lll\u2019s Motion to Vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
