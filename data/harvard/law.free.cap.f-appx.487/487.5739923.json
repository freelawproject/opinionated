(Liberty Mutual). McKeever filed an amended complaint in state court alleging defamation and slander against Liberty Mutual and GEICO Insurance Agency, Inc. (GEICO). After the case was removed to federal court, the district court entered a scheduling order adopting May 15, 2011, as the deadline for amendments to pleadings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 16, 2011, Liberty Mutual and GEICO moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. McKeever\u2019s response, filed on June 80, 2011, conceded that his claims were time-barred, but also moved for leave to amend the amended complaint to add a claim for malicious prosecution against Liberty Mutual. The district court denied McKeever\u2019s motion because he did not demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for failing to comply with the scheduling order\u2019s deadline for amendments and, alternatively, because McKeever\u2019s proposed amendment would have been futile. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">We review the denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Covenant Christian Ministries, Inc. v. City of Marietta, </em>654 F.3d 1231, 1239 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cA plaintiff seeking leave to amend its complaint after the deadline designated in a scheduling order must demonstrate \u2018good cause\u2019 under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b).\u201d <em>S. Grouts &amp; Mortars, Inc. v. 3M Co., </em>575 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir.2009). Here, McKeever moved for leave to amend his amended complaint on June 30, 2011, over six weeks after the May 15, 2011 deadline adopted by the district court\u2019s scheduling order. McKeever\u2019s counseled motion for leave to amend, however, did not even attempt to demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to comply with the scheduling order. Without any explanation, McKeever simply stated that there was no \u201cundue delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McKeever\u2019s belated motion for leave to amend his amended complaint because McKeever did not demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to comply with the scheduling order. <em>See id. </em>at 1243 (upholding district court\u2019s denial of motion to amend where the plaintiff failed \u201cto show good cause why it did not amend its complaint before the amendment deadline imposed in the scheduling order or during extensions of that deadline\u201d); <em>see also Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1417, 1418 (11th Cir.1998). Because we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of McKeever\u2019s motion for leave to amend on this ground, we need not consider whether McKeever\u2019s proposed amendment would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-10\">.
