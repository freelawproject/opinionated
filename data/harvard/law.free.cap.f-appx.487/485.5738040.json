Lee argues that he has a well-founded, fear of future persecution and torture based on the compulsory military service that he faces if he is removed to South Korea. We deny Lee\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">Lee challenges the finding that his application for asylum was untimely, but that issue is not before us. Although the immigration judge found Lee\u2019s application untimely, the Board declined to address that issue. We review only the decision of the Board. <em>Bedoya-Melendez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>680 F.3d 1321, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that Lee lacks a well-founded fear of future persecution or torture. The record does not compel a finding that Lee\u2019s service in the South Korean military would constitute persecution. Although Lee presented evidence that his father had been mistreated by senior officers in the military because he had been short, frail, and older than his fellow soldiers, Lee is three inches taller than his father and in good health, and Lee failed to submit any evidence that he would be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution based on any protected ground. <em>Forgue v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Lee subjectively feared persecution and economic hardship based on his inability to speak Korean fluently, his lack of social connections within the country, and the Korean custom of designating careers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>during childhood, but Lee introduced no evidence that established his fears were objectively reasonable. <em>See Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 358 (BIA 1983) (\u201cThe showing of a \u2018well-founded fear of persecution\u2019 requires that the alien present some objective evidence which establishes a realistic likelihood of persecution in his homeland; an alien\u2019s own speculations and conclusional statements, unsupported by independent corroborative evidence, will not suffice.\u201d). South Korea can require Lee to submit to military service, and Lee failed to present any evidence that the South Korean military is internationally condemned. <em>See Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1346-47 (11th Cir.2008). Although Lee argues that he will be imprisoned should he refuse to serve in the military, that punishment is a lawful sanction imposed on all Korean citizens and would not amount to persecution or torture. <em>See id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.18(a)(3). Because Lee cannot satisfy the standard to obtain asylum relief or the more stringent standards imposed for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention, <em>Zheng v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006), we deny Lee\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
