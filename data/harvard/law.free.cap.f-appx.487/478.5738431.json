Avila-Santoyo was ordered removed pursuant to a stipulated order of removal on March 13, 2009. On July 19, 2011, he filed an emergency motion to rescind his removal order and reopen his removal proceedings. Avila-Santoyo asserts the BIA erred in finding the IJ lacked jurisdiction under the departure bar to reopen his removal proceedings, because the departure bar conflicts with an alien\u2019s statutory right to file one motion to reopen pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). He also argues the BIA abused its discretion in finding, in the alternative, that his motion was untimely and not subject to equitable tolling. Finally, Avila-Santoyo argues we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte, </em>and the BIA erred in refusing to exercise its discretion in this regard because his stipulated order of removal and waiver of hearing was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, in violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>A. Departure bar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">As an initial matter, this Court recently held that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d), the \u201cdeparture bar\u201d regulation stating the BIA may not entertain a motion to reopen filed by or on behalf of a person who has departed the United States, impermissibly conflicts with an alien\u2019s statutory right to file one motion to reopen pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>681 F.3d 1236, 1241 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, based on <em>Lin, </em>the BIA erred in finding the IJ lacked jurisdiction under the departure bar in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) to reopen Avila-Santoyo\u2019s removal proceedings. Because the BIA correctly dismissed his petition on an alternate ground, however, this error does not warrant granting Avila-Santoyo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\n<em>B. The BIA\u2019s decision that Avilar-San-toyo\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Ordinarily, an alien who is subject to a final order of removal and wishes to reopen the proceedings may file one motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). The time limitation for filing such a motion varies depending on the nature of the proceeding the alien seeks to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). Generally, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of the final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Avila-Santoyo failed to meet the statutory requirements for filing a motion to reopen. It is undisputed that Avila-San-toyo\u2019s motion to reopen was not filed within the 90-day time limit. That time limit runs for 90 days from the date of the final administrative decision \u2014 in this case, from the IJ\u2019s March 13, 2009, order of removal. Avila-Santoyo\u2019s motion to reopen before the IJ was filed in July 2011, well more than 90 days after the final removal order. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in finding that Avila-Santoyo\u2019s motion to reopen was due to be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">Furthermore, because Avila-Santoyo stipulated to his removal, he was not removed pursuant to the <em>in absentia </em>process specifically set forth at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5). Although he claims that his waiver of his right to a removal hearing was not knowing and intelligent, such a claim, even if true, in no way transforms his stipulated removal order into an <em>in absentia </em>removal order. Avila-Santoyo could have raised this issue in a timely appeal to the BIA or a timely motion to reopen or reconsider the IJ\u2019s decision. He did not. The fact that he chose not to appeal the allegedly invalid removal order and waiver, or to move to reopen removal proceedings, does not mean that he may now argue that he was removed <em>in absentia </em>such that his untimely motion to reopen is excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">Finally, because the 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen before the BIA \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, is not subject to equitable tolling,\u201d the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Avila-Santoyo\u2019s untimely motion to reopen was not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">\n<em>C.The BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen proceedings sua sponte</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>on its <em>sua sponte </em>authority because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the BIA\u2019s exercise of its discretion. <em>See Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-94 (11th Cir.2008). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Avila-Santoyo\u2019s motion to reopen based on its <em>sua sponte </em>authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Although we noted in <em>Lenis, </em>that \u201can appellate court may have jurisdiction over constitutional claims related to the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>power,\u201d contrary to Avila-Santoyo\u2019s assertion, the BIA\u2019s comments regarding its reasoning for declining to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>power to consider his appeal do not amount to \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cconstitutional reasoning\u201d so as to arguably confer jurisdiction in this case. <em>Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1294 n. 7. Avila-Santoyo asserts the BIA decided his due process claim on the merits, based on the BIA\u2019s statement that it disagreed with Avila-Santoyo\u2019s claim that it would be \u201cextremely unfair\u201d to hold him to the stipulated order of removal. This statement, however, merely explained the BIA\u2019s determination that Avila-Santoyo had not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances warranting <em>sua sponte </em>reopening. Therefore, even assuming that the <em>Lenis </em>rationale has no application to the legal and constitutional reasoning underlying the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen removal proceedings, as Avila-Santoyo asserts, the BIA\u2019s comments regarding its reasoning for dismissing his appeal would not amount to \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cconstitutional reasoning\u201d so as to confer jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Although the BIA erred in finding the IJ lacked jurisdiction under the departure bar in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) to reopen Avila-Santoyo\u2019s removal proceedings, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding, in the alternative, that Avila-Santoyo\u2019s motion to reopen was due to be dismissed because it was untimely and not subject to equitable tolling. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction any argument concerning the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority. Accordingly, we deny in part, and dismiss in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-12\">. We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhang v.
