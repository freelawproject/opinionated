Jackson bore the burden of showing that he was convicted of only misdemeanor conduct. <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 387, 392 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1857, 182 L.Ed.2d 642 (2012). Because he did not carry this burden, he has shown no error. He also has failed to demonstrate his eligibility for relief in the form of cancellation of removal and waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"ADMk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Jackson additionally asserts that he was denied a fair opportunity to contest the IPs denial of withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. Because he failed to exhaust this claim by raising it before the BIA, this court does not have jurisdiction to consider it. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D), (d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
