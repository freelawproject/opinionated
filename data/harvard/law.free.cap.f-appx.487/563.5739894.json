After a jury trial in Florida state court, Jones was convicted on two counts of kidnapping with a weapon, one count of armed home-invasion robbery, and one count of armed robbery, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones\u2019 convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. He sought postconviction relief in the Florida state courts but was unsuccessful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After that, Jones went to federal district court. The district court denied his \u00a7 2254 petition but granted him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>a certif\u00edcate of appealability on four of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Three of Jones\u2019 claims are that his trial counsel was ineffective for: (1) failing to challenge the admissibility of a shotgun into evidence; (2) advising him not to testify to support his defense of mistaken identification; and (3) failing to correctly advise him about the scope of cross-examination if he did take the stand. Jones\u2019 fourth claim is that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for failing to argue that the evidence was insufficient to support his kidnapping convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). When evaluating performance, we \u201cstrongly pre-sumen\u201d that counsel has \u201crendered adequate assistance and [has] made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. To establish deficient performance, a petitioner must show that \u201cno competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). Prejudice occurs only when there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A \u201c[petitioner's claim must fail if either of the <em>Strickland </em>prongs are not met.\u201d <em>Mo-haraj v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>432 F.3d 1292, 1319 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">\u201c[W]hen the state courts have denied an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits, the standard a petitioner must meet to obtain federal habeas relief was intended to be, and is, a difficult one.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>643 F.3d 907, 910 (11th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)). \u201cThe standard is not whether an error was committed, but whether the state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law that has been clearly established by decisions of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). \u201c[0]nly if there is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\u2019s decision conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents may relief be granted.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>643 F.3d at 910 (quotation marks and alteration omitted). The double deference required by \u00a7 2254 and <em>Strickland </em>means a petitioner must show that the state courts applied <em>Strickland </em>in an objectively unreasonable manner. <em>Johnson, </em>643 F.3d at 910-11; <em>see also Rutherford v. Crosby, </em>385 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cWhen \u00a7 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Jones contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the admission into evidence of a shotgun because it was recovered from a different, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>uncharged crime and was not relevant to the charged offenses. He asserts that, shortly after the victims were robbed at gunpoint, one of them described the gun as a \u201c.12 gauge shotgun with a wooden stock,\u201d but the gun introduced into evidence at his trial was a \u201c.20 gauge \u2014 sawed off shotgun with no stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The state collateral court, in denying Jones\u2019 motion for postconviction relief, concluded that the prosecution had laid the proper foundation to introduce the shotgun into evidence, the defense had no basis under state law for objecting to its admission, and the question of whether it was the same gun that was used in the charged robbery was for the jury to decide. The Third District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">When the state courts have already answered the question of how an issue would have been resolved under that state\u2019s law had defense counsel done what the petitioner argues he should have done, \u201cfederal habeas courts should not second-guess them on such matters\u201d because \u201cit is a fundamental principle that state courts are the final arbiters of state law.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Campbell, </em>427 F.3d 897, 932 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). Because we will not \u201csecond guess\u201d the Florida state courts\u2019 conclusion that the shotgun was admissible under state evidentiary law, Jones cannot demonstrate that his counsel was deficient for failing to object to its introduction. <em>See id. </em>A lawyer cannot be deficient for failing to raise a merit-less claim. <em>Freeman v. Attorney Gen., </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008). The state courts\u2019 rejection of this claim was neither contrary to nor involved an objectively unreasonable application of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Jones contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for advising him not to take the stand to support his mistaken identity defense. Specifically, Jones asserts that one of the victims testified that he was robbed by a man who was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, had no noticeable tattoos, and had one open-faced gold cap in the upper right side of his mouth. Jones describes himself as having \u201cfull-sleeved\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> tattoos and \u201cthree full-faced gold crowns in the front of his mouth.\u201d Jones contends that because his counsel \u201cincompetently\u201d kept him from taking the witness stand, the jury did not get to see his gold teeth and tattoos.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">In denying Jones\u2019 motion for post-conviction relief on this ground, the state collateral court found that Jones\u2019 counsel cross-examined the victims about their identifications of Jones and specifically about tattoos and gold teeth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his clos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ing argument, Jones\u2019 counsel challenged the accuracy of the witnesses\u2019 identification of Jones, stating that \u201cpeople have a tendency to talk together\u201d and suggesting that the descriptions they gave to the police were unreliable. The jury also heard testimony that soon after the robbery each of the victims separately identified Jones in a photo lineup as the person with the gun in the home-invasion robbery, and each of them identified him again in the courtroom. The state collateral court concluded that the credibility of the witnesses\u2019 identification of Jones was for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">There is, at the very least, a reasonable argument that Jones\u2019 counsel was not deficient for advising Jones not to take the stand to show the jury his tattoos and his teeth. He cannot establish that \u201cno competent counsel\u201d would have advised him not to take the stand, <em>Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1315, particularly because the State would have challenged Jones\u2019 credibility on cross-examination and the jury would have learned that he had five prior felony convictions. Nor has Jones shown that he was prejudiced by not taking the stand. Given the evidence of his guilt that the State presented, Jones cannot show a reasonable probability of a different result if he had testified. The state collateral court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>when it denied Jones\u2019 motion for post-conviction relief on this ground. <em>See Rutherford, </em>385 F.3d at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Jones\u2019 third claim overlaps with his second one. He contends that he chose not to testify at trial based on his trial counsel\u2019s incorrect advice that, if he took the stand, the prosecutor could ask him about the nature and facts of his five prior felony convictions. Because Jones\u2019 defense was mistaken identity, he argues that his own testimony would have been the most effective way to support it. He reiterates that if he had taken the stand, he could have shown the jury his tattoos and three full-faced gold teeth, which would have undermined the testimony of the victim who did not notice tattoos on the robber\u2019s arms and who said that the robber had one open-faced gold tooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">A criminal defendant has a \u201cfundamental constitutional right to testify in his or her own behalf at trial,\u201d and that \u201cright is personal to the defendant and cannot be waived either by the trial court or by defense counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Teague, </em>953 F.2d 1525, 1532 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc). Deficient performance may be established \u201cwhere counsel has refused to accept the defendant\u2019s decision to testify and refused to call him to the stand, or where defense counsel never informed the defendant of his right to testify and that the final decision belongs to the defendant alone.\u201d <em>Gallego v. United States, </em>174 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The state collateral court found, based on Jones\u2019 colloquy with the trial court, that he had willingly agreed not to testify on his own behalf, that he made the decision independently, and that his lawyer had not forced him to make it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state collater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>al court did not address whether, in making his decision not to testify, Jones had relied on misadvice from his trial counsel about what the prosecutor could ask him on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">If Jones had taken the stand, Florida law would have prohibited the State from cross-examining him about the nature of his five prior felonies, unless he opened the door to that line of questioning. <em>See Rivera v. State, 2 </em>So.3d 1086, 1087 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). As long as he kept that door shut, questions on cross-examination about his prior felony convictions would have led to the identification of each of them but could not have sought details about the nature of them. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that \u201c[questions concerning a defendant\u2019s prior convictions are limited to whether the defendant has committed a felony ..., and if the defendant admits such a conviction, how many of such prior convictions\u201d) (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 90.610(1)); <em>see also Burst v. State, </em>836 So.2d 1107, 1108 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003) (stating that it would have been improper on cross-examination for the prosecutor to have \u201celicit[ed] testimony regarding the nature of the convictions\u201d); <em>but see Rogers v. State, </em>964 So.2d 221, 223 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007) (explaining a defendant opens the door by engaging in \u201c \u2018spin control\u2019 \u201d that \u201ccharacteriz[es] the prior convictions in a way favorable to his case at trial,\u201d and in that situation \u201cthe state is entitled to inquire further regarding the convictions to attempt to dispel any misleading impression\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Assuming trial counsel told Jones that if he took the stand the facts about his prior felonies would come out on cross-examination even if he did not open the door, that advice was incorrect, and Jones asserts that he relied on it in deciding not to testify. Even so, for the reasons that we have already discussed in connection with another of his ineffective assistance claims, Jones has not shown he was prejudiced by not testifying. Because of that, he has not established an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on this ground. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069; <em>Maharaj, </em>432 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Jones\u2019 final contention is that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his kidnapping convictions. Jones asserts that two of the victims were told to go into the garage before the robbers fled the scene, but \u201c[n]o one was touched, harmed, bound, tied-up or further confined in any manner.\u201d He states that the confinement was for a brief time, and although the victims were locked out of the house, they \u201ccould have left the garage at any point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">The <em>Strickland </em>performance-and-prejudice, two-part test that we have already discussed also applies to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>Clark v. Crosby, </em>335 F.3d 1303, 1310 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAppellate counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise claims reasonably considered to be without merit.\u201d <em>United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">To determine sufficiency of the evidence under Florida law, a court considers whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could find the existence of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Johnston v. State, </em>863 So.2d 271, 28B (Fla.2003). Jones was convicted of kidnapping under a provision of the Florida statute that sets forth the elements of his crime as \u201cforcibly, secretly, or by threat confining, abducting, or imprisoning another person against her or his will and without lawful authority, with intent to ... [cjommit or facilitate commission of any felony.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.01(1). To support a conviction of kidnapping that is done to facilitate the commission of another crime, the movement or confinement of the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">(a) Must not be slight, inconsequential and merely incidental to the other crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">(b) Must not be of the kind inherent in the nature of the other crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">(c) Must have some significance inde- \u25a0 pendent of the other crime in that it makes the other crime substantially easier of commission or substantially lessens the risk of detection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\"><em>Faison v. State, </em>426 So.2d 963, 965 (Fla.1983) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The jury heard testimony that, while wielding a shotgun, Jones forced two of the victims into the garage and then locked the door to the house. One of the victims testified that the armed robber took his keys, told them that he was going to take the car, and told them \u201cnot to come out of the garage.\u201d Another victim testified that the robber \u201cforced\u201d them to go into the garage and explained that she felt \u201cforced\u201d because he had a gun. She testified that she was afraid to leave the garage or to make any noise. They did not have cell phones with them in the garage and had no way to call the police. Only after they heard the robbers leave did the victims open the electric garage door and go around to the front door of the house. The door leading from the garage into the house was still locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">The evidence established that the victims were confined to the garage in a manner that was not slight, inconsequential, or merely incidental to the armed robbery, nor was it inherent or necessarily required to commit that crime. Moreover, confining the victims in the garage made the robbery substantially easier to commit and lessened the risk of detection. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones had committed kidnapping under Florida law. <em>See Faison, </em>426 So.2d at 965. The District Court of Appeal of Florida reasonably concluded that appellate counsel was not ineffective under <em>Strickland </em>for failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence because that challenge would have been meritless. <em>See Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\">. The state trial court determined under Florida law that because Jones was a prison release reoffender and a habitual violent felony offender, he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">. Contending that his trial counsel was ineffective, Jones filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for post-conviction relief under Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.580, which the state collateral court denied. The Third District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed the denial of relief. Contending that his appellate counsel was ineffective, he also filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for habeas relief in the Florida Court of Appeal under Fla. R.App. P. 9.141(c), and it too was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Av9\"><em>. </em>Jones\u2019 appellate counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, <em>see In re Anders Briefs, </em>581 So.2d 149 (Fla.1991), and his convictions and sentence were affirmed in accordance with the <em>Anders </em>procedure. <em>See Towbridge v. State, </em>45 So.3d 484, 487 (Fla. 1st DCA 2010) (\"It is reasonable to presume that when the court affirms an <em>Anders </em>appeal it has fully considered and rejected all potential issues that were apparent on the face of the record.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. According to Jones, this means that both of his \"arms are completely tattooed from the shoulder to the hands.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. Jones points out that the jury could not have seen his tattoos while he sat at the defense table because he wore a long-sleeved dress shirt to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. When one of the victims testified that the man who robbed them was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, Jones\u2019 counsel asked if he noticed any tattoos on the man's arms. The victim testified that he did not. Jones' counsel asked: \u201c[I]f I told you this man\u2019s arms are full of tattoos, would you change your opinion as to whether this man was the person who robbed you?\u201d The victim testified that it would not change his opinion because he noticed the robber's face and not his tattoos. Counsel also asked the witness about his statement that the robber had one openfaced gold tooth. During closing argument, Jones\u2019 counsel again challenged the identification evidence. He mentioned the testimony about the tattoos and the gold tooth, and argued that if Jones did have one open-faced gold tooth, the State would have presented a picture of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. After counsel for the State told the court that Jones had five prior felony convictions, the court conducted the following colloquy with Jones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">THE COURT: .... Do you understand that you have a right to testify if you want to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aizm\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">THE COURT: And you understand that your attorney can advise you about whether he believes it is a good idea for you to testify or not, but he can't force you not to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arl1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>THE COURT: The decision to testily is ultimately yours.
