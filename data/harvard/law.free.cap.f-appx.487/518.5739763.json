When he was originally sentenced in 2005, Hill\u2019s guideline range was 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ment, based on an offense level of 38, but the district court varied downward and sentenced him to 2 concurrent terms of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 the statutory-maximum sentence for the conspiracy offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In 2011, Hill moved the district court\u2014 based on Amendment 750, which amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the drug quantity table to reduce offense levels for various amounts of crack cocaine \u2014 to re-sentence him based on a new offense level of 36, but he did not specifically urge the district court to sentence him below his amended guideline range. The district court granted Hill\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, finding that he was entitled to a 2-level reduction under Amendment 750, which resulted in an amended guideline range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment, and entered an order reducing Hill\u2019s sentence from 240 to 235 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On appeal, Hill argues that Amendment 759 \u2014 which amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) to provide that a district court may lower a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guidelines range only if the original sentence was below the original guidelines range because the defendant provided substantial assistance to the government \u2014 is invalid because: (1) Amendment 759 -violates the Ex Post Fac-to Clause since the new version of \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201cpurports to eliminate\u201d his \u201cpreviously granted variance\u201d; (2) the notice and comment procedure was defective under the Administrative Procedures Act; (3) Amendment 759 exceeds the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u), since \u00a7 994(u) does not allow the Commission to override other sentencing decisions made at the original sentencing; (4) allowing the Commission to override previously made, case-specific, sentencing decisions would violate the principle of Separation of Powers; and (5) the newly amended \u00a7 1B1.10 is ambiguous, so the rule of lenity militates in favor of allowing the district court to maintain all of its original sentencing decisions. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">We normally review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of the scope of its authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). However, when a defendant fails to raise an argument before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244-45 (quotation omitted). In order for an error to be obvious for purposes of plain error review, \u201cit must be plain under controlling precedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Lett, </em>483 F.3d 782, 790 (11th Cir.2007). Because Hill did not request in a timely motion before the district court a sentence reduction below his amended guideline range, and failed to raise in the district court any of the issues he now raises on appeal, we review his arguments on appeal only for plain error. <em>Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95, n. 10 (11th Cir.2010). A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 does not constitute a full resentencing, and the district court must maintain all original sentencing determinations with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">A district court must engage in a two-part analysis when considering a \u00a7 3582 motion for a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 780. First, the court must recalculate the sentence using the amended guideline, while maintaining all other guideline application decisions, to determine the new applicable offense level and guideline range. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must apply its discretion to determine whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guideline or retain the original sentence, based on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Amendment- 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, and U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 759. As a result of these amendments, \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) now assigns a base offense level of 36 in cases involving at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2011). Previously, \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) assigned a base offense level of 38 in cases involving at least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Amendment 759 also modified the limitations on the authority of a district court, considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, sometimes to re-apply downward departures or variances previously allowed below the minimum guideline range. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 759; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) (2011). Under the revised \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2), the district court \u201cshall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (2011). The only exception provided under the revised guideline is for cases where the term of imprisonment fell below the guideline range due to a government motion based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 758 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The district court is required to apply the version of \u00a7 1B1.10 that is in effect at the time that it rules on the \u00a7 3582 motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment, (n.6) (2011). Amendment 759 made changes to \u00a7 1B1.10, which became effective on November 1, 2011, and would apply to any \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion decided on or after that date. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">On the record here, Hill has failed to show that the district court committed any error, much less plain error, in failing <em>sua sponte </em>to reduce his sentence below the amended guideline range. For starters, \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) provides that the district court \u201cshall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range,\u201d and in <em>Vautier, </em>we held that, prior to the \u00a7 1B1.10 amendment, a decision whether to re-apply a downward departure under \u00a7 3582(c) was discretionary. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (2011); <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 761 (holding, concerning the \u201ccomparable reduction\u201d provision in the previous version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u00a7 1B.10, that \u201ca district court, ruling on a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, ha[d] the discretion to decide whether to re-apply a downward departure ... when considering what sentence the court would have imposed under the amended guideline\u201d). The only exception provided under the revised guideline is for cases where the term of imprisonment fell below the guideline range due to a government motion based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). Here, the district court did not reduce Hill\u2019s sentence to a term that was \u201cless than the minimum of the amended guideline range,\u201d and Hill did not receive a downward departure for substantial assistance such that he qualifies for the exception to the limitation on the extent of reduction as determined in \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B). Accordingly, Hill has failed to show that the district court committed any error in failing <em>sua sponte </em>to reduce his sentence below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Moreover, neither this Court nor the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed in a published opinion the application of the \u201ccomparable reduction\u201d limitation in the recent revision of \u00a7 1B1.10, nor whether Amendment 759 is invalid for the various reasons Hill asserts for the first time on appeal. Therefore, he cannot meet his burden to show that any error by the district court in this regard \u2014 even assuming that there was one \u2014 was plain. <em>Lett, </em>483 F.3d at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Nor are we persuaded by his argument based on the rule of lenity, which requires ambiguous laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them. <em>See United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 514, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). \u201cThe simple existence of some statutory ambiguity ... is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.\u201d <em>See Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 138, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). In order for the rule of lenity to apply, there must be a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138\u201439, 118 S.Ct. 1911 (quotations omitted). Because Hill has not shown that there is any \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\u201d in \u00a7 1B1.10, the rule of lenity does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Hill\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
