This appeal concerns the district court\u2019s summary judgment disposing of Armando\u2019s claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). The district court held that AT &amp; T Mobility is not a proper defendant for Armando\u2019s denial-of-benefits claim because AT &amp; T Mobility neither sponsors nor administers its employees\u2019 benefit plan. And the district court held that Armando\u2019s complaint did not state a claim for ERISA retaliation. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">AT &amp; T Mobility\u2019s parent company hired Sedgwick, Inc., to administer the employee benefit plans of its various subsidiaries. The instrument governing the plan at issue here gives Sedgwick final authority to make benefits determinations, and AT &amp; T Mobility staff have no role in Sedgwick\u2019s formal decision making and appeals process.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">With the exception of a brief period in late May and early June, Armando was absent from her job at AT &amp; T mobility from April 17 until she was fired on September 3, 2009. Armando requested short-term disability leave covering her absence, which Sedgwick granted through August 19, 2009. Armando did not return to work after that date, and on August 25 AT &amp; T Mobility sent her a letter warning of its policy requiring an employee who has exhausted leave under the Family Medical Leave Act to either return to work or secure approval for short-term disability leave covering the absence. Armando requested an extension of her short-term disability leave on August 26, 2009, but Sedgwick denied the request. Armando did not return to work, and AT &amp; T Mobility fired her on September 3, 2009, citing the lack of approved short-term disability leave covering her absence since August 20, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">We review a summary judgment de novo, using the same standard as the district court. <em>Haggard v. Bank of Ozarks, Inc., </em>668 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is proper only if there is no \u201cgenuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We consider evidence in the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986). We also review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>True v. Robles, </em>571 F.3d 412, 417 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">Armando brings her denial-of-benefits claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). In support of its argument that it is not a proper defendant for the denial-of-benefits claim, AT &amp; T relies on ERISA \u00a7 502(d)(2): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(d)(2). In <em>Musmeci v. Schwegmann Giant Super Markets, Inc., </em>332 F.3d 339, 349-50 (5th Cir.2003), we held that \u00a7 1132(d)(2) permitted an employee to bring a denial-of-benefits action against an employer who was both the plan administrator and plan sponsor, and who had \u201cindisputably\u201d made the benefits decision that the plaintiffs wished to contest. <em>Id. </em>at 350. \u201cAdministrator\u201d and \u201cSponsor\u201d are defined terms under ERISA. In this case, AT &amp; T Mobility\u2019s parent, AT &amp; T, Inc., is the plan sponsor under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16)(B)(iii),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Sedgwick is the administrator under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16)(A)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Any money judgment under this sub-chapter against an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Although AT &amp; T Mobility is neither administrator nor sponsor of the plan, Armando contends that \u201cif evidence exists to show that the employer had some control over decisions related to claims for benefits, the employer should be able to be held accountable for a decision to deny benefits to employees.\u201d Armando relies on <em>Sweet v. Consolidated Aluminum Corporation, </em>913 F.2d 268 (6th Cir.1990). In <em>Musmeci, </em>we cited <em>Sweet </em>with approval for the proposition that \u201cthe plan beneficiaries can sue the employer when it was the employer\u2019s decision to deny benefits.\u201d <em>Musmeci, </em>332 F.3d at 349 (citing <em>Sweet, </em>913 F.2d 268).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">As evidence that AT &amp; T Mobility had control over Sedgwick\u2019s benefits determinations, Armando points to her affidavit testimony stating that as a union representative in other employees\u2019 grievance proceedings, she has witnessed AT &amp; T Mobility managers review and reverse Sedgwick\u2019s determinations concerning employees\u2019 disability benefits. Armando contends that AT &amp; T Mobility managers\u2019 ability to influence other employees\u2019 benefit determinations in the past entails \u201cin turn ... that Mobility would, likewise, have some control over the decisions involving Armando\u2019s claim for the benefits at issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">We disagree. Armando\u2019s affidavit testimony shows that Sedgwick has at times been willing to reconsider its benefits decisions in response to an informal request from an AT &amp; T Mobility manager seeking to resolve an employee grievance proceeding. Sedgwick\u2019s occasional solicitude to such requests does not create a genuine issue of fact regarding who made the decision concerning Armando\u2019s benefits in the face of the plan instrument\u2019s giving Sedg-wick control over benefit determinations. AT &amp; T Mobility is therefore not a proper defendant for Armando\u2019s denial-of-benefits claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">We next consider Armando\u2019s claim under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140, which prohibits employers from retaliating for employees\u2019 exercise of their ERISA rights. The theory of her ERISA retaliation claim, Armando explains, is that because AT &amp; T Mobil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ity did not want the plan to have to pay for her disability benefits as required by the plan, AT &amp; T Mobility first engineered Sedgwick\u2019s denial of her August 26, 2009 request for an extension of short-term disability benefits, and then AT &amp; T Mobility used the absence of short-term disability leave as a pretext to fire her. She contends that the district court erred in finding that her complaint does not state a claim for ERISA retaliation, and she argues in the alternative that the district court should have allowed her leave to amend. We need not address the sufficiency of Armando\u2019s complaint, because Armando\u2019s ERISA retaliation theory is premised on AT &amp; T Mobility\u2019s having exercised control over Sedgwick\u2019s decision to deny Armando\u2019s request for more disability leave. The record establishes as a matter of law that Sedgwick had control over that decision, so there was no reversible error in the district court\u2019s disposition of Armando\u2019s ERISA retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
