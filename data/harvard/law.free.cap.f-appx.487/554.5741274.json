Because Saldana had two pri- or felony drug convictions, he was subject to a mandatory minimum life sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851. The presentence investigation report concluded that Saldana was responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, which made his base offense level 38. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (Nov.1995). Saldana received a 2-level increase under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); a 4-level increase under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and a 2-level increase under \u00a7 3C1.1. Saldana\u2019s total offense level was 46, but because the highest offense level that the sentencing table recognizes is 43, the court treated Saldana as having a total offense level of 43. <em>See id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A cmt. n. 2. Saldana\u2019s criminal history category was IV, which resulted in a guidelines range of life in prison. The district court sentenced Saldana to life in prison on each count, with each sentence to run concurrently.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">Saldana filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendments 750 and 599 to the guidelines had reduced his guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>lines range. The district court denied that motion, concluding that it lacked authority to reduce Saldana\u2019s sentence because Sal-dana is subject to a mandatory minimum life sentence. This is Saldana\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The district court did not err in denying Saldana\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Saldana contends that Amendment 750 lowered his base offense level to 34 and that Amendment 599 removed the 2-level increase he received under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Based on those amendments, he argues, his amended total offense level is 40. We will assume that Saldana is right about that calculation. A total offense level of 40 and criminal history category of IV usually leads to a guidelines range of 360 months to life. Saldana, however, is subject to a mandatory minimum life sentence. Because that mandatory minimum is above the 360-month bottom of his otherwise-applicable amended guidelines range, that mandatory minimum becomes the bottom of his amended guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). So, even assuming Amendments 750 and 599 lowered his total offense level, those amendments did not lower his original guidelines range of life in prison. For that reason, the district court lacked authority to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[A] court cannot use an amendment to reduce a sentence in a particular case unless that amendment actually lowers the guidelines range in that case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-11\">. Saldana was also convicted of three counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The district court sentenced Saldana to 5 years in prison on each of those counts, with the sentences to run consecutively to each other and to the sentences for the three drug convictions. Saldana later filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the sentences on two of the firearm counts, which the district court granted. The remaining firearm sentence is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
