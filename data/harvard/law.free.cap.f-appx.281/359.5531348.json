He filed a habeas corpus petition to challenge the manner in which he is being given credit for time served. <em>See </em>22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court denied the petition, and Wahl appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Wahl contends that he is entitled to federal credit for his state sentence because his state detention was exclusively due to federal action. He also alleges that he should have been appointed counsel, had an evidentiary hearing, and been permitted to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">We review the district court\u2019s determinations of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998). Wahl\u2019s argument that his state custody was \u201cexclusively the product\u201d of federal action relies on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ballard v. Blackwell, </em>449 F.2d 868, 869 (5th Cir.1971). However, <em>Ballard </em>was interpreting the time-crediting statute in effect at the time, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568. Section 3568 was repealed by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. <em>United States v. Caraveo-Nunez, </em>992 F.2d 323, *1 (5th Cir.1993) (unpublished). A new statute applies to cases, like Wahl\u2019s, where the offense was committed after November 1, 1987. <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585). The new statute provides that a defendant is only entitled to federal credit if he has not already received credit against another sentence, <em>ie., </em>his state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The record shows that Wahl received credit towards his state sentence for the time he spent in state custody. Wahl does not argue otherwise. Consequently, the district court did not err by denying his Section 2241 petition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>Leal v. Tombone, </em>341 F.3d 427, 430 (5th Cir.2003) (Bureau of Prisons not required to credit state custody time toward federal sentence where time was credited against state sentence); <em>United States v. Dennis, </em>926 F.2d 768, 770 (8th Cir.1991) (defendant not entitled to federal credit for time spent in state custody because he received credit on his state sentence). The district court likewise did not err by denying Wahl\u2019s Section 2241 petition without appointing him counsel, permitting him to conduct discovery, or holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987); <em>Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 487 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Ellis v. Lynaugh, </em>873 F.2d 830, 840 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
