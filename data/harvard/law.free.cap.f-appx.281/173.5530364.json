Ingram, Jr., appeals his jury conviction and sentence on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), 846 (2000) (Count One); conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (2000) (Count Two); interference with interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (2000) (Count Three); and use of a weapon in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000) (Count Four).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced Ingram to a total of 444 months\u2019 imprisonment, ten years total supervised release, and ordered him to pay $598 in restitution. On appeal, Ingram challenges the sufficiency of the indictments and the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the offenses charged in the superseding indictment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">Ingram\u2019s first claim of error is that the indictment was insufficient because the indictment failed to specify the particular dates on which he was alleged to have committed the offenses charged. He challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss Count One of the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>nal indictment. While he admits he only challenged the original indictment below, he raises an additional challenge to the superseding indictment for the first time on appeal. Ingram offers nothing on appeal to demonstrate how the alleged flaws prejudiced his ability to defend his interests or to receive effective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir.1998) (one principal purpose of indictment is to provide sufficient information to allow preparation of defense). We have reviewed <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Ingram\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss the original indictment. <em>United States v. Loayza, </em>107 F.3d 257, 260 (4th Cir.1997). We find that the indictment is sufficient, and that the district court did not err in denying Ingram\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. Nor do we find, in reviewing for plain error<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ingram\u2019s corollary claim, that the superseding indictment was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Ingram\u2019s final claim of error is that the district court erred in denying his Fed. R.Crim.P. 59 motion because the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the drug distribution conspiracy charged in Count One of the superseding indictment, or the conspiracy and use of a firearm relating to the robbery charged in Counts Two through Four. In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction on direct review, \u201c[t]he verdict of the jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is evidence \u201cthat a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). We consider circumstantial and direct evidence, and allow the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established. <em>Id. </em>at 858; <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). Our review of the record discloses sufficient evidence presented at Ingram\u2019s trial to support the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">First, with regard to the drug conspiracy charge, Ingram contends that the witnesses against him did not testify with any specificity that there was any agreement among or between them and Ingram, but rather that the evidence established that there were a number of individuals, including Ingram, who were buying or selling drugs \u201con their own in the same vicinity\u201d on a competitive, rather than cooperative basis. He also points to alleged inconsistencies in the witnesses\u2019 testimony and their motives, asserting that such inconsistencies undermine the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The record reflects that the Government presented in excess of twenty witnesses who testified about Ingram\u2019s purchases of distribution quantity drugs and sales of those drugs on an ongoing basis. Aaron Kinchen testified that on two or three occasions he gave crack cocaine to an individual he knew as \u201cFresh\u201d who then handed the drugs over to Ingram in Kinchen\u2019s presence. Melvin John testified that he saw Ingram four to five times a week, and that he drove Ingram and Godwin Eni (together) for the purpose of conducting drug sales, five to ten per day. John testified that Ingram dealt in three and a half and seven-gram quantities of crack. He further attested that Ingram and Eni shared drugs and profits. Other witnesses testified as to sharing drug sales with In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>gram. Andy Matthews testified that Eni introduced him to Ingram as a source for the purchase of crack, and that he bought quarter to one-half ounce quantities of crack from Ingram three times a week for approximately a year. In addition, the Government introduced evidence that, based on Ingram\u2019s relationships with other drug traffickers, he was allowed to sell his drugs in areas not otherwise open to outsiders. Other witnesses testified to seeing Ingram obtain or possess one to three-ounce quantities of crack. Special Agent Danny Board testified that user quantities of crack cocaine are between a tenth to two-tenths of a gram, with three and a half gram and higher amounts being wholesale distribution-level amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">As evidenced by the finding of guilt, the jury resolved any conflicts in testimony in favor of the prosecution, determined the Government\u2019s witnesses to be sufficiently credible to support their verdict of guilty, and otherwise found sufficient circumstantial and direct evidence of guilt. We find the evidence to be adequate and sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Ingram had an agreement with two or more individuals to engage in conduct that violated a federal drug law, that he knew of the agreement, and that he knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 384-85 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The evidence likewise is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts on Counts Two through Four. The record reflects that Keon Booker testified that he, Ingram, and Michael Scarborough agreed and worked together to rob Davinei\u2019s Pizza restaurant on January 22, 2004, to obtain money to pay Booker\u2019s cousin\u2019s bond. Booker attested that each of the three co-conspirators traveled to the restaurant for the purpose of robbing it, each armed with a firearm. He testified that Ingram held one of the restaurant employees at gunpoint while Booker recovered the money. He further testified that he, Ingram, and Scarborough took money from the register, several food items, the employees\u2019 wallets, and the store\u2019s telephone. Scarborough also testified as to his role in the charged robbery, and implicated Ingram in the robbery, attesting to Ingram\u2019s role in the robbery and to Ingram\u2019s receipt of a portion of the robbery proceeds. Finally, Leonidas Brown, an inmate housed with Ingram at the Piedmont Regional Jail, testified that Ingram admitted to him that he robbed Davinei\u2019s with another individual. Ingram\u2019s claims on appeal that the witnesses\u2019 testimony was inconsistent or not credible, or that the witnesses\u2019 self-interest outweighed their credibility, are insufficient to support reversal of the jury\u2019s verdicts, because in resolving issues of substantial evidence, we do not weigh evidence or review witness credibility. <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 863. Rather, it is the role of the jury to judge the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, and weigh the evidence. <em>United States v. Manbeck, </em>744 F.2d 360, 392 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We find no merit to Ingram\u2019s claims of insufficiency of the evidence, finding that the jury\u2019s verdict on each of the four counts was amply supported by the evidence. The district court did not err in denying Ingram\u2019s Rule 59 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Ingram\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">.
