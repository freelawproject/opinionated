Bordelon supplemental security income benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382 <em>et seq., </em>and Bordelon challenged the denial in district court. The court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial, a decision that Bordelon appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">Bordelon applied for supplemental security income benefits in July 2004, alleging a disability onset date of November 20, 2003, due to depression, asthma, diabetes, kidney stones, and low back pain. Following the Commissioner\u2019s initial denial of Bordelon\u2019s claims, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on September 13, 2005, at Bordelon\u2019s request. Bordelon appeared at the hearing and testified with the assistance of a non-attorney representative. A vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) was also present and testified as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-19\">On September 22, 2005, the ALJ rendered an unfavorable decision, finding that Bordelon was not disabled as defined in the Act and was not entitled to the requested benefits. The ALJ first found that Bordelon had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged disability onset date. Next, the ALJ determined that Bordelon\u2019s depression, asthma, diabetes, kidney stones, and low back pain impairments were \u201csevere\u201d but that they did not meet or equal one of the Commissioner\u2019s listed impairments for presumptive disability. In so doing, the ALJ found that Bordelon\u2019s allegations regarding her limitations were not credible and that Bordelon retained the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform a significant range of light work \u2014 specifically, that Bordelon was \u201cable to lift 20 pounds, ten pounds occasionally and sit six hours in an eight-hour workday\u201d; that she was \u201climited to one to two step instructions\u201d; and that she was \u201cprohibited from dealing with heavy stress and should limit[ ] her public interaction.\u201d Finally, the ALJ found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Bordelon had \u201cno past relevant work\u201d and relied on the VE\u2019s testimony to find that Bordelon could perform other work in housekeeping and cleaning jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"AEk\">After the Appeals Council denied Bordelon\u2019s request for review, she filed her complaint with the district court seeking review of the final administrative decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A magistrate judge recommended that the decision be affirmed, and the district court adopted the recommendation on September 17, 2007. Bordelon appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to two inquiries: (1) whether substantial evidence supports the decision; and (2) whether the decision comports with relevant legal standards. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). If substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision, the findings are conclusive and the decision must be affirmed. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that which is relevant and sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it must be more than a scintilla, but it need not be a preponderance.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 295 (5th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). It is the role of the Commissioner, and not the courts, to resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). As a result, this court \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence, but may only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). A finding of no substantial evidence is warranted only \u201cwhere there is a conspicuous absence of credible choices or no contrary medical evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343-44 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">III. Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">A claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined in the Social Security Act if she is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The Commissioner uses a sequential, five-step approach to determine whether a claimant is so disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bordelon carried the burden of proof under the first four parts of the inquiry. <em>Leggett, </em>67 F.3d at 564. The burden of proof then shifted to the Commissioner at the fifth step to establish the existence of other available substantial gainful employment that Bordelon could perform. <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1301-02 (5th Cir.1987). Once the Commissioner identified suitable alternative employment, the burden of proof shifted back to Bordelon to prove that she could not perform the alternative work identified. <em>Id. </em>at 1302. Throughout the process, however, the ultimate burden of establishing disability remained with Bordelon. <em>Homes v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 165 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Bordelon alleges two points of error in the district court\u2019s determination that substantial evidence supports the final administrative decision that she was not disabled within the meaning of the Act: first, that the Commissioner failed to properly evaluate her mental impairments; and second, that the Commissioner posed a defective hypothetical question to the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>A. Mental Impairments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Bordelon first argues that the ALJ failed to \u201cmake any decisional <em>findings </em>on [her] impairments which are found under categories 12.06 \u2014 \u2018Anxiety Related Disorders,\u2019 or 12.08 \u2014 \u2018Personality Disorders,\u2019 \u201d that \u201cthe ALJ did not combine the additional non-exertional mental impairments found at categories 12.06 and 12.08 with the other impairments the ALJ recognized as severe,\u201d and that the ALJ violated binding social security ruling SSR 96-6p by failing to \u201cdiscuss the <em>weight </em>she accorded the State Agency medical eonsultant\u2019s expert opinion that three medically determinable mental impairments were present.\u201d These arguments fail for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">First, although the ALJ did not specifically identify anxiety disorder or personality disorder among Bordelon\u2019s severe impairments, the ALJ articulated in her decision that she considered and evaluated the medical evidence and the symptoms from Bordelon\u2019s various medical diagnoses, and Bordelon has not pointed to any symptoms affecting her RFC that the ALJ overlooked. Second, as the district court noted, Bordelon has failed to show how she specifically meets either Listing 12.06 or Listing 12.08: she fails to satisfy Listing 12.06 because she lacks medically documented findings indicating that she meets at least one of the criteria in 12.06(A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because she does not suffer from at least two of the criteria in 12.06(B) or meet 12.06(C)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and she fails to satisfy Listing 12.08 because she has not shown that she meets at least one of the criteria in 12.08(A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and two of the criteria in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>12.08(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Third, the record reflects that the ALJ specifically evaluated Listing 12.04 for affective disorders and found Bordelon failed to satisfy the requirements necessary to meet or to medically equal its criteria. Bordelon does not allege that the ALJ improperly considered Listing 12.04. It therefore follows that Bordelon similarly fails to satisfy Listings 12.06 and 12.08, because each has the same Part B requirements as Listing 12.04. An ALJ does not err by failing to specifically consider a listing if the record evidence shows that the claimant did not meet the criteria. <em>See Brock v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 726, 729 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cWe will not reverse the decision of an ALJ for lack of substantial evidence where the claimant makes no showing that he was prejudiced in any way by the deficiencies he alleges.\u201d (citation and footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Finally, contrary to Bordelon\u2019s assertion, the ALJ did not \u201csimply ignore\u201d the State Agency medical consultant\u2019s opinion. Rather, in concluding that Bordelon\u2019s impairments did not equal any of the Commissioner\u2019s listed impairments for presumptive disability, the ALJ expressly noted that she had \u201cconsidered the opinions of the State Agency medical consultants who evaluated [Bordelon\u2019s] impairments and have reached the same conclusion.\u201d Accordingly, substantial evidence and relevant legal standards show that the Commissioner properly evaluated Bordelon\u2019s mental impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>B. Hypothetical Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Bordelon also contends that \u201cthe ALJ posited a defective Step 5 hypothetical question to the vocational expert because the ALJ did not name the diagnosed impairment Personality Disorder with dependent and histrionic features,\u201d and because the hypothetical did not include \u201cmoderate\u201d limitations in concentration, persistence and pace, as found by the non-examining psychological consultant. As the district court explained, however, Bordelon fails to distinguish between her diagnosed impairments and the functional limitations caused by those impairments on her ability to work. Because the ALJ properly articulated Bordelon\u2019s specific functional limitations in the hypothetical question to the VE, the hypothetical question was valid. <em>See Hames, </em>707 F.2d at 165 (\u201cThe mere presence of some impairment is not disabling per se. Plaintiff must show that she was so functionally impaired ... that she was precluded from engaging in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d (citations omitted)). It is outside of the VE\u2019s expertise to make a medical assessment of the symptoms and of the resulting limitations of a claimant\u2019s diagnosed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">In addition, Bordelon has failed to show any prejudice arising from the hypothetical question\u2019s omission of her \u201cmoderate\u201d concentration, persistence, and pace limitations. <em>See Brock, </em>84 F.3d at 729. In determining Bordelon\u2019s RFC, the ALJ specifically noted that she had \u201cconsidered all of the evidence presented including pri- or determinations made by the state agency consultants and ha[d] given the accorded weight in the light of the objective findings and medical evidence presented since their determination.\u201d The ALJ then found that based on this evidence, Bordelon retained the RFC for light work activity: \u201cShe is able to lift 20 pounds, ten pounds occasionally and sit six hours in an eight-hour workday. She is limited to one to two step instructions. She is prohibited from dealing with heavy stress and should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>limit[ ] her public interaction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the VE adequately reflected these limitations. The ALJ asked the VE to assume an individual \u201cwho\u2019s 38 years old with approximately a seventh grade educational level, and ... no past relevant work.\u201d The hypothetical woman was \u201climited to lifting 20 pounds occasionally, 10 frequently [and to] [w]alk[ing], standing, or sitting, two hours in an eight-hour day.\u201d The woman also \u201cwould need a job with only rare public interaction, low stress, so ... simple, one-, two-step-type instructions.\u201d Such restrictions to rare public interaction, low stress, and simple, one- to two-step instructions reflect that the ALJ reasonably incorporated Bordelon\u2019s moderate concentration, persistence, and pace limitations such that the hypothetical question was proper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Bowling v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that \u201cthe hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert by the ALJ [must] incorporate reasonably all disabilities of the claimant recognized by the ALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Finding that substantial evidence and relevant legal standards support the final administrative decision to deny Bordelon\u2019s application for supplemental security income benefits, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
