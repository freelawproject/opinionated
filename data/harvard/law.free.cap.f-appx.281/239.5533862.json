To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Njinjoh fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Njinjoh cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, we uphold the finding below that Njinjoh failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
