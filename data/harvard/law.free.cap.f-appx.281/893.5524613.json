On appeal, Ag\u00fcera initially argues that the district court erred in finding him responsible for the entire amount of loss to Medicare resulting irom the conspiracy. He maintains that he did not design or execute the scheme, pool profits or resources with his co-conspirators, or work with them. He asserts that he cannot be held accountable based on his mere awareness of the scope of the overall operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Masferrer, </em>514 F.3d 1158, 1164 (11th Cir.2008). Section 2B4.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which applies to offenses involving commercial bribery, requires the district court to increase the offense level if the value of the bribe or the improper benefit exceeds $5,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1(b)(l). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(1)(B), \u201cthe district court may hold participants in a conspiracy responsible for the losses resulting from the reasonably foreseeable acts of co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003). To determine the limits of sentencing accountability, the district court must first make individualized findings concerning the scope of the criminal activity undertaken by a particular defendant. <em>Id. </em>It may consider \u201cany explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others\u201d in determining the scope of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1319-20. Second, it must determine whether the conduct was \u201c(1) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity[] and (2) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">In determining whether activity is jointly undertaken, a court may consider whether the participants pool resources, such as sharing lead sheets of potential victims and telephones. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>996 F.2d 284, 285-86 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(per </em>curiam). Another relevant factor is \u201cwhether the defendant assisted in designing and executing the scheme.\u201d <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1321. However, a defendant\u2019s mere awareness of the scope of the overall operation is not enough to hold him accountable for the activities of the entire conspiracy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The illustrations appended to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 provide guidance in determining whether a defendant should be accountable for his co-eonspirator\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>One illustration follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-11\">Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography. Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other\u2019s criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is Defendant K\u2019s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K and frequently superases the deliveries to Defendant K\u2019s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is accountable ... for the entire quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. Defendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those defendants ... because the entii\u2019e quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (illus. (c)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In <em>United States v. Studley, </em>47 F.3d 569 (2d Cir.1995) (persuasive authority), the Second Circuit vacated the sentence of a salesman who participated in a fraudulent telemarketing scheme, which secured application fees by false representation. <em>Id. </em>at 570. Because <em>Studley </em>did not design or develop the telemarketing scam, further the scheme outside of his individual sales efforts, pool profits with the overall operation, assist other representatives with sales, or share resources with his co-conspirators, that circuit concluded that \u201c[he] had no interest in the success of the operation as a whole, and took no steps to further the operation beyond executing his sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576. Similarly, the court <em>Hunter </em>vacated the sentences of several \u201crunners\u201d recruited by a ring of counterfeiters to cash counterfeit checks at various banks. <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1316-17. We noted that the runners\u2019 mere knowledge of the larger check-cashing ring could not make them accountable for the activities of the entire conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 1321. Further, the government failed to \u201cpresent\u00ed ] any evidence of sharing or mutuality from which an agreement in the larger scheme [could] be inferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">By contrast, in <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725 (11th Cir.2004), we affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the entire loss caused by a money laundering scheme properly was attributed to the defendant because he \u201cwas fully aware of the objective of the conspiracy and was actively involved in recruiting investors to further the ... scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732. The scheme was \u201cdependent upon <em>[McCrimmon\u2019s] </em>success in increasing the entire pool of money that could be redistributed to investors as interest payments, or pocketed by the other conspirators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Although he did not design the scheme, <em>McCrimmon </em>\u201cconcocted a method in which he could continue to put investors into the program and further the scheme\u201d and \u201cwas certainly not a low-end operative merely aware that he was participating in some sort of criminal ring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Because the evidence established that Ag\u00fcera recruited accomplices in furtherance of the conspiracy and participated in the scheme, with full knowledge of its nature and scope, the district court did not err in finding him responsible for the entire amount of loss caused by the conspiracy. While Ag\u00fcera did not design the scheme or pool resources with other DME companies, he furthered the conspiracy by aiding Gonzalez and Rodriguez in their effort to recruit DME companies. He also made their scheme significantly more profitable by recruiting nearly 200 patients to participate in the conspiracy. The criminal activities of the other DME companies were reasonably foreseeable because Ag\u00fcera observed the extensive list of participating DME companies in the log book when he signed in to retrieve his kickbacks every month.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Aguera\u2019s reliance on <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Studley </em>is misplaced because those defendants, unlike Ag\u00fcera, did not recruit participants to expand the overall conspiracy. Further, Aguera\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>McCrimmon </em>fail. While the scheme may not have depended on Aguera\u2019s individual success, Gonzalez testified that the scheme depended on the ability of the individual DME companies to recruit Medicare eligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ble patients. Therefore, by recruiting additional DME companies and nearly 200 patients, Ag\u00fcera significantly increased the likelihood of success for both Gonzalez and Rodriguez. Although Ag\u00fcera did not design the scheme or pool profits with other DME companies, such a finding is not necessary when a defendant recruits accomplices in furtherance of the entire conspiracy and participates in the scheme. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (illus.(c)(4)). Thus, the district court did not err in finding that Ag\u00fcera was accountable for the entire amount of loss caused by Gonzalez and Rodriguez because it \u201cwas within the scope of jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Ag\u00fcera also argues that the district court erred in finding that he was a leader or organizer in the conspiracy, warranting a four-level role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). He asserts that he played a small role in the overall scheme because he did not share profits with his co-conspirators, participate in the part of the essential operations of the scheme, or design, plan, or organize the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an increase in the offense level based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. Section 3Bl.l(a) provides a four-level enhancement when a defendant plays an organizational or leadership role. <em>Id. </em>The enhancement is appropriate when the. criminal activity involves five or more participants or when the defendant\u2019s role is \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir.1994). Section 1B1.3 of the Guidelines defines the relevant conduct to be considered in determining a defendant\u2019s role under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>Id. </em>Relevant conduct includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\u201d and \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d \u201coccurring] during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The district court should consider the following factors in determining a leadership and organizational role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-8\">[T]he exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 4). The defendant need not be the sole leader or kingpin of the conspiracy to merit enhancement. <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). However, application of the section \u201crequires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The district court did not err in applying a four-level role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), because Ag\u00fcera exerted control over the conspiracy and recruited accomplices. The evidence established that Ag\u00fcera exercised a degree of control over the conspiracy and recruited accomplices, including his codefendants and nearly 200 patients. While Ag\u00fcera did not have a right to receive a larger share of the Medicare reimbursements, Gonzalez and Rodriguez split the payments in half with the DME companies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Although he did not manage operations as a pharmacy owner like Gonzalez and Rodriguez, Ag\u00fcera had direct control over the organization and management of his DME company and its methods of patient recruitment. Gonzalez testified that DME companies were necessary to accomplish the scheme because they controlled the flow of patients to the pharmacies. Thus Ag\u00fcera, as DME owner and operator, had direct control and influence in the scheme\u2019s success.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Finally, Ag\u00fcera argues that the district court plainly erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1 rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 in calculating the base offense level. He maintains that the ultimate purpose of the scheme was fraud rather than bribery and contends that the error was plain, affected his substantial rights, and affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial process because it resulted in a higher base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Where a defendant raises a sentencing objection for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 942 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 - U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 427, 169 L.Ed.2d 299 (2007). Under this standard, the defendant first must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). An error is plain if it is \u201c\u2018obvious\u2019 and \u2018clear under current law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999). Clear under current law means that \u201cat least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this [Circuit] directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The substantive offense in this case is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b, soliciting and receiving kickbacks involving a federal health care program. The Statutory Index lists two possible guidelines for that offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1 (larceny) and 2B4.1 (commercial bribery). U.S.S.G. app. A, at 537. If more than one section is referenced for a particular statute, the sentencing court should use the section \u201cmost appropriate for the nature of the conduct charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Starks, </em>157 F.3d 833, 841 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Section 2B1.1 of the Guidelines applies generally to (1) larceny, embezzlement, and other forms of theft, (2) offenses involving stolen property, (3) property damage or destruction, (4) fraud and deceit, (4) forgery, and (5) offenses involving altered or counterfeit instruments other than counterfeit bearer obligations of the United States. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. On the other hand, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1 applies to bribery in the procurement of a bank loan and other commercial bribery. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Because any error was not clear under current law, the district court did not plainly err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B4.1 rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 to determine Aguera\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-14\">.
