On appeal, Williamson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that there was insufficient evidence that Williamson violated the terms of his supervised release and that his sentence was not reasonable. Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Williamson has not done so. The Government filed a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Williamson was originally convicted for mailing threatening communications and received a 41-month sentence. He was released from custody on December 1, 2004. On September 30, 2005, a petition for warrant or summons was filed by Williamson\u2019s probation officer alleging that Williamson violated a condition of his supervision that prohibited him from committing another federal, state, or local crime. Specifically, Williamson pled guilty to misdemeanor breaking and entering charges on August 8, 2005, in Rockingham County, North Carolina, Superior Court. At the supervised release hearing, Williamson was committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for twelve months, to be followed by a period of twenty-four months of supervised release. As a special condition, the court ordered that Williamson reside in a residential reentry center (RRC) for 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">Williamson was released from prison on January 12, 2007, and began serving his second term of supervised release. The probation office arranged for Williamson to reside in the Dismas Charities facility, which Williamson entered on March 12, 2007. On March 16, 2007, Williamson signed himself out of the RRC for an appointment and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">On April 26, 2007, the probation office filed a petition for warrant or summons, alleging two violations of the terms of supervised release: unsuccessful termination from Dismas Charities-the RRC, and failure to work regularly. The court held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>hearing on July 2, 2007. Counsel for Williamson admitted the violations. Williamson testified that he reported to the RRC, stayed for five days, and voluntarily left to reside with his mother. Williamson told the court that he left the RRC because there was too much freedom and stress for it to be a successful placement for him. He testified that he informed his probation officer that he was leaving the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The district court determined that Williamson \u201cvoluntarily and willfully\u201d violated the terms of his supervised release. The court then imposed a twelve-month term of imprisonment with no additional supervised release ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). An abuse of discretion occurs when the court fails or refuses to exercise its discretion or when its exercise of discretion is flawed by an erroneous legal or factual premise. <em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). We conclude that there was sufficient evidence, in light of Williamson\u2019s admission, to support the revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Next, Williamson suggests that the sentence imposed by the district court after revoking his supervised release was not reasonable. Williamson does not assert any error in the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines in determining the advisory sentencing range. In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>this court held that \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d 461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). Applying the analysis articulated in <em>Cmdwp, </em>we find that Williamson\u2019s sentence for violating supervised release is not unreasonable, much less plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">As correctly noted by the district court, the advisory Guidelines range for Williamson\u2019s violation was eight to fourteen months for a Grade G violation with an original criminal history category of VI. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2007). Williamson\u2019s prior conviction for mailing threatening communications was a Class C felony, so the statutory maximum sentence on revocation of supervised release was twenty-four months. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 876, 3559(a)(3), 3583(e) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). Williamson was sentenced to and served one twelve-month term on revocation of supervised release, so an additional twelve-month term was the maximum sentence available. Williamson\u2019s twelve-month sentence was thus within the statutory maximum. Moreover, the district court sufficiently articulated its sentencing deliberations to demonstrate that it did not abuse its discretion in selecting the term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Williamson\u2019s supervised release and imposing a twelve-month sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
