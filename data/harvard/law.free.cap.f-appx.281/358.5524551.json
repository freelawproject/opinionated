The district court concluded that his challenge to the denial of mandatory supervision should have been raised in habeas. In his complaint, Curry had argued that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (the Board) had denied him mandatory supervision in excess of its authority and, by doing so, had \u201cstripped\u201d him of his good time and work time credits. In his request for relief, Curry asks that his credits be applied and that he be released. Because Curry\u2019s requested relief is immediate release to mandatory supervision, he is calling into question the validity or duration of his confinement, which should be raised in habeas. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). Although Curry asserts that he must obtain a declaratory judgment that the Board\u2019s actions were unconstitutional before seeking release through a habeas proceeding, a habeas petition is an appropriate means of challenging the constitutionality of a prisoner\u2019s custody. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Curry also argues the merits of the claims he raised in his postjudgment motion to amend. The district court denied the motion because the final judgment had been entered. As Curry does not identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, he has not established that he is entitled to relief. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Curry has not established that the district court abused its discretion in denying his postjudgment motion. <em>See Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 864-65 (5th Cir.2003). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
