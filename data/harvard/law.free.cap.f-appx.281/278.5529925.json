Alvarado argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to give adequate weight to his history of mental health problems in mitigation of his culpability and in terms of his personal characteristics and history. Because Alvarado never objected to the sentence as unreasonable, review is for plain error only. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-93 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.) (revocation context), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-24\">Although Alvarado does not allege procedural error in the sentencing, we notice that his sentence for marihuana importation \u2014 84 months of imprisonment followed by 10 years of supervised release \u2014 exceeds the applicable statutory m\u00e1ximums. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(4); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>974 F.2d 22, 24-25 (5th Cir.1992). Because his total terms of imprisonment and supervised release will not be affected by modification, given the concurrent sentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>posed for his conviction of possession with intent to distribute marihuana, we modify the sentence for marihuana importation to 60 months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. <em>See United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir.2005). The sentence still runs concurrently with the sentence imposed for the conviction on the other count.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The district court sentenced Alvarado, within the sentencing guidelines, to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 10 years\u2019 supervised release, for possession with intent to distribute marihuana. The district court listened to the statement of Alvarado and his attorney\u2019s arguments based on Alvarado\u2019s history of mental health problems. The court reviewed Alvarado\u2019s criminal history and the specific facts of the crime and explained that Alvarado\u2019s culpability was not reduced by his mental health problems. The court\u2019s reasoning also reflects attention to such \u00a7 3553(a) factors as promoting respect for the law, affording adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Thus, Alvarado has not shown that the sentence constitutes error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). The judgment is therefore affirmed as modified. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir.2000) (plain error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">MODIFIED IN PART; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
