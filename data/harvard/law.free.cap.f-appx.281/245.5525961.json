Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">I. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Torres first alleges on appeal that the United States Attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct by (1) improperly and prejudicially commenting on the credibility of his sole exculpatory witness, Gail Barnette, and implying extrajudicial information proved her testimony was false, and (2) intimidating Barnette prior to trial, thereby effectively denying Torres his right to a fair trial. To establish prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must show that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct or remarks were improper, and that the conduct or remarks prejudicially affected his substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>United States v. Golding, </em>168 F.3d 700, 702 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The Assistant United States Attorney did not state that Barnette had lied either during cross-examination or closing arguments. Rather, in response to Barnette\u2019s indication that the prosecutor had threatened her and scared her into changing her story, he cross-examined her regarding them conversation the morning of trial, eliciting Barnette\u2019s acknowledgment that he had told her he did not believe her new, inconsistent statement, and that if she lied on the stand and he could prove it, she could be prosecuted for perjury. During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated several times that Barnette\u2019s testimony was \u201cinherently incredible\u201d and \u201cunbelievable,\u201d and followed those statements with a recitation of the evidence supporting his contentions. He again recounted his conversation with Barnette the morning of trial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-14\">I told her, and she confirmed this with you, that I simply told her I didn\u2019t believe what she was telling me, and I summed up the evidence for her that you heard yesterday, and I told her that if she lied \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell her that if she said what she told me she would be indicted for perjury. I told her \u201cIf you lie under oath about anything and we can prove it, you\u2019ll be indicted for perjury.\u201d This was no surprise to her. And, in fact, she admitted that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">During the Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s closing statements, the court instructed the jury: \u201cMembers of the jury, you\u2019ll take your own recollection as to what the evidence was in the case and not that urged upon you by either counsel.\u201d The prosecutor also informed the jury: \u201canything I say about this conversation is based not on what I remember, but based on what she said on the stand. If you remember it differently, please, you know, go with your recollections.\u201d The district court reenforced this point, instructing the jury that: \u201cYou are the sole judges of credibility of the witnesses in this trial and the weight that their testimony deserves. You may believe all, a part, or none of what a witness said.\u201d In addition, the court instructed the jury: \u201cIf a lawyer asked a question which contains an assertion of fact, you may not consider the assertion as evidence of that fact. The lawyers\u2019 statements are not evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We find the prosecutor\u2019s statements properly \u201cstressed] to the jury the inconsistencies and improbabilities in [Barnette\u2019 s] testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>710 F.2d 157, 159 (4th Cir.1983). Further, his statements did not substantially prejudice Torres, especially given the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it was solely up to them to determine witness credibility. <em>See id. </em>at 159-60. We also find the Assistant United States Attorney did not imply to the jury that he was relying on extrajudicial evidence to inform Barnette during their meeting that he knew she was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Next, we find that the Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s warning to Barnette against committing perjury did not amount to substantial witness interference. <em>See Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 262, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988) (holding warning to attorney implying client would be subject to prosecution for perjury if the witness testified was not improper and did not give rise to a finding of prejudice); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>398 F.3d 306, 310 (4th Cir.2005) (upholding district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s statement that [the witness] possibly faced prosecution for perjury or obstruction of justice by repudiating his earlier statements was, in these circumstances, the act of a prudent prosecutor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">II. <em>Exclusion of Witness Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Torres next contends the district court erred by excluding as irrelevant the testimony of his parents. This court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on the exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Fulks, </em>454 F.3d 410, 434 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3002, 168 L.Ed.2d 731 (2007). Although a defendant has a constitutional right to present evidence in his favor, <em>see United States v. Moussaoui, </em>382 F.3d 453, 471 (4th Cir.2004), \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to present a defense is not absolute: criminal defendants do not have a right to present evidence that the district court, in its discretion, deems irrelevant or immaterial.\u201d <em>United States v. Prince-Oyibo, </em>320 F.3d 494, 501 (4th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">We find Torres fails to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in excluding testimony about Torres\u2019 parents\u2019 alleged past encounters concerning a traffic ticket and a motor vehicle accident with one of the arresting officers. <em>See United States v. Leeson, </em>453 F.3d 631, 636 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cFederal Rule of Evidence 401 defines relevant evidence as \u2018evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence ... more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 401), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1874, 167 L.Ed.2d 365 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">III. <em>Upward Departure on Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Torres argues the district court failed to provide adequate notice of its intent to depart from the guidelines. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) requires the sentencing court give the parties reasonable notice when it is considering a departure on a ground not identified as a possible basis for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission. We find Torres had adequate notice the court would consider an upward departure at sentencing. The Government requested an upward departure prior to sentencing in its objections to the presentence report, to which Torres responded. While the probation officer did not adopt the Government\u2019s view, it noted that the position of the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>would be \u201cprovided to the court for consideration at sentencing.\u201d The Government restated its intent to seek an upward departure in its sentencing memorandum. Torres thus had sufficient notice the court would consider the Government\u2019s request for an upward departure at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Next, Torres argues the district court erroneously based its decision to depart upwardly on evidence of prior arrests that did not result in convictions. A departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3 (2006) is encouraged, provided that the criminal history category does not account adequately for the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that he will commit other crimes. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>318 F.3d 585, 588 (4th Cir.2003). However, a \u201cprior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The district court improperly considered Torres\u2019 prior arrests. We find the error harmless, however, because the district court relied primarily on Torres\u2019 extensive criminal history, including probation violations, revocations, and history of assaulting law enforcement officers, in deciding to depart, and thus the record supports the upward departure without consideration of Torres\u2019 prior arrests. <em>See United States v. Left Hand Bull, </em>477 F.3d 518, 520-21 (8th Cir.2006) (holding district court\u2019s reliance on prior arrests harmless where court relied primarily on defendant\u2019s \u201cextensive criminal history and supervised release violations. The record supports the upward departure, without consideration of his arrest record or warrants\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3072, 168 L.Ed.2d 779 (2007); <em>United States v. Hawk Wing, </em>433 F.3d 622, 629 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e conclude that the district court had adequate grounds to depart upward despite its error in considering the prior arrests for which the PSR did not set forth the factual details.\u201d); <em>United States v. Matheny, </em>450 F.3d 633, 642-43 (6th Cir.2006) (finding that although the district court committed error in considering a prior arrest, the error did not require reversal because the error did not affect defendant\u2019s substantial rights since the record otherwise supported the upward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
