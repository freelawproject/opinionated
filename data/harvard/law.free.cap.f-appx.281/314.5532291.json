The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied her application. Both the Appeals Council and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-19\">An individual is disabled under the Social Security Act if his \u201cphysical or mental impairments\u201d preclude him from \u201cen-gag[ing] in any ... kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). The ALJ found that Ortega was not disabled because she could perform various light-work jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. While the opinion of Ortega\u2019s treating physician arguably supported her claim, the ALJ concluded that substantial evidence showed that Ortega was not disabled. Ortega contends that the ALJ erred because substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s ruling, and the ALJ improperly considered the testimony of the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-20\">\u201cThis Court limits its review of a denial of disability insurance benefits to two issues: (1) whether the [ALJ] applied the proper legal standards, and (2) whether the [ALJ\u2019s] decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 292 (5th Cir.1992). After a careful review of the record, we find that the ALJ applied the proper legal standards, and substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s ruling. Therefore, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
