The district court sentenced Waters to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment for the first three counts and an additional consecutive 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, mandated by statute, on count four. On appeal, Waters challenges the reasonableness of this sentence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Waters was indicted after twice selling firearms, and on one occasion crack cocaine along with a firearm, to a confidential informant, and being recorded by the Portsmouth Police Department and the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) Task Force in the process. He subsequently pleaded guilty to all charges in the indictment and agreed to the underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Prior to his sentencing, a probation officer prepared Waters\u2019s pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR listed Waters\u2019s total offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) as 30. This included a 2-level increase for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Specifically, the PSR alleged that, \u201c[Fallowing his arrest for the instant offenses, [Waters] attempted to have a witness murdered so that [the witness] would not be available to testify against [him].\u201d J.A. 149. As a result, the PSR also recommended denying Waters the offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4 (\u201cConduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d). The PSR listed Waters\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category\u201d as III, based on his prior convictions. The corresponding Guidelines range for Waters\u2019s four offenses, based on this criminal history category and his offense level, was 181 to 211 months (121 to 151 months, plus the statutorily mandated consecutive sentence of 60 months for his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) \u2014 carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">At Waters\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government argued for an upward departure in his criminal history category on the grounds that category III did not adequately reflect the seriousness of his actual criminal history and his likelihood of recidivism. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7' 4A1.3(a)(2)(E). The government cited a number of incidents detailed in the PSR, including Waters\u2019s alleged pointing of a handgun at a victim and threatening the victim\u2019s life in September 2006, which resulted in a dismissed concealed weapons charge, and Waters\u2019s almost identical conduct in January 2007, which resulted in a charge of brandishing a firearm which was subsequently nol pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">In support of the September 2006 allegation, the government introduced into evidence a police report of the incident and statements made by the victim and his mother. One of the government\u2019s witnesses, ATF Agent Christopher Scott, also testified to the conversations that he had with those individuals in which they confirmed the allegations but declined to testify against Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">As to the January 2007 incident, the government called another witness, Officer Isaac Lopez of the Suffolk Police Department, who testified that Waters was accused of pointing a handgun at two female victims and threatening to fire the handgun into a van containing the victims as well as several children. Officer Lopez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>recounted his interviews with the victims and witnesses of the incident. Officer Lopez also testified that Waters admitted involvement in the incident but stated that he had not brandished a handgun, claiming instead that another individual had fired a handgun at him. The government submitted the victims\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 grand jury testimony to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The government further argued that Waters\u2019s sentence should be increased due to several aggravating circumstances. Agent Scott testified to Waters\u2019s involvement in the violent \u201cWilliamstown Gang.\u201d In addition to describing several shootings in which the Williamstown Gang was allegedly involved, Agent Scott described a video confiscated by police which depicted Waters, along with several other known gang members, brandishing firearms and flashing the Williamstown Gang\u2019s signs. The government submitted still photos from this video to the court. Agent Scott further testified that Waters was often seen wearing the colors of the Williams-town Gang and went by the gang nickname \u201cBang em up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Most significantly, Agent Scott went on to describe Waters\u2019s alleged attempt, while incarcerated, to lime a hit man to murder the government\u2019s principal witness against him. According to Agent Scott\u2019s testimony, Waters solicited a fellow inmate to locate someone who would murder the witness for a sum of money. Waters told the inmate that he was in contact with his own gang members to perform the murder but that he needed it done more quickly as his court date was fast approaching. The inmate reported Waters\u2019s request to law enforcement agents who then arranged for Waters to be contacted by an undercover officer posing as a \u201chitman.\u201d In a recorded telephone conversation, Waters gave detailed instructions to the undercover officer and stressed that the murder needed to be carried out immediately due to the imminence of his trial date. Waters agreed to pay $3000 in installments for the crime. The government submitted a transcript of this recorded conversation to the court along with the supporting investigative summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Waters did not submit any evidence or otherwise refute the government\u2019s allegations. He did, however, argue against the obstruction of justice enhancement, in favor of the acceptance of responsibility reduction, and against both of the government\u2019s motions for upward departures.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">After hearing the above testimony and reviewing the evidence, the district court first found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Waters should receive the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 obstruction of justice enhancement. The court then denied Waters the acceptance of responsibility reduction, stating, \u201cThe solicitation to murder one of the government\u2019s chief witnesses in order to prevent him or her from testifying ... is clear evidence that he\u2019s not truly accepting responsibility for all of his criminal conduct.\u201d J.A. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The court next found that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the allegations that Waters had brandished a firearm and made violent threats in September 2006 and January 2007, and was a member of the Williamstown Gang. Based on the two \u201cbrandishing\u201d incidents, and applying the incremental approach mandated by U.S.S.G \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B) and <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868 (4th Cir.1992),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court increased Wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ters\u2019s criminal history category from III to IV. This upward departure had the effect of increasing Waters\u2019s Guideline range from 181 to 211 months to 195 to 228 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The district court then turned to the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). The government had argued that Waters\u2019s \u201cmembership in a gang and the extent of [his] attempted obstruction\u201d made this an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case where an upward variance in the sentence was appropriate. J.A. 120. Waters, however, urged the court to vary the sentence downward to only 10 years\u2019, or 120 months\u2019, imprisonment based on his feelings of remorse, his youth, troubled childhood, and limited violent criminal history. The court considered both parties\u2019 arguments and each \u00a7 3553(a) factor and determined that due to \u201cthe type of obstruction of justice in this particular case [and] the membership in ... a very violent gang,\u201d an upward variance was warranted. The court sentenced Waters to a total of 260 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by a 5-year period of supervised release. Waters challenges this sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The Supreme Court has recently clarified the limited scope of our review of district courts\u2019 sentencing determinations. It is now clear that we review all such determinations for abuse of discretion, whether or not the sentence imposed is within the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThis abuse of discretion standard of review involves two steps[;] the first examines the sentence for significant procedural errors, the second looks at the substance of the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (examining <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97). Significant procedural errors include \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Our substantive review, by contrast, goes to the length and contours of the sentence imposed. When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, this court must \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range ... but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>This deference is premised on the district court\u2019s \u201cgreater familiarity ... with the individual case and the individual defendant,\u201d and its expertise in sentencing matters. <em>Rita v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Thus, \u201c[t]he fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that <em>we </em>might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Under both prongs of our review, we examine the sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Waters first asserts that the district court committed procedural error by \u201cselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. He contends that the information underlying the upward departure in his criminal history level was unreliable and that the court erred in concluding otherwise. The government predictably disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The Guidelines provide that \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). Such information may include evidence that the defendant has engaged in significant \u201c[pjrior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(E). When applying these Guidelines provisions in an advisory manner, the district court may make factual findings, such as whether information of similar conduct exists and if it is indeed reliable, using the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 322-23 (4th Cir.2007). We will overturn these findings only if they are clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Far from constituting clear error, the district court\u2019s findings here were amply supported by the testimony of ATF Agent Scott and Officer Lopez, transcripts of grand jury testimony of Waters\u2019s several victims and the several witnesses to his criminal conduct, as well as photographs and police reports. Waters presented absolutely no evidence to refute the allegations. Further, the court used this wealth of \u201creliable\u201d information to increase Waters\u2019s criminal history category by only one level and explained its reasoning for doing so. In short, the district court committed no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Waters next contends that the district court erred in imposing the upward variance resulting in a 260 month sentence instead of the 228 month Guidelines maximum (after applying the departure). He argues that the variance was based on factors already accounted for in calculating the Guidelines range and in the upward departure discussed above. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">If the district court \u201cdecides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, [it] must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. This court must uphold such a variance if the district court\u2019s rationale is \u201creasonable and premised on the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 474; <em>see United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cIf the district court\u2019s justifications for the variance sentence are tied to \u00a7 3553(a) and are plausible, we will uphold the sentence as reasonable.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Here, the district court considered each \u00a7 3553(a) factor carefully. In particular, when discussing \u201cadequate deterrence and [the need] to protect the public\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a), the court emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Waters\u2019s membership in a \u201cvery violent gang\u201d and the \u201cextent of [his] obstruction of justice\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as meriting a variance. J.A. 127-28. The court\u2019s rationale in this regard was both \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cplausible,\u201d and appropriately cites to factors which set this case apart from the \u201cheartland\u201d of cases contemplated by the Guidelines. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Although, as Waters contends, the court applied the obstruction of justice enhancement when calculating his original Guidelines range, it was not precluded from considering \u201cthe cavalier method\u201d in which Waters planned to have the witness against him killed and the fact that he was only fortuitously prevented from doing so by the actions of an informant in determining that a variance was in order. J.A. 127-28. As the district court said repeatedly, \u201cthere is obstruction of justice and there is <em>obstruction </em>of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The discretion afforded to district courts to fashion the appropriate sentence in each case is due precisely to situations such as this where the enhancement provided by the Guidelines fails to capture the gravity and flagraney of the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>See Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 99, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (\u201cTo ignore the district court\u2019s special competence \u2014 about the ordinariness or unusualness of a particular case \u2014 would risk depriving [us] of an important source of information, namely, the reactions of the trial judge to the fact-specific circumstances of the case.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Waters\u2019s final contention is that the combination of the upward departure and the upward variance resulted in an \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201csubstantively unreasonable\u201d sentence, and \u201cthe reasons provided by the district court were simply not so compelling to justify the length of the sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20 (internal quotations omitted). Waters forges no specific challenges to the district court\u2019s reasoning, however, and instead just emphasizes the sentence\u2019s length and its deviation from the original Guidelines range. It thus appears that Waters is inviting us to engage in the type of mathematical calculation and appellate second-guessing precluded by the current abuse of discretion regime. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595, 597. (\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d). On the facts before us, we cannot say that the sentence imposed here \u2014 -260 months, only 49 months greater than the upper end of the originally calculated Guidelines range \u2014 is either unreasonable or unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Because we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s sentencing determinations, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Rusher provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">Once the district court has decided to depart upward in the criminal history category, the majority of courts, in making their \"reasonableness\u201d inquiry, require the judge to refer first to the next higher category and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>allow the court to move on to a still higher category only upon a finding that the next higher category fails adequately to reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfV\">966 F.2d at 884.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"><em>. </em>At sentencing, the district court failed to include the obstruction of justice enhancement in its calculation and therefore misstated that this departure increased Waters\u2019s guideline range to 135 to 168 months. Neither party argues that this misstatement affected Waters's ultimate sentence, and it was subsequently corrected in the court\u2019s final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-17\">. We may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness to sentences outside the Guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">. Insofar as Waters challenges the district court's decision to give \u201cexcessive consideration\u201d to these two factors, Supreme Court precedent makes clear that \"attaching] great weight\u201d to a particular factor or factors is \u201cquite reasonabl[e]\" so long as the sentence imposed is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to accomplish the goals of sentencing advanced in \u00a7 3553. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 602; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); see <em>also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 569-70, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
