Hamidullah, </em>No. 0:05-cv-02546, 2006 WL 2076942 (D.S.C. July 24, 2006) (the \u201cOrder\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Webb maintains that the award of summary judgment was made erroneously, because he had demonstrated that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, and that they had retaliated against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As explained below, we reject Webb\u2019s contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">In September 2005, Webb filed a pro se complaint against the Defendants in the District of South Carolina, alleging that their deliberate indifference to his medical needs and acts of retaliation violated his Eighth Amendment rights. In an amended pro se complaint filed on October 6, 2005, Webb restated his constitutional claims and alleged an additional claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \u201cFTCA claim\u201d). His claims center on alleged medical care deficiencies related to (1) a hernia condition, (2) left forearm problems, and (3) a foot deformity, as well as retaliatory and medically inappropriate prison work assignments. He sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief, such as proper medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Webb\u2019s complaint was referred to a magistrate judge for pretrial proceedings and, on February 3, 2006, the Defendants sought dismissal or, alternatively, summary judgment. After ordering the Defendants to submit additional evidence, the magistrate judge assessed the dispositive motion and, on June 23, 2006, issued his Report and Recommendation. <em>See Webb v. Hamidullah, </em>No. 0:05-cv-02546 (D.S.C. June 23, 2006) (the \u201cReport\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Report recommended to the district court that summary judgment be awarded to the Defendants on Webb\u2019s constitutional claims, and that the FTCA claim be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">On July 24, 2006, the district court entered the Order giving rise to this appeal, first ruling that Webb had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on the FTCA claim as it related to the conduct of officials at FCI-Estill. The court thus dismissed the FTCA claim without prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Order also granted summary judgment to the Defendants on Webb\u2019s constitutional claims, adopting the Report of the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Webb timely noted an appeal from the district court\u2019s rulings, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although Webb initially proceeded pro se, we subsequently appointed counsel to represent him on appeal. Having carefully considered all of Webb\u2019s appellate contentions, we summarily reject the majority of them. We conclude, however, that certain issues surrounding Webb\u2019s hernia-related Eighth Amendment claim are worthy of a more thorough analysis, and we therefore dedicate the balance of this opinion to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">Webb, who is fifty years old, is presently serving a 355-month prison sentence, imposed on him in March 2001 in the Middle District of North Carolina. His medical conditions, which include what is known as a ventral hernia, stem from several gunshot wounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While awaiting his initial designation to a federal prison facility, Webb was hospitalized for hernia complications and kidney failure. He received emergency hernia surgery on May 10, 2001, and was transferred soon thereafter to the Springfield, Missouri, prison medical facility. With the exception of a few weeks in early 2003, Webb was at Springfield until January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">In September 2003, a surgical consultant at Springfield observed that scar tissue from Webb\u2019s 2001 hernia surgery was infected, and recommended surgical repair. A second surgical consultation in December 2003 revealed that Webb had \u201can extremely enlarged ventral incisional hernia,\u201d and required \u201csurgical intervention\u201d to excise scar tissue that \u201cinhibited and hindered potential success for repair.\u201d JA. 308. Webb was scheduled for such surgery on January 2, 2004, at an off-site hospital. On the morning of surgery, however, he refused to be transported to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>hospital, apparently due to animosity towards the correctional officer who was to accompany him. Webb also refused to sign a Medical Treatment Refusal form that alerted him to the possible consequences of foregoing surgery, including \u201cworsening of hernia, strangulation of hernia, bowel obstruction, death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311. His prison medical file simply reflects that Webb \u201crefused surgery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Webb was transferred from Springfield to FCI-Estill on June 16, 2004. During a routine physical examination soon thereafter', FCI-Estill officials learned of Webb\u2019s medical conditions, including his ventral hernia. Prison records indicate that Webb did not complain of chronic pain at the intake screening. He was initially assigned to work as a yard orderly \u2014 an assignment that required him to pick up or sweep trash around the facility, occasionally mow and trim grass, and sweep sidewalks. Dr. Vendel, the Clinical Director at FCI-Estill, oversaw the treatment of Webb\u2019s medical problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Webb contends that, less than a week after his arrival at FCI-Estill, he began requesting follow-up medical care and treatment for his hernia problem, including the provision of a new abdominal binder (or hernia belt) to control it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The details of Webb\u2019s medical condition, as documented in the FCI-Estill records, are summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">\u2022 On July 21, 2004, Webb was placed on convalescent status for one week.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">\u2022 On July 30, 2004, a consulting general surgeon recommended \u201claparoscopic ventral hernia [surgery].\u201d J.A. 356. According to notations in Webb\u2019s medical file dated August 2, 2004, Webb was advised that he \u201cneeds surgery of ventral hernia,\u201d and apparently requested \u201cconvalescence until surgery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43. Webb was placed on idle status for two weeks between August 20 and September 3, 2004.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">\u2022 On September 7, 2004, Webb was reassigned to work as a unit orderly, wiping down walls and handrails, with two restrictions: \u201cno lifting over 10 lbs\u201d and \u201cno prolonged standing.\u201d J.A. 165.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-15\">\u2022 At least twice in September 2004, Webb complained of extreme abdominal pain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-16\">\u2022 On September 24, 2004, Dr. Vendel noted that Webb demanded hernia surgery; that he had refused surgery in January 2004; that his hernia condition was reducible; that he had a hernia belt; and that \u201c[o]ur consultant [in July 2004] recommended hernia repair but did not indicate that it was medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>cally necessary.\u201d J.A. 330.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Vendel sought a second surgical consultation \u201cabout timing the hernia repair and probability of recurrence.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u2022 On September 29, 2004, Webb was examined by another consulting surgeon, who observed a \u201cnew bulge on [Webb\u2019s] abdomen,\u201d that was \u201cnot painful\u201d but had increased in size over the prior two years. J.A. 357. The surgeon recommended \u201ca laparoscopic repair\u201d of the hernia, with \u201cat least 3 to 4 days in the hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u2022 On October 1, 2004, Dr. Vendel examined Webb again, noting complaints of constipation and abdominal pain, but concluding that he \u201cappeared not [to be] in acute distress.\u201d J.A. 331.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u2022 On October 4, 2004, Dr. Vendel recorded a treatment plan in Webb\u2019s file: \u201cI have discussed this case [with] the g[eneral] surgeon. We agreed that the surgery is not urgent, [and] can be done electively within a time frame of 6 [months].\u201d J.A. 332.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u2022 On October 13, 2004, Webb requested a new abdominal binder \u201cto replace the extremely worn abdominal binder, to-which [sic] I am currently forced to wear daily.\u201d J.A. 64. Webb complained that his old binder was \u201cthe only thing slowing the enlargement of this hernia,\u201d and that \u201cthe hernia is currently causing me serious pain and discomfort, due to the worn and old [b]inder I am currently forced to wear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In responding, Dr. Vendel did not mention Webb\u2019s request for an abdominal binder, but confirmed, \u201c[y]ou are going to be scheduled for surgery, electively.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u2022 On December 21, 2004, the medical staff examining Webb on a flu-related visit noted that his hernia was reducible, and that he did not complain of any pain. J.A. 336.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">\u2022 On March 8, 2005, Dr. Vendel noted that Webb\u2019s \u201creducible\u201d hernia was causing \u201cmild pain,\u201d and prescribed pain medication. J.A. 340-41.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u2022 On April 28, 2005, Webb\u2019s medical restrictions of \u201clight duty\u201d and \u201cno prolonged standing\u201d were renewed due to his hernia condition. J.A. 342.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">\u2022 On May 25, 2005, Webb filed an informal prison complaint, asserting hernia enlargement and requesting to be relieved from his work assignment until elective hernia surgery was performed. J.A. 91. Webb\u2019s request was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">\u2022 On June 21, 2005, Webb filed another informal complaint, requesting that he be provided with hernia surgery \u201cwith imminence.\u201d J.A. 90.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">\u2022 On June 23, 2005, Webb filed yet another informal complaint, asserting that his work assignment aggravated his abdominal condition, and requesting \u201cconvalescent [i]dle [s]tatus.\u201d J.A. 218.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-16\">\u2022 On August 3, 2005, Dr. Vendel reexamined Webb. Although Webb complained of extreme pain, Dr. Vendel observed no objective signs of such pain \u2014 \u201cno tachycardia, no sweating, no facial expression other than being angry\u201d \u2014 and rated Webb\u2019s pain level at 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>on a scale of 0 to 10. J.A. 345. Dr. Vendel noted that the size of Webb\u2019s hernia was \u201cunchanged,\u201d and that the bulge was \u201ceasily reduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He acknowledged that Webb \u201cmay need a new hernia belt,\u201d and referred him to an orthopedic surgeon for a second opinion. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">\u2022 Prison records dated August 10, 2005, reflect that \u201cone hernia belt [was] provided\u201d to Webb. J.A. 583.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u2022 On August 24, 2005, Dr. Vendel examined Webb again, noting mild pain and no change in the size of his reducible hernia. Concerning treatment, Dr. Vendel wrote that Webb \u201cmay have [an] abdominal hernia belt.\u201d J.A. 349.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u2022 In his January 10, 2006 affidavit, Dr. Vendel stated that Webb\u2019s hernia was \u201cstill reduceable [sic] and controlled with the use of a hernia belt.\u201d J.A. 316.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u2022 On February 9, 2006, Webb filed another informal prison complaint, alleging that he had requested an abdominal binder on arriving at FCI-Estill; that on August 10, 2005, he was issued a \u201cback-brace,\u201d not a hernia belt; and that the back brace \u201cdoesn\u2019t help at all.\u201d J.A. 584. Webb requested to be \u201cpromptly provided the abdominal binder as ordered by Dr. Vendel[] about July and/or August of 2005.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u2022 On March 2, 2006, FCI-Estill staff met with Webb and confirmed that \u201ca new binder was ordered to replace your old binder ... and upon receipt will be issued to you.\u201d J.A. 584.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">\u2022 In his affidavit of March 28, 2006, Webb stated that he \u201cwas never provided with a hernia belt.\u201d J.A. 398.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">\u2022 On March 30, 2006, Dr. Vendel examined Webb again. On April 27, 2006, he noted in Webb\u2019s medical records that Webb\u2019s hernia was a \u201c5 x 4 cm bulge, minimally symptomatic,\u201d and that \u201csurgery can be done as I approved it beforef,] electively.\u201d J.A. 586. That same day, Dr. Vendel recommended that the proposed elective surgery be scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">\u2022 In his affidavit of May 8, 2006, Dr. Vendel stated that Webb was issued a hernia belt on August 10, 2005, and that \u201con March 2, 2006, a new hernia belt was ordered and Mr. Webb was instructed that once it arrived it would be issued to him.\u201d J.A. 578. Vendel noted that he had requested Webb\u2019s hernia surgery be scheduled, \u201calthough this surgery is an elective procedure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">Addressing the hernia claim allegations in the Report, the magistrate judge concluded that Webb had presented no evidence suggesting that surgery was medically required (rather than properly deemed elective), or that surgery had been unduly delayed. <em>See </em>Report 18-20. The magistrate judge further determined that Webb\u2019s assertion \u201cthat he was <em>never provided </em>with a hernia belt is ... contradicted by the medical records,\u201d and that, \u201ceven assuming there was a delay in [Webb\u2019s] receipt of a hernia belt, ... the medical evidence before the Court shows that [Webb\u2019s] hernia remains reducible, with no evidence having been presented that [Webb] has suffered any injury as a result of the delay in receiving a hernia belt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The Order adopted this aspect of the Report without specific comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment. <em>See Wolfe v. Weisner, </em>488 F.3d 234, 238 (4th Cir. =2007). In so doing, we apply the same standard as the district court: whether \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>terrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In conducting such a review, we are mindful that a mere \u201cscintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). However, in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact is in dispute, \u201cthe evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On appeal, Webb challenges the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment to the Defendants on his Eighth Amendment claim with respect to his hernia problems \u2014 asserting that his medical care was so deficient as to constitute deliberate indifference to his objectively serious medical needs. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VIII; <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). As a general proposition, a medical need may be deemed objectively serious if it is \u201cone that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Ramos v. Lamm, </em>639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir.1980); <em>see also Loe v. Armistead, </em>582 F.2d 1291, 1292-93, 1295-96 (4th Cir.1978). In order to act with deliberate indifference, a public official must have been personally aware of facts indicating a substantial risk of serious harm, and the official must have actually recognized the existence of such a risk. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 838, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\u201c[A]n official\u2019s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not ... cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.\u201d); <em>see also Miltier v. Beorn, </em>896 F.2d 848, 851 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">In this situation, it is undisputed that Webb suffers from a ventral hernia and that, in the proper circumstances, such a condition might be recognized as serious. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Doughty, </em>433 F.3d 1001, 1014 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that hernia can be objectively serious medical problem); <em>Jones v. Johnson, </em>781 F.2d 769, 771-72 (9th Cir.1986) (same). In the context of his constitutional claim, Webb contends that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs in three respects: (1) in prescribing hernia surgery on an elective basis only; (2) in unduly delaying such surgery; and, (3) in failing to provide him with the hernia belt that he needed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We review in turn these aspects of Webb\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Webb first maintains, in pursuing his Eighth Amendment claim, that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his need for surgery by prescribing such surgery for him on an elective basis only. Although the consequences of failing to prescribe an essential surgical procedure can be serious, any medical malpractice committed with respect thereto, or malpractice committed by mischaracterizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>an emergency surgical procedure as an elective one, will not contravene the Eighth Amendment. Put simply, negligent medical diagnoses or treatment, without more, do not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See Sosebee v. Murphy, </em>797 F.2d 179, 181 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">And, in this case, Webb has failed to show any deliberate indifference on the part of Dr. Vendel with respect to the \u201celective surgery\u201d classification of Webb\u2019s hernia problem. The record reflects that, shortly after Webb\u2019s transfer to FCI-Es-till, Dr. Vendel sought and obtained supporting medical opinions classifying Webb\u2019s surgery as elective. Based on those consultations, Dr. Vendel himself concluded, in October 2004, that Webb\u2019s need for hernia surgery was \u201cnot urgent, [and] can be done electively within a time frame of 6 [months].\u201d JA. 339. After Webb filed informal prison complaints in May and June 2005, requesting hernia surgery \u201cwith imminence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 90, Dr. Vendel examined Webb twice in August 2005, but found no objective signs of pain and no change in the size of his hernia. In March 2006, after examining Webb\u2019s hernia and finding it unchanged, Dr. Vendel renewed his assessment that the \u201csurgery can be done as I approved it before, electively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In summary, even if Dr. Vendel somehow misdiagnosed Webb\u2019s need for surgery, Dr. Vendel made extensive efforts to diagnose, monitor, and control Webb\u2019s hernia symptoms, and that he did not disregard any \u201crisk of harm of which he was aware.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Quinones, </em>145 F.3d 164, 168 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that doctors are only deliberately indifferent if they \u201csubjectively \u2018know[] of the serious medical condition itself\u2019 and consciously disregard a substantial risk of serious harm implied by that condition). The fact that Dr. Vendel consulted other physicians further undermines any contention that his diagnosis, even if incorrect, was somehow deliberate or indifferent. <em>See id. </em>at 169 (concluding prison physician\u2019s consultation with outside experts supported inference that misdiagnosis was not deliberate indifference). Thus, the court properly concluded in its Order that Dr. Vendel\u2019s classification of Webb\u2019s potential surgery as elective \u2014 rather than as an emergency\u2014 does not implicate Webb\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Turning next to the delay aspect of Webb\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, he argues that the fact that he was never scheduled for elective hernia surgery while at FCI-Estill \u2014 despite Dr. Vendel\u2019s statement, in October 2004, that \u201csurgery is not urgent, [and] can be done electively within a time frame of 6 [months],\u201d J.A. 332\u2014 supports an inference of deliberate indifference on the part of Dr. Vendel. Under the applicable legal principles, a significant delay in the treatment of a serious medical condition may, in the proper circumstances, indicate an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285 (holding that deliberate indifference may be demonstrated by \u201cintentionally denying or delaying access to medical care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">An Eighth Amendment violation only occurs, however, if the delay results in some substantial harm to the patient.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Thus, in order to defeat summary judgment on the delay issue, Webb was obligated to establish that the delay in his surgery caused him substantial harm \u2014 evidenced by, for example, a marked increase in his hernia\u2019s size, frequent complaints of severe pain, or signs that his hernia was becoming non-reducible or incarcerated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Miltier v. Beorn, </em>896 F.2d 848, 852-58 (4th Cir.1990) (concluding, where inmate suffered heart attack and died, that jury could find physicians were deliberately indifferent by failing to follow up on recommendations for inmate\u2019s cardiac care).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Our unpublished decisions recognize that a delay with respect to hernia surgery does not necessarily constitute deliberate indifference, absent some resultant harm or a worsened condition. For example, in <em>Price v. Carey, </em>we deemed an eight-month delay in providing elective hernia surgery as insufficient to constitute an Eighth Amendment violation, because the prisoner \u201cdid not present any information\u201d to his physician during the intervening period \u201cto indicate that his situation was an emergency mandating immediate treatment.\u201d No. 91-6643, 1992 WL 34208, at *4 (4th Cir. Feb. 26, 1992). On the other hand, in <em>Gatrett v. Elko, </em>we recognized an Eighth Amendment claim where the prisoner\u2019s hernia surgery was delayed for four years, in the face of continual \u201ccomplaints of intense pain, anxiety, and limited mobility.\u201d No. 95-7939, 1997 WL 457667, at *1 (4th Cir. Aug. 12, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">After October 2004, Webb was prescribed pain medication, and although he frequently complained about hernia-related discomfort, his complaints focused largely on work assignments. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 91 (complaining of hernia enlargement on May 25, 2005, but requesting reprieve from work assignment until elective surgery is performed); <em>id. </em>at 90 (requesting, on June 21, 2005, being provided hernia surgery \u201cwith imminence,\u201d but failing to assert pain or change in hernia\u2019s size as basis therefor); <em>id. </em>at 218 (complaining of increasing pain on June 23, 2005, making work impossible). Moreover, when Webb informed the prison medical personnel that he was in pain, they did not ignore his complaints. Rather, they monitored his condition, observed no objective signs of pain or change in the size of his hernia, provided pain medications, and concluded that the hernia was yet reducible. <em>See </em>J.A. 331 (examining Webb on October 1, 2004, and noting that, despite his complaints of constipation and abdominal pain in September 2004, he \u201cappeared not [to be] in acute distress\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 341 (prescribing pain medication on March 8, 2005, for \u201cmild pain\u201d caused by Webb\u2019s hernia); <em>id. </em>at 345 (examining Webb on August 3, 2005, and observing no objective signs of pain or change in size of hernia); <em>id. </em>at 349 (examining Webb on August 24, 2005, and observing no change); <em>id. </em>at 586 (noting that, based on March 30, 2006, examination, Webb\u2019s hernia was \u201cminimally symptomatic\u201d). In such circumstances, Webb\u2019s allegation of improper delay fails to support the proposition that summary judgment was improperly awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Finally, Webb focuses on the assertion that he was never provided with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>hernia belt at FCI-Estill. In addressing this issue, Webb maintains that the magistrate judge and the district court failed to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to him. In the Report (adopted by the Order), the magistrate judge concluded that Webb\u2019s assertion that he was never provided with a replacement hernia belt was \u201ccontradicted by the medical records.\u201d Report 20. On this point, the issue is simply whether Webb has shown that Dr. Vendel acted with deliberate indifference concerning the hernia belt. In his affidavit of May 8, 2006, Dr. Vendel states that \u201con August 10, 2005, [Webb] was issued a hernia belt by the Health Services Administrator.\u201d J.A. 578. By contrast, in an informal prison complaint of February 9, 2006, Webb alleged that, although he had requested a new belt when he first arrived at FCI-Estill in July 2004, he had been given a back brace only (on August 10, 2005).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And, in his affidavit of March 28, 2006, Webb asserted that he \u201cwas never provided with a hernia belt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">This apparent dispute of fact on whether Webb received a back brace or a hernia belt on August 10, 2005, fads to establish an Eighth Amendment claim. Put succinctly, Webb failed to complain about the inadequacy of the back brace until February 2006, six months after it was issued to him (on August 10, 2005). In the interim, Dr. Vendel believed that Webb was provided with a hernia belt on August 10, 2005. <em>See </em>J.A. 578 (\u201c[0]n August 10, 2005, [Webb] was issued a hernia belt by the Health Services Administration.\u201d). Whether Dr. Vendel was incorrect in this perception could be relevant in a malpractice claim, but it is not material to Webb\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. As a matter of law, Dr. Vendel cannot have consciously disregarded a substantial risk of serious harm to Webb if he did not know that Webb had been provided an ineffectual back brace. <em>See Johnson v. Quinones, </em>145 F.3d 164, 168 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that, for purposes of establishing deliberate indifference, \u201c[t]he correct question is whether the doctor subjectively \u2018knows of the serious medical condition itself\u2019). On this evidence, Dr. Vendel has not been shown to subjectively know that Webb did not have a hernia belt, and thus could not be deliberately indifferent to any of Webb\u2019s hernia-related medical needs. As a result, Dr. Vendel cannot be liable on the Eighth Amendment claim. In such circumstances, summary judgment was appropriate, and the Order of the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment on Webb\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims, and also its dismissal without prejudice of his FTCA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-11\">.

It is undisputed that the surgery is necessary, and the only accepted medical procedure for remedying Webb\u2019s serious condition. However, as Webb lingers, the majority, without pause or hesitation, holds that, as a matter of law, the prison medical staff has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to his serious medical need to have surgery \u201cabsent some resultant harm or a worsened condition.\u201d (Maj. Op. at 167.) The Eighth Amendment does not require a prisoner to be on the precipice of death to receive the necessary treatments that the prison medical staff itself prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Eighth Amendment expressly prohibits the infliction of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VIII. In <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), the Supreme Court established the standard for Eighth Amendment cases involving prisoner medical needs. In order to prove an Eighth Amendment violation, the prisoner must show that the defendant acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, which requires proof of two elements: (1) that the deprivation of medical care was sufficiently serious (objective component); and (2) that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs (subjective component). <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence,\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), but indifference can be manifested by prison doctors intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It is undisputed that Webb\u2019s hernia condition is a serious medical need. <em>See Martin v. Bowman, </em>48 F.3d 1216 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cA medical need is serious if it is diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d) The majority\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d analysis of Webb\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim is simple: rather than arguing that he received no medical treatment, Webb only alleges that Defendants conservative course of treatment violates his Eighth Amendment rights and since he was seen numerous times by prison medical staff and outside medical specialists, defendants were not deliberately indifferent. Simplicity notwithstanding, the majority errs.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In September, 2003, a consulting general surgeon recommended that Webb receive \u201claparoscopic ventral hernia surgery.\u201d (J.A. 356.) Based on the alleged reducible nature of the hernia, Dr. Vendel deemed Webb\u2019s surgery \u201celective;\u201d that is, \u201cnot urgent\u201d and he posited that surgery could be performed within six months of September 24, 2004. However, only five days after Dr. Vendel\u2019s determination that the surgery was \u201celective,\u201d Webb was examined by a consulting physician, who observed \u201ca new bulge on [Webb\u2019s] abdomen,\u201d that had increased in size, and recommended laparascopic repair. (J.A. 358.) As the majority correctly notes, Webb complained thirteen times of chronic abdominal pain, and two different specialists recommended surgery during the course of two years after the initial recommendation. Yet, surgery was still delayed and another six months passed without any discussion of scheduling Webb for surgery. While the majority makes much of Webb receiving treatment throughout this time and Dr. Vendel determining that the surgery was \u201celective,\u201d it is clear that Webb did not receive the treatment that was prescribed year after year by several surgeons despite his chronic pain and medical infirmities.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">For instance, there is no evidence that Dr. Vendel, after the first six-months passed, determined that Webb could wait another six-months for surgery. In fact, the record suggests otherwise. On August 3, 2005, Dr. Vendel referred Webb, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>complaints of extreme pain, to an orthopedic surgeon for a second opinion. It was not until April 27, 2006, nearly three years after surgery was first recommended and five months after Webb filed suit, that Dr. Vendel recommended surgery be scheduled. On March 10, 2006, another orthopedic surgeon confirmed that Webb\u2019s hernia had increased and surgery was needed. (J.A. 585.) To be sure, even if a procedure is \u201celective\u201d \u2014 the term certainly should not mean that Webb must wait almost four years for a surgery that Dr. Vendel stated could be scheduled at the very least within six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">We have held, albeit in an unpublished opinion, that where prison officials are aware of a serious medical need and delay treatment, the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient enough to satisfy the objective component of a deliberate indifference suit. <em>See Clinkscales v. Pamlico Corr. Facility, </em>238 F.3d 411 (4th Cir.2000) (inmate sufficiently alleged deliberate indifference as a result of defendant\u2019s nine-month delay in providing a necessary surgery) (citing <em>Monmouth County Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, </em>834 F.2d 326, 346-47 (3d Cir.1987) (prison officials may not interminably delay medical treatment or deny treatment based on arbitrary and burdensome procedures.)) Here, Webb presented evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to him \u2014 as we must, sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact as to whether the delay constitutes deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The majority\u2019s rationale to the contrary rings hollow in the face of the probability that further delay of Webb\u2019s hernia surgery could result in the worsening or strangulation of his hernia, bowel obstruction, or even Webb\u2019s death. (J.A. 311.) Deliberate indifference should not turn on whether Webb\u2019s condition worsened during the delay and nor should Dr. Vendel\u2019s decision to take an easier but less efficacious course negate deliberate indifference. It is the delay, itself, that is deliberately indifferent. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Estelle, </em>an unreasonable delay or withholding of treatment can constitute deliberate indifference and, therefore, offend the Eighth Amendment. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">It is uncontroverted that Webb suffers from a serious medical condition that requires surgery. Merely providing a prisoner with some treatment is not the Constitutional mandate of the Eighth Amendment. Rather, it is providing a prisoner with the care he or she needs. Prisoners are deprived of freedom and stripped of most rights but the Eighth Amendment guarantees that they not be treated less than human. So I ask, is it humane for a prisoner, who has suffered for four years with a serious medical condition, to be waiting for a surgery that everyone agrees is necessary? Based upon the majority\u2019s reasoning, it is uncertain how long Webb must wait for medical treatment before he can make out an Eighth Amendment claim that would at least survive summary judgment. Because surely his protection under the Eighth Amendment has not deteriorated to such an anemic state, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
