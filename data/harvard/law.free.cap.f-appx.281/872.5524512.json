Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). If the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test,\u201d and we must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of relief may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). \u201cTo conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Zapata argues that he established eligibility for withholding of removal based on uncontradicted, credible evidence that he had been the victim of past persecution. Specifically, he asserts that he was found credible and testified that the Matacabras, a group that targeted and attacked homosexuals and whose name roughly translated to \u201ckilling gay people,\u201d threatened his life on two occasions. On the second occasion, a group of knife-wielding Matacabras threatened to kill him and a co-worker, chased them, and stopped only after a stranger fired a gun in the air to scare the Matacabras away.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The alien can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>meet his burden by showing either: (1) \u201cpast persecution in his country based on a protected ground,\u201d in which case a rebut-table presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned to his country; or (2) \u201ca future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Although the regulations do not expressly define \u201cpersecution,\u201d this court has observed that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). This court, however, has rejected a rigid requirement of physical injury, making clear that \u201cattempted murder is persecution,\u201d regardless of whether the petitioner was injured and even if the attack is unsuccessful. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231-33 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58, 1257 n. 7 (11th Cir.2007) (extending the rule in <em>Sanchez Jimenez </em>to other projectiles such as rocks).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Here, even assuming, as we must, that Zapata\u2019s testimony was credible, we are not <em>compelled </em>to conclude that he suffered past persecution. Zapata identifies two incidents of harassment and intimidation, but these events do not rise to the level of past persecution under our precedent. Being chased by men carrying knives and shouting epithets does not equate with attempted murder. Moreover, mere discrimination against homosexuals does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Moreover, Zapata has not shown \u201ca future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d We note that Zapata worked for a government agency providing information and education to the gay community. And Zapata admitted during the removal hearing that, since his departure from Peru, the country conditions have improved. Thus, Zapata has not shown a future threat on account of his status as a homosexual.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Accordingly, because the record does not <em>compel </em>us to conclude that Zapata was entitled to withholding of removal, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-6\">. Zapata has not raised any challenge to the denial of asylum and, therefore, he has waived the issue. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir.2005). Additionally, Zapata failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the denial of CAT relief, thus we lack jurisdiction to hear that issue. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part on these grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">. We note that the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility finding, as required under <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Because the IJ did not make a specific finding as to credibility, we presume Zapata\u2019s testimony to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\"><em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
