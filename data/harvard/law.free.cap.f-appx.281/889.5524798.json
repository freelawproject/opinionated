His brief presents one issue: whether his sentences were procedurally or substantively unreasonable in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Gonzalez argues that, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances,\u201d the sentences the district court imposed were unreasonable. He contends that the court was confused regarding the guideline sentence ranges and statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums relating to powder versus crack cocaine. Finally, he contends that the court used the incorrect legal standard in imposing the sentences by requiring him to provide \u201cextraordinary proof,\u201d rather than \u201creasonable proof,\u201d to justify sentences outside of the guidelines range. Prison terms of 120 months would reflect the seriousness of the offense, afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and provide protection to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain its reasoning. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard, which involves inquiring whether the statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court is required to consider the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a): (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)). The district court need not discuss or state that it explicitly has considered each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Instead, an explicit acknowledgment that the court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number><em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">In this case, the sentences were not procedurally unreasonable because the district court applied the correct legal analysis, entertained the parties\u2019 presentations, and considered Gonzalez\u2019s personal history and the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). Gonzalez\u2019s sentences also were not substantively unreasonable because the court imposed below-guidelines sentences, which were consistent with Gonzalez\u2019s personal history of cocaine addiction, criminal history, and current offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
