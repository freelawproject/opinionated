The district court then sentenced Robinson to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment. Robinson appealed, contending that the district court\u2019s findings that at least fifteen but not more that fifty kilograms of cocaine was reasonably foreseeable to him, and that he was a leader in the conspiracy, were clearly erroneous. Robinson also asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">We review the district court\u2019s calculation of the quantity of drugs attributable to Robinson for sentencing purposes for clear error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Tucker, </em>473 F.3d 556, 560 (4th Cir.2007) (stating standard of review); <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). In calculating drug amounts, the court may consider any relevant information, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its accuracy. <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1021 (4th Cir.1992). Because Robinson admitted to the drug quantities attributed to him under oath, we conclude that the district court properly adopted the probation officer\u2019s recommended calculation of drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">Next, the district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is also reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002). A four-level adjustment for role in the offense is appropriate when \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Robinson admitted under oath that he was an organizer and leader in this criminal activity that involved more than five participants. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the enhancement based on Robinson\u2019s leadership role was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Finally, Robinson argues that counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the amount and kind of narcotics used to calculate his advisory guideline range. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring his claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>See id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. Our review of the record does not conclusively show that counsel was ineffective. We therefore decline to consider Robinson\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, as he may raise them in a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\"> Robinson also challenges whether the district court erred in failing to differentiate between cocaine and crack in determining the base offense level. However, there is no merit to this argument as the district court did not calculate Robinson\u2019s advisory guideline range based on crack.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
