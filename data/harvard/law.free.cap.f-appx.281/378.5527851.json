He argues that the district court plainly erred by determining that his prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). We disagree. A comparison of the statute and Guideline at issue shows that a conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1) qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)). Robles-Robles\u2019s argument to the contrary is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-20\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Robles-Robles challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. His argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
