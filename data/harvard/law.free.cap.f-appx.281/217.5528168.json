Police detained and ultimately arrested Clifton after hearing gunshots coming from the front of a residence located in a high-crime neighborhood and from which Clifton later emerged. Clifton\u2019s guilty plea was conditioned on his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his statement admitting to police that he fired one of the weapons heard by police, as well as the guns recovered by police after receiving his cousin\u2019s consent to search the residence. On appeal, Clifton challenges only the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-25\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>491 F.3d 138, 143-44 (4th Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1226, 170 L.Ed.2d 77 (2008). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d 690, 704 (4th Cir.2006). With these standards in mind, and having reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Clifton\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
