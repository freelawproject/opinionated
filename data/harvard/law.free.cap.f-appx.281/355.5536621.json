She now appeals her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain the duty to properly calculate and consider the applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), when fashioning a sentence. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). When reviewing a sentence, we typically consider whether the district court committed procedural error at sentencing and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Further, the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is ultimately reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.-, see also United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563-64 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Chavero argues that the district court erred at sentencing by presuming that the recommended guidelines range was reasonable. She further contends that this error is not harmless, and she requests resentencing. Our examination of the record controverts Chavero\u2019s assertions and does not support her conclusion that the district court applied a presumption of reasonableness to the applicable guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">Chavero has shown no error in connection with her conviction or sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
