We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Adams v. Jones, </em>No. 2:05-cv-00434-RBS (E.D.Va. Oct. 25, 2007; Nov. 14, 2007; Jan. 2, 2008; Jan. 22, 2008). We also grant Adams\u2019 unopposed motion to dismiss C. Phillips Ferguson as a party, and we deny Adams\u2019 motion for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">Turning to Appellee Ferguson\u2019s motion for damages and costs under Fed. R.App. P. 38, we deny the motion in light of the sanctions imposed by the district court and the fact that Adams has not filed numerous frivolous appeals in the past. <em>Cf. Foley v. Fix, </em>106 F.3d 556, 558 (4th Cir.1997) (imposing $500 in damages and costs where appellant filed twenty-three appeals in one year); <em>Vestal v. Clinton, </em>106 F.3d 553, 555 (4th Cir.1997) (finding sanctions warranted for seven frivolous appeals in one year). We warn Adams, however, that his continued pursuit of frivolous claims in this court may result in the award of damages or costs or other sanctions under Rule 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
