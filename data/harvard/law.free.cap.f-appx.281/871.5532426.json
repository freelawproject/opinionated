Quinn appeals his 210-month sentence for receiving and distributing child pornography materials, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), (b)(1). On appeal, Quinn argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Quinn contends that the court focused primarily on one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the nature and circumstances of his offense, without also consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ering that he had not committed any crimes in the year prior to his self-surrender, that the doctor who examined him opined that he was not a pedophile, and that he had a history of depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">After careful review, we find that Quinn\u2019s sentence was both proeedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007). The court correctly calculated the Guidelines\u2019 range and expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, in imposing the 120-month sentence\u2014at the low end of the Guidelines\u2019 range\u2014the court provided a reasoned basis for imposing Quinn\u2019s sentence. Thus, we affirm Quinn\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
