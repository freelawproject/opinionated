The district court dismissed his suit as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Amir-Sharif now moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Amir-Sharif will not receive such authorization unless he shows that he is impecunious and will raise a nonfrivolous appellate claim. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">A review of Amir-Sharifs filings with this court show that he has not made this showing. Amir-Sharif raises several arguments concerning the defendants\u2019 purported violations of Texas law. To raise a viable \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must show that a state actor infringed his rights under \u201cthe Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Resident Council v. United States Dep\u2019t of Hous. and Urban Dev., </em>980 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, to the extent that Amir-Sharif contends that the defendants violated his rights under Texas law, these contentions do not suffice to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous \u00a7 1983 claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Amir-Sharifs contention that his rights were violated because the defendants declined to bring criminal charges against the guard who purportedly assaulted him is likewise unavailing. Decisions whether to prosecute or file criminal charges against an individual lie within the prosecutor\u2019s discretion, and private citizens do not have a constitutional right to have an individual criminally prosecuted. <em>See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973); <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 124, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979); <em>see also Oliver v. Collins, </em>914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir.1990). Consequently, Amir-Sharifs arguments concerning the decision not to prosecute the guard do not suffice to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous appellate claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-18\">Finally, Amir-Sharifs arguments concerning a conspiracy, equal protection, due process, cruel and unusual punishment, and retaliation do not suffice to raise a nonfrivolous appellate claim because they are grounded in his own conclusional allegations. <em>See Mowbray v. Cameron County, Tex., </em>274 F.3d 269, 278 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-19\">Amir-Sharif has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous claim in this appeal. Consequently, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
