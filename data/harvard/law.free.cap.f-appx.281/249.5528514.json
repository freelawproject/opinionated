Black-man contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for his role in the bank robbery under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.1(c) (2006), and in enhancing his carjacking sentence for an abduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 (b)(4). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">We review Blackman\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe first step in this review requires us to \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... improperly calculating ... the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). In assessing whether the district court properly applied the Guidelines, \u201cwe review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cOn mixed questions of law and fact regarding the Sentencing Guidelines, we apply a due deference stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>dard in reviewing the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Blackman first contends he was only a participant in the bank robbery, and the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). However, there was evidence that Black-man and his co-defendant, Roman Jermaine Graham, had been planning the bank robbery for three years, whereas the other two participants in the robbery were merely \u201ctheir \u2018jackasses.\u2019 \u201d We conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding Blackman acted as \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Next, Blackman contends that the district court erred in applying an abduction enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 (b)(4)(A), along with the carjacking enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 (b)(5), because \u201cany carjacking necessarily includes an abduction.\u201d We disagree. The carjacking enhancement applies when a defendant takes \u201ca motor vehicle from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 comment, (n.l). Blackman conceded this enhancement applied, because he pled guilty to carjacking. The abduction enhancement applies when any person was abducted, i.e., \u201cforced to accompany an offender to a different location,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 comment, (n.l), to facilitate commission of the offense or escape. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A). The district court properly applied both enhancements because Blackman forced his carjacking victim to accompany him to a different location before he returned to the vehicle alone, which facilitated his commission of the carjacking and/or his escape. <em>See Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377; <em>Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000; <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>198 F.3d 467 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
