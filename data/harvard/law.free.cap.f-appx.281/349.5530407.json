This court has jurisdiction to review Lou\u2019s petition as it seeks relief based on allegedly changed circumstances in Lou\u2019s home country of China. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 600 (5th Cir.1993). That discretion will not be disturbed unless it is arbitrary, capricious, racially invidious, or utterly without evidentiary foundation. <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Approximately seven years after he was ordered excluded, and over five years after abandoning his first motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, Lou filed a second motion seeking to reopen his deportation proceedings on the basis that he is likely to be forcibly sterilized if he is removed to China because he has married and, in violation of China\u2019s family planning laws, has fathered four children during the pendency of his exclusion proceedings. He argued that these circumstances constitute a material change in circumstances warranting the reopening of his deportation proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">The BIA held that the motion to reopen was both numerically barred and untimely and that Lou did not qualify for an exception to the numerical and time restrictions for filing motions to reopen. The BIA held that the birth of Lou\u2019s children overseas did not entitle Lou to relief because it was a change in his personal circumstances rather than a change of conditions in China. The BIA further found that Lou had offered no persuasive evidence that forcible sterilizations have occurred in his home province of Guangdong. The BIA rejected Lou\u2019s argument that a successive asylum application is not subject to the timeliness and numerical limitations that govern motions to reopen and it found that Lou had not demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of its discretionary authority to reopen the proceedings. Lou filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Lou has not shown that the BIA\u2019s determination that his claim was based on a change in his personal circumstances rather than changed circumstances in China lacks an evidentiary foundation. <em>Pritchett, </em>993 F.2d at 83. The BIA\u2019s determination that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) does not authorize Lou to file a successive asylum application based on changes in his personal circumstances is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the applicable statutes. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). As Lou has not attempted to controvert the BIA\u2019s determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>nation that there is no persuasive evidence that forced sterilizations have occurred in Lou\u2019s home province of Guangdong, he has not established that he is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set Forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
