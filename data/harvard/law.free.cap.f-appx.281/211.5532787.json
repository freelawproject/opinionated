His at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>torney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for review but suggesting that the court may have abused its discretion in revoking release and imposing the sentence. Monahan was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">A decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Here, Monahan admitted to violating release conditions as charged. Given the nature of the violations, the district court was statutorily obligated to revoke release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(g)(1), (g)(4) (2000). We conclude that the decision to revoke Monahan\u2019s supervision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We will affirm a sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory limits and not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). Monahan\u2019s sentence is below the statutorily authorized maximum of two years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000), and falls within the advisory guideline range of 21-24 months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (p.s.), 7B1.4(b)(3)(A) (2005). Finally, the district court adequately considered the applicable 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2008) factors when imposing sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). We conclude that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the revocation of Monahan\u2019s supervised release and his sentence of twenty-one months. This court requires counsel to inform his client in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
