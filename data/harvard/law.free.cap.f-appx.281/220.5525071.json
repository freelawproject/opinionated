Outlaw seeks further reduction of his sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The relief Outlaw seeks is unavailable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469, 473 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a \u201cdistrict court to reduce the sentence imposed on a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
