He argues that he was subjected to an illegal traffic stop because his conduct did not violate a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>statute and that his stop was not supported by an informant\u2019s tip because no new indicia of probable cause was discovered after a fruitless search at the border checkpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The government failed to address the validity of the traffic stop, relying instead on the reasonable suspicion arising from the informant\u2019s tip. Rubalcaba-Ramirez contends the government has waived and effectively conceded the issue. This court, however, is not bound by the government\u2019s concession of error. <em>See United States v. Claiborne, </em>132 F.3d 253, 254-55 (5th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We examine the legality of police investigatory stops based on (1) whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception and (2) whether the officer\u2019s subsequent actions were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop. <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). A decision to stop a vehicle is reasonable where the officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Rubalcaba-Ramirez was stopped for driving on an improved shoulder. He contends that his conduct was not a traffic violation under state law and cites several state court decisions. Those decisions are distinguishable in that they involve traffic stops for failing to drive in a single lane of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Rubalcaba-Ramirez was not stopped for that violation. Instead, he violated Tex Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 545.058, driving on an improved shoulder. Though there are exceptions to that prohibition, RubalcabaRamirez does not claim one. His conduct objectively justified the stop, and there was probable cause to stop him. <em>See Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769; <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Valdez, </em>178 F.3d 282, 288 (5th Cir.1999). Because the stop was justified, it is unnecessary to address his challenge to the stop based only on the informant\u2019s tip. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
