Ervin brought suit after the Housing Authority terminated her federal rental benefits, which she had been receiving pursuant to Section 8 of the National Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (\u201cHousing Act\u201d). Ei-vin sought declaratory and injunctive relief, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Housing Authority had violated her procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when it failed to comply with Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) regulations governing benefits termination procedures. On appeal, Ervin argues: (1) that the district court erred by entering summary judgment because she received insufficient notice of the termination of her benefits, and (2) that her hearing before the Housing Authority did not comply with the administrative regulations applicable to Section 8 proceedings. After careful review, we vacate and remand for the district court\u2019s further consideration, in light of our intervening decision in <em>Basco v. Machin, </em>514 F.3d 1177 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. See Madray v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2000). A motion for summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">The summary judgment record in this case is not voluminous. In support of its motion for summary judgment, the Housing Authority submitted, among other things, the affidavit of Defendant Carroll, who conducted the administrative hearing on Ervin\u2019s benefits. In her affidavit, Carroll described the testimony she considered prior to entering an order terminating Ervin\u2019s benefits. The Housing Authority also submitted Ervin\u2019s affidavit. In opposition to summary judgment, Ervin submitted her own deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">According to Carroll\u2019s affidavit, she conducted an informal administrative hearing on Ervin\u2019s rental benefits on November 30, 2005. Carroll described the evidence she considered at the hearing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-11\">\u2022 Ervin was a participant in the Housing Authority\u2019s Section 8 Rental Assistance Program (\u201cProgram\u201d), which receives federal housing subsidies from the HUD, pursuant to an \u201cannual contributing contract\u201d and the implementing regulations for Section 8 programs, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 982.1 <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-12\">\u2022 Helen Hyde, the Housing Authority\u2019s Assistant Manager of Leased and Section 8 Housing, testified at the administrative hearing about a letter, dated August 28, 2005, from Captain Mike Fisher of the Birmingham Police Department. Fisher sent the letter to Ervin\u2019s landlord, Levie Satisfield III, informing him that a search warrant had been served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>on his property on August 25, 2005, and that during the search, illegal narcotics were found on the property. Satisfield forwarded Captain Fisher\u2019s letter to the Housing Authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-4\">\u2022 On September 14, 2005, the Housing Authority sent Ervin a letter informing her that her Section 8 benefits would terminate on October 31, 2005, based on her failure to comply with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.558(a)(1), which provides for termination of housing assistance if the leased property is used for drug-related criminal activity. The letter was attached as an exhibit to Carroll\u2019s affidavit. In a section entitled \u201cFactual Basis for Determination,\u201d the letter stated \u201cuse of property for illegal drug sales and/or purchase.\u201d The letter also advised Ervin of her right to request an informal hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-5\">\u2022 Rachel King, a Recertification Specialist in the Section 8 Department of the Housing Authority, made the initial decision to terminate assistance to Ervin. On September 20, 2005, King received a written request from Ervin for a hearing on the termination decision. On November 30, 2005, an informal hearing took place before Carroll.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-6\">\u2022 Belinda Carwell, one of Ervin\u2019s neighbors, testified that on August 25, 2005, she saw police officers pick up \u201creefer\u201d in the front yard of Ervin\u2019s home and that \u201cthere was a girl there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-7\">\u2022 In addition to the foregoing testimony, the Housing Authority\u2019s lawyer reported to Carroll that she had spoken to the Birmingham Police Department and learned that two detectives had gone to Ervin\u2019s residence on August 25, 2005. The first detective went to the unit at approximately 9:00 A.M. and made a narcotics arrest of a female in possession of powder cocaine and marijuana. A second detective executed a search warrant later in the day and seized three marijuana plants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-10\">\u2022 Ervin testified that no police officers had entered her apartment when she was home, and that she had not seen a search warrant for the premises. In response to Carroll\u2019s questioning about the other girl (described by neighbor Carwell), Ervin said that \u201cSharon Rush\u201d had been arrested at her apartment. Notably, Ervin argued that Rush had come to a previously scheduled hearing, which had been cancelled, but could not attend the second hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Following the hearing, Defendant Carroll filed a written report upholding the termination of Ervin\u2019s housing benefits. She made the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-12\">The owner of the unit for which Ms. Ervin receives Section 8 rental assistance was notified in writing by the Birmingham Police Department that a search warrant was executed at the unit and \u201cillegal narcotics were found.\u201d The owner provided the Housing Authority of the Birmingham District Section 8 Office with a copy of the notice. The HABD attorney ... confirmed that a narcotic arrest was made at the unit on August 25, 2005 resulting in the seizure of marijuana plants with a street value of approximately $6,000.00. No evidence was presented at the time of the hearing to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">Carroll determined that a preponderance of the evidence established that Ervin had violated one of the requirements of her Section 8 rental assistance by allowing her unit to be used for drug-related criminal activity. On appeal, the district court affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>First, Ervin argues that she received insufficient notice for termination of her housing benefits. The applicable regulation provides that a termination notice must \u201c(1) Contain a brief statement of reasons for the decision [to terminate assistance]; (2) State that if the family does not agree with the decision, the family may request an informal hearing on the decision; and (3) State the deadline for the family to request an informal hearing.\u201d <em>See </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(c)(2). It is undisputed that the last two requirements were satisfied here. Ervin contends that the information contained in the notice was insufficient to constitute a \u201cbrief statement of reasons for the decision to terminate assistance,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 982.555(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">We have interpreted the \u201cstatement of reasons\u201d for the termination of Section 8 benefits as follows: \u201cSuch a statement must be sufficiently specific for it to enable an applicant to prepare rebuttal evidence to introduce at his hearing appearance.\u201d <em>Billington v. Underwood, </em>613 F.2d 91, 94 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, the Housing Authority\u2019s notice provided that Ervin\u2019s Section 8 rental assistance \u201cwill terminate ... due to failure to comply with Section 8 regulations.\u201d The notice then goes on to inform Ervin that the regulation violated was \u201cCrime by Family Members ... Drug-related activity\u201d and that the factual basis for the determination was \u201cuse of illegal drug sales and/or purchase.\u201d This language sufficiently stated the reasons for the termination of Ervin\u2019s benefits. As the district court observed, \u201c[t]hat the notice did not specify the individual alleged to commit the illegal activity, nor the exact time does not make it deficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Indeed, the district court found Ervin\u2019s lack-of-notice argument altogether disingenuous, given her own testimony at the hearing that Sharon Rush, the woman arrested at her apartment on August 25, 2005, had accompanied her to a previously scheduled hearing which had been can-celled, but was unable to attend the second hearing. From Ervin\u2019s testimony, the district court found that she was well aware of the incident providing the factual basis for the termination notice. Indeed, Ervin presented no evidence to the contrary. On this record, the notice was sufficiently specific to enable Ervin to prepare rebuttal evidence to introduce at the hearing and the district court did not err by rejecting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Turning to Ervin\u2019s second argument, she asserts that the Housing Authority violated the HUD regulations by failing to provide her with an adequate hearing. More specifically, she claims the hearing violated her due process rights because the hearing officer relied solely on hearsay without adequate indicia of reliability and improperly shifted the burden of proof to her, rather than the Housing Authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We recently held that at an informal administrative proceeding held under the HUD regulations to determine whether a participant\u2019s housing assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>should be terminated, a local housing authority \u201chas the burden of persuasion and must initially present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Basco, </em>514 F.3d at 1182. In <em>Basco, </em>we concluded that the local housing authority had not met its burden of persuasion by submitting two unauthenticated copies of two police reports, both of which consisted of hearsay. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlthough the rules of evidence are not strictly applied in administrative hearings, there are due process limits on the extent to which an adverse administrative determination may be based on hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also Williams v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>781 F.2d 1573, 1578 n. 7 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cHearsay is admissible in administrative healings and may constitute substantial evidence if found reliable and credible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Here, according to the summary judgment record, the Housing Authority\u2019s evidence at the administrative hearing consisted primarily of Helen Hyde\u2019s testimony, in which she described the contents of the letter from Captain Fisher stating that illegal narcotics had been found in Ervin\u2019s apartment on August 25, 2005. In her affidavit in support of summary judgment, Carroll says that she considered the letter itself at the hearing, but the letter was not part of the Housing Authority\u2019s summary judgment submission. Carroll also heard from Belinda Carwell, who testified about \u201ca girl\u201d and \u201creefer\u201d found in the front yard of Ervin\u2019s building. In addition to the foregoing testimony, Carroll heard from the Housing Authority\u2019s lawyer, who described her conversations with the Birmingham Police Department concerning an arrest and search at Ervin\u2019s residence on August 25, 2005. The record on appeal does not contain an administrative record, nor any other material relating to the informal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">In short, the evidence supporting the adverse administrative decision wholly consisted of hearsay. Although hearsay may constitute substantial evidence in administrative proceedings, on the present record, we cannot say that the \u201cfactors that assure the underlying reliability and probative value of the evidence\u201d necessarily are present. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, the only record evidence supporting the decision is Carroll\u2019s affidavit in support of summary judgment, in which she describes the hearing she conducted on Ervin\u2019s benefits. Put simply, the evidence capable of appellate review in the instant case has less reliability and probative value than the two unauthenticated police reports we considered in <em>Basco. </em>On this record, we must vacate and remand to the district court, for further consideration, in light of our decision in <em>Basco. </em>On remand, the district court should consider whether the \u201cfactors that assure the underlying reliability and probative value of the evidence\u201d necessarily are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. In her affidavit, Carroll described the contents of Fisher\u2019s letter, although the letter itself was not included in the Housing Authority\u2019s summary judgment materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted, as binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit, all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit announced prior to the close of business on October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. We are unpersuaded by Ervin\u2019s argument that Defendant Carroll was not an impartial decisionmaker. The pertinent regulation provides that the informal hearing \"may be conducted by a person or persons designated by the PHA, other than a person who made or approved the decision under review or a subordinate of this person.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555(e)(4)(i). It is undisputed that Carroll is a person designated by the Housing Authority to conduct such hearings, and that Rachel King, who made the decision under review at the hearing, is not a subordinate to Carroll, but instead reports to Helen Hyde.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b966-5\">. In the context of an administrative proceeding, we judge the reliability and probative force of hearsay evidence by considering the following factors: \" \u2018whether (1) the out-of-court declarant was not biased and had no interest in the result of the case; (2) the opposing party could have obtained the information contained in the hearsay before the hearing and could have subpoenaed the declarant; (3) the information was not inconsistent on its face; and (4) the information has been recognized by courts as inherently reliable.\u201d' <em>Basco, </em>514 F.3d at 1182 (quoting <em>J.A.M. Builders, Inc. v. Herman, </em>233 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
