The Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Pina on appeal previously moved for leave to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s motion was denied and the parties were ordered to brief the issues of whether this court could consider Pina\u2019s appeals despite his apparently untimely notices of appeal and whether this court should require withdrawing counsel to certify that the Government would assert the untimeliness of a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">We pretermit the issue of the timeliness of Pina\u2019s notices of appeal because there is no jurisdictional impediment to reaching the merits of the case and his appeal fails on the merits. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir.2007) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 728, 169 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007). In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Pina challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This issue is foreclosed. <em>United States v.
