Bishop\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was 57-71 months, and the district court sentenced her to 71 months of imprisonment. Bishop contends that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because of the \u201coverwhelming\u201d mitigating evidence in her case. She also argues that her sentence is unreasonable because the district court ordered it to run consecutively to any subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>quently imposed state sentences for other unadjudicated state charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Because Bishop did not object to the district court\u2019s sentence as unreasonable, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-93 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Bishop does not allege any procedural error by the district court during sentencing. She contends that her within-guidelines sentence of 71 months was substantively unreasonable in light of her below normal IQ, the coercion applied by her boyfriend, the physical and sexual abuse she suffered in the past, her drug use, and the overrepresentation of her criminal history score. However, once the district court decided to impose a sentence of imprisonment, the record reflects that it considered Bishop\u2019s needs for education, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment while incarcerated in determining the length of her sentence. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1096 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that legislative history indicates that a statutory prohibition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 against considering rehabilitative needs \u201crelates to the decision of <em>whether to impose </em>imprisonment, not to the <em>length of the term </em>of imprisonment\u201d). A district court is required to consider \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and the need for the sentence to provide the defendant with \u201cneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Bishop also argues that the imposition of a consecutive sentence was unreasonable. As Bishop did not object to the imposition of the consecutive sentence in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Quintana-Gomez, </em>521 F.3d 495, 496 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. A district court\u2019s authority to impose a consecutive sentence includes the authority to order that the sentence run consecutively to a not-yet-imposed state sentence. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). The consecutive nature of a sentence is reviewed for unreasonableness and a consecutive sentence imposed within the parameters of the Sentencing Guidelines is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Candia, </em>454 F.3d at 473. As discussed above, the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing suggest it chose a sentence, including the decision to make the sentence consecutive, to provide Bishop with the greatest opportunity for education, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment while she is incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Bishop has not overcome the presumption that her within-guidelines sentence was reasonable, <em>see Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554; <em>see also Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69, and she has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court constituted plain error. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
