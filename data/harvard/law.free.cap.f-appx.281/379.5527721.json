The district court imposed sentence after enhancing Lee\u2019s offense level based on a determination that she possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense, possession of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">The decision to reduce a sentence \u201cis left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997). This court reviews the decision on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion only for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">Lee bases her motion on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. She argues that, as a result of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court had the discretion to reduce her sentence, taking into account the disparity in the treatment of powder cocaine and crack cocaine under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">A district court is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b) to modify a previously imposed sentence in a limited number of circumstances. <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997). One such circumstance is provided by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which \u201cpermits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Boe, </em>117 F.3d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>As the district court correctly determined, Lee was convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) rather than of a crack cocaine offense. Her sentencing range was not \u201csubsequently ... lowered\u201d by Amendment 706, as required to permit her to obtain a modification of her sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Boe, </em>117 F.3d at 831; \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">To the extent that Lee contends that she is entitled to a modification pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough, </em>her argument is unavailing. Section 3582(c)(2) \u201conly applies to retroactive guideline amendments.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Lee has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Boe, </em>117 F.3d at 831. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
