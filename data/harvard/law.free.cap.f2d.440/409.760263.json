There is little substance to these contentions. Many of them have previously been essentially resolved adversely to the arguments contained in Curtin\u2019s brief. There was more than enough evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and if any technical error occurred in the District Court, we hold, on the record before us, that it was harmless beyond reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
