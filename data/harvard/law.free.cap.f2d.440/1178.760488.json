At the first meeting of creditors, Heyman was also appointed trustee, with authority again given to perform legal services for the estate. Heyman\u2019s final report applied for compensation for services as receiver, trustee and attorney for receiver and trustee. After due notice to creditors the referee allowed Heyman $1,000 and $2,750, as attorney for receiver and trustee, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The allowances required approval of the district court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which on review reduced the respective legal fees to $700 and $1,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-19\">The allowances were based upon the referee\u2019s findings of Heyman\u2019s diligence in recovery of funds and negotiations of sales which increased the value of the estate by $6,000; and of \u201calleged preferences\u201d which netted $7,500 for the estate. The referee concluded the allowances made were for services actually performed and were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-20\">The district court found that appointment of a person \u201cwearing four hats\u201d (receiver, trustee, receiver\u2019s attorney and trustee\u2019s attorney) to be \u201chighly objectionable\u201d since review was made \u201cvirtually impossible.\u201d The court noted that \u201cthe confusion of roles\u201d was improper because although Section 48 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 76, set a method of computing, and a limit upon, fees for receivers and trustees, no limitation is set upon exercise of a referee\u2019s allowance of legal fees. The court thought that \u201cwhen virtually all\u201d admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>istrative duties are transformed into \u201cexpensive legal duties,\u201d the \u201ceconomical spirit\u201d of the Act is ignored.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The court found the legal fees allowed averaged out at $37.50 per hour and that many functions attributed to those fees were for non-professional services. The court reduced the fees to an average of $25 per hour which the court thought was the amount justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Prior to 1938 a receiver or trustee was not permitted to receive \u201cany other or further compensation for his services\u201d than that expressly authorized by the Act. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. The 1938 amendment, however, changed the provision to permit receipt of compensation for services not required by the Act by adding the words \u201cas required by this Act\u201d to the quoted provision. See 4 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00a7 72.02 (14th ed.). In In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co., 361 F.2d 164 (2d Cir. 1966), the Second Circuit held that a court could authorize a trustee to appoint his own law firm as counsel in administering a bankrupt estate that was not substantial. The court reasoned that since rendition of legal services by a receiver or trustee is not required by the Act, Section 112 would seem to permit the officer to receive compensation for serving as his own lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">In <em>Haupt </em>the amount of compensation was not in question. But from the text of the <em>Haupt </em>opinion we see no room for doubt that that court would approve a reasonable fee for the receiver\u2019s or trustee\u2019s services as attorney. And we see no reason why, in the relatively small estate before us, receiver-trustee Hey-man should not be reasonably compensated for the legal services rendered, since he was authorized to perform these services. The SEC recommends the practice of appointing, and compensating, the same person as receiver and attorney, for economy reasons. <em>See Haupt, supra, </em>at 169. And the practice is encouraged by the Administrative Office of United States Courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, in so far as the district court\u2019s opinion may be read as finding Heyman\u2019s multiple service per se improper, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">The district court found indications in the record before it that \u201cmany functions attributed to legal services [by Heyman] required no expertise;\u201d and that \u201conly in rare instances * * * when there is present such a confusion of functions\u201d could a higher rate than $25 per hour be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">The district court opinion does not specify the \u201cmany functions\u201d which should not have been attributed to legal services. We have examined Schedules (F) and (G) which list the dates and legal services rendered to the receiver and trustee, respectively. We are unable to determine reliably what services listed as legal were not. We are satisfied with the referee\u2019s Memorandum Decision statement that in making the allowances he considered the results achieved \u201ctogether with his knowledge\u201d of the rendition of the legal services. We see no basis for a conclusion that the referee abused his discretion in allowing the fees. Sarver v. Sarver, No. 17083 (7th Cir. filed Feb. 17, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">It is true that the court could properly take into consideration the \u201ceconomical spirit\u201d of the Act as one factor. Jacobovitz v. Double Seven Corp., 378 F.2d 405, 408 (9th Cir. 1967). The \u201ceconomical spirit\u201d of the Act does not however require or justify reducing attorney fees where all other factors indicate the fees are reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">We conclude that the referee did not abuse his discretion and that the district court erred in reducing the fees. The district court judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to approve the referee\u2019s allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">. There is no question raised as to the other fees allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1237-24\">. Since the expenses of administration of the estate exceeded 25% of the net proceeds realized, Bankruptcy Rule 25F(2) of the district court necessitated review of the allowances by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">. The district court opinion noted the net proceeds of the estate were $18,302.18 and Heyman\u2019s total compensation $4,350.-00 which with other expenses brought administration costs to 29.7 %.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1238-14\">.
