The Government\u2019s theory was that in a five-minute episode he stabbed her 18 times with a knife. Appellant did not deny the stabbing, but defended on grounds that he lacked mens rea and that he was insane at the time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a nine-day trial to a jury, appellant was convicted of manslaughter, and he now appeals. After carefully considering the numerous points he raises, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">Appellant complains of the trial judge\u2019s treatment of incriminating statements he allegedly made prior to the date of the offense. The Government was allowed to introduce testimony to the effect that appellant had threatened to kill his wife and \u201cdo five years standing on his head\u201d by pleading insanity. Appellant contends that the statements should not have been admitted in evidence because they were non-probative and prejudicial. We think the statements were plainly relevant on the issue of mens rea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the trial judge ruled that their probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which he felt was dissipated by the large volume of psychiatric testimony; moreover, he limited the scope of the Government\u2019s inquiry as to them. Thus the judge assigned a role to each of the relevant criteria, and we perceive no basis for upsetting the balance he struck upon weighing them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>contends that in any event the jury should have been instructed that the statements should be considered with care and could not serve as a basis for conviction unless corroborated. The legal principles to which appellant refers apply to confessions and admissions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to which special precautions are needed to safeguard against false convictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They do not obtain in reference to pre-offense statements of intent, which \u201ccontain none of the inherent weaknesses of confessions or admissions after the fact.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"> Appellant claims that the trial judge erred in receiving in evidence a photograph of the deceased taken after appellant had allegedly beaten her some six months prior to the offense. One of the conflicts in the testimony was in relation to appellant\u2019s feelings toward and treatment of his wife. Government witnesses testified that appellant had mistreated her, while appellant testified that he loved her. On cross-examination, appellant was shown five photographs purporting to depict her appearance after the alleged assault, but he denied that her appearance was as bad as the photographs indicated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On rebuttal, the Government moved for the admission of the photographs into evidence, and the trial judge let in one of the five for consideration only on the issue of appellant\u2019s credibility. The judge reasoned, <em>inter alia, </em>that the photograph could have been admitted for its tendency to show intent, and that it was non-prejudicial<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the light of the uncontradicted testimony describing the brutal manner in which appellant had killed his wife. We agree with the trial judge that the photograph was relevant to intent as well as to appellant\u2019s credibility ;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we agree, too, that the inquiry did not end at that point. As we recently reaffirmed, probative value must outweigh the probability of prejudice before even relevant evidence may be admitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here the trial judge reached a conclusion after careful balancing of the pertinent factors, and we detect no abuse in the discretion he exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Appellant also claims that three psychiatrists on the staff of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, whom the Government called as expert witnesses on the insanity issue, should not have been permitted to testify because they had participated in a pretrial psychiatric staff conference of which appellant\u2019s attorney was not notified and at which the attorney was not present. Reasoning by analogy to United States v. Wade,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and relying upon our decision in Thornton v. Corcoran,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> appellant argues that the staff conference violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Our close scrutiny of the voluminous record discloses, however, that while appellant was interviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>during the course of the conference, nothing even remotely resembling an incriminating statement at the conference crept into his trial. It reveals, too, that his counsel did not experience any substantial difficulty in examining witnesses or in reconstructing events which his presence at the staff conference could have avoided.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finding no prejudice stemming from counsel\u2019s absence from the staff conference,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we do not reach the broad issues appellant tenders.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Another contention strongly urged is that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that it might, if so persuaded by the evidence, find him guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon as a lesser offense included within the murder charge. The jury was instructed as to the elements of first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter, and was authorized to convict of one or to acquit. No more was required, for there was no foundation in the evidence for a conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon. Unlike cases involving an issue as to whether the accused\u2019s act caused the victim\u2019s death,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> thereby presenting an issue as to whether the offense, if any, was homicide or was something less, the uncontradicted evidence in the case at bar established that appellant\u2019s wife died from the multiple stab wounds he inflicted upon her. Since every legally unjustifiable assault with a dangerous weapon producing death is either murder or manslaughter,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> appellant was guilty of one or the other or else was not guilty at all.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under clear precedents, an instruction on a lesser included offense need not and should not be given unless there is evidence to support it.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s charge on this score.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Appellant argues additionally that the trial judge\u2019s instruction as to the consequences of an acquittal by reason of insanity was insufficient, and that the jury should have been informed of the possible length of resulting hospitalization, of the fact that appellant need not have been psychotic to be committed, and that appellant would have to carry the burden of proving that he was not dangerous in order to secure his eventual release.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The judge gave an instruction in the exact form approved in Bolton v. Harris,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which sets forth the legal standard for commitment, and we think no more was required, certainly not along the lines suggested by appellant. We have admonished against speculation as to the length of confinement for hospitalization,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and appellant\u2019s complaint on burden of proof is referable to only one of several avenues of release from hospitalization.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A complete canvassing of release alternatives for the jury\u2019s edification could have impermissibly led to conjecture as to what might actually occur in appellant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">In sum, we find no error in the rulings of which appellant complains.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The judgment appealed from is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-11\">.

Appellant\u2019s theory on mens rea was satisfactorily covered by the judge\u2019s instructions on second degree murder and manslaughter, and his insanity theory by appropriate instructions on that subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b343-19\">. See Belton v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 20, 127 U.S.App.D.C. at 206-207, 382 F.2d at 155-156; Stith v.

Conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon necessitates proof that a dangerous weapon was used in the course of the assault, but neither of the homicide offenses so limits the means by which death occurs. Assault with a dangerous weapon thus embraces an element not required for murder or manslaughter. See Sansone v. United States, 380 U.S. 343, 350-351, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965).

Appellant also protests the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct that a drug-induced stupor may negate specific intent. There was evidence that appellant took amphetamines, drank a quantity of liquor, and had trouble driving to the scene of the homicide, but there was no evidence that he was in a stupor at the time of the stabbing. This quantum of evidence did not rise to the level required, Womack v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 336 F.2d 959 (1964); Tatum v. United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 390-391, 190 F.2d 612, 616-617 (1951), and in any event other instructions given on the element of specific intent sufficed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\">. 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 10 n. 50, 395 F.2d 642, 651 n. 50 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">.

For example, a post-trial hearing might eventuate in a decision that appellant does not require hospitalization. At such a hearing, the burden of proof is on the Government. See Bolton v.

Again, after a period of commitment, appellant might be released by the hospital administratively, either conditionally or unconditionally, see D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (e) (1967), or release might be sought by habeas corpus. See D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301(g) (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\">. See Lyles v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 24, 103 U.S.App.D.C. at 27, 254 F.2d at 730. Appellant also argues that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that the mere probability of his sanity would not be sufficient to authorize his conviction. The judge gave several instructions on the subject, and they met the requirements of Scurry v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 374, 347 F.2d 468, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 833, 88 S.Ct. 139, 19 L.Ed.2d 179 (1965). The judge was not obliged to do more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b344-15\">. Appellant also assigns as error an Allen-type instruction, see Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896), which the trial judge gave at the conclusion of his charge to the jury. Appellant\u2019s single objection, voiced originally in the District Court and pressed here, is that such an instruction is inappropriate prior to the jury\u2019s retirement to commence deliberations. Precedent, however, is to the contrary. Fulwood v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 185-186, 369 F.2d 960, 962-963 (1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 934, 87 S.Ct. 2058, 18 L.Ed.2d 996 (1967); McNeil v.

And since the verdict was not forthcoming until four and a half hours after rendition of the instruction, we are not persuaded that its timing could in any event have affected appellant prejudicially.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
