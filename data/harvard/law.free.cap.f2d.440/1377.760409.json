We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">The goods involved are artificial flowers imported from Hong Kong in July of 1962. Export value, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401a (b), is conceded to be the proper basis for appraisement; the controversy here is over the appraiser\u2019s \u00e1ddition of 11% to the entered prices of the goods, which 11% the importer maintains was not part of the export value of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">Appellant Reliance Trading Corporation of Illinois (Reliance of Illinois) purchased the goods from the Reliance Trading Corporation of Hong Kong (Reliance of Hong Kong), and the record shows that during 1962, 66% of Reliance of Hong Kong\u2019s export sales to the United States were made to Reliance of Illinois under an agreement by which appellant purchased its goods from Reliance of Hong Kong at rates 11% below that which other importers bought the remaining 34% of Reliance of Hong Kong\u2019s export sales to the United States. This agreement provided that Reliance of Illinois was to \u201cuse its best efforts to promote the sale of the HONG KONG COMPANY\u2019S products\u201d in the United States, and both an affidavit by the sole proprietor of Reliance of Hong Kong and testimony by the then-president of Reliance of Illinois indicate that Reliance of Illinois in fact showed samples to prospective buyers and handled complaints for dissatisfied buyers of Reliance of Hong Kong\u2019s artificial flowers. Additionally, this agreement provided that 10% of the price at which other American importers purchased artificial flowers from Reliance of Hong Kong (111% of the prices at which Reliance of Illinois would have 'bought the same goods) was to be paid Reliance of Illinois as a \u201ccommission,\u201d leaving Reliance of Hong Kong with 99.9% of what it would have received from Reliance of Illinois for the same sale.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-13\">Appellant\u2019s construction of the above arrangement is that it acted as an agent for the other American importers and that the extra 11% which they paid Reliance of Hong Kong was actually its commission for its services to <em>them, </em>a commission which Reliance of Hong Kong obligingly collected for it. Accordingly, it argues that the 11% paid Reliance of Hong Kong by the other American importers but not by it was not a part of the value of the goods but rather was the value of its services in the United States, rendered to other United States firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>The single judge, noting that the other importers had not bargained for the services of Reliance of Illinois and had no option to decline the services and buy the flowers at the prices extended to Reliance of Illinois, concluded that Reliance of Illinois \u201cwas either a selected purchaser or agent in the United States of Reliance, Hong Kong.\u201d He then held that, if Reliance of Illinois were to be considered a selected purchaser of Reliance of Hong Kong\u2019s, the price it paid could not be considered the export value of the goods because the goods were also sold at wholesale to others, citing Aceto Chemical Co. v. United States, 51 CCPA 121, C.A.D. 846 (1964), and that, if Reliance of Illinois were to be considered the agent in the United States of Reliance of Hong Kong, the 11% was its commission, which it termed \u201cpart of the seller\u2019s general expense of doing business\u201d and thus a part of the export value of the goods, citing Tapetes Luxor, S. A. v. United States, 56 Cust.Ct. 797, A.R.D. 206 (1966), aff\u2019d, 54 CCPA 116, C.A.D. 921 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-4\">The appellate term affirmed, adopting the single judge\u2019s agency theory and also holding that the importer had failed to establish a basis for an alternative appraisement in that (1) it had failed to prove the \u201cusual wholesale quantities\u201d in which other Hong Kong exporters sold such or similar merchandise for exportation to the United States and (2) it had failed to establish the \u201cordinary course of trade\u201d in artificial flowers for export from Hong Kong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">While we do not necessarily agree with the lower court\u2019s characterization of the relationship between Reliance of Hong Kong and Reliance of Illinois as that of principal and agent, see B &amp; W Wholesale Co. v. United States, 436 F.2d 1399, 58 CCPA 399, C.A.D. 1010, 5 Cust.Bull. &amp; Dec. No. 8, pp. 21, 23 (Feb. 4, 1971), we do agree that there is, at the very least, \u201csome substantial evidence\u201d in the record in support of the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the 11% which Reliance of Illinois did not pay Reliance of Hong Kong but which Reliance of Hong Kong collected from its other American vendees and turned over to Reliance of Illinois (ignoring the one-tenth of one per cent discrepancy) was the consideration given Reliance of Illinois by Reliance of Hong Kong in return for the former\u2019s services in promoting and facilitating the sale of the latter\u2019s goods in the United States and thus \u201cpart of the seller\u2019s general expense of doing business.\u201d We note appellant\u2019s argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-9\">* * * the 11% which the appraiser added, and which is the only element of the appraised value in dispute, was not part of the value of the goods in Hong Kong, but was for services rendered by Reliance, Illinois <em>in the United States. </em>We submit that payments made by an importer for services rendered by the exporter or his agent in the United States, are not a part of the <em>export value of the merchandise in the foreign country.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">However, we agree with the appellate term that \u201cThe place where the services are performed is not controlling as long as they were considered a part of the price of the merchandise [to the importers which enjoyed no special relationship with Reliance of Hong Kong].\u201d Erb &amp; Gray Scientific, Inc. v. United States, 53 CCPA 46, C.A.D. 875 (1966). Since a price including this commission was the only price at which the goods were available to the importers other than Reliance of Illinois, we hold that the price to those other importers was the export value of the goods in question. Aceto Chemical Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1436-14\"> The figures do not come out exactly, but 'the parties are fighting about the 11%, not the one-tenth of one percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
