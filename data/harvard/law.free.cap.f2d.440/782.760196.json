Frey, United States District Judge, Tucson, Arizona, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b840-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">Plaintiffs appeal from a summary judgment dismissing their patent infringement suit on the grounds that claims one and four of their Patent No. 3,175,330 were obvious as a matter of law and hence invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">This court has often cautioned that relatively rare is the suit in which summary judgment is warranted; and the observation is especially relevant to litigation involving patentability of a mechanical device. Northrop Architectural Systems, a corp., v. Lupton Mfg. Co., a corp., 437 F.2d 889 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-18\">However, this appeal reveals one of those infrequent instances where the conclusion is manifest \u2014 as it was in Walker v. General Motors Corp., 362 F.2d 56 (9th Cir. 1966) and Ashcroft and Engle v. Paper Mate Mfg. Co., 434 F.2d 910 (9th Cir. 1970) \u2014 that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and * * * the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c) F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-20\">The patent in suit (herein the '330 Patent) relates to a device commonly known in the building trade as a \u201cbead.\u201d \u201cBeads\u201d are lattice-like strips constructed of wood or wire and useful for supporting plaster on a wall or other surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-21\">The \u2019330 Patent discloses two forms \u2014a \u201ccorner\u201d bead and a \u201cscreed\u201d bead; each is made of wire and is formed with a U-shaped projection which runs lengthwise along its center.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-22\">Beads similar to those of the \u2019330 Patent are old in the art. The essential point of difference between the \u2019330 Patent bead and the beads shown in several prior art patents, brought before the court on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, lies in the number of wires or rods which they respectively bear. Thus, the \u2019330 Patent claims a \u201cplurality\u201d of wires separated from each other and extending lengthwise along the sides of the U-shaped projection, while the prior art patents disclose only a single wire or rod. As a result, the \u2019330 Patent device affords a better support for plaster, than any shown in the prior art, for the interstices between the \u201cplurality\u201d of wires provide many seats for the plaster (comparable to the spaces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>created when several ordinary wood laths are applied to a wall) and the prior art devices afford none.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">But even granting that the \u2019330 Patent device was new and useful, can any doubt exist that the differences between it and the prior art were such that the subject matter as a whole would not have been obvious at the time the invention was made \u201cto a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.) We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
