We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">The appellant contends that he is entitled to credit for time spent in jail from his January 26, 1963, arrest until his May 9, 1963, sentencing under the 1966 amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568. This amendment, effective July 1, 1966, provides that a defendant shall receive credit on his sentence for time spent in custody \u201cin connection with the offense or acts for which sentence was imposed\u201d. We have specifically held that 18 U.S..C. \u00a7 3568 is not to be given retrospective application. Howard v. Blackwell, 5 Cir., 1967, 389 F.2d 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">The appellant, Parris, received a sentence for eight years less than the maximum imposable penalty. The sentence transcript reveals specifically that the trial court took into consideration the time which had been spent in custody between the time of arrest and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">The denial of relief was eminently correct and the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
