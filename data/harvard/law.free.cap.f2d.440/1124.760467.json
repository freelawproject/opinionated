He appeals from a judgment entered upon a conviction on the single count of having received stolen funds from the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">While Nolte was acquitted on the three counts pertaining to the Pasadena National Bank and the Industrial State Bank, it becomes necessary to briefly recount the evidence adduced concerning all of the counts in view of Nolte\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defense witness William Atkins was Nolte\u2019s accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">After Rudy Homan was arrested for burglarizing the Pasadena National Bank, he engaged Nolte, an attorney, to arrange for his release on bail. Since Homan was unable to raise the necessary amount of cash for Nolte\u2019s services, it was agreed that Nolte would hold Ho-man\u2019s motorcycle as security for the balance owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">There was evidence, although conflicting, that shortly after Homan and Atkins burglarized the Industrial State Bank, they redeemed the motorcycle by giving Nolte a sack containing approximately one thousand dollars in coins stolen from the bank, and that in Atkins\u2019 and Homan\u2019s presence, he counted the coins, all of which were still secured in bank wrappers labeled \u201cIndustrial State Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-14\">Additional evidence linked Atkins to Nolte in the crimes charged in the indictment. After Atkins learned that Nolte desired to sell his old car and a set of tires, Atkins, accompanied by Homan, delivered six hundred dollars to Nolte in exchange for the car and tires. Homan testified that the payment consisted of Atkins\u2019 share of stolen coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-15\">Several days before the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank burglary, Homan informed Nolte that Jean Copeland, Ho-man\u2019s girl friend, had been arrested, presumably in connection with Homan\u2019s burglary of a savings and loan association. He requested Nolte to arrange for Copeland\u2019s release from custody as soon as possible. Nolte replied that \u201cit would take some money.\u201d Unable to raise the necessary cash for Nolte\u2019s services and to meet Copeland\u2019s bond, Homan called Nolte and told him that he \u201cwas going to have to make a bank.\u201d Nolte and Ho-man agreed to meet at the Flamingo Motel the next morning. In the meantime, Homan and Atkins burglarized the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank and managed to steal approximately fourteen thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-16\">During the burglary Homan severely cut his arm on broken glass. Since he was bleeding profusely, Atkins drove him to the Twin W Motel and then fetched Homan\u2019s sister Charlotte Squires to attend to Homan\u2019s wounds. After Atkins returned with Squires, Ho-man told her that part of the loot was for Nolte, and that Atkins would understand since Nolte needed the money. Homan and Squires drove Atkins home; they then met Nolte at the Flamingo Motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>With Homan and Squires present in the motel room, Homan emptied the contents of a pillowcase containing some of the stolen money on the bed. Most of the currency was secured by bank wrappers bearing the distinctive emblem of the Lumbermen\u2019s National Bank. After the group counted the loot, Nolte said that he would take care of the money and pay it back on demand, except for two thousand dollars for Copeland\u2019s bail and two thousand dollars for attorney\u2019s fees. Having instructed Squires to remove the bank wrappers, he then stacked the money in his briefcase. Shortly thereafter the group disbanded and left the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Nolte\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defense witness Atkins was \u201cin the category of an accomplice\u201d is without merit. A witness is an accomplice if he could have been indicted either as a principal or an accessory in the offense for which the defendant on trial is charged. Phelps v. United States, 5 Cir. 1958, 252 F.2d 49, 52; Risinger v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 236 F.2d 96, 99; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Atkins could have been indicted for receiving money stolen from the Industrial State Bank\u2014 the same offense for which Nolte was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Nolte next contends that even if Atkins was an accomplice, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that an accomplice\u2019s \u201ctestimony should not be received by the jury as that of an ordinary witness, but ought to be received as suspicious and with the greatest care and caution.\u201d Nolte relies on Washington v. Texas, 1967, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019, to support his argument that the instruction given violated his Sixth Amendment right to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor. But <em>Washington </em>was not concerned with jury instructions. It held unconstitutional a Texas statute which prohibited an accomplice from taking the stand in behalf of the defendant. While a defendant has the right to have an accomplice testify in his behalf, it is the better practice, although not required, for courts to give a cautionary instruction concerning the testimony of an accomplice. Caminetti v. United States, 1917, 242 U.S. 470, 495, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442; Holmgren v. United States, 1910, 217 U.S. 509, 524, 30 S.Ct. 588, 54 L.Ed. 861. The policy behind the practice is obvious: to alert the jury to the possibility of perjured testimony. When an accomplice testifies for the prosecution he may have an interest in prevaricating in favor of the prosecution to obtain favors or even immunity. Washington v. Texas, <em>supra, </em>388 U.S. at 22-23, 87 S.Ct. 1920. On the other hand, when one accomplice testifies for another, there is always the chance that each will try to \u201cswear the other out of the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 87 S.Ct. at 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">Nolte insists, however, that the instruction may only be given when an accomplice testifies for the prosecution, and not when he testifies in behalf of the defendant. We disagree. It is clear that an accomplice\u2019s credibility may be suspect, regardless of whether he testifies for the prosecution or the defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s decision whether to give the instruction is not a matter requiring constitutional scrutiny. At most, it is \u201cmerely a part of the general conduct of the trial, over which the judge\u2019s powers are discretionary, like his control over cross-examination, or his comments on the evidence.\u201d United States v. Becker, 2 Cir. 1933, 62 F.2d 1007, 1009; <em>accord, </em>Lyles v. United States, 5 Cir. 1957, 249 F.2d 744, 746, cert. denied, 1958, 356 U.S. 931, 78 S.Ct. 773, 2 L.Ed.2d 761. Whether an accomplice testifies for the prosecution or, as here, for the defense, it is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to instruct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>jury to accept an accomplice\u2019s testimony with caution. The instruction in the instant ease is almost identical to cautionary instructions previously approved by this Court. <em>See, e. g., </em>Ward v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 898, 910. We find no error in this portion of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">Nolte next points out the prosecutor\u2019s remark made during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of government witness Applewhite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-5\">I am going to object to Mr. Nagle\u2019s arguing with Mr. Applewhite. <em>I think he would answer anything honestly and fairly. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Nolte asserts that the remark, made without objection, resulted in plain error under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P. There can be no hard and fast basis for application of the rule, Dupoint v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 388 F.2d 39, 45, since the determination whether plain error exists must be made upon the facts of the particular ease. Sykes v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 373 F.2d 607, cert. denied, 1967, 386 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 1172, 18 L.Ed.2d 138. We doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s remark prejudiced Nolte. While it may have been objectionable, the remark did not result in plain error. The plain error rule is invoked only in exceptional circumstances to avoid a clear miscarriage of justice, Eaton v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 398 F.2d 485, 486, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 937, 89 S.Ct. 299, 21 L.Ed.2d 273; Mims v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 135, 147, or where the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings is seriously affected. United States v. Atkinson, 1936, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">We now turn to Nolte\u2019s appeal (consolidated) from the denial of his motion for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed.R.Crim.P., based on newly discovered evidence that Homan had given false testimony at the trial. By agreement of the parties, Homan\u2019s deposition, taken at the Marion, Illinois Penitentiary where he was serving sentence for bank burglary convictions, was offered in lieu of his oral testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">On deposition Homan recanted his trial testimony with respect to telling Nolte that the only way he could raise Copeland\u2019s bail and Nolte\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees was to \u201cmake a bank,\u201d \u201cto make a score.\u201d Homan\u2019s later version of their conversation is that he told Nolte he would either resort to savings, borrow the money, or sell some personal property. Homan further stated that his testimony that the money wrappers were stamped with the bank\u2019s emblem was false; that the wrappers were merely of various colors according to currency denomination. Finally, Homan recanted his testimony that he told Nolte about his \u201cillegal activities\u201d and that he told Nolte that the money was \u201cbank money.\u201d He claims that his perjured testimony was motivated by a desire for revenge against Nolte for encouraging him to plead guilty to a previous bank burglary charge and by a desire to travel to Houston in the hope of receiving medical attention for his drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">Homan\u2019s recantation was thoroughly impeached by three government witnesses at the hearing. Charlotte Squires reaffirmed her previous trial testimony, which is inconsistent with Homan\u2019s recantation. She further testified that about eight months after Nolte\u2019s conviction, she visited Homan to ask him why he was changing his story. He told her Nolte had promised him that Nolte would give him an affidavit stating that he had not represented Homan properly in advising him to plead guilty to two bank burglaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">S. G. Kolius, an attorney who had represented Homan by court appointment at the time of Nolte\u2019s trial, testified that he had received a letter from Homan stating, \u201cI have decided to help Nolte in any way I can.\u201d . F.B.I. Agent Claude Grace testified that in an interview with Homan after Nolte\u2019s conviction, Homan told Grace that Nolte had visited him in the Terre Haute Penitentiary five days after Homan testified at the trial. During this visit Nolte promised Homan a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>piece of property and a house if he would give a statement indicating that Nolte was not aware of the source of the money. Homan also told Grace that he had twice received money from a Pasadena, Texas, address \u2014 apparently from Nolte\u2019s Pasadena office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">While we agree with the general principle in Mesarosh v. United States, 1956, 352 U.S. 1, 9, 77 S.Ct. 1, 5, 1 L.Ed.2d 1, relied on by Nolte, that \u201c[t]he dignity of the United States Government will not permit the conviction of any person on tainted testimony,\u201d the Supreme Court took pains to point out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-5\">It must be remembered that we are not dealing here with a motion for a new trial initiated by the defense, under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, presenting untruthful statements by a Government witness subsequent to the trial as newly discovered evidence affecting his credibility at the trial. Such an allegation by the defense ordinarily will not support a motion for a new trial, because new evidence which is \u201cmerely cumulative or impeaching\u201d is not, according to the often-repeated statement of the courts, an adequate basis for the grant of a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Motions for a new trial based on recanted testimony of a material witness are looked upon with the utmost suspicion. Batsell v. United States, 8 Cir. 1968, 403 F.2d 395, 403, cert. denied, 1969, 393 U.S. 1094, 89 S.Ct. 865, 21 L.Ed.2d 785; Newman v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 238 F.2d 861, 862 n. 1. We agree with the lower court\u2019s findings that the circumstances surrounding Ho-man\u2019s recantation renders it particularly suspect. The evidence impeaching Ho-man was overwhelming and fully supports the conclusion that he failed to demonstrate that his trial testimony was false. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for a new trial. United States v. Johnson, 1946, 327 U.S. 106, 111, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562; United States v. Hersh, 5 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 835, 837-838; Batsell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>403 F.2d at 403; Reno v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 340 F.2d 307, 308; Newman v. United States, <em>supra, </em>238 F.2d at 862-863; Harrison v. United States, 5 Cir. 1951, 191 F.2d 874, 876; <em>see </em>Weiss v. United States, 5 Cir. 1941, 122 F.2d 675, 692, cert. denied, 314 U.S. 687, 62 S.Ct. 300, 86 L.Ed. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">Nolte\u2019s other points on appeal have been considered and are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">. After Nolte\u2019s first appeal was perfected, we remanded this case for the limited purpose of permitting the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on Nolte\u2019s motion for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed.R. Crim.P. United States v. Nolte, 5 Cir. 1969, [No. 27,352, Nov. 12, 1969]. Nolte\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial was thereupon consolidated with his first appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">. Atkins can hardly be viewed as a totally disinterested witness. For example, he conceded on cross-examination that Nolte had represented him previously with respect to three other bank burglaries, and that he still \u201cowed the man\u201d for his legal services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
