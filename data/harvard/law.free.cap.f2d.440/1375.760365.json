In particular, Flavor Corporation sells a varied line of flavoring additives to animal feed manufacturers, as well as to pesticide or rodentieide manufacturers, for incorporation in their respective products to assist in attracting the particular animal or pest to the feed material or stimulating its appetite for it. Since 1956, Flavor Corporation has associated the mark \u201cPestlur\u201d with one such flavor additive it has sold to pesticide and rodenticide manufacturers. Similarly, Kemin founded by a former salesman and acting sales manager of Flavor Corporation, sells a line of flavorings to animal feed manufacturers, and has applied the mark \u201cLure\u201d to such flavoring since early 1962. It also has sold a small quantity of rodenticide flavoring under the mark \u201cRat Lure\u201d. The record supports the board\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1434-18\">* * * flavorings for rodenticides and flavorings for animal feeds are to some extent at least promoted through a common trade publication, and that at least one manufacturer of animal feeds also makes rodenticides and hence would be a prospective purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>for the flavoring additives of both parties. Moreover, there is no support in the record for respondent\u2019s contention that purchasers of such goods are discriminating as to trademarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument here is that the board erred in failing to distinguish between the \u201cvastly different\u201d channels of trade for the rodenticide flavorings of Flavor Corporation and the animal feed flavorings of Kemin, and in concluding that the respective goods of the parties are purchased by the same class of purchasers. The \u201cvast\u201d difference in trade channels and purchasers is real to a certain extent, we suppose, but in other respect is quite tenuous since, as the board noted, the record shows there is at least one manufacturer of both rodenticide and animal feeds who would be a potential customer for the flavoring materials of both parties. We cannot say that the board erred in determining that a purchaser familiar with appellee\u2019s lines of animal feed and rodenticide flavorings, the latter sold under the mark \u201cPestlur\u201d, would, on encountering appellant\u2019s \u201cLure\u201d animal feed flavoring additive, be likely to assume by reason of confusion or mistake that a common source or origin existed. Under well-established precedent, any doubt on that score is resolved against the newcomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">Appellant also urges that Flavor Corporation cannot successfully petition to cancel the registration of \u201cLure\u201d because it has not shown that it actually has applied its mark \u201cPestlur\u201d in any manner to its goods prior to appellant\u2019s date of first use of \u201cLure\u201d. That argument, which amounts to a denial of appellee\u2019s ownership and priority of use of its mark as well as an indirect attack on the validity of appellee\u2019s registration, is irrelevant to the proceedings at hand, since Flavor Corporation is entitled to rely on its extant registration of \u201cPestlur\u201d under the terms of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052 (d). See, <em>e. g., </em>In re Calgon Corporation, 435 F.2d 596, 58 C.C.P.A. 830 (1971), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">Inasmuch as we have agreed with the board\u2019s decision regarding likelihood of confusion between \u201cLure\u201d and \u201cPestlur\u201d, we need not rule on appellant\u2019s further assignment of error in the board\u2019s additional reliance on appellee\u2019s use of the marks \u201cRodentlur\u201d and \u201cFishlur\u201d. The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1434-13\">.
