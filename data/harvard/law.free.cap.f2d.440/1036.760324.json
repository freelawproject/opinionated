The refusal to register was based on the existence of two prior registrations <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the mark \u201cSTERE-O-MATIC\u201d for use with goods which both parties appear satisfied to broadly characterize as \u201ctape recorders\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-21\">Appellant\u2019s contentions here appear to center primarily on the \u201cweakness\u201d of the cited mark and the distinctions between the goods involved. We are not convinced. It may well be true that there is little of a distinctive nature in the mark \u201cSTERE-O-MATIC\u201d. If such is the case, appellant\u2019s mark appears similarly vulnerable. Nevertheless, we still feel that the board was correct in holding that the goods here are closely enough related and the involved marks so similar that their concurrent use would be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception under the test decreed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-22\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">. The board\u2019s opinion is abstracted at 159 USPQ 793 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1094-15\">. Serial No. 200,560, filed August 25, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1094-16\">. The registrations are No. 635,109, issued October 2, 1956, for \u201cSound Recording And Playing Apparatus \u2014 Namely, Binaural Conversion Equipment For Tape Recording And Playing Apparatus\u201d, and No. 690,821, issued January 5, 1960, for \u201cElectrical \u2014 Mechanical Apparatus For Recording And/Or Playing Audio And Electrical Signals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1095-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>RICH, Judge, dissenting, in which LANE, Judge, joins.</author>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">The goods of appellant as well as the goods named in the two reference registrations being \u201cstereo\u201d (or \u201cStere-O\u201d) equipment, the only arbitrary, non-descriptive portions of the marks are \u201cMASTER\u201d and \u201cMATIC.\u201d I see no likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception from concurrent use. \u201cMASTER\u201d and \u201cMATIC\u201d call up entirely different mental associations, do not look alike or sound alike, and are a common English word and a clearly recognizable part of a different common word, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">It seems unlikely that if applicant\u2019s mark were passed to publication that the owner of the reference marks would be likely to oppose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
