United States, 63 Cust.Ct. 431, C.D. 3930 (1969), sustaining appellee-importer\u2019s protest against the classification of imported merchandise. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-20\">The merchandise consists of assortments of objects variously labeled as \u201cWise Guy Buttons,\u201d \u201cSmarty Buttons,\u201d and \u201cUgly Buttons.\u201d Each of the objects consists of a round metal disk about two inches in diameter and having a metal pin attached to the back. Humorous sayings and/or designs are printed in color on the front of the objects. Examples of the sayings are \u201cI FOUND MY IDEAL \u2014 ME\u201d and \u201cSUPPORT SLOPPINESS.\u201d One of the designs is of a one-eyed monster and includes the words \u201cHERE\u2019S LOOKING AT YOU.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-21\">The collector classified these objects as toys not specially provided for, under item 737.90 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), and assessed duty at 35% ad valorem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-22\">The Customs Court ruled that appellee had established (1) that the objects were not toys within the meaning of TSUS and (2) that they were properly classifiable under TSUS item 745.08 as \u201cbuttons of metal,\u201d dutiable at 10% ad valorem. Since we conclude that the court below erred as to the first matter, we need not discuss the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-23\">The term \u201ctoy\u201d is defined in the tariff schedules as \u201cany article chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults.\u201d In interpreting and applying this provision, the courts are precluded from entertaining any considerations of relative specificity with regard to any provisions outside schedule 7, part 5, subpart E, in which the \u201ctoys\u201d item ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>pears. This preclusion arises from headnote 1 to that subpart, which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-5\">The articles described in the provisions of this subpart (except parts) shall be classified in such provisions, whether or not such articles are more specifically provided for elsewhere in the tariff schedules * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-6\">Thus, the determinative issue in this case is whether the imported objects fit the description \u201carticle[s] chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults.\u201d Furthermore, since the objects at bar are clearly \u201carticles,\u201d and since \u201cchildren or adults\u201d apparently includes everyone, the issue boils down to whether or not the chief purpose of the objects at the time of importation was \u201camusement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">The Customs Court summed up the evidence introduced at trial on the point in issue. 63 Cust.Ct. at 435-436. We paraphrase that portion of the court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-8\">Examination of the sample importations indicates that they are designed to be worn rather than played with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-9\">The testimony clearly shows that they are chiefly used for wearing. Children who bought the buttons in test marketing were generally between the ages of 9 and 14. They would open the package, look at the button, show it to a friend and then put it on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-10\">A psychologist called by the importer testified that from his research the buttons\u2019 appeal is to pre-adolescent children who, when they obtained a button, would read the saying on it, smile or frown, and then put it on. He opined that the behavioral factors motivating use of the buttons were attention-getting and communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-11\">A psychologist called by the government stated that his observations led him to conclude that only a minority of children wore the buttons they purchased and that he had observed other uses, such as mounting on bulletin boards. He believed that self-expression was not the motivation behind the purchase, but rather the fun and pleasure of collecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-12\">The four children called as witnesses by the government indicated by the general tenor of their testimony that the principal motivation behind purchasing such buttons was to wear them for fun and not to collect or trade them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">The court concluded from the evidence that the chief use of the imported objects was \u201cwearing.\u201d We have no quarrel with that conclusion. Where we differ with the court below is in its reasoning that \u201cwearing\u201d and \u201camusement\u201d are mutually exclusive. The court reached this result through an unduly narrow construction of the term \u201camusement.\u201d After noting that prior to the enactment of the TSUS a \u201ctoy\u201d was defined as a child\u2019s plaything, the court cited Wilson\u2019s Customs Clearance, Inc. v. United States, 59 Cust.Ct. 36, C.D. 3061 (1967), for the proposition that the TSUS removed the limitation regarding the users\u2019 age but left the requirement that the object be a plaything. We think this conclusion is unsupported by the wording of the TSUS or by case authority. In the <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>case the court did not hold that to be a toy an object had to <em>be </em>a plaything, but that the \u201ccharacter of amusement involved was that derived from an item which is essentially a plaything.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. The court thus stressed the quality of mind or emotion induced by the object as controlling, and we think that is the best approach to interpreting the TSUS definition. If the purpose of an object is to give the same kind of enjoyment as playthings give, its purpose is amusement, whether the object is to be manually manipulated, used in a game, or, as here, worn. We think the evidence is clear that the fun children derive from wearing the imported buttons is essentially the same kind of frivolous enjoyment they would derive from objects which we commonly think of as toys. Accordingly, we find that the importer failed to establish that the chief use of the imported buttons was other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>amusement. The presumption of correctness of the collector\u2019s classification was therefore not overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">BALDWIN, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
