Under the circumstances, it is common ground between the parties that Section 2(a) 5 of the Act controls petitioner\u2019s application for disability annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Petitioner\u2019s medical background shows a history of a back injury in 1942, a re-injury in 1944, and increasing difficulty with his lower back since that time. The medical records show a number of visits to the Veterans Administration out patient clinic by petitioner during the period 1963 to 1965. In 1965 he had a complete neurological examination at the Veterans Administration facility which resulted in the diagnosis \u201cchronic lumbosacral strain \u2014 symptomatic\u201d and other conditions not relevant here. Petitioner was confined in George Washington University Hospital from February 18, 1967 to March 11, 1967. The diagnosis at that time confirmed his lower back condition in terms of \u201cdegenerative lumbar intervertebral discs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">Petitioner\u2019s first application for disability annuity, filed on February 23, 1965, was denied on June 7, 1965. Petitioner returned to his railroad work for the Washington Terminal Company in 1966 for about 14 months until February 17, 1967, and on March 13, 1968 filed a new application for disability annuity. This second application was denied by the Board\u2019s Bureau of Retirement Claims on May 28, 1968, and the Appeals Council for the Board denied petitioner\u2019s appeal on November 1, 1968. In a 19-page opinion carefully reviewing all the facts and all of the law pertaining to petitioner\u2019s case, the Railroad Retirement Board affirmed the decision of the Appeals Council. It is this decision of the Board which is before this court for review under Section 11 of the Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228k (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Section 2(a) 5 of the Railroad Retirement Act provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">\u201c\u00a7 2(a) The following-described individuals, if they shall have been employees on or after the enactment date, and shall have completed ten years of service, shall * * * be eligible for annuities after they shall have ceased to render compensated service to any person, whether or not an employer as defined in section 1 (a) of this title (but with the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>engage in other employment to the extent not prohibited by subsection (d) of this section):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">* -If- * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201c5. Individuals whose permanent physical or mental condition is such that they are unable to engage in any regular employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Pursuant to the authority granted by Section 10(b) 4 of the Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228j(b)4 (1964)), the Board promulgated the following regulation regarding the establishment of permanent disability for work \u201cin any regular employment\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cAn individual shall be deemed to be permanently disabled for work in any regular employment if he has a permanent physical or mental condition, as that term is defined in \u00a7 208.-10, and he is because of such condition unable to perform regularly, in the usual and customary manner, the substantial and material duties of any regular and gainful employment which is substantial and not trifling, with any employer, whether or not subject to the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.17(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Section 11 of the Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228k), through incorporation of the judicial review provisions of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(f) (1964)), provides: \u201cThe findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive.\u201d This section has been interpreted uniformly as meaning simply that \u201c * <em>* * </em>the Board\u2019s decision should not be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence in the record and if not based on an error of law.\u201d Schafer v. Railroad Retirement Board, 7 Cir., 217 F.2d 874, 875 (1954).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While this standard is applicable generally to all types of cases adjudicated by the Board, it has particular reference to a disability case which \u201cis peculiarly a fact case, and * * * it [is] peculiarly for the Board to say whether the inference to be drawn from the testimony as a whole [is] that plaintiff [is], or that he [is] not, totally and permanently disabled.\u201d Watts v. Railroad Retirement Board, 5 Cir., 150 F.2d 113, 115 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">This court has studied the record in this case and the Board\u2019s decision with great care. The record reveals a railroad worker proud of the tradition of his calling who, when a disabling back injury threatened to end his career, refused to accept reevaluation of his job potential through rehabilitation and retraining and refused to seek other employment of which he was capable. The record clearly shows, with an abundance of evidence from at least six doctors, that petitioner does indeed have a lower back problem that is becoming more disabling with age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But all save one of the doctors\u2019 reports and testimony, including his own personal physician\u2019s, indicate quite clearly that with his background petitioner would be capable of retraining for jobs involving bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>work and for other sedentary occupations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record is abundantly clear, too, that there is a demand in the Washington area for persons of petitioner\u2019s age and background with limited physical capacity to perform such jobs as radio or television repairman, guard, special policeman, and other types of watchman service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Perhaps it is unkind to suggest to a man who has given his life to railroad service that he accept a sedentary job or retraining in a position which his limited physical condition permits him to perform. The suggestion, however, comes not from the court but from the Congress which passed this Act limiting disability annuities to those employees of petitioner\u2019s age and tenure<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who are \u201cunable to engage in any regular employment.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228b (a) 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Under the circumstances, and appreciating the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the Act, this court has no alternative but to affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\">. For similar statements regarding the scope of judicial review of decisions of the Board, <em>see </em>Gloss v. Railroad Retirement Board, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 177, 313 F.2d 568 (1962) ; Aldridge v. Railroad Retirement Board, 5 Cir., 285 F.2d 759 (1961) ; Ogle v. Railroad Retirement Board, 6 Cir., 238 F.2d 233 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\">. The medical evidence generally is in agreement with the findings of Dr. Bush, petitioner\u2019s personal physician. Dr. Bush found that petitioner was suffering from \u201cminimal degenerative and/or hypertrophic arthritis in the spine and hands which need not be symptomatic\u201d and was not \u201cout of proportion to the physical activities of several years in his present work.\u201d Dr. Bush noted that the x-rays taken at George Washington University Hospital showed a \u201cslight narrowing of the L-4, L-5 intervertebral disc space\u201d with \u201cno nerve root compression or disc protrusion.\u201d Dr. Bush\u2019s impression that the \u201cdegenerative disc disease in the lumbar area will continue to be symptomatic with the physical activity of his present employment\u201d supports the Board\u2019s finding that \u201cmuch of appellant\u2019s pain is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>associated with the heavy work which he did for many years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">. For example, Dr. Bush stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cIt has been my impression that with this man\u2019s background he would be capable of training for bench work while sitting, as one might perform repairs on small electrical appliances, radio, TV, et cetera. It would be understood that in this type of work that actual handling of any heavy equipment or bending or stooping would have to be minimal and then very slowly progressed depending upon his tolerance of this type of physical activity. * * *\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">. The record shows that both the District Unemployment Compensation Board and the Virginia Employment Commission reported that they have \u201copen orders for this type work now and were reasonably sure that they could place the applicant even with his alleged disability.\u201d As indicated <em>supra, </em>petitioner refused to consider other employment. The Board\u2019s finding that regular jobs were available in the Washington area which petitioner could perform avoids the need to rule on his contention that an administrative denial of disability benefits is supported by substantial evidence only if the agency has introduced evidence identifying jobs in a particular geographic area for which the claimant might have a reasonable opportunity to be hired if he were to make a good faith effort to secure employment. <em>Compare </em>Duncan v. Railroad Retirement Board, 4 Cir., 375 F.2d 915 (1967) ; Gardner v. Earnest, 4 Cir., 371 F.2d 606 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b339-22\">. In this connection it may be noted that the Railroad Retirement Act does provide, in \u00a7 2 (a) 4, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228b (a) 4 (1964), annuities for individuals who are merely disabled for work in their usual occupations. To be eligible for such an annuity, however, an individual must have either reached the age of 60 or completed 20 years of service creditable under the Act,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
