Keogh, 417 F.2d 885, 888-890 (2 Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Discovery incident to the hearing of the portion of Justice Keogh's first <em>comm nobis </em>petition, which concerned four bank deposits made by Dr. Erdman close in time to the alleged receipt of the bribe money by him, revealed the existence of an FBI report dated February 26, 1962. Another admittedly less significant FBI report dated January 24, 1962 had been made available to the petitioner in the course of his disbarment hearings. These re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ports related to a $50,000 investment in the Ace Manufacturing Company, a Glen Burnie, Md., concern, in late April, 1961, by Sanford Moore, whose indictment for bankruptcy fraud had triggered the alleged conspiracy to obstruct justice, Louis Forman, who was claimed to have furnished Moore with most of the bribe money earlier in 1961, and Dr. Erdman, who allegedly received the bribe money from Moore and paid it to Keogh and Kahaner. It had been developed at the trial that Moore and Forman had a two-thirds and Erdman a one-third share in this investment. The report revealed that the contribution of Moore and Forman was paid by a check in For-man\u2019s name for $33,332.66; that it was dated April 28, 1961, and was drawn on the Meadow Brook National Bank; that the account on which it was drawn was opened only on May 2, with a deposit of $100; that the check was received for payment on May 4; that the overdraft was met by a cash deposit of $33,350 on May 5; and that this deposit consisted of $19,700 in $100 bills, $9850 in $50 bills, $1800 in $20 bills, and $2000 in $10 bills. The claimed significance of this was that the bribe money allegedly paid by Moore to Erdman and transmitted to Keogh and Kahaner was made up of bills of rather similar denomination and that the deposit coincided in time with representations by Forman to Erdman that the latter should return the money to Moore \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t deliver what he was supposed to.\u201d Hence, it was argued that \u201cthe evidence that Forman had $33,350 in small bills on May 5 would have materially strengthened Keogh\u2019s claim that Erdman had never given him any of the bribe money.\u201d 417 F.2d at 889. On the previous appeal from denial of the first <em>coram nobis </em>petition, we declined to consider this since it was not within the scope of the hearing we had directed and had \u201cnot been explored in depth\u201d; rather we affirmed \u201cwithout prejudice to Justice Keogh\u2019s filing a new petition\u201d for <em>coram nobis </em>on this and certain other matters. 417 F.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The further proceedings took a course quite different from what we had envisioned. Although we had not directed an evidentiary hearing in so many words, our opinion rather clearly contemplated one. Instead of the simple petition which was all that would have been needed to obtain this, Keogh filed an elaborate one, dated December 24, 1969, which was supplemented by a long affidavit, in the nature of a legal argument, by the counsel who has represented him in these <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings. The Government\u2019s initial response, late in January 1970, was that these papers \u201craise in minute detail numerous issues of fact and law which in our opinion require extensive preliminary investigation and a full evidentiary hearing in order to provide the Court with sufficient facts to decide the questions.\u201d It was given until May 4 to file a response. The Government then sought and obtained an additional extension to June 1, representing that extensive factual inquiry not only into the record \u201cbut also into extrinsic matters which happened or allegedly happened eight or nine years ago\u201d had \u201cdisclosed evidence substantially negating petitioner\u2019s claim of materiality.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead of submitting such evidence, it moved on the appointed day to dismiss the petition on the ground that Keogh had failed to support it \u201cwith affidavits of fact based on personal knowledge which, if they were true, would merit issuance of the Writ.\u201d This motion was accompanied by an affidavit in the nature of argument by an attorney in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice which advanced no new facts, and two short affidavits of the prosecutors, Hundley and Lally. Hundley said that although he had no specific recollection of having seen the FBI report of February 26, 1962, during his trial preparation, he \u201cprobably had knowledge of the basic information contained in that report.\u201d He added, irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>vantly and almost certainly incorrectly, that \u201c[d]efense counsel has had access to this report since I voluntarily turned over all the material related to\u201d the Keogh matter to Hon. Bruce Bromley, the referee in the long pending Keogh disbarment proceedings. See Keogh v. Richardson, 17 N.Y.2d 479, 266 N.Y.S.2d 984, 214 N.E.2d 163 (1965). Lally had \u201cno specific recollection\u201d of having seen the February 26, 1962, report. Both prosecutors averred that they \u201cdid not in any way conceal or attempt to conceal or suppress in any manner that report or any information to which defense counsel might have been entitled.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel submitted a reply affidavit, in the nature of argument. Since the Government had suggested there was no proof that the reports had not in fact been turned over, petitioner also filed an affidavit of his trial counsel, Henry G. Singer. Mr. Singer stated his best recollection was that he had not seen them; to support this he alleged that every such report turned over to him during the trial had been marked for identification and that review of the clerk\u2019s minutes in which the trial exhibits were listed showed that the two reports were not among them. Excerpts from the disbarment testimony were also attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">With the equivalent of some 200 pages of printed matter having been thus accumulated, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss came on for argument. It was agreed that petitioner\u2019s counsel should be heard first. He began by saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">Your Honor, the writ in this case should issue and I would normally be beseeching your Honor for a hearing, but in view of the papers submitted by the Government it appears not only, perhaps, that I didn\u2019t need any answering papers, as was indicated to me, but certainly there is no necessity for a hearing because they raise no arguable or justiciable issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Since Government counsel were now in accord about the absence of need for an evidentiary hearing, Judge Weinfeld announced at the close of the argument that he would decide \u201cupon the papers as submitted by counsel.\u201d There was no demur. In his opinion dismissing the petition he stated that the merits would \u201cbe decided upon the moving papers, the files, and the trial and hearing records of the case without regard to any new matter presented in the government\u2019s answering affidavits\u201d \u2014 of which, indeed, there was precious little. Since we can add nothing to Part I of his decision, in which he rejected claims based on evidence of certain financial dealings of Mrs. Erdman which had come to light during the hearings on the first <em>coram nobis </em>petition, we shall limit this opinion to the more serious questions raised by Part II, relating to the FBI reports of February 26 and January 24, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Preliminarily, we must confess some regret that an evidentiary hearing was not held. While it is understandable that the Government might not have been able in 1970 to demonstrate that there was an innocent source for the $33,350 cash deposit of May 5, 1961, with the degree of certainty it had established two years earlier as regards Erdman\u2019s bank deposits of February 1961, see 417 F.2d at 887, and thereby have put the entire matter to rest, we would have been better satisfied with a record that contained oral testimony. Hundley, Lally, Singer, and other trial attorneys were surely available. So also were Moore, who has given evidence on this very matter in the disbarment proceedings, and Erdman. While Forman had refused to discuss the matter under advice of counsel, this does not mean that, if subpoenaed, he would necessarily have advanced a claim of privilege or could have sustained one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we see no basis on which we could properly reverse the district judge and order still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>further proceedings in this case because of his not directing a hearing which was not sought either by petitioner\u2019s counsel, quite possibly for strategic reasons, or by the Government, unless we were convinced by examination of the record that the interests of justice so required. We are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The district court, 316 F.Supp. 921, rested its denial of the petition on two grounds: (1) that \u201cit has not been adequately established that in fact these reports [of January 24 and February 26, 1962] were not turned over and available to the defense at or before the trial,\u201d and (2) that in any event the proof did not meet the standards for issuance of the writ laid down in United States v. Keogh, <em>supra, </em>391 F.2d at 146-148.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In support of the first ground, the judge noted what he called the \u201cguarded affidavit\u201d of Mr. Singer, which said only it was his \u201cbest recollection\u201d that he had never seen the report of February 26, 1962. In addition, the court cited examples of material turned over to the defense which had not been listed in the clerk\u2019s minutes or had not been marked for identification, and pointed to petitioner\u2019s failure to submit supporting affidavits by Mr. Singer\u2019s associates<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or other trial attorneys.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Conceding some force in these points, we think them insufficient to support the conclusion. Singer\u2019s affidavit was enough to put on the Government the burden of coming forward with proof that the reports had been furnished. It came forward with nothing except Hundley\u2019s affidavit which, by urging, apparently in error, that the February 1962 report had been turned over to Referee Bromley, inferentially admitted that it had not been disclosed at an earlier date. We will therefore assume that the defense did not have the February 1962 report until this was unearthed by discovery in the first <em>corara nobis </em>proceeding or the January 1962 report until it was produced during the disbarment hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">In United States v. Keogh, <em>supra, </em>391 F.2d at 146-148, we outlined three categories of cases relating to prosecutorial non-disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">(1) \u201c[W]here the prosecutor\u2019s suppression is \u2018deliberate,\u2019 by which we include not merely a considered decision to suppress, taken for the very purpose of obstructing, but also a failure to disclose evidence whose high value to the defense could not have escaped the prosecutor\u2019s attention\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">(2) Where the prosecution fails to furnish evidence favorable to the accused upon request; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\">(3) \u201c[W]here the suppression was not deliberate in either of the senses we have included and no request was made, but where hindsight discloses that the defense could have put the evidence to not insignificant use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">We held that issuance of habeas corpus for cases in the third category required \u201ca substantially higher probability that disclosure of the evidence to the defense would have altered the result.\u201d We also held that the standards in <em>corara nobis </em>were higher still. This was because the only consequences still being inflicted, namely, civil disabilities and moral stigma, while serious in any case and especially so to a former New York Supreme Court justice, were considerably less severe than continued imprisonment, and the unlikelihood of retrial would render issuance of the writ the practical equivalent of an acquittal. Hence, we said, with respect to the third category, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-15\">it is only when the court concludes that the undisclosed evidence would have permitted the defendant so to present his ease that he would probably have raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt in the mind of a conscientious juror that justice compels the invalidation of the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>391 F.2d at 148. Petitioner\u2019s claim here is, in effect, that his case comes within the second branch of (1) or, failing that, under (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Petitioner suggested below that the FBI investigation of the financing of the Ace investment was triggered by-Moore\u2019s last appearance before the grand jury on October 24, 1961. The prosecutor then asked what Moore had meant by having answered to one of the grand jurors that Dr. Erdman was \u201ca mystery man.\u201d Moore\u2019s reply was that Erdman sometimes seemed \u201cmagnanimous\u201d and sometimes \u201chungry and avaricious.\u201d Amplifying the latter, he said that Erdman had \u201cbeen lending Gabe [Forman] money trying to get control\u201d of Ace and that as to \u201cthe whole transaction, the $35,000, I can\u2019t actually pin it on him and I don\u2019t want to say he has any of the money but \u2014 there has been a few occasions, I can\u2019t recall off-hand, that gave me that impression.\u201d Moore was also asked, \u201cDo you think the Doctor kept some of the money?,\u201d and responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to say because it would only be an assumption. I really don\u2019t know. * *' *\u201d Earlier, on July 17, 1961, Forman had testified before the grand jury concerning his May 4 meeting with Dr. Erdman at Ace:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">I sat down with Dr. Erdman and I told him, I said the most important thing now is this money that he took and he didn\u2019t go through with the deal, and he should return the money, and I felt that he took the money \u2022X* \u2022Jr *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">I told him that I\u2019d like him to return the money. He said, well, he didn\u2019t have all the money available now, that he would give me five thousand dollars and a note for thirty thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">A July, 5, 1961 statement given by Moore to the FBI stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">Forman advised me that he inquired of Erdman as to the disposition of the original $35,000 in cash, and he, Erdman, stated that the money had been given to different people, and that he, Erdman, could account to Gabe for the disposition of the $35,000. Erdman is said to have added that if he did account for the $35,000, he, FORMAN, would have to apologize. Since that occasion, Forman has been in contact with Erdman on several occasions at which time Erdman continues to make the representation that he would account for the disposition of the original $35,000, but as yet has not done so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">And a memorandum dated November 22, 1961 from Hundley to Attorney General Robert Kennedy stated, in discussing whether Keogh should be prosecuted as well as Kahaner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-13\">Erdman is an enigma and on cross-examination will be vulnerable because of his extra-professional interests in a slot machine company, psychiatric treatment and his penchant for fixing cases for \u201ckicks.\u201d Unless, however, we are able to establish that Erdman kept the pay-off money which we cannot at this time it will be most difficult to try the case without Keogh as a defendant. It\u2019s all pretty much the same ball of wax; the facts against Keogh would come out at any trial and it would certainly complicate matters to try and convince a jury that Erdman was telling the truth about Kahaner and not Keogh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">It is against this background that we must endeavor to place ourselves in the position of the prosecutor when he received the FBI reports of January 24 and February 26, 1962, these being respectively of 30 and 12 typewritten pages. On their face they showed that Erdman had paid for his one-third share of Ace with three checks. Two of them, a personal check for $6,917 and a check of Jerome Edelman, a lawyer for $6,000 \u2014-allegedly a loan, had been delivered on April 28, 1961 to Becker, the lawyer for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the investors; the third was a personal check dated April 14 for $3,750 that had been issued directly to Ace.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They also revealed that Forman had paid for his own and Moore\u2019s share with a check on his newly opened account at the Meadow Brook National Bank, made good in the peculiar manner we have stated, and that Forman had been advised by his attorney not to discuss the matter with the FBI. With the advantage of hindsight, one might jump to the conclusion that Hundley should have realized that this information could have given some support to a defense theory that Erdman had kept the bribe money until forced to return it in May, and that he was therefore guilty of \u201cdeliberate suppression.\u201d But such a judgment would be altogether too severe. While the material we have summarized indicates that Hundley did anticipate a defense theory that Erdman kept some or all of the bribe money, a report showing that Erdman had paid for his share of the Ace investment by checks, two his own and the third a loan from Edelman, had no substantial tendency to establish this. Indeed, as counsel for petitioner concedes, \u201c[t]he FBI report indicates that the questionable funds were put up by Moore and Forman, not Erdman.\u201d At the time he received the FBI reports, Hundley had no reason to anticipate that the defense would suggest that rather than keeping the money for his own benefit, Erdman had returned most of it to Moore and Forman. The pre-trial statements indicated at most that Moore and Forman had some question in their minds whether Erdman had kept the money; they would have had no such question if Erdman had returned it to them. To hold that at this stage Hundley should have anticipated every conceivable defense strategy that could have been constructed from a few scattered remarks in a voluminous pretrial record would be to shut our eyes to the realities of pre-trial preparation. We thus cannot fault Hundley for failing to turn over the reports before the trial began, since they gave little support to the defense theory noted above and the prosecution cannot be held responsible for not anticipating the one now suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">The focus then shifts to the trial itself. Kahaner\u2019s counsel cross-examined Moore with respect to his and Forman\u2019s investment in Ace; we set this forth in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>of Moore by Keogh\u2019s counsel on this subject added nothing as to the source of the funds for the Ace investment, although it rather clearly demonstrated counsel\u2019s awareness of the $34,000 check to Ace. Forman testified, on direct examination, that at a meeting around that time in Baltimore, he told Dr. Erdman that he \u201cwanted the money back for Sandy [Moore] that we gave him because he [Erdman] didn\u2019t deliver what he was supposed to\u201d; that Erdman agreed to return the money but said he could do no better at that time than give $5000 in cash and a $30,000 note; and that on Forman\u2019s expressing dissatisfaction Erdman sought more time and promised to \u201cwork it out.\u201d Forman went on to testify that on one occasion when he sought the return of the money, Erdman said that \u201che had given most of the money to the judge and gave some of it to Kahaner\u201d and that he was going to seek further help from the judge. In his lengthy cross-examination of For-man, Keogh\u2019s counsel, rather than pursuing Forman\u2019s direct testimony in an effort to show that he had secured reimbursement of the bribe money, pressed him hard in a not ineffective endeavor to show that Forman had charged Erdman with having kept the $35,000 and therefore was morally bound to indorse the $50,000 of notes given by Moore in the \u201crestitution\u201d phase of the conspiracy, see 317 F.2d at 466-467, 476-477; we quote the relevant cross-examination in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>valuable testimony since it linked with the defense\u2019s most telling pieces of evidence to support its theory that Erdman had kept the bribe money, to wit, the testimony of a bankruptcy trustee of Moore\u2019s' company concerning a statement by Erdman \u201cthat he had security of $35,000\u201d for the $50,000 of notes he had indorsed and Erdman\u2019s letter of July 13, 1961, to the same effect. See 317 F.2d at 476-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">With the defense having taken this tack and also have eschewed such obvious questions of Moore and Forman as on what bank was the check to Ace drawn, what was the amount of the bank check from England, and when was it sent, see also fn. 9, <em>supra, </em>we find it impossible to conclude that the \u201chigh value\u201d of the February 26, 1962 report \u201cto the defense could not have escaped the prosecutor\u2019s attention,\u201d 391 F.2d at 147, particularly since there is no evidence the prosecutors had looked at it in the intervening three months. As we said in that opinion, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">Any lawyer who has prepared and conducted a trial like this one, lasting 23 trial days, knows how easy it is to forget items in his files that an unexpected turn in the evidence has made helpful to his own case, let alone those that might aid his opponents \u2014 something which, under our adversary system, is not exactly in the forefront of his mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">If petitioner is to prevail, he must therefore bring his case within the third category, 391 F.2d at 147, \u201cwhere the suppression was not deliberate in either of the senses we have included and no request was made, but where hindsight discloses that the defense could have put the evidence to not insignificant use,\u201d with the attendant higher standards of materiality, particularly in <em>coram nobis. </em>Despite some surface plausibility in the contention that the defense would have been materially aided by knowledge that Moore and Forman had $33,500 in bills ranging from $100 to $10 in May, 1961, analysis convinces us that Judge Weinfeld was correct in concluding that this would not have created a reasonable doubt of petitioner\u2019s guilt in the mind of a juror who was otherwise satisfied\u2014 even if we assume the applicable test in <em>coram nobis </em>to be no higher than that, see 391 F.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">In the first place, any suggestion by the defense that the cash deposits of May 5, 1961, represented a return of the bribe money would have met with vigorous denial on the part of the only three persons having knowledge of the facts \u2014Erdman, Forman and Moore.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>man\u2019s testimony that he continued to question Erdman about the money after May 5 and that up to July 6 and indeed \u201cright up to now\u201d (at the trial) Forman was never able to get a satisfactory explanation of what Erdman had done with the money would have been particularly hard to overcome. But even if the jury had chosen to disbelieve all three witnesses and infer that nevertheless the $33,500 came from Erdman, it is by no means clear that this would have worked in Keogh\u2019s favor. In view of Forman\u2019s testimony that on the very day before the deposit, Erdman had said he could do no better than pay $5,000 in cash and deliver a $30,000 note and had remarked on one occasion about seeking help from the judge, if the jury had accepted that the immediate source of the $33,500 in bills was Erdman, it might well have inferred also that the ultimate source of the bulk of the money could have been Keogh. This would have been damaging in the last degree since, among other things, it would have destroyed the defense\u2019s strong reliance on the Government\u2019s inability to trace what Keogh or Kahaner had done with the money allegedly received. Moreover, in an attempt to attain a goal so difficult to reach and thus so fraught with danger if achieved, a successful effort to develop that the $33,500 represented a return of the bribe money would have impaired the defense\u2019s most solid argument for the theory that Erdman had always kept this. If Erdman had returned the bribe money, what reason would there have been for him to indorse Moore\u2019s dubious $50,000 notes to the trustee in bankruptcy?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And how, on the hy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>pothesis of a return, could the defense have made the effective use it did of Erdman\u2019s oral and written statements to the trustee that he had security of $35,000? To ask the jury to believe that, despite all the contrary evidence, Forman had forced Erdman <em>both </em>to repay $33,500, <em>and </em>to indorse $50,000 in notes, with some arrangement whereby Forman and Moore would indemnify him to the extent of $35,000, particularly with the risk we have noted of attribution of a large part of the $33,500 to Keogh, would have been a far less effective tactic than the one followed in Mr. Singer\u2019s cross-examination of Forman, see n. 9, and in the summation. This was that it was because Erdman had <em>k&amp;pt </em>the money that Moore and Forman were able to press him into indorsing the $50,000 of notes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With the defense having made this wise tactical choice<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and having failed to propound questions of Moore and Forman about the Ace investment that obviously must have occurred to such \u201cdiligent defenders,\u201d see United States v. Soblen, 301 F.2d 236, 242 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 944, 82 S.Ct. 1585, 8 L.Ed.2d 810 (1962), as counsel for Keogh and Kahaner, we see no sufficient basis for invalidating the conviction because of failure to turn over the February 26 or January 24 reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The only other point raised in regard to the FBI reports that is worth noting is the claim that disclosure that Forman appeared to have written a check dated April 28, 1961, would have weakened the Government\u2019s evidence that, as shown by his passport and other proof, he did not return to this country from England until April 30, and would thereby have repelled the attack on Keogh\u2019s testimony that Forman had accompanied Erdman and Moore on their visit to his chambers on March 29. Quite apart from possible predating of the check, this, as Judge Weinfeld observed, is \u201ca giant leap backward.\u201d Moreover, we now know from Moore\u2019s testimony in the disbarment proceeding, see fn. 10, that the riposte to any argument based on the date of the cheek would have been that Moore signed Forman\u2019s name on the April 28 check in anticipation of Forman\u2019s early arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">When all is said and done, the case in essence stands no differently than when we sustained Keogh\u2019s conviction, after heavy attack, eight years ago. See 317 F.2d at 485. If the jury believed Moore and Erdman, the Government\u2019s proof was overwhelming; if they did not and accepted Keogh\u2019s and Kahaner\u2019s denials, they would have acquitted. Had the Government failed to turn over evidence it had reason to know would discredit either of its two chief witnesses in a significant way, relief should indeed be granted. On its face the February 26 report had no such effect. Rather it confirmed Moore\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that his and Forman\u2019s Ace investment had been paid by a check covered by a cash deposit and dispelled the suggestion that Erdman had used part of the cash Moore had delivered to pay for his share. It is asking too much of the prosecution to anticipate a theory of defense that the cash constituted a repayment of the bribe money by Erd<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>man, especially when the defense, having been alerted to the possibility of making point by Moore\u2019s and Forman\u2019s testimony, declined the gambit and adhered to the contrary position \u2014 supported by the very testimony of Forman which, on the present theory, the jury would have had to reject, to wit, that he suspected Erdman had kept all or most of the money. Mindful as we are of the earnestness with which petitioner asserts his innocence and the peculiar seriousness of the conviction to him, we are satisfied the time for finality has come. He has had one evidentiary hearing in <em>coram nobis </em>and an opportunity for a second, as well as extensive consideration of many other points on which no such hearing was found to be warranted. The disbarment hearing, in which the New York Court of Appeals has afforded him a broad opportunity to relitigate the issue of his guilt, is still open. If he should obtain a favorable result in that proceeding, other methods for attempting to erase his federal conviction will be available to him. Our review of the record convinces us that he would gain nothing by our directing an evidentiary hearing on the instant petition even if we were now to entertain a request for such a hearing not made before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-16\">.

But certainly this other company that succeeded Gibraltar, that had no $17,000 in its account, did it? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">Q. So that you put up no money that could be traceable to you or no check that could be traceable to you in this business venture in the purchasing of an interest in the Ace Company of Maryland; is that correct?

And that is the same thing, wasn\u2019t it? A. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-28\">Q. In other words, Erdman, having stolen the money from Moore, you insisted that lie endorse these notes?</p>\n<p id=\"b802-29\">Mr. Hundley: I object to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-30\">The Court: Objection sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-31\">Q.

I told him I wanted that money back.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-36\">Q. That he was making good the $35,000 by endorsing the notes; isn\u2019t that right, this restitution? A. It could be.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-37\">Q. As a matter of fact, the last time you were asked a question that I can find, didn\u2019t you say on July 6th in words or substance that you had been in constant communication with Erdman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>up to July 6th and you were never able to get from him a satisfactory explanation of what he had done with that $35,000; is that right? A. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Q. And it is true today, isn\u2019t it, right up to now? Isn\u2019t that so? A. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"ADVc\">He also questioned Forman about the Ace investment; his suggestion that the bribe moneys sent over from England had found their way into Ace through the investment was met by a flat denial:</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Q. Isn\u2019t that where the $33,500 that went to Ace came from? A. No, that is not where that came from, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Instead of continuing this line of inquiry with the rather obvious query \u201cwhere did the money come from,\u201d Singer went on to a different matter. Counsel could well have thought it better to leave matters as they stood, rather than risk an unequivocal response concerning the precise source of the funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b803-16\">. Keogh\u2019s counsel has asked us to consider testimony on the subject given by Moore in the disbarment proceedings in December 1970. While we could hardly do this for purposes of reversing the district court, which had no opportunity to hear this, we will honor counsel\u2019s request since, in our view, the net effect of the material is to sustain the district judge. Moore testified that in late April 1961, he went down to Glen Burnie, Maryland, to complete the Ace deal, and then signed a check for $33,332.66 drawn on the Meadow Brook National Bank using Forman\u2019s name, since he had l\u2019eceived assurances from Forman that the latter was flying home from London and would bring the money to meet the check. On May 5, after Forman\u2019s return from England, Moore and Forman went to the Meadow Brook National Bank to make a cash deposit to cover the check; the deposit of $33,500 consisted of $20,000 which For-man had with him and of $13,350 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Moore obtained by cashing a check (or perhaps several) on one (or perhaps several) of his corporate accounts at the same bank; the source of this was a bank check which Forman had sent to Moore a few weeks before; Moore was never physically handed the $13,350 in cash. After being confronted with the excerpts of his trial testimony quoted above, he denied there was any inconsistency. When shown a statement of Forman at trial to the effect that Forman had not brought any money back with him from England, Moore claimed that the cash Forman brought to the bank came from one of Forman\u2019s American accounts to which he had been sending money from England. He was also confronted with an affidavit prepared for the Internal Revenue Service in 1965, in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">At the end of April 1961, Forman opened a checking account by mail at the Meadowbrook National Bank and I deposited $33,350.00 into this account on May 5, 1961. The deposit slip shows that this amount was in currency. Actually, immediately before this deposit, I cashed at the same bank two checks issued by Machinery Imports, Ltd. payable to me and drawn on an English bank. These checks totalled approximately $20,000.00. These cheeks represented the return to me of funds I had invested in Machinery Imports, Ltd. I added $1,350.00 in currency which I had withdrawn from the Charcoal Pit Restaurant which I then owned. Forman loaned me $12,000.00 in currency which he had personally borrowed from the attorney for Mills Bell-O-Matic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Moore claimed that he now was not sure whether Forman had brought $20,000 in cash or whether the $20,000 derived from checks issued by Machinery Imports, Ltd.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">So maybe he didn\u2019t have it in his pocket bulging out. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t recall whether the bank cashed the bank cheek or he gave me cash, but I know he put in twenty thousand. And the twelve thousand we had gotten back from New York from an attorney who handled the Mills Bell-O-Matic franchise which I had forgotten about * *. I can\u2019t remember everything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">While we agree with counsel that Moore\u2019s various versions are not wholly consistent, that is not too surprising after the lapse of nine years and it would be a long jump to infer from any of them that the true source of the $33,500 was Erdman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b804-13\">. Petitioner endeavors to answer this by contending that \u201cif the payment to For-man were anything else than unconditional, i. e., if it was a loan as Moore had at one time testified, then the pressure would still have been on Erdman to do something else for Moore, such as signing the restitution notes as guarantor.\u201d For the jury to accept this would have required them not only to reject Forman\u2019s testimony that he never could ascertain what Erdman had done with the bribe money but to believe that, after insisting on its return because of Erdman\u2019s nonperformance, Forman had agreed to receive it merely as a loan to Moore.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b805-5\">. We are not suggesting that counsel is under any obligation to urge only consistent theories of defense. Within the limits permitted by the evidence or any rational inferences therefrom, counsel is free to take any tack, however inconsistent it may be with his other lines of defense, which he thinks may raise a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. On the other hand, in endeavoring to determine after the event whether evidence could have been put \u201cto not insignificant use,\u201d a court cannot assume that counsel would deliberately have undercut a stronger theory of defense by pressing a less persuasive and inconsistent one, and certainly cannot expect the prosecution to have anticipated such a course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b805-10\">. Doubtless this is what Judge Weinfeld had in mind when he characterized Mr. Singer\u2019s affidavit as \u201cbeing significant for what it does not say.\u201d Suggestion that Erdman had returned the money to Moore and Forman would also have been inconsistent with the alternative theory of Keogh\u2019s counsel, namely, that the bribe money had never been raised at all.
