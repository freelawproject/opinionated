S.C. \u00a7 1052(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Appellant has attacked the board\u2019s decision on several grounds, most of them unsound. However, in the main, appellant contends that CURV\u2019 is not merely descriptive of permanent wave curling solutions. We agree, and, therefore, find it necessary to discuss only this narrow issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">As the board pointed out, a mark is descriptive if it describes the purpose for which the goods are to be used. In re W. A. Sheaffer Pen Co., 158 F.2d 390, 34 CCPA 771 (1946); In re General Permanent Wave Corporation, 118 F.2d 1020, 28 CCPA 1099 (1941). The question remains, however, whether CURV\u2019 is merely descriptive of the function of appellant\u2019s permanent wave curling solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-6\">The examiner took the position that \u201cCURV\u201d is the phonetic equivalent of the word \u201ccurve\u201d and that the word \u201ccurve\u201d and variations thereof are used to describe the appearance of women\u2019s hair waved in a particular manner. In support of this position, the examiner cited several magazine articles and advertisements which indicate that certain permanent waving solutions may be used to achieve the \u201cnew curly, curvy look,\u201d \u201ca permanent curve,\u201d \u201ccurved curls,\u201d etc. The board affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-7\">* * * since applicant\u2019s solutions are used in the process of imparting curves to the hair, we are clearly of the opinion that the word \u201cCURVE\u201d and the phonetic and hence legal equivalent thereof \u201cCURV\u201d are merely descriptive of such goods within the meaning of Section 2(e) (1) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1452-8\">With due respect to the examiner's and board\u2019s reasoning, we are unable to agree that the mark CURV\u2019 is so descriptive of the goods to which it is applied as to preclude registration. While it may be granted that CURV\u2019 does suggest a possible result of the intended use of the permanent wave curling solutions, it is not merely descriptive of the permanent wave curling solutions or the purpose for which such goods are to be used. As appellant points out, citing Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers, 240 U.S. 251, 36 S.Ct. 269, 60 L.Ed. 629 (1916), the word \u201ccurve\u201d is as suggestive of almost any article of manufacture (i. e., anything having or producing any type of curved shape) as it is of permanent wave curling solutions and their intended use. Indeed, the word \u201ccurve\u201d does not, in our opinion, in its primary significance indicate the purpose for which the permanent wave curling solutions are to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">Despite the advertisements cited by the examiner, we do not think the mark CURV\u2019 would convey any definite or immediate meaning to a person seeing it or hearing it. Those advertisements use numerous nouns and adjectives to \u201cdescribe\u201d the various hairdos (for example, \u201cwave,\u201d \u201cbrushy,\u201d \u201ccurly,\u201d \u201crippling,\u201d \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cstyle,\u201d etc.), many of them more suggestive than the word \u201ccurve.\u201d Yet, at least one of these words, \u201cstyle,\u201d has already been held not to be descriptive of hair setting lotions. Wella Corporation v. La Maur, Inc., 312 F.2d 831, 50 CCPA 916 (1963). We find the mark CURV\u2019 to be likewise not merely descriptive of appellant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-11\">Accordingly, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1451-29\">. Application serial No. 241,933 filed March 25, 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1452-13\">SKELTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AaA\">sitting by designation (dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-14\">I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, the examiner\u2019s refusal to register CURV\u2019 as a trademark for permanent wave curling solutions on the ground that the mark is merely descriptive of applicant\u2019s goods within the meaning of Section 2(e) (1) Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e), which was af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>firmed by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">The facts show that appellant advertised its products under the word CURV\u2019 in connection with its permanent wave curling solution. These advertisements emphasized that appellant\u2019s products produced permanent curves, such as, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-6\">Only Realistic provides you with four permanent curve formulations, \u201cpermanent curve formulations,\u201d \u201cpermanent curves for normal hair, for bleached hair,\u201d and \u201cpermanent curves for dry, dull hair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">Furthermore, it appears from the record that appellant's competitors used the words \u201ccurve\u201d and \u201ccurly\u201d in advertising hair styles created by them for their customers by using permanent wave solutions. In view of these facts, the examiner properly concluded that customers who wished to have a hair style permanent with curves or curls might well ask for a \u201cCURVE\u201d permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">The Board correctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1453-9\">It is well settled that a mark is descriptive not only if it describes the qualities, characteristics or properties of a product but also if it describes the purpose for which it is intended. See In re General Permanent Wave Corporation, 49 USPQ 184 [28 CCPA 1099, 118 F.2d 1020]; In re W. A. Sheaffer Pen Company, 72 USPQ 129 [34 CCPA 771, 158 F.2d 390 (CCPA 1946)]; and The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company v. United States Rubber Products, Inc., 51 USPQ 58 (Comr.1941). In view thereof, and since applicant\u2019s solutions are used in the process of imparting curves to the hair, we are clearly of the opinion that the word \u201cCURVE\u201d and the phonetic and hence legal equivalent thereof \u201cCURV\u201d are merely descriptive of such goods within the meaning of Section 2(e) (1) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1453-10\">I would affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
