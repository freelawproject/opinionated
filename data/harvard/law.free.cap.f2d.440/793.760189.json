We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-19\">Represented by court-appointed counsel, the appellant was convicted upon trial by jury of <em>selling </em>cocaine in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4705(a) and 7237(b) (1967), and of being a <em>transferror </em>of marihuana in violation of 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4742(a) and 7237(b) (1967). On direct appeal the judgment was affirmed. Halling v.

United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-21\"> With regard to the last contention, <em>Leary </em>is inapplicable to the offenses for which Hailing stands convicted.
