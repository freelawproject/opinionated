Appellants\u2019 mother, a citizen of the United States, moved to Mexico with her parents at age nineteen and subsequently married a Mexican national. Appellants were thereafter born in Mexico and have now attained the ages of twenty-one and twenty-seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number> It is undisputed that appellants cannot meet the requirements of citizenship as set out in the Nationality-Act of 1940, \u00a7 201 (now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401 (1970)). They assert, however, that \u00a7 201(g) (i) (now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1401(a) (7)) is unconstitutional since it does not discriminate between those who voluntarily leave the United States and those who leave involuntarily. This contention cannot be sustained. The Congress in defining citizenship has gone considerably beyond the express provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution does not mention the citizenship status of persons born outside the United States. <em>See </em>U.S.Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Thus the Congress has a completely free hand in defining citizenship as it relates to persons born abroad. <em>See </em>Gonzalez deLara v. United States, 439 F.2d 1316 (5th Cir. 1971); Uribe-Temblador v. Rosenberg, 423 F.2d 717 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Appellants\u2019 conviction, therefore, must be</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
