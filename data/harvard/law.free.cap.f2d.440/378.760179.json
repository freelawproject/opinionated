Schack has appealed from the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> damage suit against his former court-appointed counsel in state criminal proceedings. We affirm the ruling below.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-26\">The district court held a pre-trial evidentiary hearing at which only one witness was called, Appellee Starr. The appellant did not testify nor offer any other evidence in support of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-27\">The gist of appellant\u2019s complaint is that Attorney Starr unconscionably delayed final adjudication of his direct criminal appeals by failing to timely file the briefs. The appeals ultimately were affirmed after full appellate review. Schack v. State, Fla.App.1967, 199 So.2d 129; Schack v. State, Fla.App.1967, 201 So.2d 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The district court ordered dismissal of the appeal on two grounds: (1) that the appellant \u201ccannot establish, beyond mere speculation, that he suffered any damage as a result of the delays allegedly attributable to the defendant;\u201d and (2) that the defendant-appellee, as a duly appointed state officer, is immune from suit regarding matters relating to his official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Since we agree with the former holding we need not, and do not now decide whether court-appointed counsel has complete immunity from suit under the Civil Rights Act. Cf. Mulligan v. Schlachter, 6th Cir. 1968, 389 F.2d 231; Vance v. Robinson, W.D.N.C.1968, 292 F.Supp. 786. We find no merit in the appellant\u2019s contention that the proceedings below lacked fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the appellant\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-28\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
