Accordingly, we remanded the case to the District Court to take further evidence and make additional findings. On remand, the District Judge received the hospital records and the testimony of a physician who had attended Lunnermon before and just after the confession. On the basis of the additional evidence, the District Judge found that Lunnermon was in good physical condition at the time of the confession and had received no medication which would have affected in any way his will or his mental processes, 310 F.Supp. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-25\">Since the expanded record furnishes a basis for the District Court\u2019s findings, the findings are not clearly erroneous. We accept them and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
