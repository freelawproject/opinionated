While the evidence is in hot dispute in many respects, there certainly was substantial evidence from which the Board could have found (as it did) that an organizational campaign launched in the fall of 1966 by the United Mine Workers was met by respondents by surveillance of union members, coercive questioning of same, threats to close the mines, and threats to discharge and discharges for union activity. Such evidence constitutes substantial evidence to support the findings of the Board and warrant enforcement of its order. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-13\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
