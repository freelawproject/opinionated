The jury found him guilty in that he did, by threats of force, endeavor to intimidate and impede federal officers acting in their official capacities in conducting an investigation into possible violations of the Internal Revenue Laws of the United States, in violation of 26 U. S.C. \u00a7 7212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-23\">On May 11, 1970, in a wooded rural area of Jackson County, Alabama, Officers Barrett, Baker and Deal, Special Investigators with the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Internal Revenue Service, were prodigiously working in their official capacities of destroying an illegal whiskey distillery. They had broken up a few jugs and had pulled the drum still and drum capper out from under the rocks so they could cut it up with an axe or dynamite the whole works, when Baker, who had separated from Barrett and Deal, looked up. Ten yards away from him was a man with his right hand on the trigger portion of a shotgun. The shotgun was lev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>elled at him, Baker. The shotgun wielder opened the following conversation: \u201cWhat are you moving my stuff for?\u201d \u201cWhat stuff?\u201d \u201cThe drums * * * Get the hell out of here; you haven\u2019t got any business being here.\u201d Upon Baker being informed that if he did not leave, the stranger (later identified as Miles) would shoot him, Baker started to walk back toward the distillery but continued to engage Miles in conversation in order to warn the two other officers that they were not alone. At about this time, Deal emerged from the bushes and Baker noticed that Deal had his service revolver out and had Miles covered. There followed some screaming and yelling. Miles called out to someone named \u201cJack.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cCome down here they are trying to hijack us.\u201d The pace of the activity quickened. Barrett yelled to Miles to lay down his gun, that they were federal officers. Miles replied he did not care if they were. However, after the admonition was repeated several times and after Barrett had drawn his service revolver, Miles put down his gun. Barrett ran toward Miles telling him that he was under arrest and shouting, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2014 trying to shoot someone?\u201d, to which Miles responded, \u201cI thought you were trying to hijack my still.\u201d The three officers quickly converged on Miles, a scuffle ensued with all four men down on the ground rolling around, resulting in Miles being handcuffed. Officer Barrett then advised Miles of his constitutional rights by reading the customary printed warning form to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Appellant contends that the statement, \u201cI thought you were trying to hijack my still,\u201d in response to Barrett\u2019s question, was improperly admitted in evidence as this was custodial interrogation without the benefit of a Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warning. The sequence of events, timewise, fails to support appellant\u2019s incredible contention of unlawful custodial interrogation by the police. The record establishes, to the contrary, that until an instant or so before Miles was subdued, \u201cpolice custody\u201d existed only as an immediately-hoped-for element in the minds of the would-be subduers. By that time the several unsolicited outcries of Miles had already had their incriminating effect. Unless the restraint by law enforcement officers is a significant one, <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">.
