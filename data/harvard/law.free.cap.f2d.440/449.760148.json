The trial of the case began on January 7, 1964, and continued until January 22, 1964, when it was adjourned due to the illness of one of the defense attorneys. The trial was resumed on March 10, 1964, and testimony was concluded on March 20, 1964. The trial resulted in the conviction of the Appellant and one of the others. Both convictions were affirmed on appeal to this Court, United States v. Ayotte, 385 F.2d 988 (6th Cir. 1967), and the Appellant filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. During the pendency of his petition, the Supreme Court was advised by the Soliei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tor General that during the Government\u2019s investigation of the case, a conversation in which the Appellant had participated had been illegally monitored. Acting on this memorandum, the Supreme Court granted the petition for writ of certiorari, vacated this Court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969). Giordano v. United States, 394 U.S. 310, 89 S.Ct. 1163, 22 L.Ed.2d 297 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Alderman v. United States, <em>supra, </em>holds that once the Government is shown to have illegally monitored conversations of a defendant who was subsequently convicted, adversary hearings must be conducted to determine whether \u201cfruits\u201d of the unlawful surveillance contributed to, or were \u201crelevant\u201d to, the conviction. In so holding, the Supreme Court rejected the Government\u2019s argument that \u201carguable relevance\u201d should first be determined by the District Court, after an <em>m camera </em>examination of the Government\u2019s records of the surveillance. 394 U.S. at 181, 89 S.Ct. 961. \u201c[I]n our view,\u201d the Court held, \u201cthe task [of determining relevance] is too complex, and the margin for error too great, to rely wholly on the <em>in camera </em>judgment of the trial court to identify those records which might have contributed to the Government\u2019s case.\u201d 394 U.S. at 182, 89 S.Ct. at 971. In this adversary context, after an illegal search has come to light, the Government \u201chas the ultimate burden to show that its evidence is untainted.\u201d 394 U.S. at 183, 89 S.Ct. at 972. In order to insure that the hearings be more than a \u201cformality,\u201d and to enable the defendant to \u201cgo forward with specific evidence demonstrating taint,\u201d if he can, 394 U.S. at 183, 89 S.Ct. at 972, the Government is required to produce, for the defendant\u2019s examination, \u201ctranscripts of a defendant\u2019s own conversations and of those which took place on his premises.\u201d 394 U.S. at 184, 89 S.Ct. at 972. In addition, the Government must produce the federal agents responsible for investigating the case, so that the defendant may cross-examine them concerning the extent of dissemination. <em>See </em>United States v. Alderisio, 424 F.2d 20, 24 (10th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cArmed with the specified records of overheard conversations and with the right to cross-examine the appropriate officials in regard to the connection between those records and the case made against him, a defendant may need or be entitled to nothing else.\u201d 394 U.S. at 185, 89 S.Ct. at 973.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Upon remand, the Government disclosed to the Appellant and his counsel that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had electronically eavesdropped on a conversation in which the Appellant participated on February 10, 1964, which was during the recess period in the Appellant\u2019s original trial. The magnetic tape of this unlawfully monitored conversation had been destroyed, and the Government had not, apparently, transcribed it. The F.B.I. did furnish the Appellant with its \u201clog\u201d of the conversation. A \u201clog\u201d is a record which may contain summaries or paraphrased portions of dialogue of only parts of monitored conversations, and which may omit portions of monitored conversations, at the monitoring agent\u2019s discretion. At the remand hearing in the instant case, the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201clog\u201d of the February 10, 1964 conversation was shown to have contained only parts of conversations that were not relevant to the Appellant's conviction; the log omitted 20 to 25 minutes of conversation by the Appellant about the transaction for which he was later convicted. As an apparent attempt to supplement the deficient February 10, 1964 \u201clog,\u201d the F.B.I. also turned over to the Appellant a \u201clog\u201d of a conversation on February 11, 1964, between two <em>other </em>individuals, which contained <em>their </em>conversation <em>about </em>the Appellant\u2019s February 10, 1964 conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The Government\u2019s only witness at the remand hearing was Mr. Robert Keehan, who headed the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of the Appellant\u2019s case prior to trial. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>was taken off the ease by the time of the trial, and when the illegal monitoring took place, another federal investigator had been put in charge of the Appellant\u2019s case. Mr. Keehan testified that he was not aware of the existence of the \u201clogs\u201d until 1969, five years after the original trial, and that he did not secure any evidence against the Appellant as a result of the illegal surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The Appellant then testified, on his own behalf, that the February 10, 1964 \u201clog\u201d did omit reference to 20 to 25 minutes of conversation about the transaction for which he was later convicted. Then, in proceedings before the court, Appellant\u2019s counsel pointed out that a month after the illegal monitoring, on March 10, 1964, when the trial of the Appellant\u2019s ease was resumed, the Government put on a substantial amount of its case, including 20 witnesses, some of whom may have been secured through the illegal monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On this record, the District Court held that the Government had borne its \u201cultimate burden of persuasion\u201d that the evidence leading to the Appellant\u2019s conviction was untainted. The court then entered a new judgment of conviction and sentence, and the Appellant brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Appellant argues that under the circumstances of this case, the Government did not satisfy the disclosure requirements of <em>Alderman. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The inquiry into relevance required by <em>Alderman </em>presupposes that the Government will supply the defendant with all its records of illegally monitored conversations. Where the actual magnetic tapes of monitored conversations have been destroyed, and transcripts thereof were not made, incomplete substitutes, such as \u201clogs,\u201d have been found sufficient only where the Government was able to prove, by testimony or otherwise, that the \u201clogs\u201d were the only records of the conversations available to the agents who investigated the case, and that the \u201cmonitors,\u201d the agents responsible for preparing the \u201clogs\u201d from the tapes, did not communicate, orally or otherwise, any information other than that contained in the \u201clogs\u201d to those investigating the case. <em>See </em>United States v. Clay, 430 F.2d 165, 168-170 nn. 6, 8 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. granted, 400 U.S. 990, 91 S.Ct. 457, 27 L.Ed.2d 438; Baker v. United States, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 126, 430 F.2d 499, 500 n. 4 and accompanying text, 501 n. 7 (1970); United States v. Alderisio, 424 F.2d 20 (10th Cir. 1970). Clearly, if the Government can show that \u201clogs\u201d of a monitored conversation were the only records of it that were available to the agents who investigated the case, and that the \u201clogs\u201d do not contain matter prejudicial to the defendant, then the Government is entitled to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">In the instant case, the record does not disclose whether information other than that disclosed in the \u201clogs\u201d was transmitted to those responsible for investigating the Appellant\u2019s case. The Government did not call the \u201cmonitors\u201d as witnesses, hence, there is no evidence whether they communicated material to the investigators that was not contained in the \u201clogs.\u201d Nor did the Government produce, for the defendant to cross-examine, the agent in charge when the illegal monitoring took place. Only he could testify as to the extent of dissemination of whatever illegal surveillance that was communicated to him. In addition to the complete records of the surveillance, the defendant had \u201cthe right to cross-examine the appropriate officials in regard to the connection between those records and the case made against him.\u201d 394 U.S. at 185, 89 S.Ct. at 973. The case must be remanded to allow the Appellant to cross-examine these individuals. If the Government does not come forward with them, then the District Court will have no alternative but to dismiss the proceeding and enter judgment for the Appellant. 394 U.S. at 184, 89 S.Ct. 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The case is remanded for the limited purposes designated herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
