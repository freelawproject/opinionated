We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">Private Davenport filed three successive applications under applicable Army regulations. At first he sought to be assigned to non-combatant duties. When this request was denied he sought discharge as a conscientious objector. This request was fully considered and denied after the Conscientious Objector Review Board concluded that Davenport \u201cdoes not truly hold views against participation in war in any form which are derived from religious training and belief.\u201d The third application followed two months later. It contained no new material emanating from Davenport. It was not required to be referred to the Conscientious Objector Review Board, and it was denied, at least in part, on the basis of the earlier proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">We think that there was a basis in fact for the conclusion of the Conscientious Objector Review Board. Our examination of the record discloses evidence that Davenport\u2019s conscientious objection to war was limited to the war in Vietnam and that his objection stemmed from political considerations and not from his religious training and belief. Either ground would be a proper reason to deny him status as a conscientious objector. Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971); United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">We find no merit in Davenport\u2019s contentions that his applications were not considered in compliance with Army regulations establishing the procedure for applications for discharge, consideration of applications and the granting of discharges. We also find no other error.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
