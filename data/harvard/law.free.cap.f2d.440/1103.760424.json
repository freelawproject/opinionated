Wilson and Ruby J. Wilson appeal following conviction and sentence for violations of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7201 and \u00a7 7206(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They contend that the District Court erroneously denied their motion to suppress the evidentiary fruits of an allegedly illegal governmental seizure and interrogation. Moreover, they claim that because the Government failed to prove willfulness, the court erroneously denied their motions for new trial and for acquittal. We dismiss the appeal as to Ray F. Wilson and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as to Ruby J. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">After a jury found Ray F. Wilson guilty of six counts of income tax evasion and failure to report income, the District Judge orally imposed sentence from the bench. Subsequently he published a written judgment reiterating his oral pronouncement. On both occasions the judge sentenced Wilson on three counts but imposed no sentence \u201cat this time\u201d on the other three. The Government argues that the judge\u2019s action has made Ray Wilson\u2019s appeal premature: there has been no final judgment with regard to three counts for which Wilson has been found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">In criminal cases the sentence is the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d from which appeals may be taken. Parr v. United States, 1956, 351 U.S. 513, 518, 76 S.Ct. 912, 100 L.Ed. 1377; Berman v. United States, 1937, 302 U.S. 211, 212, 58 S.Ct. 164, 82 L.Ed. 204; Yeloushan v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 313 F.2d 303, 304, cert. denied, 373 U.S. 912, 83 S.Ct. 1301, 10 L.Ed.2d 413; <em>see </em>Corey v. United States, 1963, 375 U.S. 169, 172, 84 S.Ct. 298, 11 L.Ed.2d 299; United States v. Hark, 1944, 320 U.S. 531, 534, 64 S.Ct. 359, 88 L.Ed. 290. Only probation comporting with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3651 obviates the necessity for imposition or execution of sentence to create a final decree in criminal proceedings. <em>See, e. g., </em>Andrews v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 334, 340, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 10 L.Ed.2d 383. Cognizant of the problems of piecemeal litigation, the Supreme Court has often emphasized the prerequisite of finality for appeal. See id. at 340, 83 S.Ct. 1236. Furthermore, when a multi-count indictment and verdict are involved, it is essential for post-conviction review that the record disclose the precise sentence for each count. White v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 822, 826. This Court has strongly expressed its disapproval of general sentences in such instances. <em>E. g., </em>Putt v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 392 F.2d 64, 67, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 929, 89 S.Ct. 264, 21 L.Ed.2d 266; Benson v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 288, 292; <em>see </em>Stonecipher v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 745, 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">In light of these authorities, it becomes clear that Ray Wilson has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>received a final judgment entitling him to appellate review. <em>See </em>Carroll v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 394, 412, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442; 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. By no stretch of the imagination can a sentence, or fine, imposed on three counts of a six-count conviction be equated with a sentence imposed on all six counts. Nor can the trial judge\u2019s decision to withhold sentence on three counts be categorized as probation. Finally, the specific language of the District Court\u2019s judgment pretermits our consideration of the sentence as \u201cgeneral.\u201d Consequently, we dismiss Ray F. Wilson\u2019s appeal and remand this cause to the District Court for resentencing on all six counts. <em>See </em>White v. United States, <em>supra </em>396 F.2d at 825-826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"> Ruby J. Wilson, however, has satisfied the requirements of 28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1291, for the District Judge imposed specific fines on all six counts for which she was convicted. Having considered the record and the District Court\u2019s careful findings of fact and conclusions of law, we conclude that Mrs. Wilson\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied. United States v. Prudden, 5 Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 1021, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 831, 91 S.Ct. 62, 27 L.Ed.2d 62; <em>see </em>United States v. Tonahill, 5 Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 1042, 1044-1045; Marcus v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 752, 756. Furthermore, examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the court committed no error in denying her motions for new trial and for acquittal on the ground that the Government had failed to prove willfulness. <em>See </em>United States v. Jernigan, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 471, 473, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 927, 90 S.Ct. 262, 24 L.Ed.2d 225; Graves v. United States, 10 Cir. 1951, 191 F.2d 579, 582; cf. Marcus v. United States, <em>supra, </em>422 F.2d at 755. <em>See also </em>United States v. Kolsky, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1111, 1113; United States v. Robertson, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 873, 875-876; Hale v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 147, 149, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 902, 90 S.Ct. 216, 24 L.Ed.2d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">The judgment as to Ruby J. Wilson is Affirmed. The appeal of Ray F.
