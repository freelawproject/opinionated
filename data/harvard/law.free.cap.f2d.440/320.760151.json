Mathews, damages for wages withheld in violation of the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. (1964). The action was tried to a jury, which found that Mathews had underpaid Clinger and McClanahan in the amounts of $3,200 and $6,445.43, respectively, and judgments were entered accordingly. Thereafter, the District Court refused to award Clinger and McClanahan liquidated damages or pre-judgment interest on the back-pay award. Clinger and Mc-Clanahan appealed, asserting that the District Court erred in denying their claims for liquidated damages and prejudgment interest. The Secretary of Labor has filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae </em>on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"> Prior to the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, an employer was without exception liable to his employees for liquidated damages equal to, and in addition to, any minimum or overtime wages withheld in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cAny employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or section 207 of this title [the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions] shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, <em>and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\u201d </em>[emphasis added.] 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Overnight Motor Company v. Missel, 316 U.S. 572, 581-584, 62 S.Ct. 1216, 86 L.Ed. 1682 (1942). Section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (1964), provides a dispensation from the mandatory liability for liquidated damages under certain circumstances. Under section 11, where an employer \u201cshows to the satisfaction of the court\u201d that his violation was \u201cin good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\u201d then the court \u201cmay, in its sound discretion,\u201d award a lesser amount or no liquidated damages at all.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since an award of liquidated damages is left to the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the court, it is to be granted, or denied, by the court, as opposed to the jury. Martin v. Detroit Marine Terminals, Inc., 189 F.Supp. 579 (E.D.Mich.1960). For the court\u2019s discretion to be invoked, however, the delinquent employer must sustain a \u201cplain and substantial burden of persuading the court by proof that his failure to obey the statute was both in good faith and predicated upon such reasonable grounds that it would be unfair to impose upon him more than a compensatory verdict.\u201d Rothman v. Publicker Industries, Inc., 201 F.2d 618, 620 (3d Cir. 1953); Wright v. Carrigg, 275 F.2d 448, 449 (4th Cir. 1960); Caserta v. Home Lines Agency, Inc., 273 F.2d 943, 947 (2d Cir. 1959). In the absence of such proof a District Court has no power or discretion to reduce an employer\u2019s liability for the equivalent of double unpaid wages. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 790.15, 790.-22(c) (Jan. 1, 1970 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">After the jury rendered its verdict for the Appellants in the amounts of their unpaid back wages, the Appellants moved the District Court to award them liquidated damages. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is that the District Court applied the wrong legal standard in its determination of whether they were entitled to liquidated damages. In its memorandum and order, the District Court held that an employer\u2019s failure to pay the minimum wage is \u201conly punishable via liquidated damages when it is malicious and knowingly oppressive.\u201d Elaborating, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">\u201cIt is the court\u2019s abiding conviction that liquidated damages should only be granted where a recalcitrant employer retains fair compensation out of malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">It is well established that \u201cliquidated damages for failure to pay the minimum wages under sections 6(a) and 7(a) are compensation, not a penalty or punishment.\u201d Overnight Motor Company v. Missel, 316 U.S. 572, 583, 62 S.Ct. 1216, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>86 L.Ed. 1682 (1942). As we have indicated, where an employer sustains a substantial burden of proving not only that his violation was in \u201cgood faith,\u201d but also that he had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for believing that he was not violating the Act, the District Court nevertheless may award full liquidated damages equal to, and in addition to, the unpaid back wages. We find the District Court erred in stating that liquidated damages are to be awarded only where the violation is \u201cmalicious and knowingly oppressive\u201d and \u201conly * * * against the most outrageous violators of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Appellants have not included in the record on appeal, a transcript of the evidence before the District Court. We are therefore unable to review their arguments based on prejudice resulting from the District Court\u2019s application of the wrong legal standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 10, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Drybrough v. Ware, 111 F.2d 548, 550 (6th Cir. 1940). <em>See </em>Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 116, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). <em>See generally, </em>9 Moore, Federal Practice, Par. 210.05 (2d ed. 1970). Appellants argue that a transcript of the evidence is unnecessary because a particular inconsistency between the jury\u2019s response to interrogatories and the District Court\u2019s judgment shows error <em>as a matter of law </em>in refusing to award liquidated damages. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">The complaint in this case sought damages for three years\u2019 unpaid back wages. Under the applicable statute of limitations, Section 6(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a), as amended (1966), an employee may not recover damages for more than two years\u2019 unpaid wages unless his employer\u2019s violation was \u201cwillful.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where the employer\u2019s violation was \u201cwillful,\u201d the employee may recover for three years\u2019 back wages. The issue of the Appellee\u2019s willfulness was presented to the jury by means of the following interrogatories :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATv\">1. Do you believe that the defendant, Mathews, underpaid [the plaintiff] either for straight time or overtime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-16\">Answer Yes- No-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-17\">\u201c2. If your answer to the above interrogatory, No. 1, is \u2018yes,\u2019 do you believe that the underpayment of [the plaintiff] was wilful [sic] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-18\">Answer Yes- No-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">The jury answered each interrogatory in the affirmative, indicating its finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that the Appellants were willfully underpaid by the Appellee. The Appellants argue that in view of the jury finding of \u201cwillfulness,\u201d the District Court erred as a matter of law in refusing to award liquidated damages, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (1964). The Appellee argues, on the other hand, that the jury finding of willfulness was totally contrary to the evidence, that the District Court erred in allowing the finding \u2014 and the three-year award- \u2014 to stand, and that the District Court\u2019s refusal to award liquidated damages was consistent with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The record before us does not disclose, as the Appellants suggest, that the District Court erred as a matter of law in refusing to award liquidated damages. We have no transcript of evidence, or adequate record thereof, Rule 10, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the findings of the District Court do not state facts that undermine its refusal to award liquidated damages as a matter of law. Nor does the record contain facts to support the Appellee\u2019s contention that the judgment of the District Court was supported by sufficient evidence and in accordance with law. Having applied the wrong legal standard, the District Court made no findings with regard to the relevant issues, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d Finding \u201cnothing in the evidence or the record that shows that he [the Appellee] withheld minimum and overtime compensation with a black heart and tyrannical hand,\u201d the District Court summarily dismissed the Appellants\u2019 claims for liquidated damages, without probing into the facts to determine whether the proper statutory basis for doing so existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">With a record so incomplete, we are unable to determine whether, as the Appellants argue, the District Court was wrong in not awarding liquidated damages and correct in not ruling as a matter of law that the period of limitations was two years. Logically it might be just as true that, as the Appellee argues, the court was correct in not awarding liquidated damages, and wrong in not granting the Appellee judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the limitations issue. Lacking an adequate transcript, and relevant findings by the trial judge, we have no alternative but to vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment on this issue, and remand the cause for relevant and appropriate findings. <em>See </em>Hatahley v. United States, 351 U.S. 173, 182, 76 S.Ct. 745, 100 L.Ed. 1065 (1956) ; United States v. Claycraft Company, 408 F.2d 366 (6th Cir. 1969); United States v. Tuschman, 405 F.2d 688, 690-691 (6th Cir. 1969); Traylor v. United States, 396 F.2d 837, 840 (6th Cir. 1968); S. S. Silverblatt, Inc. v. United States, 353 F.2d 545, 549-550 (5th Cir. 1965). <em>See generally </em>5 Moore, Federal Practice, Par. 52.-06 [1] &amp; [2] (2d ed. 1968. If, upon a review of the record in its entirety, or after such proceedings as it may deem necessary, the District Court remains of the belief that liquidated damages should not be awarded, then its findings and conclusions must show that the Appellee sustained his plain and substantial burden of <em>proving \u201cgood </em>faith\u201d and \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d Rule 52, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The District Court denied the Appellants\u2019 request for pre-judgment interest from the dates their respective claims accrued. The Appellants argue that pre-judgment interest is recoverable in employee wage suits, and that the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 makes no provision for interest on amounts recovered as restitution of unpaid back wages, but this is not dispositive of the issue. Rodgers v. United States, 332 U.S. 371, 373, 68 S.Ct. 57, 92 L.Ed. 3 (1947).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">\u201cThere is no language in the Agricultural Adjustment Act or in any other act of Congress which specifically allows or forbids interest on penalties such as these prior to judgment. But the failure to mention interest in statutes which create obligations has not been interpreted by this Court as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>manifesting an unequivocal congressional purpose that the obligation shall not bear interest.\u201d [Citations omitted.] <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Prior to the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, which relieved delinquent employers of having the pay liquidated damages in addition to restitution of unpaid back wages under certain limited circumstances, the Supreme Court held that interest was not recoverable in employee wage actions. The mandatory liquidated damages required by the Fair Labor Standards Act were, at least in part, compensatory to the employee for interest he would have had to pay on obligations during the period his wages were unlawfully withheld, the Court reasoned. Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O\u2019Neil, 324 U.S. 697, 707-714, 65 S.Ct. 895, 89 L.Ed. 1296 (1945). To allow interest on the amount of the damages recovered, therefore, would be tantamount to allowing \u201cinterest on interest.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cSince Congress has seen fit to fix the sums recoverable for delay, it is inconsistent with Congressional intent to grant recovery of interest on such sums in view of the fact that interest is customarily allowed as compensation for delay in payment. To allow an employee to recover the basic statutory wage <em>and </em>liquidated damages, with interest, would have the effect of giving an employee double compensation for damages arising from delay in the payment of the basic minimum wages. Allowance of interest on minimum wages <em>and </em>liquidated damages recoverable under Section 16(b) tends to produce the undesirable result of allowing interest on interest. Congress by enumerating the sums recoverable in an action under \u00a7 16(b) meant to preclude recovery of interest on minimum wages <em>and </em>liquidated damages.\u201d 342 U.S. at 715-716, 65 S.Ct. at 906. [Citations omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Supreme Court has not decided, however, whether pre-judgment interest is to be awarded where, under Section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, a court awards no liquidated damages, and the lower federal courts of appeals are in disagreement. <em>Compare </em>Holtville Alfalfa Mills, Inc. v. Wyatt, 230 F.2d 398, 401 (9th Cir 1955) (pre-judgment interest allowable), <em>and, </em>Landaas v. Canister Company, 188 F.2d 768, 772 (3d Cir. 1951) (pre-judgment interest not recoverable) .</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">There are compelling reasons why pre-judgment interest should be recoverable where, in its discretion, the district court has awarded less than the maximum amount of liquidated damages. It is well settled that \u201cone for whose financial advantage an obligation was assumed or imposed, and who has suffered actual money damages by another\u2019s breach of that obligation should fairly be compensated for the loss thereby sustained.\u201d Rodgers v. United States, <em>supra, </em>332 U.S. <em>at </em>373, 68 S.Ct. at 7. In the closely analagous situation of back pay awards in labor cases, this Court and five other courts of appeals have applied this principle so as to allow interest from the time the claims accrued. <em>See </em>Philip Carey Mfg. Co., Miami Cabinet Div. v. NLRB, 331 F.2d 720, 729-731 (6th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, International Union, United Auto. Aerospace and Agr. Implement Workers of America, UAW-AFL-CIO v. Philip Carey Mfg. Co., Miami Cabinet Division, 379 U.S. 888, 85 S.Ct. 159, 13 L.Ed.2d 92; Marshfield Steel Company v. NLRB, 324 F.2d 333, 338 (8th Cir. 1963); Reserve Supply Corp. of L. I., Inc. v. NLRB, 317 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1963); International Brotherhood of Operative Potters, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 320 F.2d 757 (1963); NLRB v. Globe Products Corporation, 322 F.2d 694 (4th Cir. 1963); Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. v. NLRB, 324 F.2d 132, 137 (7th Cir. 1963). The reasoning of our Court in <em>Philip Carey, supra, </em>is particularly relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201cIt is recognized under our legal system that wage earners are heavily dependent upon wages, which more often than not constitute the sole resource to purchase the necessities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>life from day to day. For example, many states have enacted statutes regulating the time of payment of wages. The National Bankruptcy Act accords priority to wage claims. Many wage-earners who are deprived of their wages doubtlessly find it necessary to borrow money to sustain themselves and their families, paying rates of interest at six per cent or higher.\u201d 331 F.2d at 730 [citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">While wage earners who are being unlawfully deprived of a minimum wage are borrowing money to sustain themselves, and paying interest, the noncomplying employer, however innocent, is benefitting from his violations, since he has the use of his employee\u2019s money. Unless the delinquent employer is required to restore his employee to the position he would have been in had there been no violation, via an award of liquidated damages or interest on the back wage award, the employer will thereby have been unjustly enriched by his own violation at his employee\u2019s expense. Surely Congress did not intend this result, and we will not impose it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On remand if the District Court, upon a proper showing and in its sound discretion, remains of the belief that liquidated damages are wholly inappropriate, then it must award interest on back pay from the date the claims accrued. In the alternative, if the District Court awards liquidated damages, as it may under Section 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (1964), the award must at least equal the amount of interest that would have been due the Appellants from the date their claims for unpaid back wages accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">One final argument advanced by the Appellants is that the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees was insufficient. Upon review of the affidavits and the judgment, however, we are unable to find that the court abused its discretion in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The judgment of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed with respect to its awards of back pay and attorney\u2019s fees. That part of the judgment denying liquidated damages and pre-judgment interest is vacated, and this cause is remanded for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (1964) provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">In any action commenced prior to or on or after May 14, 1947 to recover unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime compensation, or liquidated damages, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, if the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216(b) of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">. The Appellants claim that they \u201ccould not afford a four-day transcript\u201d of the trial proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b) (1964), however, granted them the right to a transcript at Government expense in the event their appeal were found to be nonfrivolous, and they were genuinely unable to pay the expenses of a transcript. So far as the incomplete record discloses, the Appellants made no motion for free transcript under section 1915(b) or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The Secretary of Labor states, and the Appellants suggest, that \u201cit is manifest that defendant failed to present any proof which would provide the trial court with discretion to withhold liquidated damages. Not only was there nothing in this record to warrant a \u2018good faith\u2019 belief that the employees did not have to be paid in accordance with the Act\u2019s requirements, but * * * the circumstances were such that defendant either knew or should have known that he was violating the Act.\u201d Naturally, in the absence of a transcript, such a failure of proof is not \u201cmanifest,\u201d and the Appellants\u2019 arguments based upon the Appellee\u2019s failure to prove \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201creasonable grounds\u201d are wholly unreviewable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-21\">. The term \u201cwillful\u201d is not defined in the statute. The District Court defined the term in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-22\">\u201cYou will hear me use the term \u2018willful\u2019 in this instruction. Now, to give you a short definition of \u2018willfully,\u2019 an act is done willfully if done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with a bad purpose, either to disobey or to disregard the law. I think you pretty well understand that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">The issue whether this was a proper definition for the purpose of section 255 (a) is not before the Court, and we intimate no decision upon it. <em>See </em>2 CCH Lab.L.Rep., Par. 25,948 <em>at </em>40,225.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">.
