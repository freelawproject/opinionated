Toler was charged in an information with violating 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 408(c) by filing a false medical report in connection with a claim for Social Security benefits. Following a jury trial in the District Court he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">In reviewing the facts linking the defendant with the report the prosecutor in closing rebuttal argument said \u2014 without objection of any kind \u2014 that \u201cat no time has he denied filing it.\u201d Toler now urges for the first time that this remark constitutes prejudicial error since the jury could have construed it as a comment on the failure of the defendant to testify in his own behalf. We disagree with this contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-17\">The uneontradicted testimony of the investigator who questioned Toler before the trial \u2014 under circumstances to which no criticism has been urged \u2014 was categorical that he admitted having sent the spurious document to both the regional office and the hearing examiner who reviewed his claim. Rather than denying at that time the submission of the medical report proved independently to have been false, he admitted it. Under such circumstances the government was justified in refuting the defense contention that there was nothing to connect the defendant with the report by commenting, not on defendant\u2019s failure to testify, but rather on the uncontradicted state of the evidence. United States v. Cerullo, 5 Cir., 1970, 435 F.2d 142; Samuels v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 964, cert. denied, 1969, 393 U.S. 1021, 89 S.Ct. 630, 21 L.Ed.2d 566; Davis v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 357 F.2d 438, cert. denied, 1966, 385 U.S. 927, 87 S.Ct. 284, 17 L.Ed.2d 210 and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-18\">Moreover, if \u2014 and the if is a very big one \u2014 this was such a comment, his failure to object to the remark at the trial when the Judge could have taken effective corrective action leaves him in the predicament of demonstrating it was so palpably flagrant as to affect his substantial rights and constitute plain error under F.R.Crim.P. 52(b). We cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>characterize it as such, particularly in light of the trial court\u2019s'unequivocal positive instruction to the jury that they could in no -way take into account the failure of the defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
