See IUERMW [Tiidee Products] v. NLRB, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 249, 426 F.2d 1243, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 950, 91 S.Ct. 239, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1970). The instant charges resulted from a series of actions taken by the Company, through its president Irving Hollander, immediately following the Board\u2019s hearing in the prior case. These included the promulgation of no-solicitation and no-distribution rules, the unilateral adoption of comprehensive work rules, and the interrogation and discharge of certain employees for what the Board found to be sympathy with the union. Because of these actions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Board concluded that the Company had violated Section 8(a) (1), (3), (4), and (5) of the Act. We have given careful consideration to the arguments on which the Company bases its challenge to the Board\u2019s findings, including the assertion that the Company\u2019s actions against specific employees were justified by considerations of economy and efficiency. We conclude, however, that the findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence of record. There was ample evidence from which the Board could reasonably conclude that the disciplinary measures invoked by Hollander were motivated by his desire to punish workers for pro-union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The Board\u2019s application for enforcement of the order as issued is granted. As to the Union\u2019s petition for review, the ease is remanded to the Board for further consideration of the make-whole claim in light of our April 3 decision in <em>Tiidee I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b357-6\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqP\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">I concur in the conclusion that the findings of the Board are sustained by satisfactory evidence, however I dissent as to the remand for further consideration by the Board as to the make-whole claim requested by the Union by way of additional remedial relief. First, the Board already has ample power under the remand by the majority in <em>Tiidee I </em>to grant all necessary remedial relief that is requested here; and secondly, in my opinion, this is not as strong a case as <em>Tiidee I </em>for the make-whole relief requested as there is not present here any general refusal to recognize and bargain with the certified union. In my view, the majority are remanding the case here on the remedial relief question principally because of the cumulative effect of the facts here when same are considered jointly with those in <em>Tiidee I. </em>I view this case strictly and solely on its own facts and would also affirm the Board\u2019s denial of further remedial relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
