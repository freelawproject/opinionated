App. \u00a7 462. The issue presented is whether a Selective Service registrant\u2019s claim for conscientious objector classification made for the first time after receipt of an Order to Report for Induction may be a \u201cchange in status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control\u201d within the meaning of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. The district court held that such a belated claim cannot, as a matter of law, be such a change of status. We hold to the contrary, and reverse Nordlof\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Nordlof registered for the draft November 18, 1963, and was classified I-A. He was later reclassified II-S, student deferment, until August, 1968, when he was reclassified I-A. His appeal from that classification was denied. Thereafter he was ordered to report for induction on October 28, 1968. He reported, but refused to submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">At the induction center, Nordlof wrote and presented to a Selective Service System official a six-page statement containing his claim of conscientious objection to war. Presumably Nordlof\u2019s claim did not reach, and was not considered by, his local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">On July 1, 1969, Nordlof was indicted for failure to submit to induction. Before his trial Nordlof moved for remandment to the local board for its determination on his conscientious objection claim. The motion was denied. At trial, his defense testimony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in support of his conscientious objection claim was stricken on the ground that Selective Service Regulation \u00a7 1625.2 precludes a registrant from asserting his conscientious objection status after receipt of an order to report for induction. The authority for the district court\u2019s ruling was this court\u2019s decision in Porter v. United States, 334 F.2d 792 (7th Cir. 1964). Nordlof\u2019s main challenge is with respect to the court\u2019s determination of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Section 1625.2 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-17\">* * * The classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Order to Report for Induction * * * unless the local board first specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control. 32 C. F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">The courts of appeals are divided in their holdings on whether this section permits a local board to reopen a regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>trant\u2019s classification after receipt of a post-induction order conscientious objection claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court is in the negative camp by virtue of United States v. Schoebel, 201 F.2d 31 (7th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In <em>Schoebel </em>this court decided conscientious objections resulting from \u201cthe promptings of a registrant\u2019s conscience\u201d cannot be a \u201cchange in * * * status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control;\u201d and accordingly that Sehoebel\u2019s board could not have reopened his classification under \u00a7 1625.2 on his claim made for the first time after the order to report for induction. The decision in Porter v. United States, 334 F.2d 792 (7th Cir. 1964), which the district court relied on in its decision against Nordlof, was based on authority of <em>Schoebel, </em>as was the earlier case of United States v. Porter, 314 F.2d 833 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Nordlof urges that <em>Schoebel </em>should be overruled. He relies principally upon the holding of the Second Circuit in United States v. Gearey, 368 F.2d 144 (2nd Cir. 1966). In <em>Gearey, </em>reaffirmed in United States v. Stafford, 389 F.2d 215 (2nd Cir. 1968), the court held that a conscientious objector claim can \u201cmature\u201d or \u201ccrystallize\u201d after a registrant has received his notice to report for induction, and that this may be a change in status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant has no control within the meaning of \u00a7 1625.2, thereby entitling him to a reopening of his classification. This holding was followed by the recent Third Circuit decision in Scott v. Commanding Officer (Volatile), 431 F.2d 1132 (3rd Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The government argues, on the other hand, that the ruling in <em>Schoebel </em>is sound and should not be overturned. It relies heavily upon the reasoning in the Ninth Circuit's recent <em>en banc </em>decision (five of thirteen judges dissenting) in Ehlert v. United States, 422 F.2d 332 (1970). The court in <em>Ehlert </em>considered, but declined to follow, the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Gearey. </em>The court stated that Ehlert as a rational human being is in \u201ccomplete charge of his own thinking\u201d and therefore a belated claim for conscientious objector classification is a circumstance within his control. The court also thought that conscientious objection claims pose more difficulty of adjudication for boards than other claims because of the necessity of determining sincerity with a depth inquiry into claimant\u2019s family life, religious training, etc. The court went on to say that if it were to follow <em>Gearey </em>the local board would be required to determine when the registrant\u2019s beliefs crystallized, or more accurately, when the registrant claims that his beliefs crystallized; and that such a procedure would be unduly burdensome for local boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">We cannot accept the reasoning of the <em>Ehlert </em>court. Even assuming that the majority is correct in stating that man is in complete charge of his own thinking, it does not follow that man can control his conscience. We think conscience is not the same as thinking. Webster defines conscience as \u201ca knowledge or feeling of right and wrong, with a compulsion to do right; moral judgment that prohibits or opposes the violation of a previously recognized ethical principle.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Implicit in this definition is the notion that the dictates of conscience are involuntary and compulsory and outside the control of the holder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the beliefs. We can perhaps control our thinking concerning whether and to what extent a moral duty exists prior to the operation of conscience on a moral issue. We can also control, when faced with the moral issue, whether or not to follow the dictates of conscience. But, as Kant points out, when a moral issue presents itself and demands action, \u201cthen conscience speaks involuntarily and inevitably.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This view that conscience is beyond the control of its subject appears to us as the better view, and is borne out by eminent philosophical and theological authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">We therefore favor the views of Judge Seitz, expressed in Scott: \u201cone cannot sincerely turn his conscience on and off at will;\u201d and of Judge Merrill in his dissent in <em>Ehlert: </em>\u201cConscientious objection, in truth, is a contradiction of control. Just as a conviction honestly dictated by conscience cannot be banished at the will of the holder, so, conversely, a belief conveniently subject to the control of the holder is not conscientiously entertained.\u201d 422 F.2d at 339. We conclude that conscience is beyond the control of the registrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">It is our further view that a conscientious objection belief may mature and crystallize after the registrant receives his Order to Report for Induction. The general formation of conscience is said by Freud to commence early in childhood, and development is a continuous process of meeting particular moral decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The late Paul Tillich said \u201cThe constitution of a person as a person never comes to an end during his whole life process,\u201d it is a \u201cprocess of self-integration * * * a continuous struggle with disintegration,\u201d in which he is free to develop \u201cthe moral side of the function of self-integration\u201d in the totality of acts which face him in life.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This view is supported by other eminent authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\"> It follows that a conscientious objection to war, while developing before, can mature after, a registrant has received an Order to Report for Induction. As Judge Seitz in <em>Scott </em>states: \u201cAlthough a registrant may have no conscientious objector leanings at all when he registers, his beliefs may later begin to evolve toward conscientious objection.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This view is impliedly accepted by the Supreme Court in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 336, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970). The term of this particular development can be due, in part, to the receipt of the notice itself. As Judge Kaufman in <em>Gearey, </em>368 F.2d at 150, says: \u201cRealization that induction is pending, and that he may soon be asked to take another\u2019s life, may cause a young man finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>to crystallize and articulate his once vague sentiments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We think Nordlof\u2019s readings in the Bible and his discussions with Mr. Guzman could have given him a view different from what he previously had concerning his duty with respect to war. His conscience then could have begun to form with respect to the particular moral issue that was facing him, and might have reached its fruition only when his induction was at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">We conclude that crystallization of conscientious objection beliefs may be a change in status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control. We therefore overrule <em>Schoebel </em>as the law of this circuit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">We are not impressed by the government\u2019s argument that, practically speaking, belated crystallization is \u201chighly improbable if not impossible.\u201d We cannot speculate that Nordlof\u2019s board upon consideration of his claim would view it as \u201chighly improbable.\u201d Moreover, such a determination goes to the merits of Nordlof\u2019s claims, which are not to be considered unless a reopening is granted. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 416-418, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970); United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246, 248-249 (7th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Nor do we think the government is aided by the fact that once a claimant is inducted he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to file a conscientious objection claim which, if he persuades the military to grant it, will result in discharge from combat service. This post-induction process effectually presupposes that Nordlof\u2019s claim is not sincere, for if he sincerely objected to participation in war, he would not enter the military. Moreover, Army Regulation 635-20,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which concerns post-induction claims for conscientious objection status made while in the army, might be interpreted to preclude claims that crystallized prior to induction but were denied by the Selective Service System because made after an induction order was mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">And even if a board determination of the sincerity of a conscientious objection claim is burdensome to local boards, we cannot agree with the <em>Ehlert </em>court that this is a relevant ground for turning away the claim. The only question is whether a recently formed conscientious objection belief is, or may be, a change in status resulting from a circumstance which is beyond the control of the registrant, thereby entitling the registrant to a reopening. This is the criterion set forth in \u00a7 1625.2, and the only relevant inquiry is whether conscientious objection meets the criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">We reject also the government\u2019s argument that Nordlof had time between his registration and induction order to inform his board of his \u201cnewly acquired beliefs,\u201d and that by failure to do so has waived his right to have the board consider his claim. This argument presupposes the correctness of the <em>Schoebel </em>rule, that a crystallization of belief after induction order cannot as a matter of law amount to a circumstance over which Nordlof had no control. It also presupposes that Nordlof\u2019s conscience was formed before receipt of the induction order so as to render his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>waivable. Belatedness itself is not a good reason for refusing to consider a claim, although it is a factor a board may consider on the board\u2019s ultimate question of sincerity, once a reopening has been granted. United States v. Gearey, 368 F.2d at 149-150. This court\u2019s decision in United States v. Angelico, 427 F.2d 288 (7th Cir. 1970), therefore does not militate against our rejection of the government\u2019s waiver claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Finally, we see no merit in the government\u2019s contention that Nordlof did not at any time file his claim with the board. The administrative process had not terminated when he filed his claim with an official within the Selective Service System who should have forwarded it to the board.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> United States v. Stafford, 389 F.2d 215, 219 (2nd Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-12\">. The following testimony is before us as an offer of proof. Nordlof was a high school teacher in Fort Madison, Iowa when he met Shirley Guzman in December, 1967. Miss Guzman is a Jehovah Witness and the daughter of the presiding minister of the Kingdom Hall in Fort Madison. They began to date in spring of 1968, and were later married. In August and September of 1968, Nordlof began discussing with Miss Guzman\u2019s father the teachings of the Bible concerning war and killing. Nordlof testified that during the month of October he began to \u201cmake his mind over,\u201d but that he was not sure of his convictions until the day of his induction when he refused to enter the army.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-8\">.

We disagree with <em>Scott </em>to the extent . that it requires, or permits, the local board to consider, in determining whether to reopen the registrant\u2019s classification, the sincerity of the registrant\u2019s beliefs. <em>See </em>Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 417 \u2014 418, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970) ; United States v. Freeman, 388 F.2d 246, 248-249 (7th Cir. 1967). See <em>also </em>footnote 12 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">. Since this opinion overrules United States v. Schoebel, 201 F.2d 31 (7th Cir. 1953), we have circulated the opinion to the active members of the court not on the panel. A majority of the court agrees that <em>Schoebel </em>should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The decisions in United States v. Porter, 314 F.2d 833 (7th Cir. 1963), and Porter v. United States, 334 F.2d 792 (7th Cir. 1964), on the issue before us fall with <em>Schoebel.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b903-15\">. Army Regulation 635-20, in paragraph 3b, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">Requests for discharge after entering military service will not be accepted when' \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b903-17\">(1) Based solely on conscientious objection which existed, but which was not claimed prior to induction, enlistment, or entry on active duty or active duty for training.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">(2) Based solely on conscientious objection claimed and denied by the Selective Service System prior to induction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b904-5\">. We think the proper procedure for the board to follow in considering claims of conscientious objection made after the registrant receives an order to report for induction is as follows: The board must first consider the claim, United States v. Shermeister, 425 F.2d 1362 (7th Cir. 1970), and determine when the registrant\u2019s beliefs matured. If it decides \u2014 with a basis in fact in the record and assuming that the registrant\u2019s statements are true, as required by \u00a7 1625.2 \u2014 that the beliefs matured before the registrant received the order or that the facts presented add no new information to the file or that the claim does not present a prima facie showing for a new classification, the claim can be denied. <em>See </em>United States v. Stafford, 389 F.2d 215, 219 (2nd Cir. 1968). If the board decides that the claim matured after receipt of the order, discloses a prima facie showing for a new classification, and is not refuted by reliable facts in the file, the board must reopen and determine the registrant\u2019s sincerity in making the claim. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 415-416, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Under this procedure a registrant will not be able to postpone his induction indefinitely by presenting new conscientious objection claims to the officials at the induction center after his original conscientious objection claim has been denied. The induction officials must send the new claim to the local board to consider whether a reopening is warranted, United States v. Stafford, 389 F.2d 215 (2nd Cir. 1968), and the board must <em>consider </em>such matter, United States v. Shermeister, 425 F.2d 1362 (7th Cir. 1970), but the board need not reopen unless there is new evidence not previously presented, United States v. Mulloy, 398 U.S. 410, 418 n. 7, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970). If the board decides not to reopen, there is no administrative appeal from that decision and the board is required merely to notify the registrant of this decision, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.4, the existing Order to Report for Induction is still valid and the registrant may be indicted should he have refused to take the symbolic step forward. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Stone, 422 F.2d 968 (10th Cir. 1970) ; United States v. Gearey, 368 F.2d 144, 152 (2nd Cir. 1966). In <em>Stone </em>the local board refused to reopen after the induction order was sent but before the registrant had reported for induction and refused to submit. We see no reason why the same procedure could not be followed after the registrant has reported but failed to submit to induction. It is only when a reopening is granted that a prior induction order is canceled, and that a new induction order is issued after the registrant is reclassified I-A. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b904-9\">KNOCH, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AdEf\">(dissenting) .</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Reluctantly I find myself in disagreement with the majority.
