We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-22\">In Shaw v. Henderson,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court held that failure to appoint counsel for an indigent in a Louisiana state probation proceeding is not a basis for federal habeas relief for two primary reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-23\">First, the revocation of probation hearing is not a \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d Second, Shaw\u2019s \u201cright to liberty\u201d was taken from him during his trial for burglary in 1965. He received probation solely at the discretion of the sentencing court. Thus, the \u201cliberty\u201d of which he speaks is a matter of grace which can be granted or denied within the discretion of the sentencing court at the time sentence is imposed. Indeed, he was under sentence from the beginning of his probation, but he was given conditional liberty which could be revoked when he violated the conditions imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-24\">The court below held that the rationale of <em>Shaw </em>militates against granting petitioner Woods the relief he seeks. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>agree. In <em>Shaw </em>there was no denial of Sixth Amendment rights because the probation hearing was not a \u201ccriminal proceeding;\u201d \u201che was not sentenced at the hearing, and no substantial rights were affected or could have been affected at the hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reasoning of the court in <em>Shaw </em>as applied to probation hearing applies <em>a fortiori </em>to petitioner\u2019s ease since parole revocation is even more remote from the actual \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d than revocation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AtPP\">. 430 F.2d 1116 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AEf\">.
