It now appears, without dispute, that the regulation in question has been repealed, that the student successfully finished the school year with full credit, and that the student is now enrolled in another school which had no part in the original contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>versy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the cause no longer exists, Sears, Roebuck and Company v.

See United States of America v.
