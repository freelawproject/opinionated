A few months later the Union began an organizational drive among the store\u2019s employees which then numbered between three and seven. During this drive the Company\u2019s District Manager Moshinsky committed unfair labor practices in interrogating employees about their Union activity and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>threatening to discharge, and constructively discharging, employees for this activity. On August 3, 1967 the Union, after receiving Union authorization cards from a majority of the employees, demanded recognition as bargaining agent. The demand was not met and the proceeding before us followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The only issues presented are with respect to the findings and conclusions that respondent had violated Section 8 (a) (5) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by refusing to bargain with the Union on or after August 3, 1967; and with respect to the bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I. THE \u00a7 8(a) (5) VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The Company does not dispute that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a)(5) of the Act by refusing to bargain in good faith. Rather, it challenges that finding solely on the grounds that the Kankakee store employees did not constitute an appropriate bargaining unit and that the Union did not have a majority when it made its demand for recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The Examiner found that the unit was not appropriate. The Board decided that the unit was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The Board has a broad discretion in its determination of an appropriate unit and may choose any unit it reasonably deems appropriate. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. NLRB, 411 F.2d 356, 358 (7th Cir. 1969). The unit must be chosen in relation to the facts of each case, and the Board is required to make each determination in order to assure the employees \u201cthe fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by [the Act].\u201d Section 9(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b). But various factors, with no one determinative, may enter into making this determination: the company organization, the number of employees in the unit and their geographic distribution, the responsibilities of unit supervisors, and the extent to which the unit is already organized. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>at 358. And where the facts underlying a Board determination are uncontroverted, the determination will not be overturned unless it is \u201carbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d May Dept. Stores Co. v. NLRB, 326 U.S. 376, 66 S.Ct. 203, 90 L.Ed. 145 (1945); NLRB v. Krieger-Ragsdale &amp; Co., 379 F.2d 517, 520 (7th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">We think the Board sufficiently related its determination of appropriateness to the relevant facts. The 50 mile geographical separation of the Kankakee store from the three downstate Illinois stores, in the light of the stock-boy employees of the Company, could be reasonably seen as isolating the Kankakee employees from easy communication with employees in the other cities, even if there might reasonably be said to be a substantial community of interest between employees in these several cities outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. The 59 mile distance between Chicago and Kankakee might offer easier communication but would probably offer less community interest between employees in the 13 Chicago stores and the stock-boys in Kankakee, since employment conditions and wage scales might be entirely different for the two cities. The distance between Kankakee and Hammond, about equal to that between Kankakee and Chicago, might offer less easy communication while offering greater community of interest between the Kankakee stock-boys and those in Hammond.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">It should also be noted that the Kankakee store manager had a reasonable degree of autonomy in her \u201con the spot\u201d supervisory control of the self-service stores, especially in view of the small number <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and unskilled character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the employees involved and the significant fact that the district supervisor visited the Kankakee store only once or twice a week. And the minimal interchange of employees, found by the Board, which contributes to the isolation of a group of stock-boy employees from the other groups, reinforces our conclusion that the Board did not err in deciding that the Kankakee store was an appropriate bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We see no merit in the claim that in making this determination the Board failed to accord any weight to the principle of <em>stare decisis. </em>The doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>does not require that the Board\u2019s policies and standards be unchangeable since it must meet changing conditions by corresponding changes in policies and standards. There is no <em>per se </em>injustice in this. The question is in each case whether the policy, standard or decision is erroneous. NLRB v. Western Wirebound Box Co., 356 F.2d 88, 91 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Respondent\u2019s reliance upon NLRB v. Purity Food Stores, Inc., 376 F.2d 497 (1st Cir. 1967), and NLRB v. Frisch\u2019s Big Boy Ill-Mar Inc., 356 F.2d 895 (7th Cir. 1966), is of no avail. The facts in those cases distinguish them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And our observation in <em>State Farm, </em>411 F.2d at 358, that the Board need not choose the best unit disposes of the Company\u2019s argument that the appropriate unit should be the employees in the Kankakee and the 13 Chicago metropolitan area stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We hold that the Board did not err in concluding that the Kankakee store was an appropriate bargaining unit. Since there is no credibility issue on this point, and the disagreement between the Examiner and Board is upon a conclusion as to which the Examiner\u2019s findings are not entitled to special weight, the Board\u2019s final determination was within its prerogative. NLRB v. Stafford Trucking Co., 371 F.2d 244, 249 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Since the Trial Examiner found the Kankakee employee unit inappropriate, there was no need for him to go on to the question of the alleged 8(a)(5) violation. The Board, however, in disagreeing with the Examiner, reviewed the relevant evidence on the issue and concluded that \u201cby refusing on and after August 3, 1967\u201d to bargain with the Union as exclusive representative of the Kankakee unit, respondent violated 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act. The evidence: On August 1, 1967 the Union wrote the Company demanding recognition on a card majority. The Company received the letter August 3 and the next day District Manager Moshinsky asked the Union \u201cto hold off matters\u201d because Mr. Kostel, the Company\u2019s president, was out of town but would contact the Union upon his return \u201con or about\u201d August 26. Neither Moshinsky nor Kostel communicated with the Union after Moshinsky\u2019s message.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">At the time of the Union demand on August 1, 1967, the store had five employees: Carter, Guimond, Dirker, Senesac and Entwhistle. Of these employees, only two, Guimond and Dirker, had signed Union authorization cards. A third authorization card, that of Entwhistle, was signed on August 23, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The Board's original decision was filed August 14, 1968. It found that on August 3 the appropriate bargaining unit consisted of Dirker, Guimond and Entwhistle. It excluded employee Senesac from the bargaining unit because she was a temporary part-time employee, and Carter because he was a Social Security annuitant. The Board found that the Union had been validly designated as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>August 3, 1967, as bargaining representative by two of the three employees in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Supreme Court filed its opinion in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547, on June 16, 1969. Thereafter, upon notice to the parties involved and after the submission of memoranda, the Board modified its decision with respect to the Union\u2019s majority on August 3, 1967. Because of a new Board policy, Carter was now included in the unit and the Board found the Union without a majority on August 3. However, it found that the Union\u2019s demand for recognition was a \u201ccontinuing\u201d one and that on August 23<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Union had a majority, and respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the demand after that date viewed in the light of the prior violations of 8(a) (1) and (3), was a violation of 8(a) (5) and (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We think the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s conclusion of a continuing demand after August 3, where the Union\u2019s demand was deferred on August 3 because of the Company\u2019s promise of a response on or about August 23, and the promise was broken. <em>See </em>Local No. 152 v. NLRB, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 25, 343 F.2d 307, 310 (1965). We hold the Board\u2019s conclusion has substantial support in the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We conclude therefore that the Board did not err in concluding that the Company violated 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act by its refusal to bargain with the Company. We now turn to the issue whether a bargaining order was appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">II. THE BARGAINING ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The Board, in its supplemental decision, issued after <em>Gissel, </em>found that Kostel\u2019s unlawful labor practices \u201ctended to undermine the Union's majority and that there is insufficient indication that an election would be a more reliable test of the employees\u2019 desires than a card count\u201d; and \u201cissuance of a bargaining order will effectuate the purposes of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">The supplemental findings presumably were designed to eliminate, because of the <em>Gissel </em>decision, the \u201cgood faith\u201d doubt language in the Board\u2019s original decision. This was proper. In this court\u2019s recent decision in NLRB v. Drives, Inc., 440 F.2d 354 (7th Cir. filed Jan. 20, 1971), Judge Stevens noted that under <em>Gissel </em>the employer\u2019s subjective motivation is no longer of controlling importance, and attention must be focused on the \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the unlawful practices and the election process.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">The Board\u2019s supplemental decision, however, made no detailed analysis of the causal connection. Rather, it merely repeated the basic facts of the constructive refusal of respondent to bargain, recited generally the prior unlawful conduct, and stated its conclusion that the prior conduct made an election unreliable. This was not a sufficient compliance with <em>Gissel. </em>NLRB v. General Stencils, Inc., 438 F.2d 894 (2nd Cir. filed Jan. 19, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">We think that <em>Gissel </em>requires the Board to make a detailed analysis of the severity of the unfair labor practices \u201cin terms of * * * the likelihood of their recurrence in the future,\u201d the possibility of holding a fair election in the future, and the potential effectiveness of less drastic remedies in deterring future employer misconduct and removing the stain of past misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is not sufficient for the Board to merely state that prior unfair practices \u201ctended to undermine the Union\u2019s majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>[and] there was insufficient indication that an election * * * would be a more reliable test of the employee\u2019s desires.\u201d Such findings were aptly condemned by Judge Goldberg in NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., 427 F.2d 446, 449 (5th Cir. 1970), as a \u201clitany, reciting conclusions by rote without factual explication.\u201d Rather, the Board must \u201cexplain in each case just what it considers to have precluded a fair election and why, and in what respects the case differs from others where it has reached an opposite conclusion.\u201d NLRB v. General Stencils, Inc., <em>supra. </em>Where the Board fails to do this, a meaningful review is impossible. NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 380 U.S. 438, 442-443, 85 S.Ct. 1061, 1064, 13 L.Ed.2d 951 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">* * * due to the Board\u2019s lack of articulated reasons for the decisions in and distinctions among these cases, the Board\u2019s action here cannot be properly reviewed. When the Board so exercises its discretion given to it by Congress, it must \u201cdisclose the basis for its order\u201d and \u201cgive clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it.\u201d Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 179, [61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">However, rather than remand for further Board action,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we shall, in view of the extended time span of this proceeding and the simplicity of the facts involved, make the necessary analysis. NLRB v. Drives, Inc., <em>supra. Cf. </em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Commission, 383 U.S. 607, 621, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">We shall first discuss the 8(a) (1) and (3) violations which form the basis of the Board\u2019s conclusion that a bargaining order was required, and which are not contested by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In July of 1967, three months after the Kankakee store opened, the Union began an organizational drive in the store. In July and August, District Manager Moshinsky and Store Manager Kelly unlawfully interrogated and threatened employee Dirker concerning Union activity. A threat also was made to employee Entwhistle, but the Board ruled that this threat was not properly before it because it was not specifically alleged in the complaint. In August, employees Dirker and Guimond were constructively discharged by Moshinsky for their Union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">In considering whether the Board\u2019s finding that a bargaining order was appropriate, emphasis must be placed on the fact that these threats and interrogations involved three employees in a bargaining unit of five. We especially note that two of the five employees were constructively discharged during the July-August organization drive, which was only three months after the store opened. We think these factors \u2014 the size of the labor force and the nature and seriousness of the unfair labor practices \u25a0 \u2014 support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the bargaining order was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">The nature of the Company\u2019s business and its location should also be considered. A self-service shoe store lends itself to the employment of relatively youthful, unsophisticated or superannuated, unskilled employees \u2014 both of whom are more likely to be susceptible to extraneous influence in making their decision about Union activity than more sophisticated and skilled employees. And in a relatively small city such as Kankakee, word of the Company\u2019s unfair practices could circulate so as to create uneasiness, not only among Company actual, but also potential, employees. We think these considerations bring this case into the second category of \u201cless extraordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>nary cases\u201d in which a bargaining order is appropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The nature of respondent\u2019s business cannot be a valid reason for diminishing the right of employees to be free of unlawful practices in expressing their organizational rights under Section 7 of the Act. Unlike cases like <em>Drives </em>and <em>Foster, </em>we have not here the fact of an election that was challenged by a losing union. Consequently we are not concerned about a suitably free climate for a \u201crerun.\u201d We are concerned about whether the Board could reasonably have concluded in its discretion that respondent\u2019s unfair practices tended to dissipate and undermine the Union card majority, NLRB v. Lou De Young\u2019s Market Basket, Inc., 430 F.2d 912 (6th Cir. 1970), and that it was unlikely that the first employee election would produce a more reliable result for employees than the cards employees had already signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">For the reasons given in this brief analysis to show the \u201ccausal connection\u201d and meet the <em>Gissel </em>test, we hold that the Board\u2019s conclusion was reasonable and that it could reasonably have found, as we now find, that the possibility of erasing the effects of the past unfair labor practices by the Company by an election is slight and that the employee sentiment expressed in the cards would better be protected by the bargaining order. NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 614-615, 89 S.Ct. 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we have limited our consideration to the record before us, rather than including in our consideration employee turnover since the original entry of the bargaining order. The Fifth Circuit in NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., <em>supra, </em>and the Ninth Circuit in NLRB v. L. B. Foster, Co., <em>supra, </em>have differed on the question of considering events since the Board\u2019s order. This court shares the view of the <em>Foster </em>court that the later events should not be permitted to preclude enforcement, since the delay is \u201cthe unfortunate but inevitable result of the process * * * prescribed in the Act.\u201d NLRB v. L. B. Foster Co., <em>supra, </em>418 F.2d at 4. <em>See also, </em>G.P.D., Inc. v. NLRB, 430 F.2d 963 (6th Cir. filed Aug. 11, 1970). If any party should be penalized for the delay, it should be the employer, since his misconduct occasioned the proceeding. To hold otherwise would permit an employer to escape his duty to bargain with the employees\u2019 representative by continuing his unlawful practices or by engaging in protracted litigation. <em>Cf. </em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 610-613, 89 S.Ct. at 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">We recognize the unsatisfactory result of this view since the Company may be required to bargain with a union that does not represent a majority of the employees. But the present employees, not subject of the 8(a) (5) violation, may after a reasonable period petition for a secret ballot election under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c) (1) (A). In order that the employees accurately understand their right to request such an election, we have decided that the Board\u2019s order should be modified to include provision for a notice to the employees advising them of their independent right to petition for a new election. NLRB v. Drives, Inc., <em>supra. </em>We leave the exact terms of the notice to the discretion of the Board. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">As modified, the order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-22\">.

Although the minimal size of the unit may be a factor, it is not determinative. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Quaker City Life Ins.

In <em>Frisch\u2019s Big Boy </em>the ten stores involved were in Indianapolis and all the Indianapolis employees had \u201cidentical terms and conditions of employment.\u201d It was agreed by the parties in that case that the eleventh store, at Muncie, 60 miles away, should be a separate unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\">.
