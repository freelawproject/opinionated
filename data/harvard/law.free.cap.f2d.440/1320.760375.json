The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act bars common law recovery against an insured employer by or on behalf of an employee for negligent injury or wrongful death. In an effort to avoid that bar, these actions were brought against the employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier alleging that its negligence in failing to discover and correct faulty conditions of the employer\u2019s equipment was a cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-13\">The district court, 307 F.Supp. 571, granted summary judgments for the defendant insurance company upon the authority of Brown v. Travelers Insurance Co., 1969, 434 Pa. 507, 254 A.2d 27. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-16\">The accident in suit occurred in 1965. In 1966 the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was amended to make explicit the right of a workmen\u2019s compensation insurer to the same immunity from an injured employee\u2019s suit for personal injury in the course of his employment that the insured employer enjoyed. P.L. 1552 of January 25, 1966, 77 P.S. \u00a7 501. But it is conceded that this statute is not applicable to injuries sustained before its enactment. However, in Brown v. Travelers Insurance Co., <em>swpra, </em>the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania considered a suit, legally indistinguishable from the present one, by an injured employee against his employer\u2019s insurance carrier on account of a 1963 accident. The court held that even before the 1966 amendment of the Pennsylvania Act, an insurance carrier was deemed an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation scheme \u201cand, therefore, shares the employer\u2019s immunity from common law liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-17\">Ordinarily, it could not reasonably be doubted that the <em>Brown </em>decision is controlling here. However, the appellants say that <em>Brown </em>should not be applied here because in 1963 this court made an interpretation of Pennsylvania law contrary to what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has more recently held in <em>Brown. </em>Mays v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 3d Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 174. The appellants say they have a \u201cvested right\u201d in this court\u2019s interpretation of Pennsylvania law as in effect at the time of this 1965 accident. However, in <em>Brown </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court carefully considered our earlier decision, found it an incorrect interpretation of Pennsylvania law and subjected the then claimant, who relied on <em>Mays, </em>to a contrary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-18\">We find no reason for a different decision in this case. The matter in dispute is the correct interpretation of Pennsylvania law. While this court must often undertake such interpretation, final authority upon all such matters is vested in the highest court of the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>wealth. No one may properly rely upon what we have held as more than persuasive on a question of Pennsylvania law so long as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not ruled upon that legal question. Thus, the appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Mays </em>in disregard of <em>Brown </em>is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">Finally, we point out that it is all but incredible that an employee in accepting employment or contemplating a possible industrial accident would in fact consider any outstanding legal decision that his employer\u2019s insurance carrier is or is not an \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of common law liability. Even without the <em>Brown </em>decision we would be free in this case to reconsider and reject our <em>Mays </em>ruling if we deemed it erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">The judgments will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
