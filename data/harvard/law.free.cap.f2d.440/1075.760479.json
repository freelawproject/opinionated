While it is obvious that most of petitioner\u2019s allegations are of such a conclusory nature and so lacking in specificity as to warrant this disposition, at least one of petitioner\u2019s allegations is difficult to resolve without an evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-26\">Petitioner complains that one of the members of the jury which convicted him of the offense which resulted in his current sentence was the wife of someone whom he had been previously convicted of robbing. The State appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>assume that this was true, but seems to assert that under no circumstances could this represent a federal constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">The federal right to a jury trial, however, is a right to a trial \u201cby an impartial jury.\u201d Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363-364, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966); Turner v.
