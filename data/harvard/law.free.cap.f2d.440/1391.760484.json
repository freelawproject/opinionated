We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-18\">THE INVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-19\">Claim 6 is for a process for producing thoria sol, which is a colloidal solution of thorium dioxide, by electrodialysis of an aqueous solution of thorium salts. According to the specification, the particles of thorium dioxide in the sol prepared by this method may be coated with zirconium and the resultant product used as a breeder \u201cblanket\u201d in nuclear power reactors. Claim 6, with subparagraphing supplied and the language principally in contention emphasized, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-20\">6. A process for preparing a thoria sol which comprises</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-22\">preparing an aqueous solution of thorium salts selected from the group consisting of the nitrate, the chloride and the perchlorate,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2z\">withdrawing a portion of said solution,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-23\">electrodialyzing in the presence of <em>an anion permeable membrane, </em>said portion to remove anions and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-24\">returning said portion to a [the?] larger body of solution and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-6\">continuing said withdrawal electro-dialysis and addition back until said body of solution is essentially free of electrolytes and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\">recovering the product thoria sol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>THE REJECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">Claim 6 has been rejected both under the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 as based upon insufficient disclosure of \u201chow to make\u201d (i. e., how to carry out the claimed process) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 as obvious in view of the disclosure of O\u2019Connor et al., United States patent No. 3,280,011, filed July 18, 1962. However, the dispositive issue in both rejections is whether disclosure which the solicitor concedes is equivalent in the specification of appellants\u2019 parent application and in the present application is adequate to support claim 6, since, as the solicitor further concedes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-5\">If the disclosure of the parent application is adequate, the effective date of the reference is overcome, and of course, the disclosure of the application on appeal would also be adequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">Claim 6 recites electrodialysis with \u201can anion permeable membrane.\u201d The specifications state generally \u201cPreferred techniques suitable for anion removal are: * * * Eleetrodialysis using anion permeable membranes\u201d and both contain an \u201cExample I\u201d which recounts the dialysis of 4000 grams of a solution of thorium nitrate in a cell \u201cdivided by an ion exchange membrane of Amberplex Al.\u201d The examiner held this disclosure inadequate because the ion exchange membrane in Example I was identified only by its trademark designation, and the board affirmed on this ground. The examiner pointed out that appellants had \u201ccited no references which teach any method of preparing * * * [Amberplex Al] or what its formula or chemical composition may be.\u201d The board made similar comments, emphasizing that, \u201cas far as the record shows, [Amberplex Al] is a proprietary material whose composition is maintained in secrecy\u201d and that future availability of the material was at the manufacturer\u2019s sufferance, and additionally pointed out that the physical characteristics of Amberplex Al, such as thickness and porosity, were not set forth in Example I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\">APPELLANTS\u2019 ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-10\">Appellants argue that their general disclosure that their process can be carried out using \u201canion permeable membranes\u201d is sufficient to support the controverted recitation in claim 6 and that the disclosure in Example I that they had carried out the process using an Amberplex Al anion permeable membrane was \u201cexcess\u201d not necessary to support the claim. Additionally, they argue that, if they must rely on the example, the example is adequate, citing primarily In re Metcalfe, 410 F.2d 1378, 56 C.C.P.A. 1191 (1969). Since we agree with the first argument, we do not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-11\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">The single claim on appeal recites \u201can anion permeable membrane\u201d without restriction as to type, and appellants\u2019 brief stresses that the particular type of membrane used is not critical to the practice of their invention. While the brief for the solicitor argues, in effect, that proper selection of the membrane <em>is </em>critical because certain anion permeable membranes might not be operative in the process, there is nothing in the record to suggest that, even if this is so, the selection of an appropriate membrane would not have been within the ordinary skill in this art at the time appellants\u2019 parent application was filed. The record discloses that anion permeable membranes <em>in general </em>were well known before the filing date of appellants\u2019 parent application, although the reference on which appellants rely to describe Amberplex Al <em>in particular </em>was published after their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>filing date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Compare In re Skrivan, 427 F.2d 801, 806, 57 C.C.P.A. 1201, 1206-1207 (1970); and In re Franck, 255 F.2d 931, 934, 45 C.C.P.A. 975, 978 (1958). If the selection of an appropriate membrane would have been, within the ordinary skill in the art at that time, appellants\u2019 disclosure is just as sufficient as if the selection criteria were set forth at length in the specification. Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U.S. 403, 437, 22 S.Ct. 698, 46 L.Ed. 968 (1902). Accordingly, we agree with appellants that the disclosure of Example I, insofar as it indicated that a particular anion permeable membrane had been used in practicing the invention, was \u201cexcess\u201d not required by the how-to-make provision of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph. Compare In re Robins, 429 F.2d 452, 456-457, 57 C.C.P.A. 1321, 1326 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">. In his brief, the solicitor, equating Example I with appellants\u2019 \u201cbest mode,\u201d argues that \u201cthe parent specification fails to \u2018set forth the best mode\u2019 as required by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 in such a clear manner that it would be reasonably understood by a skilled artisan.\u201d However, there is no indication in the record that either the examiner or the board intended a \u201cbest mode\u201d rejection. Accordingly, we do not deal with the solicitor\u2019s arguments in this connection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1451-14\">. In view of our disposition of this case on the general disclosure, we do not reach the question, also raised in In re Collier, 427 <em>F.2d 831, 833, </em>57 C.C.P.A. <em>1171, 1172 </em>(1970), whether a disclosure providing insufficient support as filed can be made sufficient as of a later date by the subsequent publication of an external reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
