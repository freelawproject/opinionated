The Board determined that respondent had violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by discharging an employee, Ernest L. Davis, for engaging in concerted activity protected by Section 7 of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent was ordered to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice found, and to reinstate Davis with pay for any wages lost in the interim. The Board\u2019s Decision and Order are reported in 175 NLRB No. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">The following recital of facts is based upon the trial examiner\u2019s findings of fact. Davis was hired by the Company as a laborer, and under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the union, was to have been a probationary employee for the first 30 days of his employment. On a regular Friday payday about three weeks after having been employed, he received his pay check covering the previous week\u2019s work, which week included the Labor Day holiday, and noticed that it did not include the holiday pay. Upon returning to inquire about the deficiency, Davis met Max Rose, the company\u2019s chief executive officer and sole stockholder, and Maurice Chorney, the chief yard superintendent. When he inquired about the holiday pay, the two asked him how long he had been employed by the company and whether he was a member of the union. Davis replied that this was his third week (i. e., that his probationary period had not expired) and that he was not a member of the union. Rose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>thereupon, informed Davis that he was not entitled to holiday pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Later in the same day, Davis inquired of the union shop steward about the holiday pay and was informed that since he was not a union member the union could do nothing for him. At the suggestion of the steward, however, Davis saw the union local\u2019s financial secretary. He made a similar reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Shortly thereafter, Davis again encountered the financial secretary while he was cashing his pay check at a nearby bank and once more inquired whether he was entitled to holiday pay. Again, the reply was substantially the same, although he added \u201cNobody said that you\u2019re not entitled to the holiday pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">On the following Monday, Davis, during his lunch hour, visited the financial secretary at the latter\u2019s work station and secured a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Upon reading the relevant section dealing with holiday pay, Davis offered his opinion, to Winbush, the financial secretary, that there was nothing in the language that excluded non-union or probationary employees from its provisions; and that he felt he fulfilled the requirements for holiday pay. Winbush advised Davis the union could do nothing for him, since he was not a member <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (it should be noted, however, that Davis had not requested the union to represent him) and suggested that he again see Rose, the chief executive officer. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do anything, then come back to me and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Later that same day, shortly after he had clocked out, Davis went to Rose\u2019s office. He renewed his request for holiday pay for Labor Day, referring to the agreement and pointing out that, as he read the contract, he was entitled to it because he had worked the days immediately before and after Labor Day. Rose first asked Davis where he got the agreement and Davis, remembering his earlier promise to Winbush not to divulge his source, refused to tell him. Rose then said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t even been here a month \u2014 and you\u2019re trying to tell me how to run my business.\u201d Davis denied this charge and repeated his claim for holiday pay. Thereupon, Rose informed Davis he should have been a lawyer; the latter responded that one did not have to be a lawyer to read the contract. Rose again replied that Davis was not entitled to holiday pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Shortly after the conversation, Rose called in the company\u2019s comptroller and instructed him to prepare Davis\u2019 final pay check; he was being discharged as an \u201cundesirable employee.\u201d There was no further elaboration. The next day, upon finding his time card removed, Davis sought out Rose for an explanation. Rose greeted Davis by holding out an envelope containing his pay check and telling him that the company could not use him any more. Upon inquiring whether he was fired, Rose replied that he could not use a man who tried to tell him how to run his business. Davis denied that he was trying to do any such thing and refused to take the pay check since there was no union representative to witness the firing. He then left the property and promptly proceeded to the Regional Office of the National Labor Relations Board and filed the charges <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which give rise to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">This case raises three questions: (1) whether Davis was engaging in concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid and protection within the meaning of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, (2) whether this was the reason for his discharge, and (3) wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>er enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is consistent with our responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of Labor Board decisions \u201cwhen viewed, on the record as a whole.\u201d See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 466, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">I. The Concerted Activities Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act provides that \u201c[e]mployees shall have the right * * * to engage in * * * concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection * * Section 8(a) (1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of\u201d their Section 7 rights. The primary question presented by this case is whether a single employee acting alone is engaged in protected concerted activity when he presses demands for holiday pay, to which he deems himself entitled under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">The trial examiner found that Davis was discharged because he pressed his claim for holiday pay with the employer. The Act protects only \u201cconcerted activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">The Board would have us hold that Davis\u2019 efforts \u201cto enforce\u201d the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement constituted concerted activity. The Board asks us to supply the necessary element of concert from the facts that Davis was presenting a grievance \u201cwithin the framework\u201d of the collective bargaining agreement and that such grievance \u201caffects the rights of all<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> employees in the unit.\u201d The Second Circuit has followed such an approach, creating a kind of \u201cconstructive\u201d concerted activity, in NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., 388 F.2d 495 (2d Cir. 1967), where the court stated that \u201cactivities involving attempts to enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement may be deemed to be for concerted purposes even in the absence of * * * interest (on the part of) fellow employees.\u201d That case represents a clear expansion of the Act\u2019s coverage, in the face of unambiguous words in the statute. The Act surely does not mention \u201cconcerted <em>purposes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This is clear from the language of the Act, and was emphatically recognized by this court in Mushroom Transportation Co. v. NLRB, 330 F.2d 638 (3d Cir. 1964). <em>Interboro Contractors </em>appears to create a legal fiction, constructive concerted activity, in an effort to support a judicial conception of a sound interpretation of the Act. We are unwilling to adopt such a fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The Seventh Circuit has held that, in order to prove concerted activity under Section 7, \u201cit is necessary to demonstrate [at least] that the activity was for the purpose of inducing or preparing for group action to correct a grievance or a complaint.\u201d Indiana Gear Works v. NLRB, 371 F.2d 273, 276 (7th Cir. 1967). The court cited our circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Mushroom, </em>supra, which contains the most expansive view of \u201cconcerted activity\u201d in this circuit. The court in <em>Mushroom </em>included within the meaning of the term not only group action, but also \u201ctalk looking toward group action.\u201d Even this definition of concerted activity stretches somewhat the normal meaning of the term in order to facilitate the policies of the Act. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1947) defines \u201cconcert\u201d as \u201cagreement in a design or plan; union formed by mutual communication of opinions and views; accordance in a scheme; harmony; simultaneous action\u201d and \u201cconcerted\u201d as \u201cmutually contrived or planned; agreed on.\u201d We do not believe the purpose of the Act would be served by expanding the limits of <em>Mushroom </em>to include activity which could be considered \u201cconcerted\u201d only in a fictional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">We therefore hold that Davis was not engaged in concerted activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>within the protection of Section 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Even if we were to adopt <em>Interboro </em>as the rule of this circuit, however, we would still be unable to enforce the Board\u2019s Order on the record as it now stands. Since its decision in <em>Interboro, </em>the Second Circuit has had an opportunity to expand upon that case\u2019s rationale in NLRB v. John Langenbacher Co., 398 F.2d 459, 463 (2d Cir. 1968). The court there noted that an attempt by employees to enforce their understanding of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \u201cis a protected activity * * * if the employees have a reasonable basis for believing that their understanding of the terms was the understanding that had been agreed upon * *</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">It is clear from the trial examiner\u2019s findings of fact that he did not consider whether there was a <em>reasonable basis </em>for Davis\u2019 belief that he was entitled to holiday pay under the contract. He found, simply, \u201cthat Davis was discharged for pressing for the holiday pay <em>to which he thought he was entitled </em>under the collective-bargaining contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, even under <em>Interboro, </em>we would be required to remand this case to the Board for a finding as to whether Davis had a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for his belief, particularly since we believe that, on the basis of the record before us, this is a close factual question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of course, our decision not to follow <em>Interboro </em>makes such a remand unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">II. The Cause for the Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">For the reasons stated under I, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether or not there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Davis\u2019 activities in attempting to obtain holiday pay were the cause of his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">III. This Court\u2019s Duty to Assure Reasonableness and Fairness of Board Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">In Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, supra, 340 U.S. at 490, 71 S.Ct. at 466, the Supreme Court of the United States said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-18\">We conclude, therefore, that the Administrative Procedure Act and the Taft-Hartley Act direct that courts must now assume more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of Labor Board decisions than some courts have shown in the past. Reviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function. Congress has imposed on them responsibility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds. That responsibility is not less real because it is limited to enforcing the requirement that evidence appear substantial when viewed, on the record as a whole, by courts invested with the authority and enjoying the prestige of the Courts of Appeals. The Board\u2019s findings are entitled to respect; but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>precludes the Board\u2019s decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Under this mandate, we believe there is an alternative and independent basis for denying enforcement of the Board\u2019s order. Our holding in I, supra, makes it unnecessary to remand this case to the Board. Had we found differently, we would nonetheless deny enforcement under <em>Universal Camera </em>until the Board, by remand to its trial examiner or in some other way, explained further the basis for the following actions of the trial examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">(1) Despite the facts\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\">(a) that Rose was dead and his version of the events was unavailable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">(b) that Davis had been involved as the charging party in numerous unfair labor practice cases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-8\">(c) that Davis had an \u201cinability to recollect certain details\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\">(d) that Davis \u201cwas confusing his contacts with Rose,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">the trial examiner credited <em>all </em>of Davis\u2019 testimony <em>needed </em>to make out a case against the company, even when it conflicted with testimony offered by the company (which was rejected in every case by the trial examiner), while he rejected <em>part </em>of Davis\u2019 testimony as \u201cimplausible\u201d (App. 11).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">(2) In evaluating the testimony of various witnesses for the employer, the trial examiner rejected the testimony of Davis\u2019 supervisor regarding Davis\u2019 allegedly unsatisfactory job performance in part because it was uncorroborated. The trial examiner also rejected Ellison\u2019s testimony regarding the last confrontation between Rose and Davis in part because it was uncorroborated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial examiner also noted that none of the people who worked with Davis and who, according to the testimony of Davis\u2019 supervisor, complained about Davis\u2019 frequent absences from the job site were called to testify. Similarly, the trial examiner noted that the payroll clerk Who made an entry on Davis\u2019 record, \u201cDischarged \u2014 -Unsatisfactory Performance of duty,\u201d was not called to testify. This, of course, is a proper way of evaluating testimony. But it should be noted that, while <em>none of </em>Davis\u2019 testimony was corroborated, lack of corroboration was not held against Davis. This court has disapproved of causing an employer to prove that a discharge is for a proper reason rather than requiring the General Counsel to bear the burden of proof before the trial examiner. NLRB v. Rockwell Mfg. Co., 271 F.2d 109, 115 (3d Cir. 1959). In this case, the opinion of the trial examiner suggests that he effectively erected a presumption <em>against </em>the veracity of testimony offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>by the employer and thereby improperly altered the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The Petition to enforce the Board\u2019s Order of May 8, 1969 will, therefore, be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-12\">.

If there were a remand in this case, it would certainly be crucial for the Board to inquire further as to whether Davis was aware of this fact, for, if he was, his belief in his own entitlement to holiday pay could hardly be found to have been \u201creasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b944-11\">. <em>The </em>rejected <em>testimony of </em>Davis was, of course, unnecessary to make out an unfair labor practice under the Trial Examiner\u2019s view of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b944-12\">. Mr. Ellison was a messenger-driver for the company and a union member. He testified that he was sitting outside Rose\u2019s office during that conversation. His account of it is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-13\">Mr. Davis walked in and asked Mr. Rose how he found out that why he didn\u2019t get paid for the holiday. Mr. Rose told Mr. Davis, \u201cThe reason you didn\u2019t get paid for the holiday is you haven\u2019t been here thirty days and I pay all of my employees by the rule of the contract.\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Rose, <em>that don\u2019t have anything to do with </em>it\u2014 <em>the contract </em>\u2014 this <em>is a national holiday and every man should he paid for Labor Day.\u201d </em>So Mr. Rose said, \u201cIs that correct?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Rose, I want to get paid for Labor Day. [\u201d] Mr. Rose asked him, \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but if you don\u2019t pay me, I\u2019m going to take you down to the Labor Board * * * \u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-19\">If Mr. Ellison\u2019s testimony had been credited by the trial examiner, it would have gone far toward showing that Davis was not, in fact, attempting to enforce the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b945-6\">BIGGS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">I. <em>The Concerted Activity Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act states that \u201c[e]mployees shall have the right * * * to engage in * * * concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection * * Section 8(a) (1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of\u201d their Section 7 rights. The question presented for our determination is whether efforts by an employee to enforce a provision of the collective bargaining agreement are per s\u00e9 \u201cconcerted activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">Since there are no Third Circuit cases which consider the specific issue <em>sub judice, </em>I would adopt the teaching of a recent Second Circuit opinion by Chief Judge Lumbard in NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., 388 F.2d 495 (1967). In that case the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-18\">\u201c[W]hile interest on the part of fellow employees would indicate a concerted purpose, activities involving attempts to enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement may be deemed to be for concerted purposes even in the absence of such interest by fellow employees.\u201d Id. at 500.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-19\">Thus, this case holds that efforts by an employee to enforce a collective bargaining agreement are considered concerted activity per s\u00e9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-20\">I think that this court should adopt the holding of <em>Interboro </em>not only because it has been followed by the National Labor Relations Board for many years <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but also because it represents a sound interpretation of Sections 7 and 8(a) (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>of the Act. When an individual employee attempts to enforce a provision of a collective bargaining agreement, he is asserting a \u201ccollective\u201d right under a collective contract. Although an individual employee, in processing his complaint based upon a contractual provision, might be concerned primarily with accomplishing a result which will benefit him personally, his success will redound to the direct benefit of all employees similarly situated. In the instant case, Davis was concerned primarily with convincing Rose that <em>he </em>was entitled to the holiday pay under the collective bargaining agreement. However, Davis was, in effect, representing all other probationary employees (both present and future) for, if successful, his efforts would benefit this class of persons. \u201cWhere an individual employee asserts a right found in a collective-bargaining agreement, it is reasonable to state he is extending the terms protecting union activity.\u201d Illinois Ruan Transportation Corp. v. NLRB, 404 F.2d 274, 285 (8 Cir. 1968) (dissenting opinion of Judge Lay). Also see NLRB v. Century Broadcasting Corp., 419 F.2d 771, 780 (8 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">It might be argued that the adoption of the <em>Interboro </em>rule will encourage employees to bypass the regular grievance procedure. This result is unlikely, except in the rare situation, where the employee is not entitled to union representation. Where an employee belongs to the union and is entitled to union representation, he would undoubtedly request the union to process his grievance. Furthermore, Congress has put its imprimatur on individual processing of grievances. Section 9(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-5\">\u201cRepresentatives * * * selected for purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees * * * shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment: <em>Provided, </em>That any individual employee * * * shall have the right at any time to present grievances to [his] employer and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining contract or agreement then in effect: <em>Provided further, </em>That the bargaining representative has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAr\">The first proviso was meant to be a buffer between the employee and his union, so that the employer <em>may </em>hear an individual\u2019s grievance without running afoul of Section 9(a), which makes the union the exclusive bargaining agent. Black-Clawson Co. Paper Machine Division v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, 313 F.2d 179, 185 (2 Cir. 1962); Comment, Federal Protection of Individual Rights Under Labor Contracts, 73 Yale L.J. 1215 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">The majority opinion indicates that even if the <em>Interboro </em>rule were adopted, a remand to the Board would be necessary for a finding as to whether Davis had a reasonable basis for his belief that he was entitled to the holiday pay under the collective bargaining contract. I agree that this procedure should be followed and, if the Board determines that Davis did have a reasonable basis for his belief, the Board\u2019s order, as amended, should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">II. <em>The Cause for the Discharge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">I conclude that Davis was engaged in concerted activity within the meaning of the Act. I think I should go further and give my view as to whether this was the reason for his discharge. Although one could conclude that Davis was discharged for a proper purpose I think that the record does not lack substantial evidence to support the finding of the Board that Davis was discharged for pressing for the holiday pay to which he thought he was entitled. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The resolution of questions of credibility rests with the Board. NLRB v. Wings <em>&amp; </em>Wheels, Inc., 324 F.2d 495, 496 (3 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>III. <em>This Court\u2019s Duty to Assure Reasonableness and Fairness of Board Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">(1) As an alternative basis for denying enforcement of the Board\u2019s order, my Brother Rosenn indicates that the trial examiner failed to follow the teaching of <em>Universal Camera </em>by crediting all of Davis\u2019 testimony needed to make out a case against the company even when it conflicted with testimony offered by the company while rejecting part of Davis\u2019 testimony as implausible. Thus, my Brother strongly implies that <em>Universal Camera </em>requires a court of appeals to scrutinize the credibility findings and reasoning of the Board. I think that <em>Universal Camera </em>merely stands for the proposition that the scope of review of NLRB decisions under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), is precisely the same as the scope of review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\u2014 whether the decision of the agency is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Universal Camera </em>does not purport to alter the primary function of the agencies in making fact determinations. As we recently stated in Ginsburg v. Richardson, 436 F.2d 1146 (1971): \u201c[i]t is unnecessary for this court to be in accord with all of the examiner\u2019s findings and reasoning as long as his ultimate conclusion is based upon substantial evidence.\u201d Also see Lester v. Celebrezze, 221 F.Supp. 607, 611 (E.D.Ark.1963). While it was certainly permissible for the examiner to discredit all of the employer\u2019s testimony (see NLRB v. John Langenbacher Co., 398 F.2d 459 (2 Cir. 1968)), it was likewise permissible for him to reject only part of Davis\u2019 testimony without rejecting all of it. The rule <em>\u201cFalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\u201d </em>is merely permissive and not mandatory in a trial examiner\u2019s evaluation of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">(2) The majority opinion also states that the trial examiner \u201cerected a presumption <em>against </em>the veracity of testimony offered by the employer and thereby improperly altered the burden of proof.\u201d In order to demonstrate this the majority lists four situations where lack of corroboration was held against the company while noting that lack of corroboration was not held against Davis. While I agree that the burden of proving an improper discharge is upon the General Counsel, I do not understand how the General Counsel\u2019s failure to corroborate Davis\u2019 testimony and the trial examiner\u2019s omission of any reference to such lack of corroboration can constitute a shifting of the burden of proof. Under the trial examiner\u2019s view of the law, and what I deem to be the correct view, Davis was only required to prove that he had been discharged for pressing his contractual grievance with Rose. The only person who ever overheard these conversations between Davis and Rose was Ellison \u2014 the company\u2019s main witness. Thus, the opportunity to corroborate Davis\u2019 testimony never reasonably presented itself. It was unnecessary for the General Counsel to corroborate Davis\u2019 denial of the company\u2019s version of the circumstances surrounding his discharge \u2014 that he had been discharged because he was an unsatisfactory employee. While such a course would have made the General Counsel\u2019s case even stronger, I do not think that this lack of corroboration and the failure of the examiner to note such lack of corroboration constituted a shifting of the burden of proof, particularly where the General Counsel had already introduced substantial evidence showing that the discharge was improper. In other words, the burden on the General Counsel of proving that the discharge was improper does not mean that he was required to corroborate the negation of the employer\u2019s version of the facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">For these reasons I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">. In NLRB v. Selwyn Shoe Mfg. Corp., 428 F.2d 217, 221 (8 Cir. 1970), the court stated: \u201cWe think it obvious that rights secured by such * * * [a collective bargaining] agreement, though personal to each employee, are protected rights under \u00a7 7 of the Act because the collective bargaining agreement is the result of concerted activities by the employees for their mutual aid and protection.\u201d The court held that it was an unfair labor practice for the employer to discharge an employee for vigorously presenting a personal grievance based upon a clause in the collective bargaining agreement. The only fact in <em>Selwyn Shoe </em>which distinguishes that case from the instant case is that the employee in that case properly invoked the union grievance procedure which was available to her. In the case at bar, Davis could not utilize the grievance machinery that was available to regular employees since he was not a member of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">It would be unfair to deny the benefits of the Act to probationary employees who are not yet entitled to utilize the union grievance machinery while extending benefits to regular employees who are entitled to process their grievances through the union. The artificiality of such a distinction has been pointed out in a recent decision of the Board, J. A. Ferguson Constr. Co., 172 NLRB No. 165 (1968). The Board, affirming the trial examiner\u2019s findings and conclusions, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-22\">\u201cAs to the May 1 discharge, the only reason assigned by the employer for the discharge was Tolot\u2019s alleged conduct on April 30 in leaving his work station without permission to protest a violation of the union contract, instead of processing his complaint through the steward under the contract\u2019s grievance procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-23\">* * $ 4 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-24\"><em>\u201cEven assuming that Tolot\u2019s request was in derogation of the grievance provisions of the contraet, </em>his conduct, nevertheless, constituted concerted activity since the \u2018grievance\u2019 pertained to a violation of a condition of employment prescribed in the contract, affecting not only Tolot but also all the bricklayers on the job. Since Tolot\u2019s conduct was protected concerted activity, the employer, therefore, violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by discharging Tolot because of such conduct.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-26\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>H.

In the instant case, Davis negated the employer\u2019s version by denying that he had ever been warned of liis unsatisfactory work performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
