After trial, the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2405. Judgment of conviction was entered on October 11, 1968, and appellant was sentenced to serve two to ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-16\">On appeal, appellant raises several issues, and we find that one of these requires reversal of the conviction. In particular, we find reversible error in the admission, without cautioning instruction, of evidence of a prior act of violence committed by appellant upon his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">For the avowed purpose of proving malice, the prosecuting attorney offered to elicit testimony from appellant\u2019s daughter that on August 5, 1967, about seven months prior to the alleged homicide, appellant had struck his wife with a chair, causing injuries which required medical attention at a local hospital. Defense counsel objected, and the trial judge held a lengthy conference at the bench in which the legal issues were carefully explored. At the end of this conference, the trial judge noted that premeditation and deliberation were not at issue in this case and that the parties had continued to live together as husband and wife for the seven months following the incident in question. He concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-18\">* * * I shall not permit the Government to use any prior act of violence between this defendant and the decedent on August 5, 1968 [sic], in the course of this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-19\">I have permitted testimony with respect to the incidents that started allegedly the night before, and presumably from the evidence, as we have heard from the evidence that there was some continuation of it several hours before this incident happened. But beyond that I will not permit the Government to go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>After this ruling, defense counsel cross-examined appellant\u2019s daughter, at one point asking whether she had seen any altercations between her parents during the day, the week, or the month before the alleged homicide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>- Another question could be interpreted as asking whether appellant had ever hit his wife in the face. After very brief redirect and recross-examination, the trial judge himself stepped in to ask questions which brought out the chair incident of seven months before.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected, and the trial judge replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avz\">I ruled, Counsel, in your favor and stated that the Government would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>be permitted to introduce through its direct examination that line of testimony, and you chose to go into the whole matter in cross-examination of the witness. Therefore, you opened it up for the Government to present whatever evidence that is relevant to rebut your line of questioning on cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">[Defense counsel:] My recollection was I went back a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">THE COURT: My recollection is and my notes indicate you asked her did the mother and father ever fight. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">[Defense counsel:] The past day and within the past week and within the past month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The prosecuting attorney proceeded to examine appellant\u2019s daughter on the subject of the chair incident, and he later introduced a hospital report to substantiate the story. Defense counsel voiced his objection each time.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">There is some doubt in our minds as to whether the trial judge in fact exercised his discretion upon a correct understanding of the circumstances when he held that defense counsel had opened up the matter of the chair incident. It is difficult to tell if the trial judge simply cut off argument about what precisely defense counsel had asked appellant\u2019s daughter, or if he did take in consideration counsel\u2019s correction to his notes and his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">If the trial judge did understand the circumstances correctly, his exercise of discretion seems highly questionable. Whether or not he intended to do so, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination brought out a history of fighting and arguing which, according to the witness, was appellant\u2019s fault. It is most peculiar then to admit testimony of an additional act of violence \u2014 one which the judge had already decided was prejudicial \u2014 to <em>rebut </em>the defense\u2019s line of questioning. The doctrine of curative admissibility is one dangerously prone to overuse. Here the issue of previous acts of violence had been laid squarely before the judge by the Government, and he had made a ruling in favor of the defense. If he then thought that defense counsel was stepping into forbidden territory, it would have been wiser to caution counsel or to rule out the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-19\">In addition, it is troublesome that the trial judge himself carried out the examination which elicited from appellant\u2019s daughter the first mention of the chair incident. Here again, the judge had the alternative of calling the prosecuting attorney to the bench and telling him that the matter of prior acts of violence had now been opened up by defense counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>We need not decide whether these circumstances surrounding the admission of testimony concerning the chair incident would by themselves lead us to reverse this conviction. For we have no doubt that it was reversible error for the trial judge to fail to give an instruction cautioning the jury that the evidence of prior violent acts came in only on the issue of malice, and that the jury might consider such evidence only after they may have determined that defendant was guilty of the unlawful killing of decedent on the date in question. Here, the relation between the various pieces of evidence and the offenses charged was not simple; the jury, in fact, found it necessary to ask the judge to repeat that part of the instructions which concerned the elements of second degree murder and manslaughter. Whenever prosecution evidence is introduced which is admissible only for a limited purpose, the defendant is entitled to instructions which inform the jury of the proper use which may be made of that evidence. And the failure of defense counsel to request such an instruction does not automatically bar this court from reaching the error if the instruction is not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The rule requiring an objection at trial to any error in the jury instructions must be read in conjunction with the rule permitting an appellate court to notice \u201cplain error\u201d in the absence of an objection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The requirement of an objection at trial serves several functions. It affords the trial judge the opportunity to rule on counsel\u2019s contention, and minimizes the danger that a desired instruction will be omitted through inadvertence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, of course, the trial judge had ample notice of the importance defense counsel attached to the issue of the prior violent act, and there had been extensive colloquy at bench over the admissibility of the proffered evidence. No one disputed that the evidence was admissible only to prove malice, and the Government even observed that if the evidence were allowed in, an instruction would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The requirement of an objection at trial is also said to allow for the possibility that trial counsel may make a tactical decision against requesting certain instructions, on the theory that it might hurt the defendant to call the jury\u2019s attention to the relevant portion of the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Waiver of an instruction, then, will usually mean that omission of the instruction is not error at all, much less plain error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the waiver is going to have such an effect, however, it must be explicit; there must be a clear statement that the particular instruction in question is being waived, and it must appear from the record that the waiver was made on tactical grounds, rather than counsel\u2019s misapprehension as to the law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>In this case it is clear that defense counsel did not explicitly waive his right to an instruction on the proper use of the evidence of the prior act of violence. Since no instruction was given and the prejudicial testimony was admitted without limitation, we must reverse this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In addition, we find the problem raised by this ease indistinguishable from Jones v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 385 F.2d 296 (1967), in which this court held that when a party seeks to impeach any witness by a prior inconsistent statement, then it is plain error not to give an <em>immediate </em>instruction limiting the effect of the prior statement, unless the party explicitly waives the instruction. We would hold that whenever evidence is admitted only for a limited purpose, it is plain error, in the absence of manifest waiver, to omit an immediate cautioning instruction. The danger of prejudicial effect from such evidence is so great that only an immediate and contemporaneous instruction can be considered sufficient to protect defendants. As long as we continue to have rules of evidence which admit testimony for some purposes but not for others, we must guard against its misuse by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">.

We think it of the highest importance that trial judges bear in mind the warning this Court gave in United States v. Barbour, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 116, 118, 420 F.2d 1319, 1321 (1969) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-16\">[T]he judge must remain \u201ca disinterested and objective participant in the proceedings,\u201d and principles both fundamental and indestructible in our criminal law exhort him to hold to a minimum his questioning of witnesses in a jury trial. Interrogation of witnesses tends to assimilate the court\u2019s role with the advocate\u2019s, and may tread over the line separating the provinces of judge and jury. The presumption of innocence may be jeopardized by an assumption of guilt radiated by over-zealous quizzing by the judge, and the right to fair trial may be imperiled by an apparent breach of the atmosphere of judicial evenhandedness that should pervade the courtroom. There is the risk that the questioning may bear \u201cthe seeds of tilting the balance against the accused\u201d and place \u201cthe judge in the eyes of some jurors, on the side of the prosecution.\u201d <em>There is also the danger that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>the judge may elicit from the witness responses hurtful to the accused </em>\u2014 re<em>sponses to which the jury may assign peculiar weight because of their ostensible judicial sponsorship. </em>[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. <em>Compare </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, <em>with </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) ; <em>see </em>C.

Since the trial judge did, in effect, instruct the jury <em>twice </em>substantially as outlined in (2) above,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in my view there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>is nothing to that point. Thus, (1) is the only remaining basis asserted to support reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Such contention requires us to consider whether substantial prejudice to appellant resulted from this evidence and its admission without a cautionary instruction. To answer this question necessitates considering the evidence in its proper posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Early in the trial the judge ruled that he would not admit evidence of an altercation between appellant and his wife that occurred on August 5, 1967, about seven months before the accident which caused her death. His ruling restricted the evidence to those acts between appellant and his wife which did not go back beyond the night before her death (Tr. 82). However, after that ruling, the defense opened up the subject generally as to the relationship between the two parties, during periods of time which antedated the time limit specified in the judge\u2019s ruling, by the cross-examination of the daughter (Carolyn) of appellant and deceased.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In support of its conclusion the majority opinion asserts that defense counsel brought out prior acts of violence which were the fault of appellant and that accordingly it was \u201cmost peculiar then to admit testimony of an additional act of violence * * * to rebut the defense\u2019s line of questioning.\u201d This observation completely misinterprets the real purpose of defense counsel in pursuing that line of questioning which was to show <em>not </em>that they fought frequently but that <em>they fought infrequently. </em>That this was counsel\u2019s objective is clearly disclosed by his interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-18\">\u201cThey didn\u2019t fight and argue then very often?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">It is perfectly obvious that by this question he was trying to minimize in the mind of the jury the occasions upon which appellant fought with his wife. And his questions went to the entire relationship between the two of them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-20\">\u201cDid your mother and father fight <em>of</em>ten?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-21\">This question has no time limit on it. Nor did the next question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-22\"><em>\u201cWhen </em>was that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">Carolyn\u2019s answers were likewise not restricted in time \u201cHe <em>always </em>hit her in the face\u201d is a good example. To which counsel inquired, \u201cWhen did he do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that?\u201d Again no time limit. And two other questions by counsel related to the \u201cpast week before this occurred\u201d and \u201ceven a <em>month before.\u201d </em>Also, <em>\u201cHow often </em>did she carry that white pocket knife ?\u201d Again, no time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">So the situation was that the trial court in its ruling restricted the parties to evidence that did not go beyond the day before the decedent\u2019s death and that defense counsel by his interrogation exceeded that restriction. In so doing he completely opened up the subject by asking questions that went to the entire relationship between the parties without any time limit. Therefore, it was perfectly proper for the court and the United States Attorney to interrogate witnesses with respect to an incident which occurred seven months before decedent\u2019s death to show' precisely when the parties did fight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Appellant on this appeal also contends that the court should have instructed the jury to give limited consideration to the prior altercation; but it is a sufficient answer thereto that appellant did not request or offer such instruction, either when the evidence was introduced or later.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests. At the same time copies of such requests shall be furnished to adverse parties. The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed. <em>No pg,rty may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. </em>Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury and, on request of any party, out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. (Emphasis added). The obvious purpose behind such rule is to give the court an opportunity then and there to correct any errors or omissions. Burns v. United States, 274 U.S. 328, 47 S.Ct. 650, 71 L.Ed. 1077 (1927). The same rule has been applied in civil cases, Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Minds, 250 U.S. 368, 375, 39 S.Ct. 531, 63 L.Ed. 1039 (1919); United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 159, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936); Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 119, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), and the underlying premise is the same <em>i.e., </em>that in fairness to the trial court, to the parties and to the public interest, there should be an end to litigation when all parties have had a fair opportunity to present all issues of law and fact. The rule is particularly applicable where a party might have obtained all he was entitled to by way of a charge merely upon request. That is the situation here as no one doubts that the judge would have given the instruction if either side had requested it. Under such circumstances an accused should not be permitted to profit by his own failure to make the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">It is also clear that evidence of the prior altercation was properly admissible on the issue of malice to show appellant\u2019s state of mind and probable intent and to show motive, the identity of the aggressor and absence of any mistake or accident.

Cifarelli, 401 F.2d 512 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 987, 89 S.Ct. 465, 21 L.Ed.2d 448 (1968). A beneficial argument for appellant could also have been made to the jury that since the parties continued to live together thereafter the malice indicated was not so deep-seated as to indicate a desire to cause decedent any great bodily harm. Finally, since I find that it was proper for the court to interrogate the witness, Griffin v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 20, 21, 164 F.2d 903, 904 (1947), cert. denied, 333 U.S. 857, 68 S.Ct. 727, 92 L.Ed. 1137 (1948), that the instructions were proper on second degree murder and manslaughter, and otherwise, I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\">. The first instruction was given on August 21, 1968:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, before you can find this defendant, Earnest McClain, guilty of homicide in any degree, you must find the decedent in this case, Mary Prances McClain, did in fact die from the injuries incurred from a shove or push inflicted by this defendant, Earnest McClain. * * * If you find from the evidence, that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that he shoved or pushed the deceased, Mary Prances McClain, and the deceased fell to the ground hitting her head on the pavement, and such fall was wholly or in part the result of such a condition caused by the shove or push inflicted by the defendant, then you may find the decedent\u2019s death was caused by the defendant, Earnest McClain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">And if you find that the other essential elements of second-degree murder were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, or if you find that the other essential elements of the lesser included offense of manslaughter has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you may find the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The second instruction was given on the morning of August 22, 1968 at the request of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-14\">Now, with respect to manslaughter, the lesser included offense, I told you that manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. Now, manslaughter is committed when a person unlawfully kills another in a sudden heat of passion caused by adequate provocation. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another human being in a sudden heat of passion caused by adequate provocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">The first essential element of the offense of manslaughter is that the defendant, again, Earnest McClain, inflicted an injury or injuries upon the deceased resulting in her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-16\">\u00ed); :\u00a1; :\u00a1; $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-17\">So with respect to any consideration from the evidence to be given to the matter of manslaughter, the lesser included offense, there are four essential elements as I have just enumerated, each of which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: that he inflicted injuries upon the deceased from which she died; that at the time he inflicted the injuries he did so in the heat of passion; and that the heat of passion was induced or caused by adequate provocation; and, fourthly, that the homicide was committed without legal justification or excuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Now, as with the first essential element of the offense of second degree murder, to establish this first element it is necessary that the defendant have inflicted an injury or injuries upon the decedent from which the decedent died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">Malice is involved in second degree. Manslaughter is without malice. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">H? * H\u00ab * H\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">Now, in this case, before you ladies and gentlemen of the jury can find homicide to any degree, that is, second degree murder or manslaughter, you must find that the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mary Frances McClain did in fact die as a result of a shove or a push inflicted by the defendant. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">Thus if you find from the evidence in this case that the defendant shoved or. pushed Mary Frances McClain from the stoop and that she fell to the ground and she struck her head, and that this fall was the result either wholly or in part of a condition caused by the defendant when he shoved or pushed his wife, then you may find that the decedent\u2019s death, Mary Frances\u2019 death, was caused by the defendant. And if all of the other essential elements of the offense either of second degree murder or manslaughter have also been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you may find him guilty of such offense, whichever of the offenses you find have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Government in the presentation of the evidence to you in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-25\">Now, on the other hand, if you find from the evidence that the Government has failed to prove that the fall was caused in whole or in part by the defendant\u2019s shove or push of his wife from the porch, and that the fall was caused entirely by an intoxicated condition of Mary Frances McClain on this date, then you cannot find the defendant guilty of homicide to any degree. And, accordingly, you must acquit him.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-26\">. <em>See </em>note 1, majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">.
