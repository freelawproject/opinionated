Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner violated Section 8(a) (1) and (5) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-18\">The Court further finds that the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner violated Section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act by laying off its part-time employee, Patti Mauzey, is not supported by substantial evidence, and its order of reinstatement will not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-19\">Enforcement is therefore granted as to the Order of the Board except insofar as it relates to Patti Mauzey, and as to her the Order is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
