He was sentenced to concurrent 2 to 4 year terms on the first five counts, plus concurrent 2 to 4 year terms on the second four counts. The two sets of concurrent terms were ordered to run consecutively to each other. Thus his net sentence was a total of 4 to 8 years. His conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division without opinion on June 27, 1968. People v. Annunziato, 30 A.D.2d 775, 292 N.Y.S.2d 364 (1st Dept. 1968). Leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied on August 27, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\"> In his habeas corpus proceedings in the District Court, appellant, then incarcerated in Sing Sing Prison, raised four claims, only two of which were ruled upon by the District Court and are properly before us, appellant having exhausted his state remedies as to these two claims by raising them on his direct appeal and the unexhausted claims being unrelated to the exhausted ones.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that Judge Motley on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>May 20, 1970, after careful consideration, correctly rejected appellant\u2019s two exhausted claims, briefly summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">First, appellant claims that the imposition of consecutive sentences under the circumstances of this case constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. The separate counts, although arising from a similar course of criminal conduct, were sufficiently distinct to warrant consecutive sentences, which were well within the limits of New York law. N.Y. Penal Law of 1909, \u00a7 1633 (McKinney App. 1967) (perjury); N.Y. Penal Law of 1909, \u00a7 2190(4) (McKinney App.1967) (consecutive sentences). Appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of the statutes under which he was convicted and sentenced. Judge Motley properly rejected appellant\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment claim upon the authority of United States v. Dawson, 400 F.2d 194, 200 (2 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1023 (1969), the principles of which we hold are applicable to habeas corpus collateral attacks upon consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"> Second, appellant claims that his testimony under compulsion before the grand jury, because his failure to waive immunity would have resulted in dismissal from public employment, violated his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. True, the procedure under which appellant in 1965 was required to sign a waiver of immunity if he wished to remain in public employment, N.Y. City Charter, \u00a7 1123; N.Y. State Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 6, subsequently was condemned by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional testimonial compulsion. Sanitation Men v. Sanitation Comm\u2019r, 392 U.S. 280 (1968); Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273 (1968) ; Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). But here appellant was not prosecuted for <em>past </em>criminal activity based on what he was forced to reveal about himself; he was prosecuted for the <em>commission of a crime while testifying, </em>i. e. perjury. In short, while a public employee may not be put to the Hobson\u2019s Choice of self-incrimination or unemployment, he is not privileged to resort to the third alternative, i. e., lying. The Supreme Court has squarely so held. United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Motley properly rejected appellant\u2019s testimonial compulsion claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-12\">. In addition to the two claims ruled upon by the District Court, appellant also raised these claims: (1) improper use of the grand jury\u2019s inquisitorial power solely for the purpose of securing petitioner\u2019s indictment for perjury, in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (2) admission into evidence of material obtained through use of an electronic recording device, in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Since appellant had not exhausted his state remedies with respect to these two claims, the District Court properly declined to rule upon them, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c) (Supp. IV, 1965-68) ; United States ex rel. Levy v. McMann, 394 F.2d 402, 404-05 (2 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>1968) ; United States ex rel. Gentile v. Mancusi, 426 F.2d 238, 240 (2 Cir. 1970) ; and of course they are not before us on this appeal. We review only exhausted claims raised by a petition which included both exhausted and unexhausted claims. United States ex rel. Levy v. McMann, <em>supra, </em>at 404 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. See People v. Goldman, 21 N.Y.2d 152, 287 N.Y.S.2d 7, 234 N.E.2d 194 (1967), appeal dismissed for want of substantial federal question, 392 U.S. 643 (1968), rehearing denied, 393 U.S. 899 (1968). In <em>Goldman, </em>on facts closely analogous to those in the instant case, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed a perjury conviction of a New York City policeman who had signed a waiver of immunity prior to the <em>Garrity </em>decision in the Supreme Court and who had testified falsely before a grand jury regarding his association with a gambler. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in <em>Goldman </em>for want of a substantial federal question on June 17, 1968, seven days after its decisions in <em>Gardner </em>and <em>Sanitation Men.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-13\">. We do not express any opinion, nor did the District Court below, upon any possible \u201cduress\u201d defense which might have been available to appellant in the state trial court \u2014 referring to \u201cthe traditional doctrine that a person is not criminally responsible for an act committed under duress,\u201d United States v. Knox, <em>supra, </em>at 83, or where compulsion is \u201clikely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from making a free and rational choice.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 464-65 (1966) ; Garrity v. New Jersey, <em>supra, </em>at 497. No such claim was made in the District Court and no such defense was asserted in the state trial court (where the possibility of such defense would not have been known to appellant or his trial counsel).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
