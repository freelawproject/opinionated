We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\">On May 4, 1966 Skelton pleaded guilty to two counts of interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312. He was sentenced to serve an indeterminate sentence under the Youth Corrections Act. He now challenges the validity of those convictions on the ground that his guilty plea was not entered with an understanding of the consequences because he was not aware that he could be required to serve six years as a youth offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing the District Court found that Skelton had been fully advised of the maximum imposable sentence, both under the Youth Corrections Act and under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312, prior to the acceptance of the guilty plea. Therefore it concluded that his contention was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-12\">An examination of the entire record, including the transcript of Skelton\u2019s arraignment proceedings, shows beyond any doubt that Skelton was properly apprised of the consequences of his plea before it was entered. <em>See </em>Caraway v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 636; Curry v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 379; Smith v.
