ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">At issue is the ownership of a fund in which a deceased husband had an interest during his lifetime, and for which his widow and two of his creditors are now arrayed as competitors. The fund, consisting of the net proceeds of a sale of District of Columbia realty in 1963, is on deposit in an account in the names of Jacob S. Wall, the decedent, and Frances P. Wall, the widow, as tenants by the entireties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Wall died in 1965 and his estate has since been in administration under supervision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">In 1968, appellants, who are among Mr. Wall\u2019s creditors, petitioned the court for an order requiring appellee, the administrator <em>cum testamento annexo, </em>to take over the fund as an asset of the estate. The petition alleged that Mr. Wall was insolvent at death, and it envisioned further litigation to establish the rights of the parties in the fund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court ordered appellee to show cause and, after a hearing, denied the petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">Appellants contend that although they are creditors of an insolvent estate, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>were precluded by the District Court\u2019s ruling from proving that the fund, or at least a one-half interest therein, belonged to the estate. They argue that they were barred from offering such proof simply because the deposit was titled in the Walls as tenants by the entireties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On close review of the record, however, we think appellants faced much more formidable obstacles. Standing out in bold relief is the fact, alleged by appellee and not disputed by appellants, that the Walls had also held the real estate, from the sale of which the fund was derived, as tenants by the entireties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, evidence, such as it was but never contradicted, indicated a plan whereby the sale proceeds were deposited, in that form of cotenancy, as substituted security for an indebtedness previously secured by the lien of a deed of trust on the realty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question, then, is whether, in light of these additional circumstances, appellants made enough of a showing in the District Court to develop a triable issue as to the ownership of the fund. Concluding that they did not,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">The estate by the entireties subsists in the District of Columbia with its most distinctive common law features still intact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe tenancy by entireties,\u201d this Court has observed, \u201cis essentially a joint tenacy, modified by the common-law theory that husband and wife are one person.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the common law concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of marital unity has been abolished legislatively,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the peculiar advantages which the estate by the entireties offers its owners have sustained it in this jurisdiction and elsewhere as an ongoing and popular arrangement between husband and wife.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We ourselves have recognized that the marital relation is well served by a form of coownership safeguarding marital property from legal hazards which other types leave as exposures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And in the protection tenancy by the entireties affords the marital partners,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we have found solid justification for its continued existence in modern society.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">So it is with us today that the full complement of common law characteristics of cotenancy by the entireties is preserved. A unilaterally indestructible right of survivorship,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> an inability of one spouse to alienate his interest,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, importantly for this case, a broad immunity from claims of separate creditors <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> remain among its vital incidents. Property so held is, of course, liable for the spouses\u2019 joint debts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and for the individual debts of the surviving cotenant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But as long as the coverture is whole, an estate by the entireties unimpeachable at inception is unreachable by legal process at the instance of creditors of one but not of both.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And it matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>not in this jurisdiction whether the subject matter is real or personal since we recognize the estate, with the same qualities, in each.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">This is not to say, however, that rights and remedies of existing creditors can be obliterated by the simple expedient of erecting a tenancy by the entireties in property that is otherwise vulnerable. Husband and wife, of course, take the property subject to liens burdening it when the tenancy is born; beyond that, when such tenancies are created, the legal rules imperiling conveyances that hinder, delay or defraud creditors <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> must be respected.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If the inter-spousal transaction happens to infringe those rules, it is open to attack by affected creditors,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and herein appellants\u2019 salvation is to be found, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Uncontested allegations and representations in the record establish several circumstances that bear critically on the questions before us. The real estate, from the sale of which in 1963 the fund in litigation arose, was owned by the Walls as tenants by the entireties. The sale was not prompted by any purpose, at least on Mr. Wall\u2019s part, to dissolve that arrangement, but rather by an understandable inclination to rescue the Walls\u2019 investment from a foreclosure then imminent.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Mr. Wall desired the same type of ownership of the proceeds, and was opposed to any change,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> whatever Mrs. Wall\u2019s wishes on that score might have been.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He advocated, too, a deposit of the proceeds in the names of both spouses as \u201ctenants by the entire-ties,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and unquestionably that was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">The record discloses nothing that would serve to impeach, at the suit of creditors, the estate by the entireties which the Walls shared in the realty pri- or to its sale. It does not suggest that Mr. Wall was in financial straits when the estate came into being, or that he was then indebted to either appellant.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We know from Mr. Wall\u2019s letter that a foreclosure was threatened in 1962 when the Walls contracted to sell the property,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> but that fact sheds no light on their financial situation when it was acquired. Thus, from aught that appears, or that appellants proffered in the District Court, the Walls\u2019 tenancy by the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tireties therein was beyond attack by separate creditors.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It was, moreover, within the Walls\u2019 power to maintain in the sale proceeds the same estate they had in the realty. Where, as in the District of Columbia, personalty can be held by the entireties,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the great weight of authority is to the effect that, absent a contrary arrangement by the parties, an estate by the entireties preexisting in particular property continues automatically in its derivatives on disposition.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> That rule has been applied in a variety of contexts,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> including cash sales of realty<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> such as we have here. In this jurisdiction, the rule has been given specific application, in a situation similar to that now presented, over the protests of separate creditors.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This, we think, is as it should be. The rule continuing in derivatives the estate previously subsisting in the realty subserves the policy justifying present-day ownership by the entireties and enjoyment of its related incidents.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We perceive nothing in reason or legal principle to oppose it. And since the estate in the derivative is an extension of the estate, and not an interest newly created,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the rule does not operate to alter, one way or the other, the rights of existing creditors. We conclude, then, that absent a different treatment by the Walls, they held the sale proceeds as tenants by the entireties in prolongation of their preexisting cotenancy in the realty, and held it free from the claims of separate creditors of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">The question remains, then, whether the Walls modified their ownership of the proceeds so as to carve the fund on deposit into separate though undivided shares. In the District Court, in support of the order to show cause, appellants stated \u2014 and this was their sole proffer \u2014 that at an evidentiary hearing they would submit proof that the Walls had been separated since 1949, that Mr. Wall had filed a separate federal income tax return for 1963, and that in it he had reported as income the capital gain from the sale and the interest accruing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>deposit. But no more than the District Court could we accept such a showing as proof that the parties had mutually undertaken to dissolve what otherwise would have been a tenancy by the entire-ties in the deposited fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Mere separation is not tantamount to divorce, and only some kind of divorce can terminate the marital relation which is indispensible to ownership by the entireties.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We cannot assume that undivorced marital partners would normally desire to forego the advantages of an existing tenancy by the entireties simply because they are unwilling to share the same roof. Nor do we consider Mr. Wall\u2019s method of reporting 1963 income for tax purposes inconsistent with a continuing cotenancy of that type in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It was the parties\u2019 option to file either joint or separate federal income tax returns.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> No real significance can be attached to so common an occurrence as the filing of a separate return, particularly when the spouses live apart. And the record tells us why Mr. Wall filed a separate return embracing the entire income. A letter written by his accountant<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> referred to a large tax arising from the capital gain on the sale, for the payment of which the deposited fund ostensibly constituted the only available source, and proposed a course of action involving a withdrawal by mutual agreement coupled with a promptly filed return by Mr. Wall. The letter also disclosed that Mrs. Wall opposed withdrawals without some sort of settlement in her favor.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> His tax technique thus emerges as an expedient to enable discharge of a responsibility which was not wholly his. And the difficulty Mr. Wall experienced in getting to the money on deposit hardly assists the argument that the parties had separate shares in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Even more relevant, we think, are the uncontradicted circumstances surrounding th\u00e9 deposit. The record shows affirmatively that, whatever Mrs. Wall\u2019s inclination as to the division of the fund,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Mr. Wall would have no part of it. He declared unequivocally his desire not \u201cto terminate or partition the estate held as a tenancy by the entireties;\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> he disdained a trusteeship for distribution of the sale proceeds, and recommended their deposit in both parties\u2019 names as tenants by the entireties in order that they might \u201cstand pledged * * * as substituted security for the specific real estate required by our contract [of sale] to be released from the\u201d lien of a specified deed of trust.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> True it is that the record does not explicitly show such a security arrangement, but the fact that, in lieu of a distribution, the proceeds were deposited just as Mr. Wall requested suggests that his wishes were fully respected.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We are unable to see how the neb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ulous inferences appellants seek to draw from the Walls\u2019 separation and from Mr. Wall\u2019s 1963 tax return could reasonably be accepted by a finder of the facts in preference to what other facts rather plainly indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The case would be different if the circumstances surrounding the deposit had aroused a suspicion of fraud on creditors.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> So it would also be if appellants had proffered evidence that might establish some ground from which the administrator might legitimately have launched an attack on the deposit arrangement. The record indicates satisfactorily, however, that the Walls\u2019 cotenancy in the fund was free from taint, and what appellants advanced fell short of posing a meritorious challenge to the fund on deposit. The District Court was entirely right in viewing the situation before it as one lacking justification for the requested direction to appellee, or for a full-scale evidentiary hearing on the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The order appealed from is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">. There were also, at Mr. Wall\u2019s death, parcels of District real estate which the Walls had acquired in 1936 and 1942 as tenants by the entireties, and to which Mrs. Wall lays claim as surviving cotenant. They are not involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\">. A similar effort in 1967, by appellant Alpher alone, seems to have foundered on a ruling that the District Court\u2019s probate jurisdiction did not extend to the determination of conflicting property claims. See Jones v. Dunlap, 73 App.D.C. 59, 115 F.2d 689 (1940). After our decision in Price v. Williams, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 242-243, 393 F.2d 348, 351-352 (1968), both appellants made the second try. But see Anderson v. Pinkett, 142 U.S.App.D.C. -, 439 F.2d 619 (1971), decided after the case at bar was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">We are not, however, faced with the question involved in those cases. Appellants have not sought to compel Mrs. Wall to pay the deposited fund into court; indeed, she was not even made a party to the show cause proceeding. Bather, appellants asked the District Court, sitting as the Probate Court, to direct the administrator of the estate to take action to gain possession of the fund. That effort was nothing more than an invocation by estate creditors of the Probate Court\u2019s undoubted authority to instruct a personal representative as to his duties. Compare Heilman v. Ginberg, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 284 F.2d 239 (1960). The question as to the forum in which the personal representative might properly bring his action was never reached. Had it been reached in consequence of sustaining appellants\u2019 position on the order to show cause, it would have been for the Probate Court to instruct in that regard too.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-5\">.

In the letter, Mr. Wall stated that \u201c[t]lic sale herein was not motivated by intent or agreement on my part to terminate or partition the estate held as a tenancy by the entireties.

Creditors of a partnership attached the proceeds arising from the sale by McNett, one of the partners, and his wife of real estate owned by them as tenants by the entireties. The trial court quashed the attachment and the creditors, on appeal, argued that \u201cthe proceeds of the sale were in a \u2018conduit\u2019 (the title company), subject to the separate claims of McNett and his wife, who because they had taken no action to define their interest in the fund or create an entirety interest therein had nothing more than an estate in common.\u201d 154 A.2d at 350. The appellate court rejected that argument, which it could not have done unless the McNetts\u2019 estate in the proceeds was merely a continuation of their estate in the realty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">.

While Mr. Wall made explicit his opposition to any division of the sale proceeds, Mrs. Wall\u2019s position, as we have indicated, was somewhat more ambiguous. But it matters not that, contrary to Mr. Wall, she may have wanted the fund divided. \u201cPresumably, * * * husband and wife may agree to split the estate [by the entireties preexisting in the realty] of its attributes and create a new and wholly different type of ownership [in the proceeds from its sale]; <em>but it xoould have to be done jointly.\" </em>Held v. McNett, <em>supra </em>note 35, 154 A.2d at 350 (emphasis supplied). This but recognizes a fundamental characteristic of tenancy by the entireties, be it in real or personal property: the inability, while the coverture subsists, of one spouse to force a partition of the subject property upon the other.
