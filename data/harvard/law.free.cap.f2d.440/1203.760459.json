He served two years at the Federal Institution at Ashland, Kentucky, and was released on parole prior to Casiano\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-20\">In 1969 a second, superseding indictment was filed against Casiano alone. In it the Grand Jury alleged that Casiano had unlawfully transferred 1.587 kilograms to Goldenbaum on May 2 and six kilograms to Fuselli on May 9. Trial was to a jury which acquitted Casiano on the May 2 count but convicted him on the May 9 count. Casiano was sentenced to a five year term of imprisonment which he is presently serving, and he appeals his conviction upon the May 9 count. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-21\">Other than the government chemist who testified that the substance alleged<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>ly transferred by Casiano was indeed marijuana, the only other government witness was Agent Goldenbaum. He told the jury that he telephoned Fuselli on the morning of May 9 seeking to make a purchase of 25 pounds of marijuana. Fuselli asked him to come to Fuselli\u2019s apartment at noontime. When Goldenbaum arrived, accompanied by an informant, Fuselli stated that the marijuana was not then available because \u201chis man, Ralphie,\u201d was working at the time and was unable to make the delivery. Goldenbaum was told to return at 7:00 P.M., by which time \u201cRalphie\u201d would be able to deliver the marijuana. Goldenbaum further testified that he returned at the appointed time, again with the informant, and was introduced by Fuselli to \u201cRalphie,\u201d the appellant Casiano, in the living room of the apartment;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that, \u201cdrifting\u201d into the kitchen, Fuselli indicated that he had only 15 pounds but could obtain the rest the next day; that Goldenbaum consented to that arrangement; that Fuselli then went into the living room, returned to the kitchen with a shopping bag holding eight bricks of marijuana, and placed the bag on the kitchen floor; and that Casiano, whose presence in the kitchen had not been previously mentioned by Goldenbaum, then took a scale from the oven and began to weigh and mark the bricks; that Goldenbaum ordered the informant to leave the apartment to get the purchase money; and that Casiano told Fuselli to go with the informant and \u201cwatch him.\u201d Fuselli was arrested soon after he left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">In a conversation following the departure of the informer and Fuselli, Goldenbaum testified that Casiano told Goldenbaum to approach him directly in the future and thereby to eliminate the expense of a middleman; he bragged that he could provide \u201cup to half a ton, if you want it,\u201d and explained that Fuselli was a $50-a~week employee who kept the marijuana in his apartment and took the risk of meeting potential purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">About this time other agents entered the apartment and arrested Casiano. A search revealed that he was carrying approximately $1,070 in cash on his person, of which $250 was part of the money Goldenbaum had given to Fuselli when the May 2 purchase was consummated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">Fuselli was the only defense witness. He admitted making the May 2 sale and negotiating the May 9 sale but adamantly denied that Casiano was in any way involved in either transaction. He stated that he had asked Casiano to hold some $400-450 for him during the evening of May 9 because he had a feeling that he would be arrested that night, as indeed he was. When so arrested Fuselli had no money on his person. He testified that one \u201cBob Loco,\u201d a Roberto Morales, who was said to have been in the apartment when Casiano was arrested, was his \u201cconnection,\u201d not Casiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">On cross-examination Fuselli conceded that he had told two Assistant United States Attorneys, once prior to his trial, and once while at Ashland, that he had been selling for Casiano and that Loco was only Casiano\u2019s delivery boy. On re-direct he explained that the first statement was made solely in hope of being released, and the second so as to increase the likelihood of his obtaining parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">Appellant, relying on Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), complains that the prosecution should have been compelled to produce the informant, or, at least, to reveal his name, because only he could confirm or deny the conflicting testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ny relative to most of the events of May 9. The defense certainly could have used corroboration of Fuselli\u2019s version of the meetings in light of his inconsistent out-of-court statements. \u201cWhere the disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity, or the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\u201d <em>Roviaro, swpra, </em>at 60-61, 77 S.Ct. at 628. The privilege exists to further and protect \u201cthe public interest in effective law enforcement,\u201d <em>Roviaro, supra, </em>at 59, 77 S.Ct. at 627, and though its protection is not absolute, a showing of one or more of the factors named above is a mandatory precedent to forced disclosure. Nevertheless, after making a most perfunctory request for the informant\u2019s name<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the court rejected \u201cat this time,\u201d no attempt was made to justify a real need for the disclosure, nor was the request ever later renewed. Under the circumstances of this case, the court\u2019s ruling was proper. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that a forced disclosure here would have been immaterial to the case for the defense. First, it is not unreasonable to assume that Fuselli knew the informant inasmuch as he had been initially introduced to Goldenbaum by him. Defense counsel\u2019s question, \u201cWas his name Jamie ?\u201d lends support to the inference that Casiano also knew him. Moreover, Casiano made no attempt to produce Morales (or Loco) who was also present when the transfer occurred. And in any event the informant was not present when Casiano claimed to Goldenbaum that he was Fuselli\u2019s supplier, the most damaging testimony to the defense in the case if the jury believed the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-23\">Appellant\u2019s other claims can be summarily dismissed. A six-pronged attack upon the court\u2019s charge to the jury is without merit. The charge properly defined the jury\u2019s role in weighing credibility, a crucial factor in the case, and properly applied the law relative to the facts. The appellant\u2019s four other claims concerning the charge are also devoid of any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-24\">Finally, appellant argues that the record is devoid of any proof of any transfer of marijuana to Fuselli by Casiano on May 9. However, there was ample evidence that Casiano on that date supplied the 15 pounds which Fuselli later attempted to sell to Goldenbaum. And there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to conclude that Fuselli was not acting as Casiano\u2019s agent in the transaction. Fuselli brought the mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>juana into the kitchen from another part of his own apartment; and Casiano\u2019s offer to save Goldenbaum money by eliminating the middleman suggests that Fuselli had at least some power to set his own prices or was getting a cut of the money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">. It appears that both Fuselli and Casiano were charged with violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a on the two occasions and with violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4744(a) and 7237(b) with respect to the May 9 transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">. Also present in the apartment, according to Goldenbaum, was Roberto Morales (Bob Loco) who was arrested but not prosecuted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">. Goldenbaum\u2019s testimony that he had carefully noted the serial numbers on the bills with which he had made the May 2 purchase was the subject of extensive cross-examination in an effort to impeach the agent\u2019s credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">.

Although the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury did not define a \u201ctransfer\u201d with precision, they did convey the concept that the acts of one\u2019s agent are one\u2019s own acts, which in turn suggests that a merely physical transfer to one\u2019s agent is not a \u201ctransfer\u201d under \u00a7 4742(a). A more explicit statement would certainly have been desirable, but none of appellant\u2019s objections to the charge suggested, even indirectly, the need for clarification. Appellant is therefore precluded from pressing the claim before us. Cf. United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2 Cir. 1965) (en <em>banc), </em>cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1264-5\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AnJ1\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">I would reverse this conviction since the jury was not adequately instructed with respect to what facts it was obliged to find in order to convict Casiano of a \u201ctransfer\u201d to Fuselli.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">Although 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4742(a) does not define the meaning of \u201ctransfer,\u201d some light is cast by the penalty provision, \u00a7 7237(b), which refers to \u201cthe sale, barter, exchange, giving away, or transfer.\u201d This indicates an intention on the part of Congress that something more is required than the mere handing of marijuana from one person to another without any change in effective control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">If Fuselli was merely Casiano\u2019s servant, it is very old law that no change in possession was effected. See Holmes, The Common Law 179 (Howe ed. 1963). The Government therefore was required to show that Fuselli was acting as a principal, either because he had acquired title to the marijuana or, at the very least, because Casiano had put the marijuana in his hands to do with as he wished. While it may be that the Government produced evidence barely sufficient to warrant submission of this issue to the jury, Casiano was entitled to an instruction which clearly pointed up what the issue was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">I find nothing in the charge which sufficiently enlightened the jury on this subject. The judge defined a transfer as \u201cthe giving, the turning over of marijuana either by yourself or by your agent in your behalf.\u201d This language was apt enough with respect to the first count, but gave no help on the second. Indeed, it was quite confusing because the first count alleged, in effect, that Fuselli was Casiano\u2019s employee in the earlier transaction, whereas the second alleged, in effect, that Fuselli was something more in the second. The difficulty was compounded by a further instruction that \u201cif you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly had control over that marijuana, either actually or constructively, you may convict him.\u201d While the objection of defense counsel could have been more clearly stated, he said enough to raise the point. In any event I would apply the plain error rule in so close a case as this.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
