The first is that there can be no likelihood of confusion between the parties\u2019 marks because the respective goods are so different in use, in principal outlets, in methods of display, etc., that no one would expect or assume that they originated from a common source. We agree with the board that the goods are not that diverse. We are especially persuaded by the fact that appellant has registered the mark GLEEM for both a dentifrice and a cleaning compound. While that mark has not been actively promoted for the latter, we find that appellant has placed itself in an awkward position from which to argue that confusion as to source would be unlikely in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">Appellant also contends that appellee\u2019s conduct has nullified any likelihood of confusion. This contention is based on appellee Johnson\u2019s extensive promotion of its name with respect to waxes. Appellant contends, with some support in the record, that appellee is generally known as \u201cJohnson\u2019s Wax\u201d rather than as S. C. Johnson &amp; Son or some similar name. Appellant argues from this that the public knows appellee as a producer of waxes and would not think that a dentifrice, even one bearing a mark identical to the mark used by appellee on a cleaner, came from that company. We disagree. We note that appellee\u2019s FORWARD cleaner is not a wax product but principally a non-ionic detergent with certain chelating and germicidal additives. Moreover, we do not know how many purchasers would be aware that FORWARD cleaner was made by \u201cJohnson\u2019s Wax\u201d or whether they would be at all influenced by the fact that the company has been in the past associated with a particular narrow line of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1081-18\">. Application serial No. 221,846, filed June 23, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1081-20\">.

I feel that the mark <em>Forward </em>is a weak, laudatory mark and that there would be no likelihood of confusion as to source when that mark is used on the goods of these two parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
