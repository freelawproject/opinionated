Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1121-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1121-22\">This appeal is taken from an order of the district court denying the petition of a federal prisoner seeking to void a detainer warrant filed against him by the State of Texas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-23\">Appellant was convicted in the Texas state court of bank robbery and was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment. While confined in the Dallas County jail, pending his direct appeal, he escaped with a codefendant. To implement their escape they forced a postal employee out of a United States postal vehicle and used it in their effort to get away. Five days later appellant was arrested and returned to the Dallas jail. He was subsequently charged with a federal violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114 and the state turned him over to federal authorities for prosecution. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment in the federal penitentiary, where he is presently incarcerated. See Dorrough v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 385 F.2d 887 and 397 F.2d 811 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-24\">The State of Texas has filed a detain-er against Dorrough for the enforcement of the twenty-five year bank robbery sentence. Appellant contends that by turning him over to federal authorities the state surrendered jurisdiction and waived future jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-25\">It is well settled that where state authorities surrender a prisoner to federal authorities for prosecution and service of sentence, the state has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>waived its right to have the prisoner returned to its custody for trial or service of sentence, Montos v. Smith, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1243; Bullock v. Mississippi, 5 Cir., 1968, 404 F.2d 75; Bilton v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 664. The circumstances which constituted a waiver of jurisdiction in Shields v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1967, 370 F.2d 1003, are not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
