The suits in each court charged infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s patent No. 2,129,332 by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its affiliates which were named as defendants, the alleged infringing device in each suit being substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s sole contention on these appeals is that the New York court determined noninfringement of claims 1, 2 and 3 of the patent only and did not determine the question of infringement of the remaining 8 claims, so that the question of infringement of the latter is still open to litigation in the present suits. It is true that Chief Judge Ryan in his opinion in the District Court for the Southern District of New York referred to and discussed claims 1, 2 and 3 specifically. But it appears that these claims had been presented to the court by the plaintiff as typical and not as the only claims infringed. On the contrary, in the complaint in the New York case the patent as a whole was alleged to have been infringed and in the judgment entered in that case the complaint in its entirety was dismissed upon the merits. The New York judgment was thus a general judgment which adjudicated that there had been no infringement of the patent as a whole, not merely of a particular claim. General Motors Corporation v. Leer Auto Supply Co., 2 Cir. 1932, 60 F.2d 902, 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">Under these circumstances, the fact that Chief Judge Ryan in his opinion discussed claims 1, 2 and 3, which the plaintiff had stressed as typical, is of no significance. Marshall v. Bryant Electric Co., 1 Cir. 1911, 185 F. 499, 500-501; General Ry. Signal Co. v. Union Simplex Train C. Co., D.C.Del.1938, 23 F.Supp. 667, 670-671, aff. 3 Cir. 1939, 106 F.2d 1018, cert. den. 309 U.S. 678, 60 S.Ct. 716, 84 L.Ed. 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">Since these cases did not involve any genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment of dismissal was rightly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
