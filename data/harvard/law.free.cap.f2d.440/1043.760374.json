Larson, United States District Judge, District of Minnesota, advised appellant that trial would commence in about two weeks; (3) on April 1, 1970, appellant appeared before Judge Larson, accompanied by his retained counsel, and asked leave of court to withdraw his plea of not guilty to Count I of the indictment and to enter a plea of guilty to the same count; (4) the Court then addressed the appellant personally and interrogated him concerning whether the plea was made voluntarily, with understanding as to the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (5) the Judge\u2019s interrogation of the appellant was then, upon invitation of the Court, supplemented by interrogation by the Assistant United States Attorney with some questions also being asked by appellant\u2019s counsel; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (6) as a result of the Court\u2019s personal interrogation, the appellant stated that he entered his plea of guilty to Count I \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and \u201cwillingly\u201d ; that no threats or coercion or promises had been made to him by any representative of the Government; that he was 34 years- of age and had two years of college; that he understood the nature of the charge, and in his own words: \u201cI feel I am charged with possession of counterfeit notes, your Honor;\u201d that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>understood the maximum penalty was a fine of $5,000 or 15 years imprisonment; (7) in response to inquiry by the Assistant United States Attorney the appellant affirmed in more detail that he possessed the counterfeit notes on the approximate date charged in the indictment ; that he intended to purchase money orders with them; that he understood: (a) his rights to trial by jury; (b) the burden of proof on the Government to prove each and every element of the crime; (c) the presumption of innocence; (d) his rights to take the stand or not to; and (e) his rights to produce evidence and cross examine; (8) thereupon, the Court directed that the plea of guilty to Count I be entered and deferred sentencing pending a presentence investigation and report and continued appellant\u2019s bond previously posted; (9) on May 26, 1970, at the time fixed for sentencing, appellant through his counsel filed written motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty and stand trial thereon; (10) in an affidavit in support of said motion, appellant stated that his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty was based on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-9\">' \u201c1. That he was unaware that the instruments, Twenty-dollar Federal Reserve Notes, were in fact forged and counterfeit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-10\">2. That he was impressed by Secret Service Agents with the fact that any information given to them would be kept in confidence and would in fact not be used against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">(11) on May 27, 1970, the Court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. Appellant commenced the hearing by announcing through counsel that he would stand on the affidavit submitted in support of the motion. The Government then called the two Secret Service Agents who had interrogated appellant before and after the indictment was filed herein. The latter interview took place after appellant entered his plea of guilty and was conducted in the presence of appellant\u2019s counsel. Appellant then testified in rebuttal; (12) on May 27,1970, Judge Larson announced his findings \u201c * * * I find that the plea of guilty was voluntarily, advisedly, intentionally and understandingly entered, and I will therefore deny the motion to withdraw the plea of guilty to Count I of the indictment.\u201d The Court then proceeded with sentencing and imposed a six-year indeterminate sentence under the provisions of Title 18 \u00a7 4208(a) (2); (13) on June 5, 1970, appellant filed notice of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-13\">\u201c1. That evidence was obtained by trick or artifice by Government Agents and that defendant was informed, by Government Agents, that it would not be used against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-14\">2. That defendant was advised to and did in fact, plead guilty upon advice of counsel, who was not informed as to how evidence was obtained until after the plea was entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-15\">(14) on June 16, 1970, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reduction of bond pending appeal and among other things noted that \u201cthe appeal is frivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">Appellant specifies one error in his brief as follows: \u201cThe Trial Court erred in allowing interrogation with respect to the truth of the appellant\u2019s confession.\u201d (Said interrogation took place during the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty). However, a fair reading of his entire brief indicates appellant\u2019s principal complaint on this appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty before sentencing despite the fact that he \u201cdisavowed the volition incident to the [oral] confession.\u201d In substance, appellant claims in this appeal that Government agents obtained information (an oral confession) from him under the guise and promise that the same would be kept in confidence and not be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-18\">In considering appellant\u2019s claims we observe that a defendant has no ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>solute right to withdraw a plea of guilty before sentence. Allowance of the same is within the sound discretion of the trial court which will be reversed only upon a finding of an abuse of that discretion. Pitt v. United States, 378 F.2d 608, 611 (8th Cir. 1967); Hughes v. United States, 371 F.2d 694 (8th Cir. 1967); Smith v. United States, 359 F.2d 481, 483 (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Before accepting a guilty plea the trial court must comply with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as follows: \u201c * * * The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea * * * without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. * * * The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 463-464, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1169, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 makes it abundantly clear \u201cthat a defendant is entitled to plead anew if a United States district court accepts his guilty plea without fully adhering to the procedure provided for in Rule 11.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record establishes that the District Judge complied with Rule 11. He addressed the defendant personally and made the requisite inquiries. In addition, the Court invited the Assistant United States Attorney to make supplemental inquiry of the defendant. The latter was more detailed in some areas and, when added to the Judge\u2019s personal inquiry, it fully developed a record that demonstrates appellant\u2019s plea of guilty was freely and intelligently made with full knowledge of the consequences thereof and that there was a basis for the plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">Appellant\u2019s complaint that a Secret Service Agent tricked him into giving information under the guise that the same was confidential and would not be used against him and that appellant\u2019s counsel advised appellant to plead guilty without being informed as to how such evidence was obtained, is without merit. We have already found that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was accepted by the trial court after full compliance with Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Once it has been established that Rule 11 has been fully complied with the occasion for setting aside a guilty plea should seldom arise. This record demonstrates the soundness of Rule 11. In this instance, since judgment had not been imposed, the Court properly granted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. Despite compliance with Rule 11, there remained a slight possibility that the defendant may not have understood all of the essential elements of the crime. Compare <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>Fn. 20 at 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166. However, the post-plea hearing demonstrates the frivolity of appellant\u2019s claim in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">Appellant\u2019s further claim that the Court erred in permitting counsel for the Government to cross-examine appellant regarding the falsity of his affidavit is frivolous. And his claim that he was tricked into orally admitting certain matters and that the same prompted his plea of guilty is equally devoid of merit and requires no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>In. summary we find: (1) that the trial court complied with Rule 11 in this case; (2) that supplemental inquiry of the defendant by counsel on the record before the plea is accepted by the Court, although not a substitute for the duties of personal interrogation required of the Court by Rule 11, is helpful in developing a record that will demonstrate that defendant\u2019s plea of guilty is an informed plea, voluntarily given, with full knowledge of the consequences, and that there exists a factual basis for the plea; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (3) that the evidence presented at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea when considered in light of the record made at the time appellant entered his guilty plea demonstrates the frivolity of appellant\u2019s claims; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion or commit error in denying defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">THE COURT: And you do wish, Mr. Rawlins, to enter a plea of guilty to Count 1?</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Hon- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">THE COURT: Have you discussed this matter thoroughly with your counsel, Mr. Bialick?</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">THE COURT: Mr. Bialick, have you discussed the matter thoroughly with Mr. Rawlins?</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">MR.

SHAPIRO: Yes, it is, Your Hon- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-32\">THE COURT: And do you understand, Mr. Rawlins, that Congress has imposed a maximum penalty for an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>fense of this kind of a fine of $5,000, or 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, or both?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">THE DEFENDANT: No, Your Hon- or, I wasn\u2019t aware of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">THE COURT: Well, it is the maximum penalty, isn\u2019t it, Mr. Shapiro?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">MR. SHAPIRO: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">THE COURT: That is the maximum penalty, Mr. Rawlins. Do you now understand that that is the maximum penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">THE COURT: A fine of $5,000, or 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, or both?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">THE COURT: Is there any other inquiry you wish to make, Mr. Shapiro ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-13\">MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-14\">(To the Defendant) Mr. Rawlins, you had possession of counterfeit money, and about when did you have that money?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-16\">MR. SHAPIRO: The indictment charges the 4th day of October in the year 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-17\">THE DEFENDANT: All right, about the 4th of October.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-18\">MR. SHAPIRO: Is that the approximate date?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-19\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s approximate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-20\">MR. SHAPIRO: Now, what were you going to do with that money? (No answer.) You didn\u2019t just have it to hold onto it, is that correct? Do you understand what I\u2019m getting at?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-21\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-22\">MR. SHAPIRO: Well, what did you do with the money? (Pause.) Well, did you pass any of the money?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-23\">THE DEFENDANT: You mean, was the money in my possession?

BIALICK: And it was your intention to purchase money orders with these nine $20 bills?</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-35\">THE . DEFENDANT: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-36\">MR.

Set out in Appendix B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">. <em>McCarthy </em>applies to guilty pleas entered after April 2, 1969. Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969). It has been so applied in this Circuit, United States v. Cody, 438 F.2d 287 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">. We note that in the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, appellant admitted he knew the notes were forged and counterfeit. In <em>McCarthy </em>at 394 U.S. p. 470, 89 S.Ct. p. 1173, it is observed that \u201cThere is no adequate substitute for demonstrating in the record at the time the plea is entered the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge against him.\u201d The facts developed at the hearing held on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty substantiates the correctness of the trial court\u2019s previous determination to accept the guilty plea and further supports the conclusion that there was a factual basis for the plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1105-15\">. The Bench Book For United States District Judges (United States v. Cody, <em>supra, </em>Appendix) is helpful in developing a full record. However, a large number of arraignments covering a variety of crimes, may lead to an inadvertent oversight of an essential element of a particular crime. Government counsel will be more familiar with the charge and the circumstances indicating defendant\u2019s guilt. Controversy may have developed prior to entry of the plea over a confession, seizure of evidence, defendant\u2019s health and use of drugs, and many other factors which might affect defendant\u2019s plea. In short, supplemental inquiry can be very helpful to the Court in discharging its duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1105-34\">. Each case of this kind must stand on its own factual basis. We do not believe that the holding in <em>Cody </em>has a factual parallel or effective application here. The facts in this case as set forth in the Appendix distinguish it from <em>Cody.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
