Accordingly, for the reasons stated by the district court in Miller v. Richardson, 325 F.Supp. 91 (S.D.W.Va. October 20, 1970), the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1053-19\">. Subsequent to presentation of oral argument on appeal counsel for appellant tendered to us two medical reports, namely, a report from Dr. William B. Kossman dated January 13, 1970, and a report from Dr. F. M. Viscuse dated June 13, 1970. Counsel represents by letter that said reports were before the Appeals Council and also before the district court but though some inadvertence were not included in the record transmitted to this court on appeal. For purposes of review we have considered these reports as part of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
