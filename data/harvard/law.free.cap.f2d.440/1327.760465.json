We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-16\">The appellant seeks relief on grounds that he was misled as to the maximum sentence imposable under counts of his indictment alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, subsections (a) and (b), and conspiracy to commit bank burglary in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. He pled guilty to the \u00a7 371 and \u00a7 2113(b) counts; and the more serious \u00a7 2113(a) count was dismissed on motion of the government. The record does not conclusively show whether the appellant was in fact unaware of the original maximum imposable prison sentence, which was 25 years rather than 35 years as Erwin avers he thought it was. The district court denied relief on grounds that the appellant\u2019s decision to plead guilty resulted from a co-conspirator's having given heavily damaging testimony against him at the start of his trial; that Erwin conferred at length with his counsel before pleading guilty; and that the United States Attorney correctly advised Erwin of the maximum prison terms for the counts on which he pled guilty. We agree that the record supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-17\">Moreover, this court <em>en banc </em>recently overruled the two principal cases on which appellant relies, Stephen v. United States, 5th Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 257, and Grant v. United States, 5th Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 273. United States v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>Woodall, 5th Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 1317 [February 24, 1971]. The order of the district court is therefore due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1386-9\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se ease summarily, pursuant to this court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
