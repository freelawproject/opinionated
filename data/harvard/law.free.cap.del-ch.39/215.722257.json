J., and Wolcott and Bramhall, JJ., sitting.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-6\">Bramhall, Justice:</author>\n<p id=\"AMB\">Plaintiff instituted suit against defendants charging defendants with fraud and misrepresentation in obtaining title to certain of plaintiff\u2019s patents and in causing plaintiff to execute an agreement assigning certain rights thereto to Fish. Defendants filed a motion for dismissal, alleging that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that the complaint failed to set forth with sufficient particularity a claim upon which relief might be granted. Defendants also objected to plaintiff\u2019s numerous interrogatories. The Chancellor denied both defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and defendants\u2019 objections to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories. Defendants appealed. Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion presents three questions: (1) Is the order of the Chancellor denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that the action is barred by the statute of limitations an appealable order within the meaning of <em>Article IV, Section </em>11(4), of the <em>Delaware Constitution, Del.C.Ann.?; </em>(2) Is the order of the Chancellor denying Pacific\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint does not set forth with sufficient particularity a claim upon which relief might be granted an appealable order?; (3) Is the order of the Chancellor denying defendants\u2019 objections to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories an appealable order ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">1. Motion to dismiss because of bar of statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The question of whether or not the Chancellor\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss upon the ground that the action is barred by the statute of limitations is determined by our decision as to whether or not the denial of this motion disposed of substantial issues and established legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\"><em>Article IV, Section </em>11(4), of the Constitution of 1897, authorizes this Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201cTo receive appeals from the Court of Chancery and to determine finally all matters of appeal in the interlocutory or final decrees and other proceedings in chancery\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">As plaintiff\u2019s somewhat voluminous complaint was construed by the Chancellor, plaintiff prayed for recision of certain transactions involving patents, damages and other relief. Defendants were charged with a breach of fiduciary relationship and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The Chancellor held that at this stage of the proceedings the statute of limitations per se has no application. The Chancellor did not, however, foreclose defendants from pressing this defense at the trial. What he did, in effect, was to say that he did not desire to pass upon this question at this stage of the proceedings but desired further information by way of the trial before making his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Not every denial of a motion to dismiss constitutes an appealable order; there must be a substantial issue with legal rights established. <em>DuPont v. DuPont, </em>32 <em>Del.Ch. </em>405, 82 <em>A.2d 376. </em>On a motion to dismiss, all inferences are construed in favor of plaintiff. See 2 <em>Moore\u2019s Fed. Pr., Second Edition, </em>\u00a7 12.08, <em>p. </em>2245. A court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless it appears to a reasonable certainty that under no state of facts which could be proved to support the claim asserted would plaintiff be entitled to relief. Mere vagueness or a lack of detail are not alone sufficient ground to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Danby v. Osteopathic Hospital Ass\u2019n of Delaware, </em>34 <em>Del.Ch. 172, </em>101 <em>A.2d </em>308, 315, <em>affirmed </em>34 <em>Del.Ch. </em>427, 104 <em>A.2d </em>903.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The language of the complaint charges defendants in somewhat general terms with the breach of a fiduciary relationship. If, as defendants contend, the language is vague and somewhat uncertain, defendants by discovery can easily cure such uncertainty or ambiguity. The Chancellor\u2019s decision was a matter lying entirely within his discretion. Since he made no order relative to the question of the statute of limitations \u2014 deciding to reserve his decision until the trial of the case \u2014 there is no order from which defendants can appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>2. Motion of Pacific to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">This question involves also the determination of whether or not the Chancellor\u2019s refusal to dismiss the complaint as to Pacific disposed of any substantial issue or established a legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The nub of Pacific\u2019s motion is that plaintiff in his complaint has failed to set forth with sufficient particularity the facts upon which he bases his claim against Pacific. Pacific\u2019s argument runs something like this: In paragraph 46 of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, he charges conspiracy. Pacific is not therein connected in any manner with any overt act. Plaintiff withdrew his charge of conspiracy. If you take from the complaint the language upon which the allegation of conspiracy is based, there is nothing left except a bare statement of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Pacific alleges that the refusal of the Court to dismiss the complaint deprived it of substantial rights. Pacific also suggests, citing <em>DuPont v. DuPont, supra, </em>that the failure of plaintiff in his complaint to give Pacific due notice of the specific charges of wrong-doing raises the question of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The allegations involving Pacific are quite meager. Nevertheless, after eliminating the specific charge of conspiracy, plaintiff has still charged in general terms that Pacific was involved in the commission of a joint tort by aiding and abetting Fish in the performance of the wrongful acts charged against Fish and by causing devices based upon plaintiff\u2019s inventions and patents to be manufactured for the account of Pacific and other defendants without compensation to plaintiff. While <em>Rule 9(b) </em>of the Court of Chancery, <em>Del.C.Ann., </em>provides that in all averments of fraud the circumstances thereof shall be stated with particularity, nevertheless, it is a rule of procedure and the action of the Chancellor in refusing to dismiss the complaint upon this ground was a matter lying within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Pacific has not been harmed because, as heretofore stated, it can undoubtedly proceed by discovery to ascertain all the facts upon which plaintiff\u2019s claim against it is based, and, if the facts are not sufficient, it may move for judgment under <em>Rule 56(b). </em>In any event, no substantial issue has been determined nor has any legal right been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>established by the Chancellor\u2019s ruling. Obviously, there is no question of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">3. Denial of defendants\u2019 objection to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Chancellor\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 objections to certain interrogatories raises the question as to whether this is an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Plaintiff filed numerous interrogatories. Defendants took exception to all of them upon the ground that they were unduly numerous, harassing, sought beliefs rather than facts and sought confidential information irrelevant to the issues and prejudicial to defendants\u2019 business if they should be made available to competitors. In denying defendants\u2019 objections, the Chancellor noted that with the exception of the alleged confidential matter, the relevancy of the matters sought was not questioned. As to the alleged confidential matter, the Chancellor stated that this matter was relevant and that since plaintiff sought only answers within the knowledge of defendants, no objection to the interrogatories may be based upon an alleged confidential status.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The Court has broad discretion in determining whether or not to allow discovery under Rule 33 of the Court of Chancery (similar in all respects to Rule 33 of the Rules of Federal Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.). <em>Newell v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>10 <em>Cir., </em>1944, 144 <em>F.2d </em>338; <em>De Bruce v. Pennsylvania R. Co., D.C.E.D.Pa. </em>1947, 6 <em>F.R.D. </em>403. It has been said that in the exercise of the Court\u2019s discretion discovery should be allowed unless the Court is satisfied that the administration of justice will be impeded by such an allowance. <em>Mall Tool Co. v. Sterling Varnish Co., D.C.W.D.Pa. </em>1951, 11 <em>F.R.D. </em>576; <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>3 <em>Cir., </em>1945, 153 <em>F.2d </em>212, <em>affirmed </em>1947, 329 <em>U.S. </em>495, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>385, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>451. See 4 <em>Moore\u2019s Fed. Pr., </em>\u00a7 33.27, p. 2339. The order of the Chancellor in directing the defendants to answer the interrogatories did not determine any substantial issues nor establish any legal rights. It was therefore not appealable. <em>State v. Arns, 72 Iowa </em>555, 34 <em>N.W. </em>329; <em>Mackowain v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>369 <em>Pa. </em>581, 87 <em>A.2d </em>314, 37 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>584. See citations 37 <em>A.L.R. 2d </em>586, 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Defendants complied with the Chancellor\u2019s order and answered all the interrogatories. The appeal is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
