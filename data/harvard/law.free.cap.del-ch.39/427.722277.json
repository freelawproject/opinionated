The essential question concerns the computation of the time required to give notice of the hearings before the Zoning Commission and before the Levy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">The facts are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">The defendants below, the Santows, are the owners of a tract of land of 4.22 acres situated at the intersection of the Newport Gap Pike and the Old Wei din Road in Mill Creek Hundred. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>purchased it in December 1955. It was zoned R-2, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cAgricultural and General Purposes\u201d. In April 1956 the Santows applied to the Levy Court for a re-zoning of one-half of the tract as C-2, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cRoadside Business\u201d. It was at that time their intention to build a gift shop on the area to be re-zoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The New Castle County Zoning laws vest ultimate authority in zoning matters in the Levy Court. But the Zoning Commission, a body appointed by tire Levy Court, is required to consider and make recommendations to the Levy Court with respect to the original zoning of land in the county and with, respect to any changes in zoning. See 9 <em>Del.C. </em>c. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Accordingly, the Levy Court referred the Santow application to the Zoning Commission. As required by law, the Levy Court gave published notice on April 18, 1956, of a hearing on the application to be held April 25. The application was approved and on May 17, 1956 the Levy Court was so advised. The Levy Court gave published notice on May 17 (and subsequently) of a hearing on the proposed change to be held before it on June 1, 1956. The application was thereafter approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In 1958 the Santows built a home on the half of their tract zoned R-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In February, 1960, the Santows began work upon the construction of four stores on the other half of their tract, re-zoned C-2. This is a non-conforming use under the former zoning classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The plaintiffs below, Ullman and Bachman, own residential property in the neighborhood. On February 16, I960', they filed suit to enjoin the erection of the proposed structures. They asserted two contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">(1) That insufficient notice had been given of the Zoning Commission hearing and also of the Levy Court hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">(2) That no proper description of the tract to be re-zoned had been furnished either to the Zoning Commission or to the Levy Court at the time when the hearings were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The Santows answered, denying these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Plaintiffs moved for a restraining order and preliminary injunction. On April 12 the Vice Chancellor issued a restraining order and a rule to show cause. The motion for a preliminary injunction was heard on the pleadings and on affidavits. The Vice Chancellor held that the notices were insufficient in law and the attempted rezoning void. Reargument was granted to hear the parties on a contention that plaintiffs were guilty of loches. This additional defense was rejected and on May 24 a preliminary injunction was ordered. On the same day the Levy Court and the Zoning Commission were made parties to \u25a0the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">All the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The question of the sufficiency of the notices turns on the construction to be placed on the language of the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">9 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 2611 (6), relating to the hearing before the Zoning Commission, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201cWith respect to any proposed changes, the Zoning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing, notice of which hearing shall be published at least seven days before the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">9 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 2611(c), relating to the Levy Court hearing provides in part :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">\u201cBefore finally adopting any such changes, the Levy Court shall hold a public hearing thereon, at least 15 days\u2019 notice of the time and place of which shall be given by at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the County\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">As above stated, the notice of the Zoning Commission hearing was published on April 18; the hearing was held April 25. The notice of the Levy Court hearing was published May 17; the hearing was held June 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">The general rule for the computation of time under a statute, in the absence of anything showing a contrary intent, is that the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>day should be exduded but the day on which the act is to be done should be included. <em>Standard Scale &amp; Supply Corp. v. Chappel, </em>16 <em>Del. Ch. </em>331, 336, 141 <em>A. </em>191; <em>Simkin v. Cole, </em>32 <em>Del. </em>271, 122 <em>A. </em>191. This rule is so well settled that it is embodied in the rules of our trial courts. Court of Chancery <em>Rule </em>6, <em>Del.C.Ann.; </em>Superior Court <em>Rule </em>6 (Civil Rules); and Superior Court <em>Rule </em>45 (Criminal Rules). If the general rule is applied, the notices were in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">But there is a series of decisions of our Superior Court holding that if the statute fixing the time of notice uses the phrase \u201cat least\u201d or \u201cnot less than\u201d in specifying the number of days required for notice of an act to be done, or for service of process, the days required must be \u201cclear days\u201d. This is to say that \u201cat least seven days\u2019 notice\u201d means notice must be given not later than the eighth day before the time of the act to be done. See the following cases approving this exception to the general rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Robinson v. Collins, </em>1 <em>Har. </em>498 (\u201cat least four days before the day appointed for appearance\u201d); <em>Warrington v. Tull, </em>5 <em>Har. </em>107 (\u201cnot less than five days after the day of the date of the summons\u201d) ; <em>In re Public Roads, </em>5 <em>Har. </em>174 (\u201cat least ten days before the sitting of the court\u201d); <em>Chambers v. Jones, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>209, 39 <em>A. </em>1098 (\u201csuch rule shall be served at least two days before the expiration thereof\u201d) ; <em>State ex rel. Content v. Bay State Gas Co., </em>4 <em>Penn. </em>214, 221, 57 <em>A. </em>291, 292 (\u201cat least six days before the return of the process\u201d); <em>Jones v. Hinderer, 7 Boyce </em>516, 108 <em>A. </em>737 (\u201cat least four days before the day of appearance\u201d). In <em>MacCrone v. American Capital Corp., D.C., </em>51 <em>F.Supp. </em>462, the federal district court followed the rule in a case involving a notice requirement of the General Corporation Law. (For convenience, we shall call these decisions \u201cthe exception cases\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">There is, however, one contrary holding. In <em>Underwood v. Jeans, </em>4 <em>Har. </em>201, the statute required notice of a sheriff\u2019s sale to be given \u201cat least ten days before' sale\u201d. Notice in one locality was posted on September 30 for a sale on October 10. It was held sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Counsel for the Levy Court suggests -that the difference in wording of the statutes accounts for this decision. The language of the statutes in the exception cases is \u201cbefore the or \u201cbefore the day\u201d appointed for the aot to be done; whereas in the <em>Jeans </em>case the language of -the statute was \u201cbefore sale\u201d. And, indeed, in <em>Simkin v. Cole, supra, </em>Judge Harrington cited the <em>Jeans </em>case, which has never been expressly disapproved, as authority for the general rule, and cited the other cases as authorities for the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Hence it is suggested that if the rule of the <em>Jeans </em>case be applied to the language of \u00a7 2611(c), relating to- the Levy Court hearing, the notice was sufficient, because the language of that sub-section refers to \u201c15 days\u2019 notice of the time and place\u201d of the hearing, and does not say \u201c15 days <em>before </em>the <em>date </em>of the hearing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We -think that to apply different rules to the two sub-sections would be quite unreasonable. Moreover, the -distinction is too tenuous to constitute a difference. Either ,the <em>Jeans </em>case is wrong, or the other cases are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The Vice Chancellor naturally and properly followed the exception cases. If -they are to be disapproved, this Court should take the responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The list of exception cases appears impressive. But, as will be seen, there are very weighty objections to the soundness of these decisions. None of them contains any real discussion of the basis of the exception, nor any satisfactory reason why -the addition of the phrase \u201cat least\u201d is sufficient to indicate a legislative intent to depart from the general rule. Why should \u201cat least seven days\u2019 notice\u201d mean, in common parlance, eight days\u2019 notice ? Our exception cases derive from <em>Robinson v. Collins, supra. </em>The memorandum of the decision contains -only the pronouncement that the service \u201cmust be exclusive of both the day of the service and tire day of return\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">No authority is cited, but it is permissible to surmise that it followed the English precedents. Our early opinions leaned heavily upon -the English authorities. See, for example, the footnotes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Randel v. President, etc., Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal Co., </em>1 <em>Har. </em>151, 178-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><em>Robinson v. Collins </em>was decided in 1835. In 1821 the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in <em>Zouch v. Empsey, 4 B. &amp; Ald. </em>522, 106 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>1028, had held that \u201cat least fouteen days\u2019 notice\u201d meant fourteen clear days. There was no discussion of the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In 1838 the same Court had before it the same question, <em>i.e., </em>the construction of the phrase \u201cfourteen days at least\u201d. The point was fully argued. The Court, with marked reluctance, adhered to the rule in <em>Zouch v. Empsey, supra, </em>though solely on the ground of adherence to precedent. Three of the four justices expressed their disapproval of the rule. Littledale, J., said: \u201c* * * it appears to me that a day is a day, whether \u2018at least\u2019 be added or left out\u201d. Coleridge, J., said: \u201c* * * on principle, I should be of a different opinion.\u201d Denman, C.J., expressed \u201cregret\u201d at the decision they had to pronounce. It is fair to say that the soundness of the earlier English case (whether or not it was the basis of the holding in <em>Robinson v. Collins), </em>is open to question. Certainly, the comments of the judges in the later case suggest the desirability of examining the reason for the \u201cexception\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Now, the prefixing of the phrase \u201cat least\u201d before the number of days required simply means, on its face, that the specified time <em>(e.g., </em>seven days) is the minimum time. Suppose a statute provides that \u201ca minimmn of seven days\u2019 notice\u201d shall be given. Would it be contended that it required seven clear days? The only difference that we can see between \u201cseven days\u2019 notice\u201d and \u201cat least seven days\u2019 notice\u201d is that in the latter phrase there is the implication that a longer notice may be given if desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The suggestion that the phrase \u201cat least\u201d evidences a specific legislative intent to require a longer time than that required by the general rule we cannot follow. If the legislature intends to depart from the general rule it may readily find appropriate language to indicate an intention to do so. Thus in the case of <em>In re Fortner, </em>2 <em>Har. </em>461, the statute construed provided that no imprisoned debtor should be detained longer than \u201cfive days from the date of such com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>mitment <em>inclusive\u201d. </em>8 <em>Del. Laws, </em>178. The court, of course, ruled that the day of commitment must be counted. So, again, if seven clear days are to be required, it is simple to use the word \u201cexclusive\u201d in an appropriate context.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">When we examine the decisions of other American jurisdictions, we find that they are divided. But we think that the better reasoned cases reject the view that the phrase \u201cat least\u201d changes the general rule for the computation of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In <em>Barron v. Green, </em>13 <em>N.J.Super. </em>483, 80 <em>A.2d </em>586, 589, the statutory phrase, which related to the filing of certain election petitions, was: \u201cat least 40 days prior to\u201d the election. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:75-3. The court reviewed the New Jersey decisions and held that the ordinary rule for computation of time applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In <em>Luedke v. Todd, </em>109 <em>Colo. </em>326, 124 <em>P.2d </em>932, the election statute provided that a certificate of nomination should be filed \u201cnot less than forty-five (45) days before election\u201d. <em>Colo.Laws </em>1941, <em>c. </em>124, \u00a7 7. The Supreme Court quoted from and followed a prior decision to the effect that the general rule applied. That prior decision had noted the criticism of the \u201cexception\u201d rule by the judges in the English case of <em>The Queen v. The Justices, supra, </em>and had cited their comments with approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Board of Deputy State Supervisors, </em>93 <em>Ohio St. </em>14, 112 <em>N.E. </em>136, 138, the Supreme Court of Ohio held, in a similar case, that the general rule applied. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cThe use of the words 'at least,\u2019 prefixed to the number of days named, cannot in any wise affect the result or the method of computation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">The New York cases are to the same effect. See <em>H.E. &amp; S. Transportation Corporation, </em>271 <em>N.Y. </em>239, 2 <em>N.E.2d </em>642.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">These cases seem to us to announce a sound and desirable rule. Why should the computation of time depend upon the use or non-use of the phrase \u201cat least\u201d? If it be said that the words are inserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>with a purpose, it may be replied that the purpose might be to anticipate a possible technical objection that a longer notice than the prescribed number of days would not be proper. This suggestion was made by counsel in the case of <em>The Queen v. The Justices, supra. </em>It is a technical answer to a technical construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In any event the sufficient answer is that the natural import of the phrase \u201cat least\u201d is, as above stated, to express the idea of a minimum and nothing more. It does not in itself affect the general rule for the computation of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We also think that the rule of our \u201cat least\u201d cases is an undesirable one in practice. In modern times we . have numerous administrative bodies, usually composed of non-lawyers, who may be often required to attend to administrative details concerning notices, hearings and so forth. The present distinction is probably confusing. Thus it is shown in this case that in 1959 and 1960 the Levy Court held eleven hearings under the zoning law, and that in each case tire period of notice was fifteen days, computed according to tire general rule. We do not think that in the light of our decisions this fact constitutes an administrative interpretation entitled to weight. But we do think that it supports our view that it is desirable, so far as possible, to have one simple rule for the computation of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We are quite aware that the exception to the general rule has stood, almost unchallenged,' for a very long time. But we cannot find that any real examination of the logic of the rule was ever made in any of our decisions. The first one, <em>Robinson v. Collins, supra, </em>is a mere <em>\u201cipse dixit.\u201d </em>The succeeding decisions followed it without question or critical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Nevertheless, a question of <em>stare decisis </em>is presented. This is a salutary rule, and will be given full effect in a proper case. See <em>Trustees of the New Castle Common v. Gordy, </em>33 <em>Del.Ch. </em>334, 93 <em>A.2d </em>509, 40 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>544; <em>Flait v. Mayor &amp; Council of Wilmington, </em>48 <em>Del. </em>89, 90, 99, 97 <em>A.2d </em>545. The <em>Gordy </em>case involved the power of the General Assembly to authorize the sale of lands in a charitable trust. A prior decision of the Supreme Court had upheld this power, and we applied <em>stare decisis </em>and again sustained the power. Titles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>to real estate would have been adversely affected by a contrary holding. The <em>Plait </em>case involved the rule of municipal immunity from liability for torts in the performance of governmental functions. Two prior Supreme Court decisions, as well as numerous Superior Court cases, had sustained the doctrine. It was a matter of substantive law. Although disagreeing with the immunity rule, we again applied <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On the other hand, in <em>American Insurance Co. v. Iaconi, </em>47 <em>Del. </em>167, 89 <em>A.2d </em>141, 36 A.L.R.2d 604, we declined to apply it, and disapproved a decision of the Superior Court that had stood unchallenged for many years. We pointed out that <em>stare decisis </em>has little application to a case in which an appellate court is examining a decision of a lower court. 47 <em>Del. </em>189, 89 <em>A.2d </em>152.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In the instant case the exception to the general rule for computation of time, based on the use of the phrase \u201cat least\u201d, has never been approved by the Supreme Court, or by the Court in Banc. It is not a rule of property. Indeed, it is little more than a rule of practice. We think that we should not apply <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Accordingly, the Delaware cases upholding the exception are disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">It follows that the notices in this case were legally sufficient, and that the order awarding the preliminary injunction on the basis of insufficient notice must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The case is remanded to the Court of Chancery for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
