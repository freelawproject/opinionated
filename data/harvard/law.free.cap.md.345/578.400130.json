Specifically, the Petition for Disciplinary Action alleged that, in approving the issuance and negotiation of five checks drawn upon the corpus of the trust, Sachse had failed to provide competent representation, Rule 1.1 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, had represented interests in conflict with those owed to the trust, Rule 1.7(b), and had engaged in professional misconduct, Rule 8.4(a) and (c). The Petition further alleged that Sachse had made a false statement of material fact, Rule 8.1(a), and had violated Maryland Code (1989, 1995 RephVol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (BP), which provides: \u201cA lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we transmitted the case to Judge John 0. Hennegan of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Hennegan found that Sachse had violated Rule 1.1 and BP \u00a7 10-306, but had not violated Rules 1.7, 8.1, or 8.4. Bar Counsel excepted solely to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law in respect to Rule 1.7(b), and recommended that Sachse be indefinitely suspended, with the right to apply for reinstatement after one year. As conditions upon that reinstatement, Bar Counsel asks that we order restitution of the principal of the trust and that Sachse submit to monitoring by Richard B. Vincent, Director of Lawyer Counseling for the Maryland State Bar Association, for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">For the reasons recited below, we shall sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Hennegan made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">\u201cMr. Douglas T. Sachse was admitted to the Maryland Bar on November 9, 1979. He maintains an office for the practice of law with the firm of Turnbull, Mix and Farmer in Towson, Maryland. Shirley Stemler is the daughter of the late Dorothy J. Thompson. Whitney Stemler Riley and Erin Stemler Drew are the daughters of Shirley Stemler. On or about March 19,1978, Dorothy J. Thompson executed a Last Will and Testament (hereinafter \u201cthe Thompson Will\u201d) that provided, <em>inter alia, </em>for the creation of a trust upon Mrs. Thompson\u2019s death to hold one-half of her net estate for the benefit of her daughter, Shirley Stemler, and Mrs. Stemler\u2019s descendants. The Thompson Will specified that Shirley Stemler was to receive net income from the trust in at least quarterly installments during Mrs. Stemler\u2019s lifetime, with the principal and undistributed income to be distributed to Mrs. Stemler\u2019s then living descendants, per stirpes, upon Mrs. Stemler\u2019s death. Mrs. Thompson died on May 13, 1985, and the Thompson Will thereafter was probated in Harford County. Pursuant to the terms of the Thompson Will, a trust (hereinafter \u201cthe Stemler Trust\u201d) was established, with County Banking and Trust Company appointed to serve as trustee. The original corpus of the Stemler Trust was approximately $50,000.00, of which approximately $45,000.00 was invested in blue-chip stocks and $4,500.00 was placed in a certificate of deposit at County Banking and Trust Company. Mr. Sachse had a professional and social relationship with Shirley Stemler dating back to approximately 1980. Sometime in the spring of 1987, Shirley Stemler hired Mr. Sachse to seek removal of County Banking and Trust Company as trustee of the Stemler Trust based on Mrs. Stemler\u2019s dissatisfaction with its investment of the trust assets and the income she was receiving. With the consent of Mrs. Stemler\u2019s two daughters, Whitney Stemler (now Riley) and Erin Stemler (now Drew), who were the only then living residual beneficiaries of the Stemler Trust, the Circuit Court for Harford County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>approved a Consent Order on May 6, 1987, by which Mr. Sachse became substitute trustee of the Stemler Trust. Upon his appointment as trustee, Mr. Sachse arranged to have the Stemler Trust\u2019s stock portfolio transferred into an investment account at Alex. Brown <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cAlex. Brown\u201d). Alex. Brown received the transferred stock certificates on or about September 18, 1987. Mr. Sachse also received $5,000.00 from redemption of the County Banking and Trust certificate of deposit at the end of December 1987. Out of those funds, Mr. Sachse took $750.00 as a fee for petitioning for appointment of a substitute trustee and for his services as trustee to that point. The remaining $4,250.00 was forwarded to Alex. Brown for investment on behalf of the Stemler Trust. In August 1987, Mr. Sachse, at the request of Mrs. Stemler, filed a petition to have the Stemler Trust terminated and to allow distribution of the principal to Mrs. Stemler\u2019s two daughters prior to Mrs. Stemler\u2019s death. The Circuit Court for Harford County denied that petition on August 16, 1990. As of the time that the petition to terminate the trust was denied, the total market value of the stocks held in the Alex. Brown investment account was in excess of $70,000.00. From September 1987 through August 1990, Shirley Stemler received periodic distributions of dividend and interest income by transfer from the Stemler Trust investment account into a separate account held at Alex. Brown in the name of Mrs. Stemler individually. Beginning in September 1990 and continuing through August 1991, several distributions were made from the Alex. Brown investment account by way of checks made payable to Mr. Sachse as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">\n<em>Date Check No. Amount</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxR\">(i) September 7, 1990 2022318 $19,472.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIU\">(ii) February 20, 1991 2174207 $18,758.78</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_t\">2175800 $16,255.89 (iii) April 30,1991</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au5\">2176459 $ 2,000.00 (iv) July 29,1991</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akp\">6480069 $15,272.70 (v) August 5,1991</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB6\">Total $71,760.35</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The distributions from the Alex. Brown account depleted the principal to the Stemler Trust, leaving a balance of only eight cents ($0.08) in the account as of August 30, 1991. With the exception of Check No. 2174207, drawn on February 20, 1991, and Check No. 2175800, drawn on April 30, 1991,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Sachse acknowledges that he authorized the above listed distributions and endorsed the checks over to Shirley Stemler with knowledge that she planned to invest the funds in a company known as Autel Corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Sachse prepared Articles of Incorporation for Autel Corporation in 1987. Mr. Sachse had no further active involvement in the operations and activities of Autel Corporation from the time of its incorporation in 1987 through September 1990, when he began releasing Stemler Trust funds to Shirley Stemler for investment in the corporation. Mr. Sachse obtained no financial data about Autel Corporation before releasing Trust funds to Shirley Stemler for investment in the corporation. Mr. Sachse did not obtain any formal security from Shirley Stemler or anyone else to protect the Stemler Trust\u2019s \u201cinvestment\u201d in Autel Corporation. After he began releasing Trust funds to Shirley Stemler for investment in Autel Corporation, Mr. Sachse never requested or received an accounting of those funds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Shirley Stemler took the position that the Trust funds were for her personal use as she deemed appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">Fred Eisenbrandt handled the trust account for the [Stemler] Trust. He recalls the distribution of the funds. He states that the sale of the stock could not have occurred without authorization from the Respondent. It was standard procedure at Alex. Brown for sales of stock to occur only at the request of the account holder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Mr. Sachse began drinking on a regular basis at the law firm when they developed a habit of taking off Friday afternoons and drinking at lunch into the late afternoon. This continued and eventually extended into other days of the week, i.e. Thursday. He eventually had an affair with his current wife while married to his first wife that produced a child with cerebral palsy and a hearing impairment. Obviously, this led to difficulties with the marriage and increased drinking. The marriage ultimately broke down, a separation resulted and the Respondent\u2019s drinking became more severe in an effort to sleep and deal with his emotional problems and dilemma[s]. His social worker feared he was suicidal and it was clear he had no judgment or ability to make sound decisions. As a result, he was admitted to Sheppard Pratt\u2019s substance abuse program. Subsequently, he was released, got control of his substance abuse and emotional problems, and has been sober since his discharge from Sheppard Pratt Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">Upon his release he attempted to obtain an executed note from Shirley Stemler and Karl Keffer [with whom Shirley Stemler had approached Mr. Sachse about investing in Autel Corporation]. He purchased life insurance policies and executed an indemnity deed of trust to protect the trust corpus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Respondent admits that he would not invest any of his personal assets in the Autel Corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Based upon these findings, Judge Hennegan concluded that Sachse had \u201cfailed to use the knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Trust or its beneficiaries\u201d in violation of Rule 1.1<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and BP \u00a7 10-306. Sachse\u2019s admission that he allowed the corpus to be depleted in furtherance of Mrs. Stemler\u2019s investment in Autel, without obtaining security therefor or ascertaining the precise nature of the transaction, provided clear and convincing evidence that Sachse had failed to provide competent representation to the Stemler Trust and its beneficiaries, and his attempts to correct his \u201cerrors in judgment\u201d were \u201ctoo late to avoid the responsibilities required\u201d by the Rule. The hearing judge then rejected Bar Counsel\u2019s assertion that the fact of Sachse\u2019s interest in Autel in conjunction with his representation of Mrs. Stemler constituted a <em>per se </em>conflict of interest under Rule 1.7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given evidence indicating that Sachse had possibly relinquished his interest, if any, in Autel in 1987 and the fact that the disbursements at issue took place in 1990 and 1991, the court was not persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that the Rule had been violated. Judge Hennegan also rejected Bar Counsel\u2019s claim that Sachse had \u201cknowingly assisted or induced another to violate the rules of professional conduct or engage in dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>court found that Sachse\u2019s bouts with depression and alcoholism had clouded his judgment and that he was subject to \u201cextreme pressure\u201d from Mrs. Stemler and her demands for money, the court was not persuaded that Sachse had engaged in professional misconduct within the meaning of Rule 8.4(a) or (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Judge Hennegan further determined that Sachse had not knowingly made a false statement of material fact in denying that he authorized the sale of the stock in the trust. Specifically, the court found that Sachse\u2019s acknowledgment of his ultimate responsibility for the investment of trust assets in Autel could not be reconciled with violation of Rule 8.1. \u201cIt is hard to believe,\u201d the judge stated, \u201cthat [Sachse] would knowingly make a false statement when he accepts full responsibility for the ultimate event. The sale of the stock may be a material [f]act in the distribution of the Trust funds but the denial of it may not be a material fact since there is no denial that the distribution of the funds to Shirley Stemler could easily have been averted by [Sachse] after the sale of the stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">As we have stated, Bar Counsel has excepted solely to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 1.7(b). Bar Counsel asserts that Sachse\u2019s representation of the Stemler Trust was compromised by his relationship with Shirley Stemler when he authorized the release of trust funds to Mrs. Stemler. Bar Counsel adds that the severity of Sachse\u2019s misconduct was \u201ccompounded]\u201d by his failure to arrest further depletion of the trust assets when he ratified an unauthorized distribution from Alex. Brown on April 30, 1991. \u201cAt that point,\u201d Bar Counsel argues, Sachse\u2019s \u201cconduct transcended what might be characterized as simply poor judgment and rose to the level of affirmative participation in Shirley Stemler\u2019s systematic use of trust monies to fund the operations of Autel Corporation.\u201d Bar Counsel further disputes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Sachse\u2019s alcoholism may mitigate the egregiousness of his conduct, arguing that \u201che understood the nature of Shirley Stemler\u2019s conduct yet chose to ratify it rather than taking appropriate remedial measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In the management of a trust, a trustee is charged with exercising \u201cthe care, skill, prudence, and diligence of an ordinary prudent [person] engaged in similar business affairs and with objectives similar to those of the trust in question.\u201d <em>Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank v. Cummins, </em>322 Md. 570, 580, 588 A.2d 1205, 1210 (1991). \u201cAll trustees are subject to common law duties and equitable rules or principles.\u201d George G. Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 541 (2d ed. rev. 1993). \u201cPerhaps the most fundamental duty of a trustee is that he must display throughout the administration of the trust complete loyalty to the interests of the beneficiar[ies] and must exclude all selfish interest and all consideration of the interests of third persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 543; <em>see also Board of Trustees v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>317 Md. 72, 109, 562 A.2d 720, 738 (1989) (\u201c[T]he general duty of loyalty is well-established in Maryland law.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1093, 110 S.Ct. 1167, 107 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1990). \u201c[A] trustee is charged by law with representing the beneficiaries\u2019 interests,\u201d <em>Board of Trustees, </em>317 Md. at 90, 562 A.2d at 728, and is liable for acting to their detriment when the conduct causing the loss \u201cfailed to conform to the standard of care and skill applicable to trustees in the administration of the trusts,\u201d Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 541. \u201cIt is clear that the trustee\u2019s duty of loyalty extends beyond a prohibition against self-dealing and conflict of interest---Even if the trustee has no personal stake in a transaction, the. duty of loyalty bars him from acting in the interest of third parties at the expense of the beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Board of Trustees, </em>317 Md. at 109, 562 A.2d at 738. Conflicts of interest impair the trustee\u2019s ability to act on behalf of the beneficiaries with independent and disinterested judgment in the administration of the trust, the rationale being that it is generally not possible for the same person to act fairly in two capacities and on behalf of two interests in the same transaction. Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 543. Whether or not a conflict exists must be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>mined by the facts of each individual case. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kent, </em>337 Md. 361, 379, 653 A.2d 909, 918 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">\u201cIn reviewing the multiple findings made by the hearing judge, we accept findings of fact made by the hearing judge if they are supported by clear and convincing evidence, and are not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>333 Md. 298, 303, 635 A.2d 382, 384 (1994) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 287-88, 614 A.2d 102, 108 (1992); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 402, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991)). To this end, hearing judges may pick and choose the evidence upon which they will rely. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 684, 480 A.2d 807, 816 (1984). We shall, however, make \u201can independent, detailed review of the complete record with particular reference to ... evidence relating to [a] disputed factual finding.\u201d <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Judge Hennegan concluded that no conflict of interest existed by virtue of Sachse\u2019s ownership, if at all, of a one percent interest in Autel. \u201cHis representation of Shirley Stemler in part and while trustee,\u201d Judge Hennegan added, \u201cwas ... clearly known to all parties in interest and there is no evidence of any objections raised by any beneficiaries.\u201d Bar Counsel excepts to this conclusion, charging that Sachse \u201cviolated Rule 1.7(b) by virtue of the conflict between his obligation to preserve the principal of the Stemler Trust and the interest of Shirley Stemler individually in pursuing the Autel \u2018investment.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWhen [Sachse] succumbed to Shirley Stemler\u2019s requests for the distribution of trust monies to be used for her own misguided funding of Autel Corporation,\u201d Bar Counsel argues, \u201che pursued Mrs. Stemler\u2019s interests at the expense of the trust\u2019s [interests].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">As a threshold matter, Sachse challenges Bar Counsel\u2019s ability to except to Judge Hennegan\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law on Rule 1.7(b). He contends that Bar Counsel did not argue alternative bases of conflict, relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>solely upon the fact of his one percent ownership interest in Autel in charging him with a conflict of interest. Therefore, he continues, Bar Counsel may not argue at this juncture that his simultaneous representation of Shirley Stemler and the Trust was the basis for its allegation of conflict. Sachse also disagrees that the facts support the substance of Bar Counsel\u2019s exception. He contends that his belief that Mrs. Stemler and her daughters had a very close relationship, and that Mrs. Stemler was providing them with candid information regarding the Trust, was not unreasonable and demonstrates that \u201chis decision making process was based on his belief that he was seeking the interest of all the beneficiaries of the Stemler Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Our independent review of the record reveals that Bar Counsel did in fact raise alternative theories of conflict before the circuit court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, therefore, may pursue its exception before this Court. Thus, we shall proceed to determine whether Sachse\u2019s actions relative to the trust were improper. Sachse maintains that his impression of the closeness of Mrs. Stemler and her daughters, coupled with his belief that the Autel investment could net millions to the benefit of the Trust and its beneficiaries, warrants this Court\u2019s acceptance of Judge Hennegan\u2019s Finding of Fact and Conclusion of Law. Although superficially attractive, upon closer examination, Sachse\u2019s contentions are without merit. In his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>before the circuit court, Sachse stated that he knew that he, as trustee, had to give Alex. Brown authorization before the sale of stock in the Stemler Trust could be effected, and admitted that, although he did not recall authorizing the sale of the constituent stock or the distribution of the checks, he either signed the checks over to Mrs. Stemler or, in the case of the April 30, 1991 check, he ratified its issuance. He also described Mrs. Stemler as \u201cassertive, [and] strong,\u201d and admitted that he \u201clet [him]self give in to her relentlessness.\u201d He added that, except for the first disbursement, he understood that the money was in furtherance of investment in Autel. Yet, he did not obtain any information about the security of the investment prior to the periodic outlay of sums totaling $71,760.35 to Mrs. Stemler based upon her word alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Furthermore, his testimony that he had no reason to believe that the relationship extant between Mrs. Stemler and her daughters did not remain close and that she was advising them of her actions is unpersuasive. An honest but misguided assessment of the facts does not relieve a trustee of the responsibility to act solely in the interest of the trust. \u201c \u2018Fiduciaries in general, and attorneys in particular, must remember that the entrustment to them of the money and property of others involves a responsibility of the highest order. They must carefully administer and account for those funds.\u2019\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kramer, </em>325 Md. 39, 51, 599 A.2d 100, 107 (1991) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 345, 587 A.2d 511, 516 (1991)). Sachse had a duty to ascertain whether the alleged investment in Autel was one properly pursued by the Trust. He did not conduct any such investigation, permitting, instead, Mrs. Stemler to dictate the ultimate disposition of the funds. In so doing, he breached his duty of loyalty to the Trust.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sachse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>admittedly knew of his responsibilities as trustee of the Stemler Trust and, armed with the knowledge that Mrs. Stemler was anxious to access the trust principal (as evidenced by, <em>inter alia, </em>her 1989 campaign to have the Trust terminated), Sachse nevertheless yielded to her machinations and sacrificed the integrity of the Trust. We shall, therefore, sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exception to Judge Hennegan\u2019s findings and conclusion relative to Rule 1.7(b) and hold that Sachse did entertain a conflict of interest when he permitted Mrs. Stemler\u2019s imperiousness to override the best interests of the Stemler Trust and its beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We now turn to the matter of Sachse\u2019s sanction. We are mindful that the imposition of sanctions is reflective of our responsibility \u201cto insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute.\u201d <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 549, 318 A.2d 811, 814 (1974). \u201cIn determining the appropriate sanction for an offending attorney, we have recognized that \u2018the severity of the sanction to be imposed is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case\u2019 and the Court \u2018may consider facts in mitigation....\u2019\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kenney, </em>339 Md. 578, 587, 664 A.2d 854, 858 (1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pollack, </em>279 Md. 225, 238, 369 A.2d 61, 68 (1977)). \u201c[A] less severe sanction than that ordinarily dictated may be appropriate when an attorney is able to establish the existence of compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 664 A.2d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">At the hearing before Judge Hennegan, the evidence revealed that Sachse has had a long history of emotional and substance abuse problems. Bar Counsel maintains that, \u201c[a]l-though some of [SachseJ\u2019s decisions may be partially attributable to impaired judgment arising from his alcoholism, ... [Sachse] had the capacity to recognize Shirley Stemler\u2019s actions ... as conduct fraught with deceit.\u201d Sachse\u2019s alcoholism notwithstanding, Bar Counsel continues, \u201che understood the nature of Shirley Stemler\u2019s conduct yet chose to ratify it rather than taking appropriate remedial measures.\u201d Sachse concedes that his conduct stemmed from the exercise of poor judgment, but submits that he has \u201cattempted to right the wrongs he committed [and] ... worked diligently and faithfully to resolve the underlying problems resulting in the poor judgment and impaired decision making ability that gave rise to this proceeding.\u201d He asserts that he has remained sober for five years and asks that we accept Judge Hennegan\u2019s recommended sanction of a published reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Although we have of late been reticent to allow alcoholism to mitigate violations of legal and ethical rules that would ordinarily warrant disbarment, <em>see Kenney, supra, </em>339 Md. at 594, 664 A.2d at 862, we recognize that Bar Counsel has not sought Sachse\u2019s disbarment in the instant proceeding. Rather, Bar Counsel asks, for the violation of a fiduciary obligation, that we indefinitely suspend Sachse, with a right to apply for reinstatement after one year. Bar Counsel also asks that we condition his reinstatement upon restitution of the principal of the Stemler Trust and periodic monitoring by Richard B. Vincent. As we stated in <em>Kenney, </em>339 Md. at 594-95, 664 A.2d at 862:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201cSevere sanctions are necessary to protect the public from being victimized from any further dishonesty on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the attorney. We do, however, recognize that alcoholism is a serious medical condition and we will be more sympathetic to attorneys who recognize their need for assistance and seek to rehabilitate themselves before their transgressions are discovered. Nonetheless, we believe that when violations ordinarily warranting disbarment are found, our duty to protect the public is strong and we cannot permit alcoholism to alleviate an attorney\u2019s responsibility to recognize the wrongfulness of his or her actions and to honor his or her commitments to his or her clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">While Sachse has not attempted to avoid responsibility for his actions in respect to the Stemler Trust, he is not relieved of liability for those actions. Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the proper sanction for his violation of Rule 1.7(b) and BP \u00a7 10-806 will be indefinite suspension from the practice of law with the right to reapply not less than one year from the date of the filing of this opinion. As a condition to his readmission, Sachse is also ordered to provide or absolutely assure restitution of the corpus of the Trust and to submit to monitoring by Richard B. Vincent for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.

By order dated June 5, 1996, effective January 1, 1997, this Court renumbered this Rule and the other Rules governing attorney discipline proceedings. They are now found in Chapter 700, Maryland Rules 16-701 through 16-718. In this opinion, all reference to the Maryland Rules will be to the former Md.

Although Sachse has no independent recollection of authorizing the sale of stock to support the distributions, he admitted before the circuit court that he signed the checks over to Shirley Stemler with the understanding that, except as to the first distribution, the funds were in furtherance of an investment in Autel Corporation, a company operated by Mrs. Stemler. In the case of the April 30, 1991 check, Sachse categorically denied having endorsed the check and stated that he later learned that Karl Keffer, with whom Mrs. Stemler approached him about investment in Autel, had been the one to do so. Upon becoming aware of Mr. Keffer\u2019s unlawful negotiation of the check, Sachse ratified the disbursement of the funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. Apparently, Autel Corporation, purportedly a producer of defense computer technology, was operated by Shirley Stemler and her husband, Walter, out of the basement of the Stemler home; Mr. Stemler handled the research and development end of the business, while Shirley Stemler managed its business aspects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b642-4\">. Rule 1.1, Competence, mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\"A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\">. Rule 1.7, Conflict of Interest: General Rule, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201c(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">(2) the client consents after consultation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\">. Rule 8.4, Misconduct, reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">\"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3W\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\">. Specifically, in closing, Bar Counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\"I would like to point out to the Court with respect to the 1.7(b) issue, even absent the ownership interest in the Autel Corporation, I think there is still an issue for the Court to evaluate ... that being whether ... in connection with his responsibilities to the trust, whether those were materially limited by his responsibilities to another client or to a third person, that being Shirley Stemler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">Whether you identify her as a client or a third person, Mr. Sachse obviously had some sort of ongoing relationship, business and social, with her and he allowed himself to be persuaded, I would submit to the Court, by that relationship, into releasing funds that he had an obligation to the other client, the trust, to protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">So I think that there can still be a finding of a Rule [1.7](b)(1) violation, even in finding that he had a 1 percent interest in Autel Corporation. Those are two alternative theories.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b647-5\">. Indeed, looking to each disbursement, we discern a pattern of behavior in which Sachse (admittedly) compromised the integrity of the Trust in response to pressure from Mrs. Stemler. At the hearing before Judge Hennegan, Sachse testified that, although he believed the September 7, 1990 disbursement of $19,472.98 to be an interest payment under the terms of the Stemler Trust, he did ask that Mrs. Stemler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>obtain her daughters\u2019 written concession that the money was in fact a payment of interest. He received nothing from them and did not pursue the matter further. Although he had no independent recollection of the circumstances surrounding the February 20, 1991 distribution of $18,758.78, in response to a letter from Alex. Brown confirming the sale of shares to support the issue, Sachse wrote Alex. Brown, stating that he did not grant permission for the sale but that he expected any proceeds therefrom to be forwarded to him. He received the funds and, apparently, endorsed them over to Shirley Stemler. Sachse adamantly denied that he had authorized the sale of stock necessary to support the issuance of the $16,255.89 check on April 30, 1991. He further testified that he had not signed the check; he later learned that Karl Keffer had negotiated it in his name, to which Sachse \"said it was ok.\u201d In July of 1991, Sachse recalled that Mrs. Stemler went so far as to jump out of her car in traffic to ask him to endorse the $2,000.00 check issued on July 29, because she needed more funding for Autel. He further testified that he could not recall the circumstances respecting the distribution of $15,272.70 on August 5, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
