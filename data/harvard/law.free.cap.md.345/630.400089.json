SMITH, Judge, Specially Assigned.</author>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We shall here hold that under the facts in this case the \u201con\u201d requirement in a jeweler\u2019s block policy that an \u201cemployee or sales personnel [be] in or on the vehicle at the time of the loss\u201d is ambiguous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Petitioner JMP Associates, Inc. (JMP) sued respondent The St. Paul Fire <em>&amp; </em>Marine Insurance Company (StPaul) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for breach of contract under a jeweler\u2019s block policy. We conclude that the trial judge erred in holding the term \u201cin or on\u201d unambiguous and in granting summary judgment in favor of St. Paul. The Court of Special Appeals likewise erred when it affirmed that judgment. Accordingly, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In <em>JMP Assoc. v. St. Paul Fire, </em>109 Md.App. 343, 674 A.2d 562 (1996), the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">\u201cThe relevant facts are undisputed. JMP is a wholesale jeweler with a principal place of business in Silver Spring, Maryland. It sells its products to jewelers in other States as well, including to those in North Carolina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">\u201cIn March, 1992, St. Paul issued to JMP a Jeweler\u2019s Block Policy, insuring jewels, watches, precious metals, and other stock usual to JMP\u2019s business \u2018against risks of direct physical loss or damage except those listed in the Exclusions\u2014Losses We Won\u2019t Cover section.\u2019 One of the exclusions listed in that section stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">\u2018Unattended vehicle. We won\u2019t cover loss to property while it is left in or on a vehicle unless you, your employee or sales personnel are in or on the vehicle at the time of the loss.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u201cOn March 23, 1994, while this policy was in force, JMP\u2019s sales representative, Marty Leibson, was traveling in North Carolina on his way to make a business call in Charlotte. He was carrying in the trunk of his car a collection of jewelry worth about $150,000. Leibson stopped for gas in Shelby, North Carolina. After pumping the gas, he walked over to the check-out station to pay for it, using his credit card. The trunk was locked, and the car was visible. As the cashier rang up the sale, a van pulled in and partially blocked Leibson\u2019s view of his car. When the transaction was completed, Leibson returned to his car. The van had left, and Leibson noticed nothing out of the ordinary. He drove on to Charlotte, parked at his customer\u2019s store, unlocked the trunk to get his merchandise, and, for the first time, discovered that the cases containing the jewelry were missing. Leibson immediately reported the theft to the proper authorities, but to no avail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\u201cJMP made a claim on the policy. That claim was rejected on the ground that Leibson was not \u2018in or on\u2019 the vehicle at the time of the loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u201cJMP raises a number of issues in this appeal, but the central one is the proper construction of the word \u2018on\u2019 as it appears in that clause of the exclusion. It seems to be agreed that the loss occurred at the gas station and that Leibson was not \u2018in\u2019 the car when the loss occurred. The question is whether,' for purposes of construing the policy, he can be regarded as having been \u2018on\u2019 the vehicle at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 674 A.2d at 563. The Court of Special Appeals concluded, \u201c \u2018[0]n\u2019 means \u2018on\u2019 and not \u2018near.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 674 A.2d at 565. It said it thus \u201calign[ed] [itself] with the majority view\u201d and held that \u201c[t]he [trial] court did not err in applying the exclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We granted JMP\u2019s petition for certiorari to address the important question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>\u201cThe court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The law relative to summary judgment has been stated and restated by this Court many times. <em>See, e.g., Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp., </em>343 Md. 185, 206-07, 680 A.2d 1067, 1076-77 (1996); <em>Heat &amp; Power v. Air Prods., </em>320 Md. 584, 591-92, 578 A.2d 1202, 1205-06 (1990); <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 110-12, 492 A.2d 608, 614-15 (1985); and <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 304-05, 413 A.2d 170, 171 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In <em>King, </em>Judge Cole said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment, we are concerned primarily with deciding whether a material factual issue exists, and in this regard, all inferences are resolved against the moving party. <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Products, Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 7-8, 327 A.2d 502, 509 (1974); <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Board of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 40-41, 300 A.2d 367, 374 (1973); <em>see Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., </em>302 Md. 47, 62, 485 A.2d 663, 671 (1984). If there is a conflict between the inferences that may be drawn from that before the court, summary judgment is not proper. As Judge Smith explained in <em>Porter v. General Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 413, 396 A.2d 1090, 1096 (1979) (quoting <em>Fenwick Motor Co. v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 138, 265 A.2d 256, 258 (1970)[) ], \u2018 \u201ceven where the underlying facts are undisputed, if those facts are susceptible of more than one permissible inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law, but should be submitted to the trier of fact.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-9\"><em>King, </em>303 Md. at 110-11, 492 A.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">In <em>Bailer v. Erie Ins., </em>344 Md. 515, 687 A.2d 1375 (1997), Judge Rodowsky recently set forth for the Court the bases for construction of insurance policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201cUnder Maryland law, \u2018[i]nsurance policies, being contractual, are construed as other contracts.\u2019 <em>Bond v. Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Casualty Ins. Co., </em>289 Md. 379, 384, 424 A.2d 765, 768 (1981). As such, a court interpreting an insurance policy is to examine the instrument as a whole, focusing on the character, purpose, and circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract. <em>Pacific Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985). \u2018[W]e accord words their ordinary and accepted meanings. The test is what meaning a reasonably prudent layperson would attach to the term.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>Unlike the law of some states which construes insurance contracts against the insurer, this Court holds that an insurance contract will be construed against the insurer only when an ambiguity remains after considering the intentions of the parties from the policy as a whole and, if necessary, after admitting and considering any relevant parol evidence. <em>Cheney v. Bell Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>315 Md. 761, 766-67, 556 A.2d 1135, 1138 (1989).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\"><em>Bailer, </em>344 Md. at 521-22, 687 A.2d at 1378. To similar effect, see <em>Collier v. MD-Individual Practice, </em>327 Md. 1, 5-6, 607 A.2d 537, 539 (1992) (with the further statement, \u201cIf the language is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be consulted.\u201d); <em>Pacific Indem. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas., </em>302 Md. 383, 388-89, 488 A.2d 486, 488-89 (1985); <em>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Marks Rentals, </em>288 Md. 428, 435, 418 A.2d 1187, 1190 (1980). In <em>Collier, </em>this Court made the specific statement, \u201cIn Maryland insurance policies ordinarily are construed in the same manner as contracts generally.\u201d 327 Md. at 5, 607 A.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In <em>Orkin v. Jacobson, </em>274 Md. 124, 332 A.2d 901 (1975), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cOur predecessors in <em>Waters v. Griffith, 2 </em>Md. 326, 333 [ (1852) ], said that \u2018[w]e must give, if we can, some distinct meaning to every word employed in the contract....\u2019 To like effect see 17 Am.Jur.2d Contracts \u00a7 259 (1964), citing, among other cases, <em>Nat. Fire Ins. Co. v. Crane, </em>16 Md. 260 (1860):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u2018 \u00a7 259. Giving effect to entire con tract, and all its pails and language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u2018It is a fundamental rule of contract construction that the entire contract, and each and all of its parts and provisions, must be given meaning, and force and effect, if that can consistently and reasonably be done. An interpretation which gives reasonable meaning to all its provisions will be preferred to one which leaves a portion of the writing useless or inexplicable. So far as reasonably possible, effect will be given to all the language and to every word, expression, phrase, and clause of the agreement. No word or clause should be rejected as mere surplusage if the court can discover any reasonable purpose thereof which can be gathered from the whole instrument. A construction will not be given to one part of a contract which will annul another part, unless such a result is fairly inescapable. Comparatively unimportant parts or provisions which may be severed from the agreement without impairing its effect or changing its character will be suppressed or subordinated if in that way, and only in that way, the agreement can be sustained and enforced.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 660-62.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Orkin, 274 </em>Md. at 129-30, 332 A.2d at 904. Similar statements are found in 43 Am.Jur.2d Insurance \u00a7 275 (1982) and 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts \u00a7 386 (1991). To like effect, see <em>Sagner v. Glenangus Farms, Inc., </em>234 Md. 156, 167, 198 A.2d 277, 283 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">We have reviewed each of the cases cited by the Court of Special Appeals and many other cases. We shall discuss each of these cases other than an unreported Ohio intermediate appellate court opinion that was decided contrary to the view espoused by our intermediate appellate court and by St. Paul. We find no clear cut majority view applicable to this case. Appellate cases heretofore decided really shed little light on the issue here because those cases represent situations or language so substantially different from that in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>before us. Only two of the cases, <em>Phil G. Ruvelson, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>235 Minn. 243, 50 N.W.2d 629 (1951), and <em>Princess Ring Co. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>52 R.I. 481, 161 A. 292 (1932), are from courts of last resort. None of the cases is from a United States Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">St. Paul puts great store by <em>Princess Ring, </em>particularly its statement \u201c \u2018[ojpportunity makes the thief.\u2019 \u201d 52 R.I. at 484, 161 A. at 293. The statement, however, has to be taken in the context of the facts of the case. The court there said relative to the insurance policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201cIt stated that it covered loss of the insured property arising from any cause except \u2018... loss or damage to property insured hereunder whilst in or upon any automobile ... unless such conveyance is attended at the time the loss occurs by a permanent employee of the assured, or by a person whose sole duty is to attend the conveyance and who at such time shall remain in or upon the conveyance ...\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 483, 161 A. at 293. The facts were that the jewelry company\u2019s permanent employee went to visit his brother. Two containers of jewelry were in the car. When he arrived at his brother\u2019s house, the brother\u2019s father-in-law was outside. He asked the father-in-law to watch the car. When the employee went to ring the doorbell at his brother\u2019s home, he saw someone jump into the car and drive away. The court found that the permanent employee \u201cwas not in attendance upon the automobile at the time the jewelry was stolen. He was about forty feet from the automobile, attending to another matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 161 A. at 293. As to the father-in-law, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">\u201cDoes the evidence prove that Mr. Mark was \u2018a person whose sole duty is to attend the conveyance and who at such time shall remain in or upon the conveyance\u2019? The phrase \u2018shall remain in or upon the conveyance\u2019 fixed the place where the person attending the automobile was required to be when the property insured was \u2018in or upon any automobile.\u2019 The same phrase is used both in reference to the property insured and the person attending the automobile. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Both must be \u2018in or upon\u2019 the automobile. \u2018Opportunity makes the thief.\u2019 If Mr. Mark had been in the automobile probably the thief would not have entered. There is no evidence that the thief then knew the jewelry was in the automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the evidence proves that plaintiffs loss was not covered by the insurance policy because plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements contained in the exception above quoted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Id. </em>484-85, 161 A. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>Ruvelson, </em>the policy read as to an exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201c <em>\u2018Loss of or damage to property insured hereunder whilst in or upon any automobile, motorcycle or any other vehicle </em>unless, at the time the loss occurs, there is actually in or upon such vehicle, the assured or a permanent employee of the assured, or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">235 Minn. at 244, 50 N.W.2d at 630. In that case, the employee began to feel drowsy because of medication he was taking. The employee went to a hotel to procure a cup of coffee to serve as an antidote for the medicine which he had taken. He had first securely locked his car with the suitcases containing the jewels and merchandise contained in the car. He found one of the car windows broken and the jewelry missing upon his return. The court, upholding denial of the claim, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">\u201cThe language used in the exception now before us is clear and unequivocal. It requires that the assured, or a permanent employe[e] of assured, or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle be actually in or upon the automobile when the loss occurs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 251, 50 N.W.2d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">We have found but two cases addressing the issue of ambiguity. In one case the policy language involved was substantially different from that in the case before us. Moreover, it was not \u201cin or on\u201d that was construed but \u201cunattended.\u201d In <em>Zurich Midwest v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>159 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Ill.App.3d 961, 111 Ill.Dec. 813, 513 N.E.2d 59 (1987), the exclusion read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201c \u2018 <em>Unattended Vehicle. </em>We won\u2019t cover loss to property while such is left in or on a vehicle unless you, your employee or sales personnel are attending the vehicle at the time of the loss.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 963, 111 Ill.Dec. at 814, 513 N.E.2d at 60. There, as the court put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cAfter his last stop in Wisconsin, Gutman made a brief stop at a doughnut store with windows which were wide open and without curtains. He stayed within approximately 40 feet of his locked car and his car was out of sight for less than one minute, while he used the restroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 962, 111 Ill.Dec. at 814, 513 N.E.2d at 60. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cThe \u2018Unattended Vehicle\u2019 clause in the case at bar is not subject to double or multiple meanings. As defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2482 (3d ed.1966), \u2018unattended\u2019 means \u2018lacking a guard, escort, caretaker, or other watcher.\u2019 Here, when Gutman went into the restaurant, albeit with the car securely locked, and lost sight of the car when he went into the washroom, he no longer was attending it. Under these facts, the car was unattended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 963, 111 Ill.Dec. at 814, 513 N.E.2d at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">The second case to address ambiguity is <em>Tivoli Corp. v. Jewelers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>932 S.W.2d 704 (Tex.Ct.App.1996). The court set forth the exclusion in the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">\u201cProperty Excluded</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">We do not cover property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-14\">H\u00ed sfc Hi H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-15\">10. <em>In or on a vehicle that is not attended. An attended vehicle has a person actually in or on the vehicle. This </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>person must be you, your employee, or a person whose duty it is to attend it. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 707. The court set forth the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">\u201cOn December 9, 1991, George Kessler, Tivoli\u2019s wholesale jewelry salesman, who was traveling between sales locations, placed jewelry valued at $78,000 in the trunk of his car. Kessler stopped at a check cashing business owned by his friend in Houston. Parking in the parking lot and locking the car, Kessler left the jewelry in the trunk. Inside the building, he used the restroom located in a locked security area behind the lobby. Exiting the restroom, Kessler stood by a -window with his friend in the secured area overlooking the check cashing business\u2019s lobby. Kessler saw thieves taking the jewelry from his car\u2019s trunk. He ran from the secured area through the lobby and attempted unsuccessfully to stop the thieves as they drove away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The court said, \u201cWe must determine whether the insurance claim was properly denied. One issue is whether the \u2018unattended vehicle\u2019 exclusion contained in the insurance policy is ambiguous, as maintained by Tivoli and Goldman, so as to preclude summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710. In denying the claim, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cWe hold in this case the salesman did not have the jewelry in his possession at the time of the theft. We also hold the property was left in an unattended vehicle when he went into the building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">In <em>Jerome I. Silverman, Inc. v. Lloyd\u2019s Underwriters, </em>422 F.Supp. 89 (S.D.N.Y.1976), the policy excluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">\u201c \u2018... Loss of or damage to property insured hereunder while in or upon any automobile, motorcycle or any other vehicle unless, at the time the loss or damage occurs, there is actually in or upon such vehicle, the Assured, or a permanent employee of the Assured, or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 90. In that case, the salesman parked his car in a parking garage. He left his keys in the ignition so that the parking attendant could move the car if necessary. He told the attendant that he \u201cwould give him an extra tip if he would watch the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The salesman \u201cwalked about one and one-quarter blocks to a customer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, after sitting in the car for a period, he went to a telephone booth about fifteen feet in front of the car where he said he could view the car. Yet later he went to see another customer. The jewelry was missing when the salesman finally returned. The court concluded that \u201cno loss occurred while [the salesman] was in or around the automobile\u201d and that the parking lot attendant \u201c[q]uite simply [was] not \u2018a person whose sole duty it [was] to attend the vehicle....\u201d\u2019 <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In <em>Williams v. Fallaize Ins. Agency, </em>220 Ga.App. 411, 469 S.E.2d 752 (1996), the policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201c \u2018This policy does not insure loss of or damage to property: 3) in or upon any automobile or any other vehicle unless at the time the loss or damage occurs there is actually in or upon the vehicle, the Assured, or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 412, 469 S.E.2d at 754. The saleswoman was inside a store delivering jewelry to a customer at the time the jewelry was stolen. She was at least twenty-five feet away from her car. While she was in the store, someone smashed her car window, punctured the tires, released the trunk, and stole a briefcase containing the jewelry. The court said, \u201c[I]t is apparent that at the time of loss, [the saleswoman] was neither \u2018actually in\u2019 nor \u2018upon\u2019 her vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 469 S.E.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">In <em>Steinzeig v.

In that instance, the car was left unattended from 9:30 p.m. until sometime the following morning. The court said, \u201c[U]nder the facts in this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>plaintiffs cannot recover, because the loss occurred from an automobile at a time when it was not occupied by the insured or a permanent employee of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In <em>William Kinscherf Co. v.

The employee left the car parked at the curb of a street while he called on a customer and had lunch. The court said that \u201cunder the circumstances alleged in the complaint, bill of particulars, and proof of loss, [the employee] was not in attendance and no person was present \u2018to attend the conveyance\u2019 while the loss occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>254 N.Y.S. at 384.

The court recited the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\u201cThe vice-president drove up to a certain hotel and parked the car in a position which was approximately six to 10 feet from the hotel\u2019s entrance; he locked the car, checked the furs which were in the trunk, and saw that the trunk was locked. He then went to the registration desk. There was testimony that adjacent to the desk was a large window from which the car could be seen. After registering, which took but a few minutes, he started to walk back to the car. As he did so a man \u2018bolted\u2019 into the car, started it up and drove off. This all took but a few seconds. Some time later the car was found and the furs were gone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-10\"><em>Id. </em>The court said, in denying recovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">\u201c[T]here was no employee of the insured in or upon the vehicle, nor was there present the insured or a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>whose sole duty it was to attend the vehicle. It should be noted that the language provides for the necessity of having a person in or upon such vehicle is prefixed by the word \u2018actually.\u2019 That word must be given a meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Id. </em>291 N.Y.S.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">There are a number of cases that have focused on the presence in a policy of the adverb \u201cactually.\u201d <em>Revesz v.

The court recited the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\u201cIn order to get directions to [his ultimate destination], he parked his car at a curb in front of a service station, locked the ignition, got out of the car, taking his car keys with him, and walked around in front of his auto to the parkway.

The court denied liability, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201cAt the time of the loss the jewelry was not in his \u2018personal custody\u2019 and he was not \u2018actually in or upon\u2019 his vehicle, as required by the policies, in any sense of these words. The temporary abandonment is clearly evidenced by the fact that the thief was able to take possession of the vehicle and its contents without interference from him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 129, 106 Cal.Rptr. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">In <em>Greenberg v. Rhode Island Ins. Co., </em>188 Misc. 23, 66 N.Y.S.2d 457 (1946), a policy excluded a claim \u201c \u2018... unless, at the time the loss occurs, there is actually in or upon such vehicle the Assured or a permanent employee of the Assured, or a person whose sole duty it is to guard the property....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>66 N.Y.S.2d at 459. The loss occurred while the supposed custodian was in a restaurant with a friend.

One of the doors of the car had been pried open and the property in question had been stolen when the party returned about an hour later. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cWe must give due recognition to the use of the word \u2018actually\u2019 and must conclude it was inserted and intended for a definite purpose\u2014to indicate the intention that presence in reality\u2014presence in fact\u2014was required and not a constructive or theoretical one. If we do not adopt that view then care and accuracy in the use of words is a meaningless effort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\"><em>Id. </em>66 N.Y.S.2d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Recovery was permitted in <em>Lackow v. Insurance Co., 382 </em>N.Y.S.2d 529, 52 A.D.2d 579 (1976). The policy provision in question required that the employee \u201c \u2018actually [be] in or upon such vehicle\u2019 at the time of the loss.\u201d <em>Id. 382 </em>N.Y.S.2d at 530. The court held that the \u201cemployee\u2019s position at the time of the robbery, at the rear of the vehicle opening its trunk, was in compliance with the \u2018Jeweler\u2019s Block Policy\u2019 provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>382 N.Y.S.2d at 529-30. No reasoning is set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\"><em>Wideband Jewelry v. Sun Ins. Co., </em>619 N.Y.S.2d 339, 210 A.D.2d 220 (1994), likewise contains no analysis. The exclusion denied coverage \u201c \u2018... unless [the assured], an employee, or other person whose only duty is to attend the vehicle, are actually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>619 N.Y.S.2d at 339. The employee was approximately six feet from his vehicle when the thieves opened the trunk and stole the jewelry in question.

Taylor, </em>188 Misc. 199, 67 N.Y.S.2d 378 (1947), was similar to a jeweler\u2019s block policy in that the policy there excluded \u201c \u2018loss of the property insured [t]herein from road vehicles of every description when such vehicles are left unattended.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>67 N.Y.S.2d at 379. The vehicle in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>question was watched from the front window of an apartment on the first floor of an apartment house before which it was parked. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201cThe attendant, assuming the watcher to be such, was not shown to be actually within or upon the automobile, or so near thereto as to be able to observe a theft of the contents. The term \u2018unattended\u2019 has a connotation of lack of due diligence or protection which would exclude coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\"><em>American Stone Diamond, Inc. v. Lloyds of London, </em>934 F.Supp. 839 (S.D.Tex.1996), involved yet another case in which the policy provision required that \u201cthere [be] actually in or upon such vehicle, the Assured, or a permanent employee of the Assured, or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 841. There the representative of the wholesale jewelry company involved pulled into a service station to purchase gasoline for the trip home. After refueling the car, he went inside the station to pay. As the court put it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASf\">\u201c[AJfter waiting a minute or less in line, [he] noticed a black car pull up behind his rental car. Because the gasoline pumps were crowded with vehicles, [he] decided to return to his car to move it to allow the black car access to the pump. As [he] approached his car, the black car sped off and a customer informed [the custodian] that someone had stolen something from the trunk of [the] car [in question].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 840. The court said in denying liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201cIndeed, the use of the word \u2018actually\u2019 in the requirement that the assured or properly-designated person be \u2018actually in or upon\u2019 the vehicle at the time of loss belies any contention that constructive possession of the type urged by Plaintiff can avoid the exclusion. <em>See Royce Furs, </em>291 N.Y.S.2d at 531 (The \u2018in or upon the vehicle\u2019 language of the coverage exclusion \u2018is prefixed by the word \u201cactually.\u201d That word must be given a meaning.\u2019); <em>Revesz, </em>106 Cal.Rptr. at 168 (Agreeing with courts that \u2018placed great emphasis on the word \u201cactually,\u201d indicating that it clearly negates con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>structive presence and possession.\u2019). <em>See also Ideal Mut.

There is no contention that the salesman here was \u201cin\u201d the vehicle. Given our cases which hold that some distinct meaning must be given to every word and no word is to be rejected as mere surplusage, \u201con\u201d must be said to have some intended meaning here, a meaning which differs from \u201cin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In earlier generations when running boards were found on virtually all automobiles, there might have been some contention that a person on the running board of a vehicle would be on the car in question within the meaning of the policy. In today\u2019s world, one certainly would not expect a custodian of jewelry to be actually riding on a vehicle\u2014upon it, if you will. Indeed, if the person were and this obstructed the vision of the driver, the person might run afoul of Maryland Code (1977, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 21-1104 of the Transportation Article. In common parlance, one would expect the requirement that a person be \u201con\u201d a vehicle to mean the person was required actually to be situate upon the exterior of the vehicle. This would be in line with the most nearly applicable definition of the word \u201con\u201d found in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 1574 (Unab. ed 1961), where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">\u201c1 a-used as a function word to indicate position over and in contact with that which supports from beneath (the book is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>[on] the table) (was built [on] an island) (kept his hands [on] the desk).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 981 (5th ed.1979), defines \u201con\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cUpon; as soon as; near to; along; along side of; adjacent to; contiguous to; at the time of; following upon; in; during; at or in contact with upper surface of a thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">No citations are given. However, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1240 (4th ed.1951), after giving a similar definition, refers to <em>Slaughter v. Robinson, </em>52 Utah 273, 173 P. 456, 458 (1918); <em>Hinton v. Vinson, </em>180 N.C. 393, 104 S.E. 897, 900 (1920); and <em>Stuckey v. Jones, </em>240 S.W. 565, 566 (Tex.Civ.App.1922). None of those cases, however, provides guidance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We do not understand that it is the intent that a person actually be physically located upon the vehicle. In fact, St. Paul agrees that for JMP to recover the employee in question does not have to be actually physically situate upon the vehicle in question. It says that \u201con\u201d fixes place. That is fine, but interpretation is required, a judgment call as to whether a given fact situation amounts to being \u201con\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">At oral argument, in response to questions from the Court, St. Paul took the position that when the employee here put the gasoline nozzle into the vehicle and began pumping gasoline he was still \u201con\u201d the vehicle, although he obviously would not have been physically affixed upon it. Counsel agreed that if the employee had gone four feet away from the car to an outside booth to pay for the gasoline in question, he still would have continued to be in attendance and thus \u201con\u201d the vehicle, but he contended that when the employee went inside to pay for the gasoline, he abandoned the vehicle and therefore no longer was \u201con it.\u201d The problems encountered are demonstrated by the further contention in response to questions from the bench that if the building in question had been three feet away from the vehicle rather than forty feet and the person went a foot inside the building to pay for the gasoline, he would no longer be \u201con\u201d the vehicle, not being in attendance. Further questions were propounded relative to a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>son having his head under the hood of the car for some purpose or fixing a flat tire, in either of which situations he would have been unable to see the trunk in question. Nevertheless, it is the belief of the insurance company that this person would be in attendance and therefore \u201con\u201d the vehicle. If the insurance company meant \u201cin attendance,\u201d it did not say so. This all points up the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cOn\u201d as here used is ambiguous. Under our cases some meaning must be ascribed to it. There is nothing to tell us what the insurance company meant. Each of the dictionary definitions we have quoted would require interpretation. Scriveners of insurance policies have the ability to express what they mean when they so desire. There is nothing to guide us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We have found no reported appellate opinion other than that of the Court of Special Appeals which has construed the \u201cin or on\u201d language with which we are here concerned. We conclude that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of St. Paul. The Court of Special Appeals likewise erred in affirming that judgment. As Judge Eldridge said for the Court in <em>Truck Ins. Exh. v. Marks Rentals, </em>288 Md. 428, 433, 418 A.2d 1187, 1190 (1980), \u201c[Wjhere contractual language is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the intention of the parties.\u201d Hence, there must be a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-12\">. \"The idea of jeweler\u2019s block insurance was conceived by a Lloyds of London underwriter at the turn of the century, and provides jewelers with the only adequate coverage for the various risks inherent in their businesses.\u201d Tracy A.
