McAULIFFE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Avr\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">This case involves a constitutional attack by judgment debtors against a judgment entered against them by a state trial court in Virginia. The collateral attack on the judgment was made in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, Maryland, where the judgment creditor sought to enforce the judgment. The defendants challenge the basis for the exercise of long-arm personal jurisdiction by the Virginia court, as well as the constitutional sufficiency of the Virginia statutory scheme for the giving of notice to nonresidents proceeded against under that Commonwealth\u2019s long-arm jurisdiction statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, Sections 11-801 to 807 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Md. code (1957, 1989 Repl. Vol., 1992 Cum. Supp.), Resort Properties, Inc. (Resort), filed a judgment against Gerard and Karen Miserandino, (defendants) in the Circuit Court for Carroll County on June 3, 1993. The notice of filing of judgment, mailed by a court clerk to the defendants, simply informed them that a judgment of $4,211.82 against them had been filed by Resort. Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion to strike the entry of the foreign judgment. From their inspection of the court\u2019s file, the defendants knew that the judgment was obtained in Warren County, Virginia and that Resort was the assignee of North Fork Shenandoah Vacations, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In the motion, the defendants alleged by affidavit made on personal knowledge that they were not served with process, had no notice, and did not appear in the Virginia action. They alleged further, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Defendants were not subject to the jurisdiction of said Virginia Court in said action, nor was either of them.... Said foreign judgment is invalid, null, void and of no effect since said Virginia Court lacked <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over defendants, or either of them, in the action in which that judgment was entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Specifically, the motion alleged that neither of the defendants resides in Virginia, neither is domiciled in Virginia, neither is employed in Virginia, carries on any regular business, occupation, or vocation in Virginia, or maintains a principal place of business in Virginia. Finally, they alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">Defendants do not have sufficient contacts with Virginia to confer <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over them, or either of them, upon the Virginia court in which said foreign judgment was entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">In an accompanying memorandum, the defendants argued that they did not have sufficient contacts with Virginia to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201csatisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\u201d quoting <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1877).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In opposition, Resort stated: \u201cThe underlying transaction was based upon the defendants having an interest in and possessing real property in Virginia, and the transaction in and of itself constituted transacting business by the defendants in Virginia.\u201d Resort also averred, \u201cDefendants executed a loan application in July, 1988, in Virginia for an interest in real property which was located in Virginia, thereby confessing fees and jurisdiction over both defendants in the State of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">At the hearing of defendants\u2019 motion, Resort\u2019s attorney informed the court that he had a loan application, club membership contract, and deed in his file, and that he was willing to provide the court with copies. The court interrupted and there ensued an exchange between the judge and the defendants\u2019 attorney, Mr. Lipsitz, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">THE COURT: Well ... I\u2019m not sure Mr. Lipsitz has any problem with the fact that there was property purchased, or a loan made, or a contract made in West (sic) Virginia____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">MR. LIPSITZ: Well, I\u2019m not pressing that point today, your Honor....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">I raise the issue because, frankly, until this morning, I had no idea what the claim was. You can\u2019t\u2014from the record ... you really can\u2019t tell what the claim is.... If my people, in fact, own property in Virginia, and if this transaction involved that\u2014is involved in this case, I probably would not prevail on the in personam jurisdiction point. Nevertheless, the service point is the critical point..... I\u2019m willing to accept my brother\u2019s statement as to what he says is in his file ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">THE COURT: For purposes of the hearing (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">MR. LIPSITZ: ... that\u2019s something that could be thrashed out at a trial on the merits ... maybe they\u2019re subject to jurisdiction; maybe they\u2019re not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">The court initially granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. Resort filed a motion to alter or amend because the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>cited the wrong statute in its order. After a second hearing, the court reversed its ruling and recorded the judgment against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion, and this Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">II. PERSONAL JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Virginia, like Maryland, has interpreted its long-arm statute as an attempt to assert jurisdiction to the extent possible under the Due Process Clause of the federal Constitution. <em>Brown v. American Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1296 (4th Cir.1983). Section 8.01-328.1 of the Virginia Code (1950, 1992 Rep. Vol.) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person ... as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">1. Transacting any business in this Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\"># ^ H* sH \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">6. Having any interest in, using, or possessing real property in the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">We note initially that the defendants had the burden of producing evidence to attack the judgment sought to be recorded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">In Maryland, an authenticated copy of a record is prima facie evidence of jurisdiction and the judgment or decree must be presumed valid until it is declared invalid by a competent court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-13\"><em>Imperial Hotel v. Bell Atlantic, </em>91 Md.App. 266, 271-72, 603 A.2d 1371 (1992). In <em>Brewster v. Brewster, </em>204 Md. 501, 105 A.2d 232 (1954), the Court considered the issue of a divorce obtained by the husband in Arkansas and another divorce obtained by the wife in Maryland. The wife argued the Arkansas divorce should not take effect until she was given an opportunity to prove it invalid. The court ruled, however, that \u201cuntil [the foreign judgment] is declared to be invalid by a competent court, it must be presumed to be valid and given full faith and credit.... The burden of proof is upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>attacker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <em>505, 105 </em>A.2d 232. <em>See also Van Wagenberg v. Van Wagenberg, </em>241 Md. 154, 160, 215 A.2d 812 (1966). As noted, defendants offered no evidence to contradict the basis of long-arm jurisdiction asserted by Resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">To exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant who is not present in the forum state, \u201cdue process requires only that ... [the defendant] have certain minimum contacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). \u201c[T]he quality, and quantity of contacts required to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction\u201d depend upon the facts of each particular case. <em>Camelback Ski Corp. v. Behning, </em>312 Md. 330, 338, 539 A.2d 1107 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 849, 109 S.Ct. 130, 102 L.Ed.2d 103 (1988). Ordinarily, cases involve either \u201cgeneral jurisdiction\u201d where the cause of action is unrelated to the defendant\u2019s contact with the forum state, or \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d where the cause of action arises out of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">Generally speaking, when the cause of action does not arise out of, or is not directly related to, the conduct of the defendant within the forum, contacts reflecting continuous or systematic... conduct will be required to sustain jurisdiction. On the other hand, when the cause of action arises out of the contacts that the defendant had with the forum, it may be entirely fair to permit the exercise of jurisdiction as to that claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 338-39, 539 A.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The defendants\u2019 allegations were insufficient to raise an actual controversy regarding the Virginia court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. If this were a \u201cgeneral jurisdiction\u201d case, their assertion that they did not reside in Virginia or conduct business regularly in Virginia may have been sufficient to raise an actual controversy. <em>See International Shoe, supra, </em>326 U.S. at 317, 66 S.Ct. at 158-59. This case, however, may be classified as a \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d case because Resort\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>cause of action arises out of the defendants\u2019 contacts with Virginia, signing a contract and allegedly purchasing an interest in property in that jurisdiction. Thus, under the facts of this case, the defendants\u2019 allegations did not raise an actual controversy regarding the existence of a sufficient basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">In a suit arising out of a contract signed in the forum state, the contract plus other factors provide a sufficient basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the forum state. In <em>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas insurance company was amenable to suit in California because the insured was domiciled in California and the suit arose under the insurance contract. \u201cIt is sufficient for purposes of due process that the suit was based on a contract which had substantial connection with that State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 78 S.Ct. at 201. Other factors, however, such as ongoing relationship with the party in the forum state, are required to establish \u201cminimum contacts.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 478-79, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 2185-86, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). In this case, the defendants never alleged or proved that they did not sign a contract in Virginia, that this case did not arise out of a contract signed in Virginia, or that there were no other factors to support personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In any event, it is clear from the colloquy we set forth in Section 1, <em>supra, </em>that for present purposes the defendants waived any attack they may have had against the assertion of personal jurisdiction under the Virginia long-arm statute, and acquiesced in the statement of counsel for the plaintiff that the documentary evidence he proffered would be sufficient to show a proper ground for the exercise of that jurisdiction. Any issues that might have been raised as to the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 original pleadings in Virginia, or as to the grounds for personal jurisdiction, were effectively waived for purposes of the circuit court hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>III. ADEQUACY OF NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The more difficult question with respect to the acquisition of personal jurisdiction by the Virginia court involves the constitutional adequacy of the means employed to give notice to the defendants. The procedure followed by the plaintiff was in accordance with the Virginia statute prescribing the method of service of process upon a nonresident individual in a case involving long-arm jurisdiction, but that will not be sufficient to confer jurisdiction unless the method authorized by the statute comports with the requirements of federal due process. Thus, we are required to address a question not yet resolved by the United States Supreme Court, and only rarely considered by other federal and state courts: whether initial and original service of process by first-class mail is constitutionally sufficient to confer <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over a nonresident individual in a long-arm jurisdiction case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment \u201cat a minimum ... require[s] that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Tr. Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656-57, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). The importance of giving adequate notice cannot be overstated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it. Nor has a better way been found for generating the feeling, so important to a popular government, that justice has been done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO\"><em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123, 171-72, 71 S.Ct. 624, 649, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951), Frankfurter, J. concurring (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">No particular procedure is required in all cases. \u201cOn the contrary, due process is flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. Procedures adequate under one set of facts may not be sufficient in a different situation.\u201d <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 416, 474 A.2d 191 (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>See also, Golden Sands Club v. Waller, </em>313 Md. 484, 493, 545 A.2d 1332 (1988) (Maryland Contract Lien Act, requiring notice of lien to condominium unit owners by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, satisfies due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">To determine whether notice in a particular case is constitutionally sufficient, the court \u201cmust balance the interests of the state or the giver of notice against the individual interest sought to be protected by the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>Golden Sands, supra, </em>313 Md. at 496, 545 A.2d 1332; <em>see also, Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. at 657; <em>Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 416, 474 A.2d 191. At a minimum, the notice must be \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Among the multiple factors to be considered in determining what process is due in a given situation is the nature of the action being brought.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">What is a sufficient method of notification depends upon the nature of the action and the circumstances. The interests to be considered are, on the one hand, those of the state and of the plaintiff in bringing the issues involved to a final settlement and, on the other hand, those of the defendant in being afforded an opportunity to defend. The practicalities of the situation must be considered. A state is not precluded from exercising such judicial jurisdiction as it may possess by the fact that under the circumstances it is impossible to make certain that notice will reach the defendant or because the only sure way of giving notice to the defendant would be so burdensome and expensive as to be impracticable. On the other hand, when actual notice is practicable, a procedure which is a mere gesture is not enough. A method of notification which would be sufficient in some circumstances may be insufficient in others because another method would obviously be better calculated to give the defendant knowledge of the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 25 cmt. d. (1971). Although the distinction between <em>in rem </em>and <em>in personam </em>actions no longer offers a <em>per se </em>solution to problems of notice, the nature of the action continues to be relevant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">[W]e decline to resolve the constitutional question based upon the determination of whether the particular action is more properly characterized as one <em>in rem </em>or <em>in personam. ... </em>That is not to say that the nature of the action has no bearing on a constitutional assessment of the reasonableness of the procedures employed. The character of the action reflects the extent to which the court purports to extend its power, and thus may roughly describe the scope of potential adverse consequences to the person claiming a right to more effective notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>Greene v. Lindsey, </em>456 U.S. 444, 450, 102 S.Ct. 1874, 1878, 72 L.Ed.2d 249 (1982). The Supreme Court has recognized that when an action involves property, the state may indulge certain assumptions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">The ways of an owner with tangible property are such that he usually arranges means to learn of any direct attack upon his possessory or proprietary rights. Hence, libel of a ship, attachment of a chattel or entry upon real estate in the . name of law may reasonably be expected to come promptly to the owner\u2019s attention. When the state within which the owner has located such property seizes it for some reason, publication or posting affords an additional measure of notification. A state may indulge the assumption that one who has left tangible property in the state either has abandoned it, in which case proceedings against it deprive him of nothing ... or that he has left some caretaker under a duty to let him know that it is being jeopardized.... As phrased long ago by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>The Mary, </em>9 Cranch 126, 144, 3 L.Ed. 678 \u2018it is the part of common prudence for all those who have any interest in [a thing], to guard that interest by persons who are in a situation to protect it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\"><em>Mullane, supra, </em>339 U.S. at 316, 70 S.Ct. at 658. More recently, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>It is, of course, reasonable to assume that a property owner will maintain superintendence of his property, and to presume that actions physically disturbing his holdings will come to his attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><em>Greene v. Lindsey, </em>456 U.S. at 451, 102 S.Ct. at 1879. For a further discussion of the \u201ccaretaker assumption\u201d <em>see </em>R. Greenbaum, <em>The Postman Never Rings Twice: The Constitutionality Of Process By Posting After Greene V. Lindsey, </em>33 Am. Univ.L.R. 601, 616-20 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">When the nature of a case involved judicial settlements by the trustee of a common trust fund embracing 113 trusts with resident and nonresident beneficiaries, the Supreme Court held that personal service of notice of the accounting would not be required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">This type of trust presupposes a large number of small interests. The individual interest does not stand alone but is identical with that of a class. The rights of each in the integrity of the fund and the fidelity of the trustee are shared by many other beneficiaries. Therefore notice reasonably certain to reach most of those interested in objecting is likely to safeguard the interest of all, since any objection sustained would inure to the benefit of all. We think that under such circumstances reasonable risks that notice might not actually reach every beneficiary are justifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>Mullane, supra, </em>339 U.S. at 319, 70 S.Ct. at 659-60. The Court held, however, that newspaper publication alone was insufficient \u201cnot because in fact it fails to reach everyone, but because under the circumstances it is not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The case before us is not <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem. </em>This case involves an attempt by one party to obtain a money judgment against another party or parties for an alleged breach of a promise to pay. It is a classic example of a case requiring the acquisition of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. Historically, in-hand delivery of process has been the preferred method of service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>in a case of this kind, but equivalent methods have been approved and alternative methods may be utilized when personal service proves difficult or impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In Maryland, the method of service of process ordinarily required to obtain original personal jurisdiction over a resident or nonresident individual is by personal delivery, or by certified mail with restricted delivery and return receipt stating to whom delivered and the date and address of delivery. Maryland Rule 2-121(a). Additionally, personal service outside the state may be made \u201cin the manner prescribed by the court or prescribed by the foreign jurisdiction if reasonably calculated to give actual notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Substituted service is permitted when a defendant has acted to evade service;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when a person resists service by threats, or force;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or when good faith efforts to serve the defendant in person or by certified mail have not succeeded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In the case before us, there is no indication that any earlier attempt of service had been made, or that the defendants were attempting to avoid or resist service. Accordingly, the method of service utilized in this case, service by first-class mail, would not have been sufficient under Maryland law. That fact is of no consequence, however, if the method of service satisfies the requirements of due process, because the service of process was in accordance with the applicable Virginia statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Section 8.01-329 of the Code of Virginia (1950, 1992 Repl. Vol.) provides an alternative method of service of process on a nonresident subject to long-arm jurisdiction by service \u201con the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia ... who, for this purpose, shall be deemed to be the statutory agent of such person.\u201d That section of the code further provides that service on the Secretary</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>shall be sufficient upon the person to be served, provided that notice of such service, a copy of the process or notice, and a copy of the affidavit are forthwith mailed, by the Secretary to the person or persons to be served at the last known post-office address of such person, and a certificate of compliance herewith by the Secretary or someone designated by him for that purpose and having knowledge of such compliance, shall be forthwith filed with the papers in the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The concept of serving a state officer or agency in connection with the acquisition of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident dates to the era of <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, supra, </em>when it was held that <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction could be acquired only by service made within the state. With the subsequent recognition of long-arm jurisdiction the necessity for service within the state disappeared, and resort to the legal fiction of \u201cconsent\u201d to service on a local agent or \u201cappointment\u201d of a local agent for service was no longer necessary. See <em>Olberding v. Illinois Central R. Co., </em>346 U.S. 338, 74 S.Ct. 83, 98 L.Ed. 39 (1953); <em>Com. De Astral v. Boston Met. Co., </em>205 Md. 237, 264, 107 A.2d. 357, 108 A.2d. 372 (1954).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">Inasmuch as service no longer is limited in all cases to the territorial confines of the jurisdiction in which the court is sitting, the requirement in the original nonresident motorist statutes that service be made \u201cwithin the state\u201d by serving a state official before process is mailed to defendant no longer is of constitutional magnitude. Although it served its purpose well in an earlier era, it is largely an anachronism today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">4 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1074 at p. 459 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Although no longer required as a condition to the acquisition of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident, and insufficient in itself to confer jurisdiction, involvement of the Secretary of the Commonwealth does serve the important purposes of ensuring that notice is in fact sent and providing a neutral and official repository for documentary evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>that fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants do not contend that the required procedure was not followed in this case. That the notice was sent, however, does not answer the question of whether the means employed for transmittal of the notice was constitutionally sufficient. Service on a state official or agency does not obviate the necessity for constitutionally sufficient notice to the defendant. <em>Wuchter v. Pizzutti, </em>276 U.S. 13, 48 S.Ct. 259, 72 L.Ed. 446 (1928); <em>Grote v. Rogers, </em>158 Md. 685, 149 A. 547 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Personal delivery of process to a defendant, followed by the filing of written proof of that service, is a time-honored method of acquiring personal jurisdiction. This method of service, properly executed, provides a high degree of probability that the defendant received the required notice. An alternative method of \u201cpersonal delivery\u201d is to have an employee of the United States Postal Service deliver the process to the defendant. This method, service by mail, is often quicker and less expensive than service by a sheriff or private process server, but may present a problem with respect to proof of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Postal regulations providing an optional service of restricted delivery of registered or certified mail do, however, offer a solution to the problem of proof of service. For an additional fee, a person mailing a letter may direct that the letter be handled as registered or certified mail, that the letter may be delivered only to the addressee or his duly authorized representative, and that the person accomplishing delivery return a receipt to the sender bearing the signature of the person receiving the letter and showing the date and address of delivery. <em>See </em>39 C.F.R. \u00a7 111.1 incorporating by reference the provisions of the Domestic Mail Manual. <em>See </em>in addition, the following sections of the Domestic Mail Manual: S 911 registered mail; S 912 certified mail; S 915 return receipts; and S 916 restricted delivery. When process is mailed in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>fashion a return that includes a postal receipt bearing the signature of the defendant or his authorized agent and a copy of the process that was mailed is filed, and the court can proceed with a high level of confidence that the requisite notice has been given.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">Service by registered or certified mail should be regarded as efficacious [as personal service] from a constitutional perspective to evoke personal jurisdiction since the return receipt normally guarantees that defendant or someone related or associated with him has received the process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHR\">4 Wright and Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>(1987), \u00a7 1074 at p. 457-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Problems have arisen with the use of restricted delivery mail for service of process principally with respect to mail that is returned \u201crefused\u201d or \u201cunclaimed.\u201d Postal regulations permit an addressee to \u201crefuse to accept a piece of mail when it is offered for delivery.\u201d Domestic Mail Manual, D 042. In the event of an affirmative refusal, the letter is marked \u201crefused\u201d and is returned to the sender. A restricted delivery letter that is not affirmatively refused, but is not delivered because the addressee does not claim it after delivery is attempted and notices have been left at the address given, is returned to the sender marked \u201cunclaimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Courts in jurisdictions permitting personal service by registered or certified mail have generally held that a defendant cannot defeat service by an affirmative refusal to accept the letter, but that an \u201cunclaimed\u201d letter will not suffice to confer personal jurisdiction. <em>See, </em>Note, <em>Service Of Process By Mail, </em>74 Mich.

In 1982, the Supreme Court forwarded to Congress a proposed revision of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 that would have utilized restricted delivery registered or certified mail as an alternative to personal service. Significant protests were advanced, however, resulting in a postponement of the effective date of this proposed rule change, and ultimately resulting in a major change in the proposed amendment to the Rule. <em>See Brown v. Hart, </em>96 F.R.D. 64, 116-135 (N.D.Ill. 1982), detailing the history of the initial proposal and subsequent modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In a letter dated December 10, 1982, to the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Assistant Attorney General Robert McConnell summarized the criticisms of the proposed rule, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">[Cjritics of that system of mail service have argued that certified mail is not an effective method of providing actual notice to defendants of claims against them because signatures may be illegible or may not match the name of the defendant, or because it may be difficult to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>whether mail has been \u2018unclaimed\u2019 or \u2018refused,\u2019 the latter providing the sole basis for a default judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">96 F.R.D. at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The amendment to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 that emerged from Congress in 1983 did not permit original service by registered or certified mail as a means of acquiring personal jurisdiction. Instead, the Rule permitted an attempt at service by first-class mail that would be effective <em>only </em>if the person to be served returned a written acknowledgment within twenty days after the date of mailing. If an acknowledgment of service was not received, service would then be required under other provisions of the Rule. As an incentive to the recipient to accept service by first-class mail, the Rule further provided that a recipient who declined to file a written acknowledgment would be charged with the costs of service by other means. Changes to Rule 4 effective in 1993 now make it clear that this use of first-class mail does not actually achieve service of process, but rather facilitates the filing by the recipient of a waiver of service that permits the action to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">This history of recent amendments to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 suggests the existence of an abiding congressional concern about the effectiveness about certain types of mail delivery as a primary means of service to acquire personal jurisdiction. Certainly there has been no suggestion that the use of first-class mail alone to accomplish such service would be looked upon with favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The Maryland legislature has recently enacted a bill that permits the giving of first notices in an estate case by first-class mail instead of restricted mail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chapter 417 of the Laws of Maryland, 1996, codified at \u00a7 1-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1991 Rep. Vol., 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>cum. supp.). The legislative history indicates that the principal purpose of the change was to reduce costs now borne by Registers of Wills. There is no discussion in the legislative history or in the brief approval of the proposed bill by the Attorney General of any due process considerations. This Court has not had an opportunity to pass upon the constitutional sufficiency of notice by first-class mail in this context, and we intimate no opinion on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Professor Robert W. Kirst, in his article <em>Nebraska\u2019s Modern Service of Process Statute, </em>63 Neb. L.Rev. 1 (1983) suggests that service by first-class mail as a primary means of acquiring personal jurisdiction probably does not comport with the requirements of due process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae9\">Service by first class mail alone, with no receipt, is an alternative method of substituted service, but it hardly seems likely to comply with the due process clause, notwithstanding the Sixth Circuit\u2019s possible endorsement of it in <em>Greene [v. Lindsey </em>]. The Sixth Circuit clearly had no empirical data to show that the rate of pilferage from mailboxes in public housing projects was less than the rate of removal of summons from doors. The chance that the summons will be mailed or delivered to the wrong address must be at least as high, if not higher, as the chance it will be posted on the wrong door. With ordinary mail there is no sheriffs return of service to provide some assurance that the summons was actually posted and when it was posted; in entering a default, the court can relay only on post office routine to deliver mail promptly and return undeliverable mail. Although the Supreme Court upheld the use of first class mail service in <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>it was in the context of an action more like class litigation than individual litigation. Given these defects in service by ordinary mail, the wise course is to consider the caveat in <em>Greene </em>as a warning not to use ordinary mail as a routine method of substituted service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 6 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The parties did not supply, and we are unable to find, empirical data reflecting the rate of success of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>States Postal Service in delivering first-class mail. The Postal Service does provide performance data relating to average days to deliver from overnight service areas, from two-day service areas, and from three-day service areas. This data is compiled by Price Waterhouse under contract to the Postal Service, and provides figures for 96 cities and the nation. Data for September 14, 1996, to December 6, 1996, disclose that the aggregate on-time delivery ranges from 76 percent to 91 percent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These figures do not, however, disclose how many pieces of first-class mail were not delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Notwithstanding the concerns about the use of mail without a signed returned receipt or waiver of service to obtain personal jurisdiction, there is strong precedent and rather extensive experience that supports the use of first-class mail for that purpose. That precedent may be found in Federal Bankruptcy Rule 7004, and in the 1976 amended version of its predecessor Rule 704. Prior to the 1976 amendment, Rule 704(c) permitted service of summons, complaint, and notice of trial upon competent individuals \u201cby any form of mail requiring a signed receipt.\u201d The 1976 amendment permitted such service anywhere within the United States \u201cby first-class mail postage prepaid.\u201d Successor Rule 7004(b), adopted in 1983, continues the practice of permitted service of the summons and complaint by first-class mail, and provides that the mailing may be made \u201cto the individual\u2019s dwelling house or usual place of abode,\u201d or \u201cto the place where the individual regularly conducts a business or profession.\u201d Unlike the procedure specified in Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, no acknowledgment of waiver of service is required to accomplish service under this Rule. Moreover, this method of service may be made in \u201cnon-core\u201d as well as \u201ccore\u201d proceedings, so that it is recognized as an effective means of acquiring original personal jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>a stranger to the bankruptcy proceedings in a contested matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The constitutional sufficiency of notice given pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7004 and its predecessor rule has been upheld. <em>Matter of Park Nursing Center, Inc., </em>766 F.2d 261 (6th Cir.1985); <em>In Re M &amp; L Business Mach. Co., Inc. </em>190 B.R. 111 (D.Colo.1995); <em>In Re Kim, </em>163 B.R. 157 (9th Cir. BAP1994); <em>In Re Cossio, </em>163 B.R. 150 (9th Cir.BAP1994), <em>aff'd, </em>56 F.3d 70 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Leavell v. Karnes, </em>143 B.R. 212 (S.D.Ill.1990); <em>Windsor Communications Group, Inc. v. Grant, </em>75 B.R. 713 (E.D.Pa.1985). It should be noted, however, that two of the three judges in <em>Matter of Park Nursing Center, Inc. supra, </em>believed that first-class mail service satisfied due process requirements only if interpreted in the light of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 55(c) and 60(b) so that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">[I]f a default judgment in bankruptcy proceedings is entered against an individual who, through no fault of his own, failed to receive actual notice by first-class mail, then that judgment should be set aside under these rules upon a showing of meritorious defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">766 F.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">These rule changes have been upheld on the basis that special requirements of bankruptcy cases justify a more expeditious and less costly means of service than might be required in an ordinary civil case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">In recognition of the time constraints in bankruptcy proceedings and to insure simple and expeditious service of defendants to such proceedings, Congress enacted Bankruptcy Rule 7004(b) to allow for service by mail alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\"><em>In Re M &amp; L Business Mach. Co., Inc., supra, </em>at 115.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">What is needed in bankruptcy proceedings is a form of notice which is likely to achieve actual notice in a large volume of cases but is not overly expensive or time consuming. Bankruptcy proceedings occupy a large and important place in our federal judicial system. In 1983, there were 490,717 petitions filed in bankruptcy court, and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>842,229 bankruptcy proceedings pending, 123,442 were adversary proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><em>Matter of Park Nursing Center, Inc., supra, </em>766 F.2d at 263. Additionally, adjudication of the rights of many persons and entities may be delayed in bankruptcy proceedings pending the determination of adversary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As we pointed out earlier, the concept of due process is not static\u2014the process that is due may change according to the circumstances. Necessity may, therefore, be a valid factor in the due process equation in the balancing of the interest of the state against the interest of the individual. Historically, courts have permitted the employment of potentially less effective methods of service where more effective methods have been attempted and have failed, or are otherwise impractical. Notification of lien holders in tax sale proceedings by mail instead of individual personal service may be adequate because of the state\u2019s interest in facilitating tax sales, the presumption of reasonable interest in tax sale proceedings by the lien holders, and the difficulty and expenses of personal service, but notice by publication may not be sufficient when the identities of creditors are reasonably ascertainable. <em>Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180 (1983). Reasonable risks that the method of notice employed will not reach each individual affected may be tolerated when the action is against a class of persons and notice is reasonably certain to reach most of those interested in objecting. <em>Mullane, supra, </em>339 U.S. at 306, 70 S.Ct. at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Turning to the case before us, we consider whether there are any special or unique circumstances that would justify relaxation of the ordinary and available methods of service that offer a considerably higher degree of probability of actual notice. In other words, given the availability of personal service by officials or private process servers, or service by restricted delivery mail, what state interest is present in this case that would justify resort to the significantly less certain procedure of first-class mail? We find but one circumstance that may distinguish this case from any other <em>in personam </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>action: the fact that the defendants are nonresidents of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The Supreme Court has recognized that some distinction may be drawn between the methods employed to serve residents and some to serve nonresidents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">Personal service has not in all circumstances been regarded as indispensable to the process due to residents, and it has more often been held unnecessary as to nonresidents. We disturb none of the established rules on these subjects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsR\"><em>Mullane, supra, </em>339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. at 657. Additionally, the fact of nonresidency has been held sufficient in some instances to uphold disparate treatment when a challenge has been made under the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See, e.g., Owens v. I.F.P. Corp., </em>374 F.Supp. 1032 (W.D.Ky.1974); <em>Castelline v. Goldfine Truck Rental Service, </em>49 Del. 155, 112 A.2d 840, 844 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">We do not, however, view the factor of nonresidency as being of such significance or compelling interest as to justify the shifting of the balance to a point where notice by first-class mail alone will be sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over an individual defendant. We fail to see why traditional methods of personal service on residents become so much more difficult or costly when applied to nonresidents. Certainly there may be some additional inconvenience or expense when dealing with officials or private process servers in another state, but this small difference hardly justifies the significant step of permitting first-class mail service. Moreover, service by mail requiring a signed return receipt would be no more difficult or expensive in the case of a nonresident than that of a resident. Virginia does not permit first-class mail service of its residents in personal jurisdiction cases except where more conventional means have failed, and then only in conjunction with posting of the premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Code of Virginia (1950, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1996 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 8.01-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Virginia does permit a direct attack against a void judgment, if made within two years, \u00a7 8.01\u2014428(A)(ii), and a collateral attack by an independent equity action if a party can show nonreceipt of the first-class mail notice and the existence of a defense to the action, \u00a7 8.01-428(D). As the Supreme Court has said, however, in <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965), actions for relief from a default judgment that place a burden of proof upon the petitioner that he would not have borne if the notice had been sufficient in the first instance are insufficient to overcome the initial deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The heart of the question is whether the means adopted by the Virginia legislature to notify nonresident defendants of an <em>in personam </em>action against them amounted to \u201ca reliable means of acquainting interested parties of the fact that their rights are before the courts\u201d and \u201cmeans ... such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it,\u201d <em>Mullane, supra, </em>339 U.S. at 315, 70 S.Ct. at 657, when \u201cthe reasonableness of the notice provided ... [is] tested with reference provided to the \u2018feasible and customary\u2019 alternatives and supplements to the form of notice chosen,\u201d <em>Greene v.

We hold that the means selected by the Virginia legislature to accomplish notice of service of original process in this case does not measure up to this test, and are constitutionally inadequate to afford the due process required by the United States Constitution. The method chosen to acquire personal jurisdiction over nonresident individuals\u2014 notice by first-class mail\u2014\u201cis not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand.\u201d <em>Mullane, supra, </em>339 U.S. at 319, 70 S.Ct. at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Accordingly, although the judgment may remain valid where entered until there is a contrary ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction, we decline to grant full faith and credit to the judgment because of our finding that the Virginia trial court did not acquire personal jurisdiction over these defendants because of the constitutional inadequacy of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Dissenting Opinion by CHASANOW, J., in which RODOWSKY and RAKER, JJ., join.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">.

I respectfully dissent. If statutorily authorized service of process in a long-arm jurisdiction case is actually received by the defendant, whether effectuated by first-class mail or certified mail with restricted delivery and return receipt requested, the court ought to have <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. The focus of this Court should be on whether the Miserandinos actually received the statutorily authorized mail service. If they did, they received all of the process they were due.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">If the Miserandinos were served with process in the Virginia proceeding, then the judgment against them should be given full faith and credit. The Miserandinos maintain that they did not receive service, but their uncorroborated denial of service is not necessarily adequate to overcome the presumption that service was properly made. Therefore, this case should be remanded in order to afford the Miserandinos an opportunity to establish that they were not served.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">This case does not arise from a failure to follow the applicable statute governing service of process. It is undisputed that Resort strictly complied with the notice requirements of Virginia\u2019s long-arm statute. Specifically, Resort served the Secretary of the Commonwealth with process, accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the Miserandinos\u2019 address as \u201c418 Ridge Rd., Westminster, Md. 21157,\u201d and stating that the Miserandinos were non-residents of the Commonwealth. The Secretary in turn certified that copies of these papers \u201cwere forwarded by first-class mail\u201d to the Miserandinos.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The trial judge concluded that the Miserandinos received due process of law, and denied the Miserandinos\u2019 Motion to Strike Entry of the Judgment. Although it is not clear from the record, this ruling may have included a determination that the Miserandinos received the notice mailed to each of them by the Virginia Secretary of the Commonwealth. Certainly, the Miserandinos\u2019 mere affidavit of nonreceipt of service did not conclusively rebut the strong presumption of service. Until there is a hearing to rebut the presumption of service, we must assume that the Miserandinos received the mailed notice. If the Miserandinos received mailed notice of the Virginia suit pursuant to the Virginia statute, this Court should not give them standing to challenge the constitutionality of the notice provision in the Virginia statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Recently in <em>Academy of IRM v. LVI Environmental Services, Inc., </em>344 Md. 434, 446, 687 A.2d 669, 675 (1997), this Court held that \u201cthe return of service ..., with its accompanying return receipt, <em>prima facie </em>evidences service of process .... \u201d \u201cIn a particular case, [however,] it may become a question of fact whether the person who signed the return receipt was an agent for accepting the delivery of certified mail on behalf of the corporate officer to whom delivery was restricted.\u201d 344 Md. at 447, 687 A.2d at 675. Because no evidence was produced in <em>Academy of IRM </em>to contradict the <em>prima facie </em>validity of service, we upheld the service of process. 344 Md. at 449-50, 687 A.2d at 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>How much of a burden of proof will be placed on a defendant to prove nonreceipt of service will depend on the reliability of the method of service chosen. Where there is a sheriffs return of service, very strong evidence is necessary to impeach the return. In <em>Weinreich, Adm\u2019x v. Walker, </em>236 Md. 290, 203 A.2d 854 (1964), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">\u201cIt is true that there may be successful impeachment of service seemingly valid on the record but, in all the Maryland cases in which there has been, the circumstances have ranged from virtual demonstration of the lack of service (as in <em>German v. Slade, </em>42 Md. 510, in which a defendant swore he had not been served and the deputy sheriff swore he had served the other defendants but not that one and had entered the notation of service by mistake) to clear and convincing evidence that there had not been service, in the form of corroboration of the defendant\u2019s claim that there had not been, by independent disinterested witnesses, plus lack of refutation, when challenged, by the sheriff or others. See, for example, <em>Master v.

Hence, the burden is on the Miserandinos to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that they did not receive the mailed summons. The presumption of service afforded by first-class mail service ought to be the easiest presumption of service to rebut, but a mere affidavit of nonreceipt without corroborating facts does not necessarily rebut the presumption of receipt of mailed service. The trial judge did not find that the Miserandinos failed to receive the mailed service; in fact, the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Miserandinos were not denied due process may have encompassed a finding that they did receive the mailed service.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">At a hearing to determine whether the Miserandinos received the mailed notice, the factors that the trial judge could weigh against the Miserandinos\u2019 denial of service are the presumption of proper mailing based on the affidavit of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia; the fact that the address was the correct home address and that other mailed service in the Maryland case was received at that address; and any possible defenses the Miserandinos have to the Virginia action. The Miserandinos\u2019 possible defenses to the Virginia action are relevant to receipt of service based on the assumption that a person with a strong defense would be unlikely to ignore notice of a suit, but a person with no defense might be likely to ignore or forget about notice of a suit. Instead of refusing to give full faith and credit to the Virginia judgment, this Court should remand the case to give the Miserandinos an opportunity to rebut the presumption of service and to establish a denial of due process by proving an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>actual lack of notice and to proffer some defense to the . Virginia action.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The majority clearly defines what it sees as the issue in this case: \u201cwhether initial and original service of process by first-class mail is constitutionally sufficient to confer <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over a nonresident individual in a long arm jurisdiction case.\u201d 345 Md. 43, 52, 691 A.2d 208, 212 (1997). It then recognizes the significant body of law and experience that is contrary to its holding when it says, \u201cthere is strong precedent and rather extensive experience that supports the use of first-class mail 345 Md. at 63, 691 A.2d at 217-218. The Court goes on to acknowledge that service by first-class mail is probably adequate to acquire jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases. But, according to the majority, first-class mail is not adequate to acquire jurisdiction over nonresidents in long-arm cases because it \u201c \u2018is not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand.\u2019 \u201d 345 Md. at 67, 691 A.2d at 220 (quoting <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover B. &amp; T. Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 319, 70 S.Ct. 652, 660, 94 L.Ed. 865, 876 (1950)). The majority seems to indicate that the only acceptable form of mail service is \u201ccertified mail with restricted delivery and return receipt stating to whom delivered and the date and address of delivery.\u201d 345 Md. at 67, 691 A.2d at 214 (citing Maryland Rule 2-121(a)). Hereinafter, I will refer to that kind of mail as \u201ccertified\u201d mail, but the majority\u2019s requirement raises interesting questions, such as, would certified mail without restricted delivery, but which is signed for by the defendant, also be inadequate to acquire <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction in the same manner that ordinary mail actually delivered is insufficient to acquire <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The majority suggests that if \u201ccertified\u201d mail were substituted for first-class mail in Virginia\u2019s long-arm statute, the statute would be constitutional. This type of mail does not increase the likelihood that the mail will arrive at the address to which it was sent. If the address is correct, then ultimate receipt by the defendant is about as likely with first-class mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>as with certified mail. The use of \u201ccertified\u201d mail merely provides corroborative evidence that the material is actually sent, and further provides a record of dispatch and delivery. <em>See State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. 195, 209, 328 A.2d 737, 746 (1974)(stating that \u201c[t]he only logical purpose to be served by directing that the notice be delivered by certified mail is to provide corroboration for bald assertions of having given such notice and a means of tracing and establishing the date of receipt should a dispute concerning the delivery of notice arise\u201d); <em>Holmes v. Randolph, </em>610 N.E.2d 839, 845 (Ind.1993)(stating \u201cuse of certified mail will provide a better record of receipt but not necessarily increase the probability the addressee will actually receive the notice. Certified mail is not insured, and \u2018is dispatched and handled in transit as ordinary mail.\u2019 U.S. Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual subch. 912.11 (Issue 43: June 1992)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Furthermore, the majority appears to equate first-class mail with the specific method of notice prescribed by Virginia\u2019s long-arm statute. In fact, the method of notice under the statute surpasses ordinary first-class mail in that, like \u201ccertified\u201d mail, it too provides a record of dispatch. The statute requires the Secretary of the Commonwealth, rather than the plaintiff, to mail the notice and to certify the date and fact of mailing. Hence, a party disinterested in the litigation issues a record of dispatch. This feature enhances the reliability of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The majority\u2019s insistence on registered or certified mail also fails to take into account the fact that these types of mail are not available in certain instances. The postal regulations declare certain matters ineligible for registration. Mail which is \u201c[a]ddressed to post offices to which it cannot be transported safely,\u201d for example, may not be registered. United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual, Issue 48, S911.1.4, at S-19 (1995)(hereinafter \u201cDMM\u201d). In addition, mail that requires a signature is, as a practical matter, often unavailable in certain rural areas. Rural letter carriers must dismount from their vehicles in order to deliver registered, certified, or return-receipt mail only if the address is \u201con the line of travel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>or within one-half mile of the route and has a passable road leading to it.\u201d Rural Carrier Duties and Responsibilities \u00a7 313.3, at 63 (1991). If an individual lives farther than one-half mile from the rural route, a letter carrier need not deviate from his or her route. Therefore, return-receipt mail sent to such a remote address is undeliverable, unless the addressee takes affirmative steps to retrieve the mail at a post office. The Uniform Probate Code specifically references such difficulties with rural route delivery and in some circumstances permits service by ordinary mail. <em>See, e.g., </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 15-4-303 (1996)(comment to official text)(stating that \u201c[t]he provision for ordinary mail as a substitute for registered or certified mail is provided because ... registered mail may not be available to reach certain addresses ... and also certified mail may not be available as a process for service because of the method of delivery used [rural delivery and star route delivery]\u201d); Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 72-4-203 (1995)(same); N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 30.1-25-03 (1995)(same); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-4-303 (1996)(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In adopting a long-arm statute that provides for service by first-class mail the Virginia legislature concluded that this method is reasonably calculated to inform nonresidents of the pendency of a judicial proceeding against them. This Court should accept the general validity of that determination, and only deny full faith and credit if the mailed process has not been received. Notice by first-class mail certainly has been upheld in a number of cases, and ample authority exists to support Virginia\u2019s decision to employ it in the context of notice to nonresidents who, because of real estate transactions or other contacts with the Commonwealth, are amenable to service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">My primary difficulty with the majority\u2019s approach is that it seems to assume that first-class mailed service (hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cmailed service\u201d) is constitutionally permissible to establish <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction in some types of law suits, but not others. Under the majority\u2019s approach, if mailed service is not constitutionally permissible in a particular type of lawsuit, then statutorily permissible mailed service does not establish <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction even if received. The majority\u2019s test for determining when mailed service is permissible is at best vague and uncertain, yet the majority does acknowledge that mailed service is adequate in some causes of action, such as bankruptcy. A better approach would be to hold that mailed service is constitutionally permissible in any form of action, and the decision as to when it may be authorized should be left to the legislative or rule making authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some legislatures may choose to adopt a statute that comports with merely the minimum requirements of due process, while others may choose to enhance the constitutional minimum. As one legal commentator has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201cSome service-by-mail statutes require only the satisfaction of minimum constitutional standards. Such statutes permit the use of ordinary mail....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">ik sk \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">In contrast ..., most service-by-mail statutes contain at least some requirements that are not constitutionally mandated. For example, many statutes demand that the plaintiff use registered or certified mail.... \u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\"><em>Service of Process by Mail, </em>74 Mich. L.Rev. 381, 385-86 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">There are numerous Maryland rules and statutes that authorize service by first-class mail. These rules and statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>may be of questionable validity as a result of the Court\u2019s decision in the instant case. A few examples should suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">To begin with, it is ironic that the Maryland proceedings in the instant ease were initiated by service on the Miserandinos by statutorily authorized first-class mail service. The Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, codified in Maryland at \u00a7 11-801 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides in \u00a7 11-803:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Addresses of debtor and creditor to be </em>furnished.\u2014 At the time a foreign judgment is filed, the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor\u2019s attorney shall file with the clerk of the court an affidavit showing the name and last known post office address of the judgment debtor and the judgment creditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">(b) <em>Clerk to mail notice of filing to </em>debtor.\u2014(1) The clerk promptly shall mail notice of the filing of the foreign judgment to the judgment debtor at the address given and shall note the mailing in the docket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Notice of the Maryland action against the Miserandinos, therefore, was addressed and sent to the same address in the same manner as was used to obtain service in the Virginia action; yet, this Court today holds that this method of notice is violative of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Several other statutes similarly provide for service of process by first-class mail. As the majority notes, \u201c[t]he Maryland legislature has recently enacted a bill that permits the giving of first notices in an estate case by first-class mail.... \u201d 345 Md. at 61, 691 A.2d at 217. This provision is codified in the Maryland Code (1974, 1996 Supp.), Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 1-103. Unfortunately, doubt is cast on the constitutionality of that statute when the Court states that \u201c[t]his Court has not had an opportunity to pass upon the constitutional sufficiency of notice by first-class mail in this context, and we intimate no opinion on that question.\u201d 345 Md. at 62, 691 A.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Title 6 of the Maryland Rules governs all matters in the orphan\u2019s courts and before the registers of wills relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>settlement of decedents\u2019 estates. Rule 6-125 of that title was recently adopted by this Court and is the general rule on service. Rule 6-125 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">\u201cRULE 6-125. SERVICE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">(a) Method of Service\u2014Generally.\u2014Except where these rules specifically require that service shall be made by certified mail, <em>service may be made by personal delivery or by ordinary mail. </em>Service by certified mail is complete upon delivery. Service by ordinary mail is complete upon mailing. If a person is represented by an attorney of record, service shall be made on the attorney pursuant to Rule 1-321. Service need not be made on any person who has filed a waiver of notice pursuant to Rule 6-126.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Did this Court recently adopt an unconstitutional rule? I doubt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Other actions commenced by first-class mail are now questionable because first-class mail may be insufficient to acquire <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. These include judicial review actions in workers\u2019 compensation cases initiated by first-class mail service. Rule 7-202(d)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201c(2) <em>Service by Petitioner in Workers\u2019 Compensation </em>Cases.\u2014Upon filing a petition for judicial review of a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, the petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition by first-class mail on the Commission and each other party of record in the proceeding before the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Even process initiating criminal proceedings may be served on a defendant by first-class mail under Rule 4-212. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">\u201c(a) General.\u2014When a charging document is filed or when a stetted case is rescheduled pursuant to Rule 4-248, a summons or warrant shall be issued in accordance with this Rule. Title 5 of these rules does not apply to the issuance of a summons or warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">(b) Summons\u2014Issuance.\u2014Unless a warrant has been issued, or the defendant is in custody, or the charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>document is a citation, a summons shall be issued to the defendant (1) in the District Court, by a judicial officer or the clerk, and (2) in the circuit court, by the clerk. The summons shall advise the defendant to appear in person at the time and place specified or, in the circuit court, to appear or have counsel enter an appearance in writing at or before that time. A copy of the charging document shall be attached to the summons. A court may order the reissuance of a summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">(c) <em>Summons\u2014Service.\u2014The summons and charging document shall be served on the defendant by mail or by personal service </em>by a sheriff or other peace officer, as directed (1) by a judicial officer in the District Court, or (2) by the State\u2019s Attorney in the circuit court.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">These statutes and rules are just some of the first-class mail provisions that may be cast in doubt by the majority\u2019s opinion in the instant case. Do these statutes and rules have \u201cspecial or unique circumstances that would justify relaxation of the ordinary and available methods of service ... ?\u201d 345 Md. at 65, 691 A.2d at 219. We do not know, and the test for special and unique circumstances seems, at best, murky. Apparently bankruptcy proceedings probably pass the test, estate and probate proceedings might pass the test, but long-arm suits do not pass the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">A better rale would be that, where a permissible method of service of process reasonably designed to reach the defendant is used but does not reach the defendant through no fault or lack of diligence of the defendant and where a judgment is entered against the defendant based on that service of process, the defendant will be deemed to have been denied due process when the failure to receive service prevented the assertion of a viable defense to the cause of action. Of course a heavy burden will be placed upon the defendant to prove nonreceipt of service. The amount of proof necessary to establish nonreceipt of service will depend upon the method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>service chosen by the plaintiff. This rule is entirely consistent with this Court\u2019s prior holdings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The majority and I agree that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201cAt a minimum, the notice must be \u2018reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">345 Md. at 53, 691 A.2d at 212 (quoting <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. at 657, 94 L.Ed. at 873). First-class mail meets that test, but it is up to the legislative or rule making body to authorize such service, and when authorized, it should be up to the litigants to decide whether to use first-class mail or an easier-to-prove form of service that would better insulate judgments from later collateral attack for nonreceipt of service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The law presumes that a letter properly mailed is in fact received. <em>Mohr v.

Although current statistics are unavailable, a law review article published in 1987 reported that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcN\">\u201c[Rjecords of complaints of nondelivery of all first-class mail show an annual figure of approximately 44,000 claims of nonreceipt out of a total first class mail volume of over 72 billion pieces, for a rate of .00006 of 1 percent (or about 1 claim for every 2 million pieces of mail). Actual loss experience is presumably considerably less than even this tiny fraction of mail volume.\u201d (Footnotes omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Kent Sinclair, <em>Service of Process: Rethinking the Theory and Procedure of Serving Process Under Federal Rule 4(c), </em>73 Va. L. Rev. 1183, 1206 (1987)(citing United States Postal Serv., Annual Report of the Postmaster General 26 (1985)). The Supreme Court has referred to the mails as \u201c \u2018an efficient and inexpensive means of communication,\u2019 upon which prudent men will ordinarily rely in the conduct of important affairs,\u201d <em>see Greene v. Lindsey, </em>456 U.S. 444, 455, 102 S.Ct. 1874, 1880, 72 L.Ed.2d 249, 258 (1982) (citation omitted), and has recognized mail service as a constitutionally sufficient means of providing notice in a number of cases. <em>See Tulsa Professional Collection Servs. v. Pope, </em>485 U.S. 478, 490, 108 S.Ct. 1340, 1347, 99 L.Ed.2d 565, 578 (1988)(stating that \u201c[w]e have repeatedly recognized that mail service is an inexpensive and efficient mechanism that is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice\u201d). In <em>Wuchter v. Pizzutti, </em>276 U.S. 13, 48 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>259, 72 L.Ed. 446 (1928), for example, the Supreme Court assessed the validity of a New Jersey statute that permitted notice to nonresident motorists to be accomplished by service upon the Secretary of State. The Court observed that this method of service \u201cwould not be fair or due process <em>unless </em>such officer or the plaintiff is required to <em>mail the notice to the defendant, or to advise him, by some written communication, </em>so as to make it reasonably probable that he will receive actual notice.\u201d <em>Wuchter, </em>276 U.S. at 19, 48 S.Ct. at 260, 72 L.Ed. at 449 (emphasis added). Because the New Jersey statute failed to provide for such communication by mail, the Court found the statute to be unconstitutional. The method of notification provided under the Virginia statute, in contrast, appears to conform with <em>Wuchter\u2019s </em>precise requirements; service was made upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who then mailed the notice to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The Supreme Court made similar reference to the mail system as an acceptable method of notification in <em>Schroeder v. New York, </em>371 U.S. 208, 83 S.Ct. 279, 9 L.Ed.2d 255 (1962), a case which involved a municipality\u2019s decision to divert a portion of a river. With regard to landowners whose property rights would be adversely affected by this action, the relevant statute required notice by publication. <em>Schroeder, </em>371 U.S. at 209, 83 S.Ct. at 280-81, 9 L.Ed.2d at 257. The Supreme Court found that while newspaper publications and posted notices did not provide the \u201cquality of notice\u201d required by the Due Process Clause, the municipality\u2019s constitutional obligation would have been discharged by \u201cthe mailing of a single letter.\u201d <em>Schroeder, </em>371 U.S. at 213-14, 83 S.Ct. at 283, 9 L.Ed.2d at 260. <em>See also Mennonite Board of Missions v.

At issue in <em>Mullane </em>was the validity of notice by publication to trust fund beneficiaries of a judicial settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of fund accounts. 339 U.S. at 307-09, 70 S.Ct. at 654-55, 94 L.Ed. at 869-71. Some of the beneficiaries were not residents of the state. <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 309, 70 S.Ct. at 655, 94 L.Ed. at 871. The Court held that notice by publication was constitutionally inadequate, and stated that those beneficiaries whose whereabouts were ascertainable should have been informed of the accounting \u201cat least by <em>ordinary </em>mail.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 318, 70 S.Ct. at 659, 94 L.Ed. at 875 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In assessing the minimal requirements of due process, therefore, the Supreme Court has repeatedly referenced the ordinary mail system as a constitutionally sufficient mechanism by which to provide notice. Virginia\u2019s decision to permit service by mail, therefore, seems in accord with the minimum requirements of due process as defined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Service by ordinary mail also has been upheld by numerous lower courts. Service by first-class mail in a bankruptcy proceeding, for example, withstood direct constitutional attack in <em>Matter of Park Nursing Center, Inc., </em>766 F.2d 261 (6th Cir.1985). Federal Bankruptcy Rule 7004 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201c(b) Service by first class mail. Except as provided in subdivision (h), in addition to the methods of service authorized by [certain Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], service may be made within the United States by <em>first class mail </em>postage prepaid as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or incompetent, by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the individual\u2019s dwelling house or usual place of abode or to the place where the individual regularly conducts a business or profession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Fed. R. Bankr. 7004(b)(1)(1994, 1996 Cum.Supp.)(emphasis added). A debtor, against whom a default judgment in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding had been entered, challenged the constitutionality of an earlier version<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of this rule on the grounds that: (1) due process requires personal service; (2) a method of service more likely to accomplish service should be attempted before resorting to first-class mail; (3) safeguards to ensure receipt of a first-class letter were lacking; and (4) the rule contained no requirement that the address on the envelope be correct. <em>Park Nursing Center, </em>766 F.2d at 263-64. In rejecting these assertions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted that <em>\u201cMullane </em>does not require the very best means of serving process, only a means that is reasonably calculated to reach the party.\u201d <em>Park Nursing Center, </em>766 F.2d at 264. In light of other rules of civil procedure that provide a mechanism by which to set aside a default judgment, the court concluded that the rule in question satisfies due process. <em>Park Nursing Center, </em>766 F.2d at 263-64. Bankruptcy court decisions subsequent to <em>Park Nursing Center </em>have consistently supported the constitutionality of service by first-class mail. <em>See, e.g., In Re M &amp; L Business Mach. Co., Inc., </em>190 B.R. 111, 115-16 (D.Colo.1995)(observing that \u201cstrict compliance with Rule 7004 serves to protect due process rights.... \u201d); <em>Leavell v. Karnes, </em>143 B.R. 212, 217 (S.D.Ill.1990)(stating that \u201c[sjervice under Rule 7004(b) comports with the procedural due process requirements identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Mullane. </em>...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The Minnesota Supreme Court, similarly, upheld the constitutionality of a statute permitting ordinary mail service upon a nonresident motorist in <em>Schilling v. Odlebak, </em>177 Minn. 90, 224 N.W. 694 (1929). The statute at issue was strikingly similar to Virginia\u2019s long-arm statute. Specifically, it allowed substituted service upon the Secretary of State \u201c \u2018provided, that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of such service and a copy of the process are within ten days thereafter sent <em>by mail </em>by the plaintiff to the defendant at his last known address and that the plaintiffs affidavit of compliance with the provisions of this act are attached to the summons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schilling, </em>224 N.W. at 695 (quoting L.1927, p. 557, c. 409, 1 Mason Minn. St. \u00a7 2684-8)(emphasis added). Relying in part on <em>Wuchter, supra, </em>the court concluded that \u201cit is reasonably certain that the defendant will receive actual notice, and that adequate opportunity is afforded him to defend.\u201d <em>Schilling, </em>224 N.W. at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In a more recent decision, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld a statute that permitted notice of the impoundment and potential disposal of abandoned vehicles by first-class mail. <em>Holmes, supra. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Holmes </em>contended that this method of notification was constitutionally flawed in that it \u201cfail[ed] to provide notice in the best available manner to assure delivery to the known owner prior to depriving the owner irrevocably of a property interest.\u201d 610 N.E.2d at 840. Although the trial court entered summary judgment in the plaintiffs favor, based in part on its conclusion that due process requires certified mail, return receipt requested, <em>see id., </em>the Indiana Supreme Court reversed that judgment. <em>Holmes, </em>610 N.E.2d at 846. The court noted that \u201c[t]he notice by first class mail given to owners of abandoned vehicles must be viewed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgement in dicta that \u2018the mails provide an \u201cefficient and inexpensive means of communication,\u201d ... upon which prudent men will ordinarily rely in the conduct of important affairs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holmes, </em>610 N.E.2d at 844 (quoting <em>Greene v. Lindsey, </em>456 U.S. at 455, 102 S.Ct. at 1880, 72 L.Ed.2d at 258, in turn quoting <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 319, 70 S.Ct. at 660, 94 L.Ed. at 876). Applying the <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>test, the court concluded that the method of notification prescribed by the statute satisfied due process, <em>see Holmes, </em>610 N.E.2d at 845 (observing that \u201c[t]he risk that failure of ... notice will lead to deprivation of an individual\u2019s vehicle is modest\u201d), and that \u201c[f]irst class mail notice sent to the record address of the vehicle owner is reasonably calculated to apprise the owner of the pendency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>abandoned vehicle proceedings.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>610 N.E.2d at 846. See also <em>Service of Process by Mail, </em>74 Mich. L.Rev. at 382, where the author concludes that \u201cservice by mail without a return-receipt requirement complies with the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,\u201d (citations omitted), and further \u201cconcludes that, in light of the procedures available to a defendant to challenge service [by ordinary mail] and to reopen default judgments entered against him, the requirement of a signed receipt is unduly harsh on plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Service by ordinary mail clearly satisfies due process in a variety of contexts. Virginia has apparently concluded that the use of first-class mail under its long-arm statute is \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to reach defendants. Maryland courts should defer to that assessment and limit their inquiry to whether the Miserandinos were afforded due process in the application of this statutory method of service. Since first-class mail is \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to reach a recipient, if the Miserandinos actually received the mailed service authorized by the Virginia statute, they have literally received all the process they were due. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Judges RODOWSKY and RAKER have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">. In the instant action, the Miserandinos do not dispute that they had sufficient contacts with the Commonwealth to otherwise subject them to the jurisdiction of the Virginia courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\">. Even if first-class mail service is permitted, litigants should be cautious in using this method of service because if the defendant does not respond, any judgment might be vulnerable to a due process attack. It is easier to prove nonreceipt of first-class mailed notice than it is to prove nonreceipt of certified mail notice where there is a written return receipt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">. It is interesting to speculate that the majority might have held first-class mail service to be constitutional had the Virginia statute required the Secretary of the Commonwealth to give notice by registered mail return-receipt requested, restricted deliveiy, but the Secretary only gave notice to the Miserandinos by first-class mail, as in the instant case. This Court has indicated that the use of first-class mail is adequate, even though the statute requires registered mail, if the first-class mail is actually received. This Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">\u201ceven when a statute requires that a notice be given by registered mail it has been held that notice actually received, though by regular mail, is valid. <em>See </em>58 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Notice </em>\u00a7 27 (1971); <em>Crummer </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>230 Cal.App.2d 264, 40 Cal.Rptr. 826 (1964); <em>Volandri v.

First-class mail service would be less expensive and less burdensome to plaintiffs as well as defendants and ought to be available as an optional form of service in many causes of action. Plaintiffs in some instances, however, should prefer \u201ccertified\u201d over first-class mail, not because the former increases the probability of service, but because it increases the evidence of service and makes any judgment less vulnerable to a later challenge. Whether first-class mail is more or less reliable than \u201ccertified\u201d mail often depends upon the individual to be served, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>rather than the nature of the cause of action. If \"certified\u201d mail is sent to th\u00e9 home address of a defendant or defendants who work during postal delivery hours or travel frequently, and who find it too difficult or inconvenient to go to the post office, such mail will often be returned as \u201cunclaimed.\" A prospective plaintiff who wishes to serve a working defendant at a home address may wish to use ordinary mail and to consider later a back-up form of service if the defendant does not respond and there may be some doubt about receipt of service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">.
