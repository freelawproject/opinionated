The issues concern the appealability of the circuit court decision, as well as the duties and responsibilities of Ocean City officials with regard to the City\u2019s registered voter list and the procedure for determining the validity of referendum petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The Mayor and City Council of Ocean City enacted a comprehensive rezoning ordinance on January 19, 1993. Shortly thereafter, a group of local citizens, led by the petitioner Vincent Gisriel, filed a petition pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Art. 23A, \u00a7 2(b)(30), and the Ocean City Charter, to bring the zoning ordinance to referendum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ocean City Solicitor approved the form of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>referendum petition, and the petition was then forwarded to the Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Elections (the Board) for a determination of whether Gisriel had obtained a sufficient number of signatures to place the zoning ordinance before the electorate. Gisriel\u2019s petition contained 1,013 signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Section C-411 of the Ocean City Charter sets forth the general procedures for petitioning an ordinance to referendum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The specific dispute in this case is over \u00a7 Call\u2019s requirement that a referendum petition contain the signatures of at least \u201c20% of the qualified voters\u201d of Ocean City. Upon learning that the Board\u2019s standard practice for determining whether referendum petitions met this requirement was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>compare the names on a submitted petition with the City\u2019s list of registered voters as of the date the petition was filed, Gisriel notified the Board that, in his view, the' list of registered voters contained the names of several unqualified voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">After comparing the names on the petition with the registered voter list, and after checking the status of persons asserted by Gisriel to be unqualified voters, the Board recommended to the City Council that Gisriel\u2019s petition be denied because it did not contain the names of at least 20% of the City\u2019s qualified voters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the Board, the number of registered voters in Ocean City was 4,903 as of February 16,1993, the date that the referendum petition was filed. The Board struck 66 of the 1,013 signatures on the submitted petition because they were duplicative, were the names of non-registered voters, or were otherwise \u201crejected signatures.\u201d The remaining 947 signatures constituted only 19.31% of the 4,903 registered voters in Ocean City, a figure less than the 20% threshold requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following an initial decision by the City Council that the number of valid signatures was insufficient, Gisriel, pursuant to \u00a7 C-505 of the Charter, requested an opportunity to be heard before the Council in order to present evidence contradicting the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">At a regularly scheduled Council meeting, Gisriel explained to the Council that the Ocean City voter registration list used by the Board is based on two voter registration rolls, the Worcester County \u201cUniversal List\u201d and the Ocean City \u201cMu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>nicipal Only\u201d or \u201cSupplemental List.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gisriel alleged, and produced evidence designed to support his allegation, that the voter registration list contained the names of 294 individuals who failed to meet the requirements for qualified voters under the provisions of the Charter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gisriel maintained that if the Board had removed the names of these allegedly unqualified voters from the list of registered voters, so that the list contained only the names of the City\u2019s registered and qualified voters, the number of signatures submitted on his referendum petition would have exceeded 20% of the City\u2019s qualified voters, requiring the City Council to place the ordinance on the ballot for consideration by the Ocean City electorate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Despite Gisriel\u2019s submission, the Council voted to reaffirm its initial decision upholding the recommendation of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Thereafter, Gisriel instituted the present action in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, naming the City, the Board and the Council as defendants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After a hearing, the circuit court issued an opinion and order. As a preliminary matter, the court rejected the City\u2019s contention that a comprehensive rezoning ordinance was not subject to referendum under the state statute, Art. 23A, \u00a7 2(b)(30). Addressing the merits of Gisriel\u2019s suit, the circuit court noted that there was a difference between a \u201cqualified voter\u201d and a \u201cregistered voter\u201d as those terms were used in the Ocean City Charter, and the court concluded that the Board\u2019s and Council\u2019s \u201crefusal to strike the unqualified but registered voters from the voter roll as of the date the Petition was timely delivered ... [was] erroneous as a matter of law....\u201d The circuit court ordered the Board to \u201ccull [the City\u2019s registered] voter roll of unqualified ... voters\u201d prior to determining the percentage of qualified voters who had signed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendants appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed. <em>Ocean City Board v. Gisriel, </em>102 Md.App. 136, 648 A.2d 1091 (1994). After raising <em>sua sponte </em>the question of whether it had jurisdiction, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The intermediate appellate court held that, absent fraud or misconduct by election officials, the list of registered voters is presumed to be the list of all qualified voters at any given point in time, so long as there are appropriate remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>available periodically to purge the list of unqualified voters. The Court of Special Appeals further held that the procedures enumerated in Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Art. 33, \u00a7 3-16, were applicable to municipal elections and provided the mechanism for correcting errors in voting registration lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Gisriel then filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the defendants were entitled to use the list of registered voters for the purpose of checking the petition, and arguing that the circuit court\u2019s decision was correct. This Court granted the petition, and we directed the parties to address an additional issue, namely whether the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the defendants\u2019 appeal. We shall first address this jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">It is an often stated principle of Maryland law that appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally authorized, is determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted. <em>See, e.g., Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 7, 633 A.2d 855, 857 (1993) (\u201c \u2018The right to take an appeal is entirely statutory, and no person or agency may prosecute an appeal unless the right is given by statute,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, 309, 242 A.2d 506 (1968)); <em>Howard County v. JJM, Inc., </em>301 Md. 256, 261, 482 A.2d 908, 910 (1984); <em>State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 147, 422 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1980); <em>Estep v. Estep, </em>285 Md. 416, 422, 404 A.2d 1040, 1043 (1979); <em>Smith v. Taylor, </em>285 Md. 143, 146, 400 A.2d 1130, 1132, (1979); <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 500, 331 A.2d 55, 64 (1975). Consequently, resolution of the jurisdictional issue depends upon an examination of the relevant provisions of the Maryland Code and of Ocean City\u2019s legislative enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Section C-505 of the Ocean City Charter grants a right to appeal actions or decisions of the Board to the City Council, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>and it provides for judicial review in the circuit court of the Council\u2019s decision. Section C-505, however, does not provide a right, of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Furthermore, no other provision of the Ocean City Charter or the Ocean City ordinances authorize an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-801 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which is the general statute authorizing appeals from the circuit courts, provides that \u201ca party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d Section 12-301 goes on specifically to grant a right of appeal \u201cfrom a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ApD\">Section 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, however, limits \u00a7 12-301\u2019s broad grant of the right to appeal, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201c(a) Unless a right of appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered or made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of the District Court, an administrative agency, or a local legislative body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision concerning its jurisdiction in the present case was based on that Court\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 12-302(a). Therefore, we shall briefly review the historical background of \u00a7 12-302(a)\u2019s limitation on the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The first general appeals statute enacted by the General Assembly after the Revolution was Ch. 87 of the Acts of 1785, \u00a7 6, which granted the \u201cfull power and right to appeal\u201d to \u201cany party or parties aggrieved by any judgment or determination of any county court in any civil suit or action, or any prosecution.... \u201d Despite the broad language of the 1785 statute, as well as subsequent broadly worded general appeals statutes, this Court construed the 1785 statute, and its successor statutes, to be inapplicable in a case where a county court, or later a circuit court, exercised a special limited statutory jurisdiction rather than its ordinary common law-type jurisdiction, and acted within that special limited statutory jurisdiction. When a county court or a circuit court was exercising a special limited statutory jurisdiction, and not a common law-type of jurisdiction, this Court regularly held that the general appeals statutes did not authorize an appeal, and that an appeal could be taken only if authorized by a specific statute relating to the particular type of statutory jurisdiction being exercised. <em>See Wil. &amp; Susq. R.R. Co. v. Condon, </em>8 G. &amp; J. 443, 448, 449 (1837), where the principle was initially adopted and discussed. This rule of construction was subsequently applied by this Court in a variety of contexts, including judgments of county courts or circuit courts reviewing decisions by justices of the peace, <em>Herzberg v. Adams, </em>39 Md. 309, 312 (1874); <em>Hough v. Kelsey &amp; Gray, </em>19 Md. 451, 455-456 (1863); <em>State v. Mister, </em>5 Md. 11, 15 (1853); <em>Crockett v. Parke, </em>7 Gill. 237, 240 (1848); judgments of the Baltimore City Court reviewing judgments of People\u2019s Court of Baltimore City, <em>Montgomery Ward v. Herrmann, </em>190 Md. 405, 408-411, 58 A.2d 677, 678-680 (1948); judgments of county and circuit courts reviewing decisions of local government officials, <em>Co. Commrs. Harford Co. v. Jay, </em>122 Md. 324, 327, 89 A. 715, 717 (1914); <em>Stephens v. M. &amp; C. of Crisfield, </em>122 Md. 190, 192-193, 89 A. 429, 429-430 (1914); <em>Webster v. Cockey, </em>9 Gill. 92, 93-95 (1850); circuit court judgments reviewing certain decisions of orphans\u2019 courts, <em>Lammott v. Maulsby, </em>8 Md. 5, 8-9 (1855); and circuit court judgments in actions for judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>administrative agency decisions, <em>Simpler v. State, Use of Boyd, </em>223 Md. 456, 460-461, 165 A.2d 464, 466 (1960); <em>Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>196 Md. 400, 406-407, 76 A.2d 736, 738 (1950). <em>See also Sugar v. North Balto. M.P. Church, </em>164 Md. 487, 498-500, 165 A. 703, 707-708 (1933) (collecting several other types of circuit court decisions rendered pursuant to special statutory jurisdiction); <em>Savage Man. Co. v. Owings, </em>3 Gill. 497, 498-499 (1846).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The rule precluding, under the general appeals statute, appeals from circuit court judgments in cases of special limited statutory jurisdiction, persisted despite several recodifications of the general appeals statutes by the Legislature containing no mention of the rule. Furthermore, in later years, the rule was frequently applied to limit appeals from circuit court judgments reviewing decisions of administrative agencies. <em>See, e.g., Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. v. American Federation, </em>289 Md. 388, 397-400, 406, 424 A.2d 770, 774-776, 779 (1981); <em>Urbana Civic v. Urbana Mobile, </em>260 Md. 458, 461, 272 A.2d 628, 630 (1971) (\u201c \u2018The rule is that where an inferior court exercises a special limited jurisdiction which is conferred by statute, no appeal from its decision in such cases lies to this [Cjourt unless expressly given by the statute\u2019\u201d); <em>Md. Pharmacy Board v. Peco, </em>234 Md. 200, 202, 198 A.2d 273, 274 (1964) (\u201cthe provisions of [the general appeal statute] do not apply to cases where the trial court exercises a special or limited jurisdiction conferred by statute\u201d); <em>Hart v. Comm. of Motor Vehicles, </em>226 Md. 584, 587, 174 A.2d 725, 726 (1961); <em>Simpler v. State, Use of Boyd, supra, </em>223 Md. at 460-461, 165 A.2d at 466; <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 580-581, 102 A.2d 248, 251 (1954); <em>Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, supra, </em>196 Md. at 406-407, 76 A.2d at 738; <em>Abbott v. Administrative Hearing Board, </em>33 Md.App. 681, 685-686, 366 A.2d 756, 759 (1976), <em>cert. denied, 280 </em>Md. 727 (1977); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Fahey, </em>28 Md.App. 312, 315-316, 345 A.2d 102, 104-105 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In 1973, the General Assembly recodified the appeals statutes in its enactment of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Code, which became effective on January 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>1974.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With its enactment of \u00a7 12-301, the Legislature retained the broad, general grant of the right to appeal. In addition, \u00a7 12-301 partially abrogated the above-discussed rule by expressly stating that the right of appeal existed \u201cfrom a final judgment by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction\u201d unless expressly denied by law. Thus the Legislature abolished a large part of the doctrine disallowing appeals from circuit court judgments entered pursuant to the exercise of special limited statutory jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The Legislature, however, expressly retained a portion of the doctrine by its enactment of \u00a7 12-302(a), which makes \u00a7 12-301 inapplicable to appeals from final judgments of circuit courts reviewing decisions of the District Court, administrative agencies, or local legislative bodies. Nevertheless, judgments of the circuit courts reviewing decisions of the District Court are generally subject to further discretionary appellate review by petitions for writs of certiorari filed in the Court of Appeals. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-305 and 12-307(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Moreover, appeals to the Court of Special Appeals from judgments of the circuit courts reviewing decisions of most <em>state </em>administrative agencies are generally authorized by the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-223(b) of the State Government Article. Consequently, the viability of the nonappealability principle adopted in <em>Wil. &amp; Susq. R.R. Co. v. Condon, supra, </em>8 G. &amp; J. at 448-449, and partially embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, is today largely limited to circuit court judgments in cases involving statutory judicial review of adjudicatory or quasi-judicial decisions by <em>local </em>government administrative agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and legislative bodies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In holding that \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article did not preclude an appeal of the circuit court\u2019s judgment in this case, the Court of Special Appeals pointed to the language of \u00a7 12-302(a) which states that \u201c\u00a7 12-301 does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered <em>... in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction </em>in reviewing the decision of ... an administrative agency, or a local legislative body.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Court of Special Appeals, construing this language in its most literal sense, held that \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable only when the court below is exercising \u201cappellate\u201d jurisdiction rather than \u201coriginal\u201d jurisdiction. The Court of Special Appeals thus explained (102 Md.App. at 147, 648 A.2d at 1095-1096):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThe issue, therefore, is whether the circuit court, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>exercised original or appellate jurisdiction when it reviewed the City Council\u2019s decision to affirm the Board\u2019s denial of appellee\u2019s petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Next, the Court of Special Appeals, citing and quoting from <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, </em>276 Md. 36, 43, 47, 343 A.2d 521, 525, 527 (1975), reiterated the principle of Maryland constitutional law that circuit court review of decisions by administrative agencies or local government bodies constitutes an exercise of original jurisdiction and not appellate jurisdiction. 102 Md.App. at 147-149, 648 A.2d at 1096-1097. Since, under the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7 12-302(a)\u2019s limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion on the right to appeal from circuit court judgments is applicable only when a circuit court is technically exercising <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction, and since the circuit court\u2019s review of the City Council\u2019s decision in the present case was an exercise of <em>original </em>jurisdiction, \u00a7 12-302(a)\u2019s limitation on the right to appeal was held to be inapplicable in the present case. For this reason, the Court of Special Appeals held that it had jurisdiction under \u00a7 12-301 to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Although we shall hold, on entirely different grounds, that the Court of Special Appeals did have jurisdiction over this appeal, we flatly reject that court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-302(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As indicated by the Court of Special Appeals, whenever a circuit court directly reviews the action, or inaction, of any administrative agency, governmental body, or official in the executive or legislative branches of government, including local government, the court is exercising original jurisdiction and not appellate jurisdiction. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, supra, </em>276 Md. at 43, 343 A.2d at 525 (\u201c[T]he exercise of appellate jurisdiction requires a prior action by some <em>judicial </em>authority, or the prior exercise of <em>judicial </em>power.... [R]e-view of the decisions of an administrative agency is an exercise of original jurisdiction and not of appellate jurisdiction\u201d). <em>See Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 604-605 n. 5, 612 A.2d 241, 245 n. 5 (1992); <em>In re Petition for Writ of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 294, 539 A.2d 664, 671 (1988); <em>Montgomery Co. v. Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. 459, 467, 385 A.2d 80, 84 (1978). In a technical, constitutional meaning of the term, a circuit court <em>never </em>exercises \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d when it directly reviews the decision of an administrative agency or a local government body.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Consequently, under the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, the language in \u00a7 12-302(a) relating to administrative agencies and local legislative bodies could never be given any effect. If \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable only when a court is exercising \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d in a technical, constitutional sense, and if a court never exercises such appellate jurisdiction when directly reviewing the action of an administrative agency or local legislative body, then the statutory language has utterly no effect. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation represents a striking violation of the principle that a court should not \u201cinterpret a statutory scheme so as to render any part of it meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Fraternal Order of Police v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 180, 680 A.2d 1052, 1065 (1996). <em>See, e.g., C &amp; P Telephone v. Director of Finance, </em>343 Md. 567, 579-580, 683 A.2d 512, 517-518 (1996); <em>DeBusk v.

As previously pointed out, this principle was regularly applied to statutory actions for judicial review of administrative agency and local government decisions. <em>See, e.g., Urbana Civic v. Urbana Mobile, supra, </em>260 Md. at 460-461, 272 A.2d at 630; <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, supra, </em>203 Md. at 580-581, 102 A.2d at 251; <em>Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, supra, </em>196 Md. at 406-407, 76 A.2d at 738. Although the statutory judicial review actions in those cases were clearly <em>original </em>actions under the teaching of <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, supra, </em>276 Md. at 43-47, 343 A.2d at 525-527, nevertheless \u00a7 12-302(a) was intended to embody the holdings of <em>Urbana, Steward, Johnson, </em>and similar cases. <em>See Pr.

Consequently, the history of \u00a7 12-302(a) indicates that the statute is applicable to statutory judicial review actions even though such actions technically do not represent exercises of a circuit court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Section 12-302(a) was enacted by the General Assembly in 1973, and the opinion in <em>Shell Oil Co. v.

Prior to the opinion in the <em>Shell Oil </em>case, and at the time \u00a7 12-302(a) was enacted, statutory circuit court actions for judicial review of decisions by administrative agencies or local legislative bodies were regularly called \u201cappeals\u201d and treated as if they fell within the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit courts. <em>See, e.g., Criminal Inj.

(Emphasis added). The Maryland Rules in 1973, and continuously until July 1, 1993, when the correct terminology was adopted, referred to circuit court actions reviewing administrative decisions as \u201cappeals\u201d and treated them as appeals. <em>See </em>Ch. 1100, Subtitle B, of the former Rules. In fact, the very provision of the Ocean City Charter invoked by Gisriel in the case at bar, \u00a7 C505 of the Charter, states that a decision of the City Council \u201cmay be <em>appealed </em>to the circuit court....\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Therefore, when \u00a7 12-302(a) was enacted, a reference to circuit court review of administrative agency and local government decisions as an exercise of \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d was consistent with the normal usage of the language at the time. It is much more likely that the Legislature, in \u00a7 12-302(a), intended to refer to ordinary statutory judicial review actions instead of to exercises of appellate jurisdiction in a technical, constitutional sense. We fully agree with Chief Judge Wilner\u2019s comment for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Department v. Harmans, </em>98 Md.App. 535, 542 n. 2, 633 A.2d 939, 943 n. 2 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cIn a technical, but to some extent jurisprudential, sense, a court does not exercise \u2018appellate jurisdiction\u2019 when reviewing the decision of an administrative agency or legislative body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cIt has long been common, however, to treat these kinds of actions as being in the nature of appeals and to refer to them as \u2018administrative appeals.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cWe have no doubt that, in crafting \u00a7 12-302(a) as it did, the Legislature had in mind actions of this type, to review the decisions of administrative and local legislative bodies, and so we shall construe the term \u2018appellate jurisdiction\u2019 in the manner the Legislature intended, rather than in its more narrow, but more appropriate, manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Accordingly we hold that, when a circuit court proceeding in substance constitutes ordinary judicial review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency or local legislative body, pursuant to a statute, ordinance, or charter provision, and the circuit court renders a final judgment within its jurisdiction, \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable, and an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals is not authorized by \u00a7 12-301. <em>See Pr.

For reasons entirely different from those set forth by the Court of Special Appeals, we believe that \u00a7 12-302(a) is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Although Gisriel did cite \u00a7 C-505 of the Ocean City Charter in his circuit court complaint, the nature of his action was not a statutory judicial review action unknown to the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>at the time when the principle embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) was first adopted by this Court in <em>Wil. &amp; Susq. R.R. v. Condon, supra, </em>8 G. &amp; J. at 448-449, and <em>Savage Man. Co. v. Owings, supra, </em>3 Gill. at 498-499. Instead, Gisriel\u2019s action in substance was a traditional common law mandamus action, and the circuit court\u2019s judgment in substance resembled the type of order rendered in a mandamus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">This Court recently reviewed the nature of a traditional common law mandamus action in <em>Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145-148, 680 A.2d 1040, 1047-1049 (1996). There, Judge Bell for the Court explained (343 Md. at 145, 680 A.2d at 1047):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201c[T]he common law writ of mandamus ... \u2018is an original action, as distinguished from an appeal,\u2019 ... [and] is ... \u2018an extraordinary remedy[,]\u2019 <em>Ipes v. Board of Fire Commissioners of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 180, 183, 167 A.2d 337, 339 (1961), \u2018that ... will not lie if [there is] any other adequate and convenient remedy[.]\u2019....

Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 514, 331 A.2d 55, 72 (1975).... [It] does not lie where the action to be reviewed is discretionary or depends on personal judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"><em>See, e.g., Board v. Secretary of Personnel, </em>317 Md. 34, 46-47, 562 A.2d 700, 706 (1989); <em>George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Allegany Co., </em>59 Md. 255, 259 (1883) (\u201cIts [mandamus\u2019s] office ... is to compel ... public officers to perform their functions, or some particular duty imposed upon them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Turning to the present case, Gisriel argued, and the circuit court agreed, that the Board had a non-discretionary duty to delete from the Ocean City registered voter list the names of unqualified voters before determining the percentage of voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>who had signed the petition. The circuit court\u2019s order concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cThe Court finds that Ocean City must cull its voter roll of unqualified but registered voters before it can determine the percentage of voters who signed Gisriel\u2019s petition. The Court finds, given the facts of this case, that the date the Town must use to purge its voters roll is February 16, 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, it is, ... by the Circuit Court for Worcester County, Maryland,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">ORDERED that this case is REMANDED to the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, Maryland, for REMAND to the Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Elections for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">If Gisriel\u2019s and the circuit court\u2019s view of the applicable law is correct, whenever a referendum petition is filed, and it is claimed that certain names on the registered voter list represent unqualified voters, the Board must determine whether or not such registered voters are unqualified, and delete the names of those found to be unqualified before deciding whether the petition contains the requisite percentage of signatures. Under the circuit court\u2019s holding, this is a ministerial duty imposed as a matter of law. It is the type of duty which, under the above-cited'cases, is an appropriate subject for a common law mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Any issues requiring the resolution of disputed facts would not arise until the Board begins to perform this duty. A subsequent judicial review of the manner in which the Board and Council performed the duty, involving the substantiality of the evidence supporting factual findings, the reasonableness of inferences and conclusions, etc., would constitute a judicial review action authorized by \u00a7 C-505 of the Ocean City Charter. Section \u00a7 12-302(a) presumably would be applicable to such an action. But a court action to determine in the first instance whether the Board must perform the duty is, by its very nature, a traditional common law mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">As previously discussed, the non-appealability rule embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) only applies when a circuit court exercises a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>special limited statutory jurisdiction instead of a common-law type of jurisdiction. The reason given for the rule was that the \u201cspecial limited jurisdiction given to the [trial] Court\u201d to \u201creview is a fit subject for litigation in [the trial] Court, but is wholly inappropriate to the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d <em>Wil. &amp; Susq. R.R. Co. v. Condon, supra, </em>8 G. &amp; J. at 448. Judge Chambers for the Court in <em>Savage Manufacturing Co. v. Owings, supra, </em>3 Gill, at 498-499, explained the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\u201cJurisdiction of this proceeding is not exercised by the County Court, in virtue of its general powers, as a Court of common law; it is vested by a special delegation of power and by the terms of the Act which confers it, to be exercised, not according to the forms and course of the common law, but in a special and peculiar mode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201cIt is a general and sound rule that a writ of error will not lie to a Court vested with special jurisdiction, and which does not proceed according to the forms of the common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cThis not being a case in which a writ of error would lie, and the Act ... being silent as to an appeal, we think the motion to dismiss must prevail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Thus, whether sound or not, the non-appealability principle was based entirely on the conclusion that the trial court was exercising a statutory type of jurisdiction unknown to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Consequently, the principle embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) has no application to common law actions. Both before and after the enactment of \u00a7 12-302(a), this Court has regularly exercised appellate jurisdiction in mandamus actions against administrative agencies and officials. <em>See, e.g., Goodwich v. Nolan, supra, </em>343 Md. 130, 680 A.2d 1040; <em>Board v. Secretary of Personnel, supra, </em>317 Md. at 45-49, 562 A.2d at 705-707; <em>Tabler v. Medical Mut. Liab.

Montgomery County, </em>180 Md. 498, 25 A.2d 682 (1942). Furthermore, even where a particular action against an administrative agency was allegedly brought under a statutory judicial review provision, and did not purport to be a mandamus action,, this Court has looked to the substance of the action, has held that it could be treated as a common law mandamus or certiorari action, and has exercised appellate jurisdiction. <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, supra, </em>273 Md. at 500-506, 331 A.2d at 64-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Since Gisriel\u2019s action was in substance a common law mandamus action, the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Gisriel argues, and the circuit court held, that whenever a referendum petition is filed and an issue is presented concerning the requisite percentage of signatures, the Board has a duty to examine the qualifications of any challenged names on the voter registration list, and delete the names of those who are not qualified, before determining whether the petition contains the signatures of at least 20% of the qualified voters. The position of the City and of the Court of Special Appeals, on the other hand, is that the voter registration list is determinative of the number of qualified voters as long as there are procedures for periodically culling from the list the names of those who are no longer qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Although we shall resolve this issue, we first point out that, in light of the undisputed facts of this case, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment would have to be affirmed under either of the above-described opposing views.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">As noted early in this opinion, <em>supra </em>n. 6, under Gisriel\u2019s allegations and evidence, the largest category of allegedly unqualified voters on the Ocean City voter registration list consisted of 128 residents of Ocean City who had failed to vote in the last two Ocean City elections immediately preceding the filing of the referendum petition. According to Gisriel, these 128 residents were no longer qualified voters because of \u00a7 C-504 of the Ocean City Charter. That section states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cIf any person has not voted in two (2) consecutive general municipal elections, it shall be the duty of the Board of Supervisors of Elections to strike his or her name from the list of eligible voters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Section C-504 of the Ocean City Charter does not expressly state that frequent voting is a \u201cqualification\u201d or that the failure to vote in two consecutive general municipal elections renders one \u201cunqualified\u201d to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Section C-403.A of the Ocean City Charter sets forth the \u201cqualifications\u201d for voting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201cThe qualifications of voters in Town elections of Ocean City shall be as follows: A voter, whether a man or a woman, must be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">(1) A citizen of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">(2) At least eighteen (18) years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">(3) Registered in accordance with the provisions of this Charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">(4) One who, for thirty (30) days next preceding the election, has been and is, at the time of the election domiciled within the corporate limits of the Town of Ocean City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Being a frequent voter is not included among the qualifications listed in \u00a7 C-403.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">Moreover, this Court has held that, under Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Maryland Constitution, being a frequent voter, or having voted in a specified number of prior elections, is not' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and cannot be a qualification for voting.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Recently in <em>State Election Bd. v. Election Bd. of Balt., </em>342 Md. 586, 598-599, 679 A.2d 96, 102 (1996), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cThe qualifications for voting in Maryland are prescribed in Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4, of the Maryland Constitution. In order to vote, one must be a citizen of the United States, eighteen years of age or older, and a resident of Maryland. In addition, the General Assembly may regulate or prohibit the right to vote of one convicted of a serious crime or under care or guardianship for mental disability. These prerequisites are the exclusive qualifications for voting in Maryland. <em>See </em>Article 7 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u2018every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage\u2019); <em>Jackson v. Norris, </em>173 Md. 579, 594, 195 A. 576, 584 (1937); <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 24 A. 606 (1892).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cConsequently, having voted frequently in the past is not a qualification for voting and, under the Maryland Constitution, could not be a qualification. The \u2018inactive\u2019 voters who remained on the registration rolls and who continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>meet the constitutional qualifications for voting in Baltimore City, were not \u2018ineligible\u2019 voters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">We went on in the <em>State Election Bd. </em>case to explain the only possible legitimate purpose of \u201cpurge\u201d provisions like \u00a7 C-504 of the Ocean City Charter and former Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, of the Maryland Election Code, as follows (342 Md. at 599, 679 A.2d at 102):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cContrary to the position of the State Board, former Art. 33, \u00a7 3-20, did not make voting at least once every five years a condition for continued voter eligibility. Instead, the sole purpose of former \u00a7 3-20, as well as present \u00a7 3-17A, was to set forth a procedure or remedy by which election boards could remove from the voter registration rolls the names of persons who had died, moved away, or incurred a voting disability under Article I, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Consequently, the 128 residents of Ocean City who had not voted in the preceding two general municipal elections, but whose names remained on the voter registration list, were not unqualified voters. In no event should their names be removed from the voter registration list.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">If it be assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that all of the other names challenged by Gisriel should be removed from the voter registration list, but with the names of the 128 infrequent voters retained on the list, the number of signatures obtained by Gisriel would still be insufficient to meet the twenty percent requirement imposed by \u00a7 C-411 of the Charter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, even under Gisriel\u2019s legal theory and allegations, he would not have been entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The Court of Special Appeals correctly held that, under this Court\u2019s opinions, the voter registration lists are conclusively presumed to be the lists of all qualified voters at any given point in time, as long as reasonable remedies are available periodically to delete from the lists the names of unqualified voters. \u201c[W]hen no fraud or misconduct is charged or imputed to the election officials in registering the voter or in retaining his name, the official registration books become, on the day of election, the list of the only qualified voters of the municipality.\u201d <em>Moore v. Bay, </em>149 Md. 286, 293, 131 A. 459, 462 (1925). <em>See also DuBois v.

Bay, supra, </em>two unsuccessful candidates in a municipal election challenged the validity of the election, alleging that some registered voters participating in the election were not legally qualified to vote because they did not possess all of the necessary qualifications required by the city charter. In rejecting the challenge, this Court concluded that \u201cthe final registration lists of voters [is] conclusive evidence of those entitled to vote at the ensuing municipal election.\u201d <em>Moore v. Bay, supra, </em>149 Md. at 296, 131 A. at 463. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the local election law prescribed a sufficient plan for the maintenance of the municipality\u2019s registration lists, and that, as long as the registration lists were compiled pursuant to this plan, they were conclusive evidence of the municipality\u2019s qualified voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>In <em>Lee v. Sec. of State &amp; Mahoney, supra, </em>the plaintiff challenged the right of a candidate to run in a general election as an independent, alleging that the Board of Supervisors of Elections had improperly reopened the voter registration books to allow the candidate to change his party affiliation. This Court pointed out that the state election code prescribed the applicable statutory mechanism by which voter registration lists could be challenged, but that the plaintiff had failed to follow these procedures. Consequently, the Court held that the trial court had properly dismissed the plaintiffs action.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Finally, in <em>DuBois v. City of College Park, supra, </em>three students at the University of Maryland, who were duly registered voters of the City of College Park, brought an action for a declaratory judgment that the City\u2019s couneilmanic districts were unconstitutionally apportioned because the figures upon which the districts were apportioned excluded students residing on the campus of the University of Maryland. It was claimed that the two \u201cstudent\u201d districts contained two to three times the population of the \u201cnon-student\u201d districts. The City argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the apportionment because, despite the fact that they were included on the City\u2019s registered voter list, they were not \u201cbona fide\u201d city residents. In rejecting the City\u2019s standing argument, we pointed out that the College Park Charter had incorporated the state election code\u2019s procedures providing for the removal of voters who were either improperly registered or who had become unqualified to vote, and that such remedy was exclusive and could not be by-passed. <em>DuBois v. City of College Park, supra, </em>280 Md. at 533, 375 A.2d at 1104. The Court held that the City \u201c[could] not, merely by moving to dismiss for lack of standing ..., contest the fact that those registered according to the city charter are not qualified voters.\u201d <em>DuBois v. City of College Park, supra, </em>280 Md. at 534, 375 A.2d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Court of Special Appeals recognized the important practical considerations underlying the principle applied in the above-discussed cases, when it stated <em>(Ocean City Board v. Gisriel, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 151, 648 A.2d at 1097-1098):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cThe ... effect of [the circuit court\u2019s] decision ... is that it allows or sanctions a petitioner, such as [Gisriel] in fact did here, to challenge the voter registration list at anytime after the referendum petition is submitted, <em>ad infinitum, </em>so long as the challenges submitted recite a factual premise that the challenged voter was not qualified to vote as of the date the petition was submitted. Notwithstanding the administrative nightmare this \u2018rolling barrage\u2019 scenario would present for the Board, a petitioner also would be disadvantaged as he or she would be unable to ascertain prior to or during the petition signature drive, with any degree of certainty, the number of signatures needed to satisfy the twenty-percent requirement of \u00a7 C-411. Moreover, while the Board struggles with this potential \u2018rolling barrage\u2019 ... the effectiveness of the petitioned law is suspended indefinitely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8W\">Furthermore, the record in this case shows that Ocean City does have an adequate periodic procedure for culling from the voter registration list the names of those who have died and the names of those who are unqualified. At the meeting of the City Council which afforded Gisriel the opportunity to present his challenges and evidence, the Chairperson of the Board, Mary Adeline Bradford, also testified concerning the Board\u2019s procedures. She stated that \u201cour board has a standard procedure for address verifications, deaths, moves, and other voter roll changes in order to protect the voter rights as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d She indicated that the Board had met on ten separate occasions between October 1992 and March 1993, for the purpose of conducting \u201cthe ongoing process of maintaining an accurate voter roll for ... Ocean City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">With respect to the particular process utilized by the Board to purge the City\u2019s registration list, Ms. Bradford explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A54\">\u201cInformation is sent out and replies are either\u2014come in with the folks saying they\u2019ve moved or else letters are returned by the post office as undeliverable. And only when we have paper documentation from the individual, can we indeed remove them from the rolls. We have called individuals before the Board ... who we had reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>believe lived in ... other locations. And they have sworn to us under penalty of perjury that they indeed do live in Ocean City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201c[W]ith the advent of the universal registration law, this was\u2014the procedures and things were changed---- [W]hen we got the original list [of registered voters of Worcester County] as sent to us by the county and verified by the county as what the true voter rolls of Ocean City should be, it was approximately 7800 names____ We have spent the time since 1990 helping the county understand what streets are actually in Ocean City and what streets actually are not in Ocean City. So we have indeed culled the county list down considerably----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The Chairperson stated that the Board met on a regular basis in order to conduct an \u201con-going purge\u201d of the City\u2019s registration list, and \u201c[had] the board ... done no work, we would [have] a list of over 7,000 names of registered voters in Ocean City as submitted to us by the Board of Elections of Worcester County in 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The record thus shows that the Board has a reasonable procedure for periodically purging unqualified persons from the City\u2019s registered voter list.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under our decisions, that procedure is exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-12\">.

At a public Council meeting held on March 15, 1993, Maty Adeline Bradford, the Chairperson of the Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Election, explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\"[the Board] looked into duplications, incorrect information, information to be verified ... [P]ossible duplicates submitted by Mr. Gisriel and verified were three names.... Incorrect information submitted by Mr. Gisriel was 183 names.

This figure was later revised slightly as a result of the removal of three duplicate names from the registered voter roll. The revised signature percentage was 19.32%, still less than the 20% necessary to place the zoning ordinance on the ballot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b539-4\">. As pointed out by Gisriel, the official voter registration list for Ocean City is a combination of two lists, a \u201cUniversal List\u201d and a \u201cSupplemental List.\u201d The Universal List contains the names of persons presumably residing in Ocean City, who register to vote with the Worcester County Election Board for state, county and municipal elections pursuant to the provisions of the State Election Code, Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.VoL), Article 33, \u00a7 3-2. The Supplemental List contains the names of individuals, also presumably residing in Ocean City, who register to vote with the Ocean City Board of Elections only for Ocean City municipal elections pursuant to Article 33, \u00a7 3-1 (b), of the State Election Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b539-5\">. According to Gisriel, of the names on the Ocean City registered voter list used by the Board to measure the sufficiency of his referendum petition, 77 had been removed by the Worcester County Board of Supervisors of Election from the rolls of Worcester County; 19 were not registered with Worcester County or on the Ocean City supplemental list; 15 were confirmed by Worcester County as registered and living outside of Ocean City; 17 were deceased; 8 were duplicative names; and 30 names were of individuals who had relocated from Ocean City.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The largest number of allegedly unqualified voters on Ocean City\u2019s registration list challenged by Gisriel consisted of 128 individuals who, although residents of Ocean City, had failed to vote in the last two Ocean City elections immediately preceding the filing of the referendum petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">. If all the names challenged by Gisriel in fact were names of unqualified voters, the number of registered and qualified voters in Ocean City on February 16, 1993, the date Gisriel\u2019s referendum petition was filed, would have been 4,609 instead of 4,903 as indicated by the Board. Therefore, if all 947 signatures in the petition were of registered and qualified voters of Ocean City, then Gisriel's petition actually contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the names of 20.54% of the City's qualified voters, a sufficient percentage to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 C-411 of the Ocean City Charter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. Section C-505 of the Ocean City Charter, invoked by Gisriel in his complaint, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201cIf any person shall feel aggrieved by the action of the board of supervisors of elections in refusing to register or in striking off the name of any person or by any other action, such person may appeal to the Council.

In addition, Article I, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\"The General Assembly shall provide by law for a uniform Registration of the names of all the voters in this State, who possess the qualifications prescribed in this Article, which Registration shall be conclusive evidence to the Judges of Election of the right of every person, thus registered, to vote at any election thereafter held in this State....\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b564-13\">. We note that the Court of Special Appeals stated that the State Election Code's procedure for challenging the voting qualifications of registered voters was applicable to the instant proceeding. Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Article 33, \u00a7 1-1(a)(6), states that \"election,\u201d as used in Article 33, excludes \"any municipal election other than in Baltimore City unless otherwise specifically provided for in [Article 33].\u201d Thus, municipal elections are generally not covered by the provisions of Article 33. <em>See Hanrahan v. Alterman, </em>41 Md.App. 71, 80 n. 12, 396 A.2d 272, 277-278 n. 12 (1979). Moreover, the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly interpreted this Court\u2019s holding in <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>City of College Park, </em>280 Md. 525, 375 A.2d 1098 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1146, 103 S.Ct. 787, 74 L.Ed.2d 993 (1983), as supporting the application of Article 33, \u00a7 3-16, to municipal elections. In <em>DuBois, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>simply recognized that the City of College Park had specifically incorporated by reference the procedure in Article 33, \u00a7 3-16, into its charter, thereby making \u00a7 3-16 the exclusive mechanism for challenging voter qualifications in the city. <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>City of College Park, supra, </em>280 Md. at 532, 375 A.2d at 1103. We are not aware of any prior decisions in this Court where Article 33, \u00a7 3-16, has been applied to a municipal election in the absence of specific incorporation by reference in the municipality\u2019s charter.</p>\n<p id=\"AZo\">In light of the reasonable procedures actually utilized by the Ocean City Board to maintain an accurate voter registration list, the inapplicability of the state statute to Ocean City elections is of no consequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
