Because this case results from the consolidation on judicial review of two separate administrative actions, we shall recount the facts relevant to each Respondent <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">a. Engelman</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Steven E. Engelman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> began operating a bail bonding company known as Professional Bail bonds on October 22, 1992. Engelman subsequently incorporated the entity as Professional Bail Bonds, Inc. (\u201cProfessional\u201d), which began issuing bonds in its own name in January of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In March of that same year, Sandra Castagna, Senior Market Conduct Examiner for the MIA, and William McGarvey, a Market Conduct Examiner for that same organization, performed an examination of Professional\u2019s business activities as well as those of Engelman, for the period November 1,1992 through February 28, 1993. By a letter dated April 19, 1993,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Castagna informed Engelman of the March examination results, questioning a $12,766.25 discrepancy between insurance premiums charged and premiums actually collected. Castagna also informed Engelman that \u201cProfessional\u201d was not a registered trade name and that the corporation was not on record as having a Certificate of Qualification as required by \u00a7 168(e)(2) of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On April 22, 1993, Engelman responded to Castagna\u2019s letter, averring that he had registered Professional as a trade name and completed the corporation\u2019s Certificate of Qualification and was filing it that same day. Unsure of the alleged discrepancy period, however, Engelman requested further information so that he could adequately respond. Within six days, Engelman\u2019s father, who also was his accountant, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>formed Castagna by letter that, with respect to the discrepancy between premiums charged and premiums collected,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cthere are numerous situations where premiums are not paid in full because of broken promises, bad checks and the bad credit of essentially indigent persons who make up the bulk of his clientelle. [sic] At the time of these shortfalls, Steven [Engelman] provides his client with a written receipt and obtains a promissory note for the balance due. Steve keeps a record of these balances due but in time, many of these receivables go on to becoming write offs ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdE\">Following its investigation, the MIA alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that by failing to collect bond premiums in full at the time the bonds were written, Engelman violated \u00a7\u00a7 226(a), 230(b), and 242(e) of the Code, discussed further beginning in Part III, <em>infra. </em>The MIA also charged Engelman with violations of \u00a7 168(e)\u2014(f),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for failing to timely acquire a Certif\u00edcate of Qualification and for faffing to timely register Professional\u2019s trade name with the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">At a hearing held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Engelman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>stipulated that from November 1, 1992 to February 28, 1993, he and his employees had accepted less than the full premium for thirty-five issued bonds, although the balance of the premiums due had been secured by promissory notes. The sureties underwriting the bonds did not have a rate filing permitting installment payments. Engelman also conceded that he did not register Professional\u2019s trade name until April 20, 1993\u2014 almost five months beyond the date it began issuing bonds and collecting premiums in its own name. The ALJ recommended granting Engelman\u2019s Motion for Summary Decision on the installment payment issue, concluding that none of the cited statutes prohibited the practice. The ALJ did, however, conclude that Engelman\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 168(e)\u2014(f) warranted a three-day suspension under \u00a7 175(12).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">On March 8, 1995, the Insurance Commissioner (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) rejected the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law with respect to installment payments, concluding that \u201c[they] ... plainly constitute[ ] a \u2018special favor ... benefit ... or valuable consideration\u2019 as those terms are used in \u00a7 226(a) of Article 48A,\u201d and that \u00a7 230(b) prohibited the collection of partial premiums. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The Commissioner imposed a thirty-day suspension for the totality of Engelman\u2019s alleged violations. Engelman then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">b. Wynder</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">After an initial hearing before the Associate Deputy Insurance Commissioner (\u201cADC\u201d), Respondent Wynder was found to have violated various provisions of Art. 48A for concededly collecting bond premiums in installments. Wynder sought judicial review of the ADC\u2019s Order in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which remanded the case for a <em>de novo </em>hearing. The ALJ assigned to hear Wynder\u2019s case delayed his ruling pending the Engelman decision. On April 17, 1995, Wynder received a recommended suspension of sixty days under \u00a7 175(1), (6), and (12), <em>see </em>n. 6 <em>supra, </em>which the Commissioner adopted in a Final Order, dated April 21, 1995. Wynder once again sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Engelman and Wynder\u2019s cases were consolidated on judicial review. The circuit court reversed Respondents\u2019 suspensions for accepting \u201cshort money.\u201d In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the court ruled that \u201cinstallment plans, with or without interest, are permitted under the [Insurance] Code, and do not constitute a \u2018valuable consideration\u2019 given in exchange for the purchase of the bond [within the meaning of \u00a7 226(a) ].\u201d The court further concluded that even assuming that the Commissioner himself prohibited the practice of accepting \u201cshort money,\u201d that policy was unknown and unknowable to Engelman and Wynder and fairness dictated that the Commissioner adopt a specific rule prohibiting the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The court, however, affirmed Engelman\u2019s suspension for failing to register and qualify Professional in a timely manner, but remanded the case so that the Commissioner could consider what portion of Engelman\u2019s suspension was attributable to his registration and qualification failures. The Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>appealed that judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. Engelman filed a cross-appeal. We granted a writ of certiorari in both cases before argument in the intermediate appellate court to consider the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Ordinarily, a final order of the Commissioner must be upheld on judicial review if it is legally correct and reasonably supported by the evidentiary record. <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 519, 636 A.2d 448, 450 (1994); <em>Younkers v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>333 Md. 14, 18-19, 633 A.2d 861, 862-63 (1993). This standard of review is both narrow and expansive. It is narrow to the extent that reviewing courts, out of deference to agency expertise, are required to affirm an agency\u2019s findings of fact, as well as its application of law to those facts, if reasonably supported by the administrative record, viewed as a whole. <em>United Parcel Service v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994); <em>Supervisor v. Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. 614, 625-27, 547 A.2d 190, 195-96 (1988); <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1124 (1978). The standard is equally broad to the extent that reviewing courts are under no constraint to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>United Parcel Service, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230; <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Employment Security Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The fact that both Engelman and Wynder secured bond premiums with promissory notes or otherwise extended credit to their customers is undisputed. Therefore, the only remaining question is whether that practice is proscribed by the Insurance Code when not part of an approved rate filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Leaning on the oft quoted principles of statutory construction, <em>see generally Kaczorowski v. Mayor, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987), the Commissioner maintains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>when read together, the package of Code provisions addressing the regulation of rate filings compels the conclusion that installment payments are prohibited if not part of an approved rate filing. Specifically, the Commissioner points to \u00a7\u00a7 226(a), 230(b) and 242(e) of the Code. They provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArI\">\u201c\u00a7 226. Unfair discrimination and rebates\u2014Property, casualty and surety insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">(a) <em>Giving of rebates inducement by insurer, agent or broker </em>prohibited.\u2014No insurer or any employee or representative thereof, and no agent or broker shall pay, allow, or give or offer to pay, allow, or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to insurance, or after insurance has been effected, any rebate, discount, abatement, credit, or reduction of the premium named in the policy of insurance, or any special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits to accrue thereon, or any valuable consideration or inducement whatever, not specified in the policy, except to the extent provided for in an applicable filing with the Commissioner as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u00a7 230. Illegal dealing in premiums; improper charges for insurance; raising policy limits of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">(b) A person willfully may not collect as premium or charge for insurance any sum in excess of or less than the premium or charge applicable to the insurance, in accordance with the applicable classifications and rates as filed with and approved by the Commissioner; or, in cases where classifications, premiums or rates are not required by this article to be so filed and approved, the premiums and charges shall not be in excess of or less than those specified in the policy and as fixed by the insurer ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u00a7 242. Property, casualty, surety and marine rating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">(e) <em>Use of </em>rates.\u2014No insurer, officer, agent or representative thereof shall knowingly issue or deliver, or knowingly permit the issuance or delivery of, a policy or insurance, or any endorsement, certificate, or addition to the policy, except in accordance with the filings which are in effect for the' insurer as provided in this section or in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>subsection (H) of this section. As compensation for procuring business, any insurer may pay or allow a commission to any licensed agent of the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">One of the principal aims of the above-quoted provisions, and of the entire Code itself, is the prevention of excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory insurance rates. \u00a7 241. To that end, the practice of rebating was identified by the General Assembly over one hundred years ago as an undesirable custom within the insurance industry resulting in unfair discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unfair discrimination, as the term is employed by the Insurance Code, means discrimination among insureds of the same class based upon something other than actuarial risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Rebating occurs when an insurer or its agents offer inducements to insure which are not specified in the policy of insurance. Such practices include, refunding part of the premium or accepting less than the premium specified in the policy, splitting agent commissions with the insured, selling insurance company stocks or bonds discounted by the proposed rebate amount, and raising policy limits beyond that for which was originally contracted and paid. For an excellent discussion of the various forms rebating may take, <em>see </em>Kimball and Jackson, <em>The Regulation of Insurance Marketing, </em>61 Colum.L.Rev. 141, 146-149, 187-89 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In effect, rebating undermines rate classifications on file with the Commissioner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When insurers offer insureds within the same rate class different terms on the same insurance product, the rate actually paid by the favored party is something less than that reflected in the insurer\u2019s rate filing. Ademec, <em>Premium Rebating: An Unnecessary Evil, </em>39 Fed\u2019n Ins. &amp; Corp. Couns. Q. 3, 5 (1988). State legislatures have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>variously targeted this practice primarily to protect insureds from the concentrated power of large insurance concerns with the financial capacity to offer large rebates, from unethical sales practices engaged in by competing agents and a concomitant decrease in service, and from generally discriminatory practices. <em>Id. </em>It has also been suggested that anti-rebating statutes were aimed at averting insurance company insolvency, but the response to that suggestion has been that capital surplus and security laws are designed expressly for, and better accomplish, that purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 6; <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 48-50. Anti-rebating statutes are currently in effect in some form in all fifty states.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Maryland\u2019s General Assembly first addressed these issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>in 1890. <em>See </em>Chapter 254, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1890,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> now codified and as amended in scattered sections of Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1996 Supp.), Art. 48A. Section 226(a), one of several antirebating provisions of the Maryland Insurance Code, employs language that closely parallels that of the model Unfair Trade Practices Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) in 1945.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As currently amended, the Model Act provides in Section H.(l), entitled \u201cRebates:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by law, knowingly permitting or offering to make or making any life insurance policy or annuity, or accident and health insurance or other insurance, or agreement as to such contract other than as plainly expressed in the policy issued thereon, or paying or allowing, or giving or offering to pay, allow, or give, directly, or indirectly, as inducement to such policy, any rebate of premiums payable on the policy, or any valuable consideration or inducement whatever not specified in the policy; or giving, or selling, or purchasing or offering to give, sell, or purchase as inducement to such policy or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds, or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation, association, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or anything of value whatsoever not specified in the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Although the Model Act speaks in both general and specific terms (such as a prohibition on the sale of stock or bonds in connection with the sale of insurance), it makes no attempt to exhaustively list those practices that would fall within the purview of the Act. And as some commentators have suggested, such an attempt would be futile. <em>See </em>Kimball &amp; Jackson, <em>supra, </em>at 186-189. Likewise, \u00a7 226(a) makes no attempt to identify any particular practice as rebating. Rather, the statute speaks in broad terms, leaving its outer boundaries undefined.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">A hint, however, is provided by \u00a7 230(b), which prohibits persons from \u201cwillfully ... not collecting] as premium or charge for insurance any sum in excess of or less than the premium or charge applicable to the insurance.\u201d When considered in light of the purposes of anti-rebating provisions generally, the aim of \u00a7 230(b) is clear\u2014it prevents, <em>inter alia, </em>insurers and their agents from engaging in \u201cwink and nod\u201d transactions with selected insureds, leaving the latter something less than fully liable for the policy premium reflected in the applicable rate classification. In other words, \u00a7 230(b) obliterates any arguable distinction between post-transactional rebating versus waiving policy premiums or any portion thereof in the first instance. The effect of such practices is the same as those generally targeted by \u00a7 226(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The Commissioner contends that because of the time-value of money, by collecting bond premiums without the prior sanction of the Commissioner in an approved rate filing, a bond agent issues a rebate, discount, abatement, credit, inducement or reduction of the bond premium in the purchase of insurance, which is prohibited by \u00a7 226(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Using this same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>logic, the Commissioner also maintains that installment arrangements violate \u00a7 230(b), which prohibits bondsmen from \u201cwillfully [ ] not collecting] as premium or charge for insurance any sum in excess of or less than the premium or charge applicable to the insurance, in accordance with the applicable classifications and rates as filed with and approved by the Commissioner....\u201d Finally, the Commissioner asserts that notwithstanding the above two provisions, \u00a7 242(e) prevents an insurer or its agents from charging rates \u201cexcept in accordance with the filings which are in effect for the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The essence of the Commissioner\u2019s position is that unapproved installment plans allow bond agents to unfairly discriminate among individuals in the purchase of insurance. Even though the <em>insurance rate </em>may be the same for individuals, the conditions of credit may vary greatly with no articulable basis\u2014a breeding ground for discrimination. Moreover, the extension of credit to bond purchasers necessarily affects the profit and loss expectations of the surety. Respondents counter that the Commissioner\u2019s position is unsupported by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">As indicated in Part V., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 230(b) prohibits insurers and their agents from \u201cwillfully\u201d collecting any sum in excess of, or less than, the premium applicable to the insurance in accordance with the applicable classifications and rates filed with, and approved by, the Commissioner. It says nothing about the method of collection\u2014only that they must be collected in accordance with the applicable rates and classifications for that particular insurance product on file with the Commissioner. The Commissioner\u2019s reading of the statute is commercially unrealistic and simply does not square with the practice of many insurers who bill their customers for the entire amount of the premium, payable within thirty days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Even the simple act of accepting checks on bond premiums would constitute rebating under the Commissioner\u2019s view, since those employing this commonly used form of commercial paper would arguably enjoy the use of the funds represented by the check longer than those who secure coverage with cash. Despite the Commissioner\u2019s assertions to the contrary, nothing in the Code requires a strict temporal proximity between coverage and actual cash payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Moreover, the record evidence indicates, and the Commissioner does not suggest otherwise, that Engelman used best efforts to enforce the promissory notes executed in his favor. Engelman\u2019s failure to collect certain specified sums was the result of defaults, and thus cannot be said to have been \u201cwillful\u201d on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Section 242(e) is similarly silent about whether installment payments must be first sanctioned by the Commissioner in an approved rate filing. Once again, the statute only prohibits insurers and their agents from issuing or delivering a policy of insurance \u201cexcept in accordance with filings which are in effect\u201d for the surety under the rate filing provisions of the Code. Stated otherwise, the only premium that an insurer may charge for a given insurance product is that which has been actuarially justified with the Insurance Commissioner. Section 242(e) compels no conclusion about how those premiums must be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The inquiry that remains, however, is whether in the final analysis the taking of a promissory note without interest and an indemnification agreement in lieu of cash or its equivalent in partial or full payment of a policy premium constitutes rebating as that term is employed in the Maryland Insurance Code\u2014a question of first impression. We believe that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Despite the uniform adoption throughout the several states of anti-rebating provisions, there is a paucity of administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>enforcement actions which have directly addressed the present issue. Rather, the propriety of no-interest loans on insurance premiums in light of anti-rebating provisions has been incidentally raised in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">For example, Pennsylvania\u2019s intermediate appellate court considered the credit/rebate issue in a breach of contract action. <em>Blouch v. Clifford R. Zinn &amp; Son, Inc., </em>350 Pa.Super. 327, 504 A.2d 862 (1986). In <em>Blouch, </em>a widow sought the proceeds of her husbands life insurance policy. Because the insurer\u2019s agent extended credit to Mr. Blouch for payment of the first insurance premium, a jury concluded that the insurance agreement was consummated and that the insurer was bound to the terms of the policy. The insurer, however, sought indemnification from its agent for allegedly violating Pennsylvania\u2019s anti-rebating statute and for violating the insurer\u2019s internal policies prohibiting agent/insured credit arrangements. Although the jury rejected that argument, the trial court granted the insurer\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. on the indemnity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The agent fared better on appeal. In addressing the matter, the appellate court first noted that (like our own anti-rebating provisions) \u201cthe object of [Pennsylvania\u2019s anti-rebating statute] is to outlaw unfair treatment of prospective insurance clients of the same class.\u201d <em>Blouch, </em>350 Pa.Super. at 331, 504 A.2d at 864. The court pointed out that no violation was apparent since \u201cno testimony was given to demonstrate that Zinn furnished any rebate to [Mr.] Blouch by extending credit to him for the initial premium, or that [the agent] used the extension of credit as an inducement to Blouch.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tantly, the court did not consider credit arrangements violative of the rebating provisions of the Pennsylvania Insurance Code\u2014a code, we note, that employs language similar to our own anti-rebating provisions and that of the model Unfair Trade Practices Act, <em>see </em>Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 275 (1921); <em>see also </em>Part V., <em>supra, </em>save for a proviso in the Pennsylvania statute that states \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to prevent the taking of a bona fide obligation, with legal interest, in payment of any premium.\u201d Although the <em>Blouch </em>court failed to reference this language in its holding, we note that prior holdings of the same court weakly suggested, but by no means held, that no-interest loans by insurers to their insureds may violate Pennsylvania\u2019s anti-rebating statutes. <em>Compare Hirsch v. Singer, </em>86 Pa.Super. 605, 607-08 (1925); <em>Ellis v. Anderson, </em>49 Pa.Super. 245 (1912). We believe, however, that based on <em>Blouch, </em>current Pennsylvania law is otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">A similar result obtained in an action on a promissory note in <em>Lamar v. Lowery, </em>41 Ala.App. 166, 124 So.2d 834 (1960). In <em>Lamar, </em>the purchaser of a life insurance policy executed a note in favor of the insurer\u2019s agent in lieu of cash for the policy\u2019s initial premium. The note was subsequently endorsed to the insurer. No payment was made upon the note. The Court of Appeals of Alabama rejected the insured\u2019s defense that the acceptance of an interest bearing promissory note for an initial insurance premium constitutes rebating under then Section 75, Title 28 of the Alabama Insurance Code rendering the holder other than one in due course. Again, the language employed in that code closely paralleled the language of the codes cited <em>supra, </em>and Maryland\u2019s own \u00a7 226(a). <em>Lamar, </em>41 Ala.App. at 168, 124 So.2d at 836; <em>accord MacDonald v.

Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>337 Mo. 1084, 88 S.W.2d 167 (1935). In a letter to the plaintiffs superior, the defendant charged the plaintiff, <em>inter alia, </em>with accepting policy premiums in twelve equal monthly installments, interest free, \u201cwhich [in the defendant\u2019s words] amounts to rebating.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>337 Mo. at 1087, 88 S.W.2d at 172. After considering the applicable Missouri anti-rebating statute,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court rejected the plaintiffs argument, holding instead that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c[i]t is apparent from a reading of this statute that it does not prohibit the payment of a full annual premium in twelve equal monthly installments. Neither does this nor any other statute require the payment of interest on deferred installment payments on an annual premium or provide that the failure to charge interest on such payments shall amount to rebating. If defendant had charged plaintiff with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>rebating without giving the facts upon which such charge was based, then the charge would have been libelous because rebating is a violation of law. But where, as here, the letter does not charge a violation of the statute ... it is not libelous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">337 Mo. at 1094, <em>88 </em>S.W.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The sum and substance of the above cited cases is that the overwhelming opinion in those jurisdictions that have considered the issue <em>sub judice </em>is that insurer/insured credit arrangements fall without their respective anti-rebating insurance statutes. This result is consistent with the purposes of these statutes\u2014that of eliminating discrimination in insurance rates among similar classes of insureds. Every Code provision cited by the Commissioner is directed towards ensuring that insurers justify and abide by rates established for the various insurance products offered for sale to the public. Again, \u00a7\u00a7 226(a), 230(b), and 242(e) concern insurance rates, not the manner in which premiums charged in accordance with those rates are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In our view, there is a critical difference between conferring a special advantage to an insured not specified in the policy as an inducement to purchase that policy versus assisting the insured in the procurement of insurance through the execution of a note bearing a confessed judgment. The latter is not wrought with the peril and imbued with the evil that anti-rebating laws were designed to reach. <em>See </em>Part V., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Indeed, the Commissioner does not challenge Engelman\u2019s assertion that he used every effort to collect the balances due under the notes executed in his favor; nor does the Commissioner allege that either Engelman or Wynder charged rates other than those expressly provided for in their respective sureties\u2019 rate filings, attempted to rebate any part of the premium to their insureds, or otherwise waived part or all of any premium, thereby reducing the applicable rate. At all times the insureds or their benefactors remained fully liable for the balance represented by the notes. Although not an exclusive list, it is these activities that anti-rebating statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>were designed to reach\u2014activities that are conspicuously absent from the evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Furthermore, the Commissioner\u2019s own regulations certainly suggest a different interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 226(a), 230(b), and 242(e) from that which he now advances. Specifically, Md. Regs.Code (COMAR) tit. 09, \u00a7\u00a7 30.94.09B and 30.94.11B, effective January 2, 1993,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> specifically envision instances where unpaid balances will exist on bond premiums. Md. Regs.Code tit. 09, \u00a7 30.94.09, Receipts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cA. A surety agent shall provide a numbered receipt to bail bond purchasers. A copy of the receipt shall be retained by the surety agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">B.

Immediately upon the discharge of a bond, the licensee or surety agent shall return any collateral held by the licensee or the surety agent. Upon receiving a request for return of collateral, the licensee or surety agent shall promptly determine whether the obligation has been discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>B. The licensee or surety, agent may deduct any unpaid premiums due on the bail bond from any collateral being returned.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Although the Commissioner insists that COMAR \u00a7\u00a7 09.30.94.09B and 09.30.94.11B apply only to <em>approved </em>installment plans, that is not apparent from the language of those regulations. <em>See Chesapeake v. Comptroller, </em>331 Md. 428, 440, 628 A.2d 234, 240 (1993); <em>Messitte v. Colonial Mortgage Service Co., </em>287 Md. 289, 295-96, 411 A.2d 1051, 1054 (1980)(when words of an administrative regulation are unambiguous, they will be accorded their natural and ordinary meaning). The Commissioner\u2019s decision to promulgate and adopt COMAR \u00a7\u00a7 09.30.94.09B and 09.30.94.11B without any reference to \u00a7\u00a7 226(a), 230(b), and 242(e) belies his interpretation of those regulations and certainly lends credence to Respondents\u2019 position. Thus, we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 226(a), 230(b), and 242(e) do not prohibit insurers from securing premium obligations with promissory notes or other such credit arrangements, with or without interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Engelman cross-petitions, claiming that the thirty-day suspension of his Certificate of Qualification was unwarranted and unsupported by the Code. Because the record fails to disclose what portion of Engelman\u2019s suspension is attributable to his failure to timely register and qualify Professional, we agree with the circuit court that a remand to the Commissioner is in order for a final determination of what sanctions should be imposed, if any, for those violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

Although Chapter 254 of the Acts of 1890 only applied to \u201clife endowment insurance,\u201d subsequent acts of the Maryland General Assembly extended the reach of anti-rebating provisions to all insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\">. The model Unfair Trade Practices Act was adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Pub.L.

South-Eastern Underwriters Association, </em>322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944), which for the first time held that the insurance business is commerce properly subject to federal regulation when conducted across state lines. The act ameliorated public fears that states would be completely precluded from regulating the insurance industry under the holding in <em>South-Eastern. </em>In fact, the act gives preemptive authority to states dealing with insurance regulatory issues. Although at the time, state regulation of unfair or discriminatory practices in the insurance industry was \"exceedingly spotty,\u201d all states employed anti-rebating laws in some form. <em>See </em>1 Richards on Insurance \u00a7 51 (5th ed. 1952 &amp; 1968 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\">.
