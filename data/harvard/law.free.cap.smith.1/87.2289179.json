Stiles and Jer. Stiles, Administrators of Jer. Stiles.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b105-6\">An administrator in the solvent course, who has suffered judgment to be recovered against himself by default, cannot plead want of assets to ail action of debt against him on such judgment, suggesting waste.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b105-7\">The representatives of an administrator, as far as they have assets, are liable for his waste. An action of debt (suggesting waste by the first administrator) may be brought against the administrator of an administrator, upon a judgment recovered against the first administrator.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">The plaintiff, as administrator of E. Bacbelder, exhibited a claim to the commissioners appointed to receive, examine, and adjust the claims of the creditors to the estate of Jer. Stiles, deceased, represented insolvent, and under the administration of the defendants, his sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">The claim was this: The intestate, Jer. Stiles, was administrator of Breed Bacbelder. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Elizabeth Bachelder, at the Superior Court, Cheshire County, May Term, 1797, recovered judgment against him. as administrator of Breed Bachelder, by default, for certain damages and costs amounting to --\u25a0. Execution issued on the judgment, and <em>nulla bona </em>returned; and afterwards the administrator, Jer. Stiles, and Elizabeth Bachelder both died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-12\">The commissioners wholly rejected the claim; and the plaintiff, at the time the commissioners returned and made their report to the judge of probate, appealed to this court, and the proceedings required in such case by the statute (ed. 1805, 183) were had. The declaration filed in the Probate Office was for money had and received by Jer. Stiles, deceased, to the use of plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-13\">Upon the opening of the case at a former Term, it was sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>gested by the Court that tbe merits could not be tried under a count for money had and received; <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that the question to be tried was whether Jer. Stiles, the administrator, by suffering judgment to go by.default, had admitted assets. The action to charge him must be debt on the judgment, suggesting waste ; or <em>scire facias </em>with a similar suggestion, and praying for execution <em>de bonis propriis </em>of the administrator (Laws, ed. 1805, 176). This latter remedy was lost by the death of the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">Accordingly, the counsel for the plaintiff, having obtained leave to amend (by consent), declared in debt on the judgment, suggesting waste.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">The defendants pleaded : \u25a0\u2014 <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">1.

Raym. 1502, 1503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The opinion of the Court was now delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"A_k\">Smith, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">After stating the case, he observed that it is extremely clear this action might have been maintained against Jer. Stiles in his lifetime. He could have made no defence. Suffering judgment by default was an admission of assets. He could not, on the <em>scire </em>facias, or to the action of debt, deny assets, <footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Whenever an administrator does not administer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the insolvent course, be admits assets, provided tliere is any estate to be apportioned among the unprivileged creditors. (II. Manuscript, Descent, and Last Wills, 1038-1057.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">At common law it seems that representatives of representatives were not liable for the <em>devasiavits </em>of those they represented. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The reason given does not seem to be a good one ; viz., because they could not be supposed to know how those they represent had disposed of the goods. But in chancery it was otherwise; they were liable as far as they had assets. Creditors may, in equity, follow the assets into whose hands soever they come. To remedy the common-law doctrine, which was found inconvenient, 30 Car. II. c. 7, and 4 &amp; 5 W. &amp; M. c. 24, provide that, where the representative shall waste or convert to his own use goods, &amp;c., of his principal, his representative shall be chargeable in the same manner as he who wasted, &amp;c., should or might have been. 1 Wms. Saund. 216, 219, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It is believed that this doctrine of the common law was never admitted here, or, if it.was, that the statute remedy (which was as early as 1677-1692) was admitted also.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The principles laid down by the Court in <em>Hambly </em>v. <em>Trott, </em>Cowp. 371, seem clearly to show that the doctrine was not well founded at common law. The estate of the administrator may be presumed to be benefited by the property in respect of which he is liable. If he received his principal\u2019s money, then he is indebted to his creditors to the same amount; he received the money to their use. If he sold the goods of his principal, the same thing follows. If he used, and consumed in using, the goods, his estate gained the value ; he was enriched by his executorship or administration to the value. The injury done to the estate of the deceased will generally be attended with proportional gain to the representative. Tie gains what the estate has lost. Property is acquired in respect of which he is in equity (at least) chargeable. In this case we may presume that Jer. Stiles received value from the estate of Breed Bachelder to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>this judgment, and that in consideration thereof he took upon himself this debt. The plea, it is presumed, might have been different. <em>Nil debet </em>would have been good.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We have enlarged the remedy against representatives of deceased persons. By a late statute, ed. 1805, 96, actions for misconduct in office may be prosecuted against the representative of a sheriff; trespass for carrying away goods, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Upon the whole, the Court are clearly of opinion that the defendants are liable; that the common-law doctrine never prevailed here, at least never since the statutes of Charles and William; but that we have adopted the chancery doctrine, which is more just, and not unfit to be carried into execution by a court of common law; that the deceased administrator, by suffering judgment to go by default, admitted that he had received assets to answer this debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em>The defendants were defaulted, </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> , <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b106-19\"> It is presumed Stiles did not administer Breed Bachelder\u2019s estate in the insolvent course of administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> 3 G-.
