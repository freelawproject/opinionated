Little was arrested by plaintiff, a deputy sheriff, and escaped from his custody. Hart sued the sheriff for plaintiff\u2019s suffering the escape, and recovered judgment for the full amount of his debt, damages, and costs ; which judgment has been satisfied by Clarke, who was answer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>able to tbe sheriff. The plaintiff afterwards sued the defendants, in the name of Hart, on the judgment; and, amongst other pleas, the defendants pleaded the judgment, execution issued, arrest of Little by Clarke, Little\u2019s escape, the suit against the sheriff for the escape as a voluntary one suffered by Clarke, judgment for the amount of his [Hart\u2019s] debt and costs, and execution issued on that judgment, which has been satisfied by the sheriff. Issue was taken upon the matter of satisfaction, and found for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">The objection to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover [in the present action for money paid] was, that he had joined Johnson and Webber in the suit. The act of Feb. 10, 1791, Laws, ed. 1805, 128, 124, declares that, in all cases where the sheriff or other person has been compelled to pay any sum of money on account of any prisoner\u2019s escape, he shall be entitled to his remedy against such prisoner. As it respects Little, the payment by compulsion of law supersedes the necessity of proving a request; but this only applies to Little. In no sense can it be said that Johnson and Webber requested Clarke to pay the debt. It was paid for Little, and the remedy is against Little only.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-6\">But The Court</author>\n<p id=\"A93\">were of opinion that the action was maintainable in its present form against all the defendants; and that independent of the statute cited. Esp. 612.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> At common law, if the sheriff voluntarily permits a prisoner to escape, and is in consequence obliged to pay the debt, he may maintain an action for money paid, laid out, and expended, against the defendant; for he is discharged as against the plaintiff in the action. Here it is held that the debtor is liable. Why ? Because he is discharged as against his creditor. Why does this action lie against all the defendants ? \u25a0 Because they are all, by the payment made by Clarke, discharged as against Hart, the creditor. The debt was not paid by Little's escape. But Clarke thereby became liable by law to pay the debt to Hart. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>This was a payment without request by any person; but clearly it was a payment for the benefit of all the defendants, because all were, till payment, liable to Hart. The situation in which plaintiff stood as it respects Little is equivalent to a request of Little to pay. If one of sever.al debtors, jointly liable, request another to pay, it is a request by all; because it inures to the benefit of all. Johnson and Webber suffer no inconvenience by this doctrine. With respect to them, it operates only as a change of creditor. It has been holden that, where, there are several debtors, and the bar of the statute of limitations has attached, a promise or acknowledgment of the debt by one of the debtors revives the debt, and makes them all liable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That is stronger than the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">But the case of <em>Exall </em>v. <em>Partridge and two </em>others, 8 T. R. 308, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> is decisive of the present question. The case was this: The defendants were lessees, by deed from one Welch, of certain premises, and bound by their covenants to pay the rent. Two of the defendants afterwards, with the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, assigned their interest to P., their co-lessee; subsequent to which assignment the plaintiff put his carriage upon the premises, under the care of Partridge, where it was taken as a distress for rent by the landlord, Welch. In order to redeem it, the plaintiff was obliged to pay the rent due, taking a receipt from the landlord\u2019s attorney as for so much paid for the three defendants. The action was for money paid, laid out, and expended for the use of the defendants, to recover that sum. The Court held that all the defendants were liable, because they were originally liable to the landlord for the rent. All. were bound by law to pay. The plaintiff paid the rent which all were bound to pay. The debt of all was satisfied, released by this payment. It was not a voluntary, but a compulsory payment. The law implies a promise by the three defendants to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">This case runs on all-fours with the case before the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>All tbe defendants were liable to Hart till plaintiff paid the debt. Clarke has been compelled to pay the debt of all; all are discharged from Hart. There it was the duty of Partridge to pay the rent to Welch. The cases would compare, if in this case it were the proper debt of Little, and Clarke knew that such was the case ; but it is conceived that the debt due Hart was the proper debt of all the defendants, in equity as well as law. The act of Little here occasions this demand in this form; <em>i. e., </em>Little\u2019s escape gives occasion to a suit in the name of Clarke instead of Hart. There the negligence of Partridge occasioned the suit against his co-lessees who were not ultimately liable ; they having their remedy against Partridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><em>Judgment for plaintiff </em>(as it is supposed, by default) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"><em> </em>See, <em>contra, semble, </em>Peake, N.
