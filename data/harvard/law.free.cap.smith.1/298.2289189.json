At the time and place appointed, the creditor did not appear; but the stock was appraised, and turned out into the highway. E. took the creatures into his possession to prevent their starving. This was in December, 1791. At sundry times, the original debtor, W., and E. requested B. to take the cattle away, which he as often, refused, declaring he would have nothing to do with them. He sued W. on the note, but became nonsuit. In 1795, having delivered up the note, he demanded the cattle of E., who refused to deliver them, unless paid for keeping.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b316-8\">On trover for the cattle by B. against E., <em>held, </em>that lie- could not recover; the property did not vest in him ; if it did, he abandoned.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b316-9\"><em>Quaere, </em>of E.'s lien for expenses of keeping.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-10\">This was an action of trover, for the conversion of two four-year old oxen, two cows, and one steer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-11\">The defendant pleaded not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-12\">The evidence of the property in the plaintiff, and conversion by the defendant, was, in substance, as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-13\">The plaintiff held a note against one Peter Wright, of Stoddard, for the payment of a certain sum, by a certain day, in neat cattle, to be delivered at a certain place in Stoddard, and to be appraised by indifferent men. At the time and place mentioned in the note, the creditor did not appear.. The debtor produced the cattle; they were appraised according to the contract, and were sufficient, according to the appraised value, to discharge the note. The cattle being turned into the highway, and it being winter-time, and the former owner refusing to take care of them, the creditor living in Massachusetts', the defendant, to prevent their starving, took them into his care. This was in December, 1791, and they remained with defendant till the action brought (except such as he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>killed or sold). The action commenced in 1795. Soon after the appraisal, the former debtor and the defendant sent word to the creditor, and requested him to take the cattle, which he refused: this was repeated, and again refused. In 1791, 1792, 1798, or 1794 (it is not recollected which), the creditor commenced a suit upon the note, against the debtor, Wright, in Massachusetts, in which, after advising with counsel, he became nonsuit. Afterwards, he delivered up the note he held against Wright, and sent a messenger to Emerson, the defendant, demanding the cattle, but refusing to pay for the keeping. The defendant refused to deliver them unless he would pay for the keeping.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\">This was the amount of the evidence offered by plaintiff and defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-5\">It was contended by <em>Bigelow, </em>counsel for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUX\">that this evidence proved the property in him, and that the demand (which was on May 23,1795, before the commencement of the suit) and the refusal was evidence of conversion in defendant, sufficient to maintain this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-6\"><em>J. </em>Smith, counsel for the defendant, rested the defence on two points.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">1. That this evidence did not prove property in plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">2. That the defendant was not bound to deliver up the cattle till payment, or offer of payment, for the keeping.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">I. Property in the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">It was admitted that the appraisement and delivery by the debtor, Wright, was a complete bar to any action on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-11\">But it was contended that this did not, at all events, vest the property in the creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-12\">It was admitted that there are cases where consent to a contract is to be presumed, and that this was one of the cases; but this presumptive assent is destroyed by positive proof of dissent; and nothing could be clearer than the evidence of dissent in the present case. He repeatedly declared they were not his cattle; he would have nothing to do with them. He would not accept them. He commenced a suit against Wright, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>on the note; and, from 1791 to May, 1795, was uniform in his refusal to accept the property. Now, it will not be denied that property cannot vest against the will of a person expressly manifested. Before property can change its owner, there must be the concurrence of two wills, \u2014 that of the former owner to part with it, and' that of the new proprietor to accept of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">Till Boynton had notice of the appraisal, he might be considered as the <em>owner; </em>after that, he could not be in any sense. They could not be taxed to him. Emerson could not compel him to pay for sustenance of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">Perhaps it is going too far to say that the property could be considered as in him till his dissent. It would be more proper to say that, upon his consent, the property should be considered as in him, and, by a hind of postliminii, to have been all along in him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">The delivery and appraisal of the cattle was no more than a tender by the debtor; and the property of the thing tendered no more vested in the creditor than the property of money tendered, which is not accepted, vests in the creditor. From the nature of the contract, the custody of the article tendered is sometimes with the person making the tender. This is the case with money; the tender is not complete till renewed in court. But, where a specific article is tendered, the person offering need not retain the possession; for he is under no necessity to renew the offer. In the latter case, the creditor, having had one offer of fulfilment, shall not be indulged with another; as this would subject the debtor to great inconvenience, and, sometimes, total loss of the property. He is estopped from demanding the article again; not because the property is in him by the former offer, but because the defendant shall not be vexed, after having done every thing to fulfil in his power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">\u2022 But, upon either of these grounds, \u2014 that the property did not vest at all, or that it vested <em>sub modo </em>till dissent expressed, \u2014 the instant that dissent was expressed, the plaintiff ceased to have any property in the cattle mentioned in his declaration, anil, of course, cannot maintain this action. For, if he has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>an absolute property, he has none at all; there being no pretence of any qualified property in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">But, if it should be considered that the property did absolutely vest in the plaintiff by the proceedings of his debtor, yet his absolute denial of property, refusal to receive it, and refusal to pay for keeping, is complete evidence of an abandonment. 2 Blaekst. 9. The owner of any chattel may abandon it; in which case he shall never claim it again.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">According to the foregoing principles,\u2014 that the property was devested from Wright and never vested in the plaintiff, or became devested upon his refusal to accept, or abandonment,\u2014 the right of the plaintiff to maintain the action is destroyed; but it may be added that the defendant, as the first finder of property which at one time belonged to nobody, acquired a title by occupancy. 2 Blaekst. 9, 402.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">II. But should it be admitted that the property of the cattle in question was in the plaintiff on May 23,1795, \u2014 the time of the demand made, \u2014 yet it is contended that he cannot maintain this action, not having tendered a reasonable sum for the keeping'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">It is not pretended that any of the cases in the books declare that a person, circumstanced like the defendant, has a lien on the goods in his custody, but it is apprehended that the principles of the bases will apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">Here the defendant was under a moral obligation to relieve and sustain the cattle, and the cattle themselves seem to be the fund out of which he is to be paid. His obligation to relieve is certainly as great, and it is for the honor of our law and of humanity to say that it is as legal, as that on an innkeeper to receive the horse of his guest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-9\">The case, in 2 Blaekst. Rejn 1117, of the dog, may easily be distinguished from the present. They may be considered as agreeing in this, that the animals, in both cases, strayed to the keeper; but the obligation to keep a dog, \u2014 an animal which is hurtful to society, \u2014 and animals of the description of those in the plaintiff\u2019s writ, is extremely different. 2 Blaekst. 298, n. 11.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The Count</author>\n<p id=\"ACv\">instructed the jury to find for the defendant, which they did.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">One of the Court only was with the defendant on the second point.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Emerson </em>is cited with approval in the well-known case of <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>1818, 1 N. H. 295, 328. That case goes farther than <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Emerson; </em>for the defendant there was the debtor himself, who had successfully pleaded the tender in a suit on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\"><em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley </em>has been disapproved of by prominent text-writers. 2 Kent, Com. 509; 2 Pars. Cont. 5th ed. 654, n. <em>w; </em>2 Chit. Cont. 11th Am. ed. 1210, 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">There are also numerous expressions of judicial opinion adverse to <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley; </em>hut a very large proportion of these occur in suits on the contract, where the question of title to the property tendered was not directly in issue. Por dicto in cases of this description, see Bell, J., in <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>1856, 34 N. H. 245, 256; Thompson, J., and Kent, J., in <em>Coit </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>1802, 3 Johns. Cas. 243, 249, 258; <em>Slingerland </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>1811, 8 Johns. 370, 374; Savage, C, J., in <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>1834, 13 Wend. 95, 97; <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1820, Brayt. 223, 227; <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>1824, 1 D. Chip. 399, 406-409 (see also Hall, J., in <em>Seward </em>v. <em>Heflin, </em>1848, 20 Vt. 144, 148); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>1833, Wright (Ohio), 383 (decided under statute); <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1854, 12 Tex. 386, 353-355; <em>Hambel </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>1863, 14 Iowa, 530, 532; Peters, J., in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>1828, 7 Conn. 110, 114-116; Blackford, J., in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>1827, 2 Blackf. (Ind.) 87, 89; Stevens, J., in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>1833, 3 Blackf. (Ind.) 182, 186, 187; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>1834, 3 Blackf. (Ind.) 490, 492; Rogers, J., in <em>Case </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1836, 5 Watts, 262; Coulter, J., in <em>Zinn </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>1846, 4 Penn. St. 169, 171; <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>Greenbanks, </em>1852, 24 Vt. 536 (where the question related to the validity of a tender of money); Bibb, C. J., in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>1809, 1 Bibb, 449, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\"><em>Leballister </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>1844, 24 Me. 316, and <em>Des Arts </em>v. <em>Leggett, </em>1858, 16 N. Y. 582, are both cases where the title to the property tendered was directly in issue, and opinions were intimated adverse to <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley ; </em>but in neither case was the precise point in <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley </em>before the Court. In <em>Leballister </em>v. <em>Nash </em>(trover by the creditor against a third person), there was no refusal to accept. In <em>Des Arts </em>v. <em>Leggett, </em>Strong, J., took the ground that the debtors had been, at all times after the tender, willing that the creditors should have the benefit and control of the property, and had carefully avoided any thing which would interfere with any use of the property by the creditors. Under this view of the facts, it was <em>held </em>that the defendants, who were third persons, could not question the creditor\u2019s title to the property. As all the judges are stated to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>concurred in the opinion delivered by Strong, J., it would seem that the very forcible criticisms upon <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>in the opinion of Com-stock, J., pp. 592-594 (though also concurred in by the other judges), must be regarded as <em>dicta. </em>'</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In <em>Shelden </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>1830, 4 Wend. 525, the debtor was <em>held </em>liable in trover for abandoning the property (turning the hogs into the street) after the tender. But see the contrary <em>dicta </em>of Comstock, J., in <em>Des Arts </em>v. <em>Leggett, ubi sup. </em>591, 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The view held by most of the opponents of <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley </em>seems to be that the tender <em>ipso facto </em>vested the property in the creditor; but it seems to have been thought by some that it did not vest until the debtor had successfully set up the tender as a defence to the contract. See Scott, J., in <em>McJilton </em>v. <em>Smizer, </em>1853, 18 Mo. 111, 116, 117. And it has sometimes been <em>held, </em>that a plea of tender of specific articles in the creditor\u2019s absence should aver that the defendant has been always, and yet is, ready to deliver the articles. See <em>Tiernan </em>v. <em>Napier, </em>1823, Peck (Tenn.), 212; <em>Nixon\u2019s Adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Bullock, </em>1836, 9 Yerg. 414; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>1837, 10 Yerg. 245; <em>Walters v. M\u2019Allister, </em>1818, 4 Hayw. (Tenn.) 299. (Contra, 2 Kent, Com. 508; 2 Pars. Cont. 5th ed. 653, n. <em>v.) </em>In <em>Garrard </em>v. <em>Zachariah, </em>1828, 1 Stew. (Ala.) 272, a plea of tender and refusal was <em>held </em>good, without an averment that the defendant abandoned the articles, or kept them ready to be delivered to the creditor on demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The report of <em>Rix </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>1773, 1 Root, 55 (referred to in <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>329), is as follows: \u201c Action of trover for a number of horses. Plea : not guilty, to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201c The facts were: Rix had a note against one Bacon, for \u00a324 10s. payable, in horses, at a certain time and place in Lebanon. Bacon tendered the horses at time and place, and Rix refused them, and brought an action upon the note; to which Bacon plead the tender of the horses, and prevailed. Rix then looked after his horses, and found that the defendant had taken them away. lie went and demanded them, and brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201c And verdict and judgment was for the plaintiff to recover; for, as the tender was legal, the property of the horses was vested in the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">It may perhaps be urged that, in <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>there was stronger evidence of .the creditor\u2019s \u201c abandonment \u201d_of the property than in <em>Rix </em>v. <em>Strong.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
