J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeM\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">1. [First objection.] The property not sufficiently described.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>It is clear the property must be described with certainty to a general intent. 6 G. Bacon, 71; Lawes, 57; Butler, 53. This perhaps ill on special demurrer, but it is sufficient after verdict. Defendant has avowed taking the boards. This cures the defect in the description. 2 Sellon, 254; 2 Lil. 353. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">2. [Second objection.] There cannot be judgment for plaintiffs on this verdict, because it does not find, as it ought, that the boards were the property of the plaintiffs, but only that they were not the property of Samuel Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Answer. This is well enough. The defendant justifies the taking as the property of Samuel Stevens. He does not plead property in a stranger, and traverse the plaintiffs\u2019 property, as in 2 Lil. 358. The only question raised by the defendant\u2019s plea or avowry is as to the property of Samuel Stevens, and defendant\u2019s lawful taking as such. Plaintiffs deny the property of Samuel Stevens, and on this the parties are at issue. Defendant, by his mode of pleading, admits that, if the property be not in Samuel Stevens, he had no right to intermeddle. Defendant might have denied plaintiffs\u2019 property, and put his defence solely on that ground; but he has not' so done. The finding of the jury is correct; they have found the matter in issue. And the pleadings are right. If they are not, they are such as the defendant chose to make them ; and he cannot complain if the plaintiffs do not prove what they have not been called on to prove. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">3. [Third objection.] Defendant avows taking on the 5th August. The writ is dated the 4th.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Answer. The plea may doubtless be amended at defendant\u2019s request. But certainly it is not competent for defendant to insist on the badness of his avowry in arrest of judgment. A party shall not take advantage of his own errors in pleading. Tidd, 828..</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>4. [Fourth objection.] The declaration in replevin does not allege property in the plaintiffs. The writ and declaration ought to allege that the goods taken were the property of plaintiffs. F. N. B. 156 ; 2 Lil. 347, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Answer. The declaration may refer to the writ of replevin. 2 Lil. 853. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But it is a sufficient answel to say that this, though bad on demurrer, is good after verdict. Qualified property is sufficient for plaintiffs.\u2019 3 Wooddes. 280. In this case the pleadings put plaintiffs\u2019 property out of the case. It is admitted by the form of pleading that judgment must be against the defendant, if the property be not in Samuel Stevens. <em>Judgment, for plaintiffs.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"><em> </em>See all the learning on this subject. 3 Selw. 1024; 2 Saund, 74 6, n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b206-10\">&amp;) If property in Stevens had been pleaded in abatement (as it might have been), this, if found against him, would, it seems, warrant a judgment in favor of plaintiff; the question of the plaintiff\u2019s property could not have been tried.

St. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">As to the sufficiency of a description in detinue, see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>1875, 55 N. H. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">II. According to the views expressed by Bell, J., in <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Lovell, </em>1857, 35 N. H. 9, 19, 20, the pleadings ought to have been so framed as to have resulted in an issue on the plaintiff\u2019s property. And if such had been the issue, a verdict that the goods were not the property of S. S. would have been bad, because it did not find the issue submitted. <em>Bemus </em>v. <em>Beekman, </em>1829, 3 Wend. 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">But, because the plaintiff might have successfully demurred to the issue tendered by the defendant, it does not necessarily follow that the plaintiff, after prevailing on the issue thus tendered, cannot have judgment; nor is this point decided in any of the cases cited by Judge Bell, on pp. 19 and 20, in <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Lovell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The view of the Court in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Clagett, </em>as to the admission to be implied from the defendant\u2019s pleadings, seems sustained by the following language of Wilde, C. J., in <em>Couling </em>v. <em>Coxe, </em>1848, 6 M. G. &amp; S. 703, 721: \u201c . . . A plea traversing an allegation in a declaration, although not, for all purposes nor in all events, an admission of the material allegations in the declaration which it does not traverse, yet may be considered as a conditional admission, that is, as admitting the allegation not traversed, in case the plaintiff can prove the allegation traversed; and it is certainly so treated in the case in which, on a single plea traversing a part of the declaration, where an issue is found for the plaintiff, the plaintiff has judgment \u2014 which he would not be entitled to, unless the Court considered the material allegations which were not traversed, as being admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Upon these principles, it might be said that the defendant, by his form of pleading, admitted the property to be in the plaintiffs, in case the jury should find that it was not in Stevens; and that the subsequent verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>(that the property was not in Stevens) made this conditional admission absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">A repleador, for the immateriality of the issue, will not be granted on the motion of that party who committed the first substantial fault in pleading which occasioned the immaterial issue, and who himself tendered the issue. Here it would seem that the defendant is that party. And therefore, if the verdict is <em>against Mm, </em>judgment must also regularly go against him. For, as the fault in the issue commenced on his part, \u2014his traverse being bad in law; and it being, moreover, found to be false in fact; it is deemed unreasonable to grant him the indulgence of a repleader. \u2019 \u2019 Gould, PI. c. 10, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">If, upon the other hand, the plaintiffs are regarded as committing the first substantial fault in pleading, still the issue was so framed that a verdict upon it in favor of the defendant would have been decisive of the merits of the cause. Under the statute 32 H. VIII. c. 30, perhaps such an issue is \u201c aided by a verdict <em>either </em>way.\u201d See Gould, PI. c. 10, \u00a7 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
