The receiptor knew of the second attachment. Subsequently the first suit was compromised, and the receiptor delivered the goods to the debtor. After this delivery, the sheriff demanded the goods of the receiptor, in order to levy on them to satisfy the judgment of the second attaching- creditor, and, upon the receiptor\u2019s refusal, brought assumpsit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-7\"><em>Held, </em>that the receiptor was not liable. The delivery to him was for a special purpose, viz., to hold them to satisfy his action, arid to indemnify the sheriff against the debtor; and these objects had both been fulfilled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">This was an action of assumpsit. The declaration stated that the defendant, at W., Dec. 11,1799, in consideration that the plaintiff, at the request of the defendant, had delivered him two feather-beds, with the furniture thereto belonging, of the value of $70, by his memorandum of that date, promised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>plaintiff to redeliver the same to him on demand ; yet, though requested, at -r, on -, to do so, he had not done it, but had neglected and still neglects it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">Plea: the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">The memorandum declared on was produced and read. It acknowledged the receipt of the goods mentioned, and promised generally to see them forthcoming when called for. The occasion of giving the receipt was this: The defendant, Watkins, had a writ against Calvin Darling, and the goods in question were attached by the plaintiff, a deputy sheriff, by defendant\u2019s directions, to respond to the judgment that might be recovered in that suit, and were'immediately delivered to Watkins, the creditor, to be safely kept, and the memorandum made for security to the officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">Afterwards the plaintiff had a writ put into his hands, <em>Caleb Bellows </em>v. <em>Calvin Barling, </em>and he attached the same goods on this latter writ, Dec. 17, 1799. Watkins knew of this second attachment. Afterwards the matter was settled between Watkins and Darling, and the suit compromised. Bellows proceeded to judgment against Darling, and, before the commencement of this suit, the plaintiff demanded the goods in question of Watkins, who refused to deliver them, \u2014he having delivered them to Darling on the compromise of the suit, (say) after Dec. 17, 1799, and before April 1 following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-10\">This was the evidence, in substance; and upon this evidence the counsel submitted the cause to the Court, and it was withdrawn from the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-11\"><em>B,. Vose, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-12\"><em>B. West, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-12\"> The Manuscript Digest contains the following abstract of this decision: \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">\u201c Attachment of goods, receiptor only answerable to the officer in ca&amp;e of judgment for creditor and demand to levy on them in thirty days. If suit compromised, receiptor may deliver the goods to former owner. If officer do not demand them of receiptor, but return them as attached on second writ, this shall not prejudice the receiptor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\">It was the opinion of a majority of</p>\n<author id=\"AGH\">The Court,</author>\n<p id=\"AON\">that Watkins was not answerable on this memorandum. The delivery to him .was for a special purpose, namely, to hold them to satisfy his action and to indemnify the officer against Darling. These objects have been both fulfilled. The action is settled. Watkins makes no claim on the officer for the goods; and Darling makes none, \u2014 he has got the goods. They were taken for a special purpose, and that purpose is answered. The meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of tbe defendant\u2019s engagement to the officer is no more tban this: \u201c On jour attachment, I can look to you for these goods; you can detain them against Darling till this suit is settled, or till I discharge them.\u201d \u201c I have received the goods; I will not look to you, and I will see them forthcoming if Darling looks to you for them.\u201d <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">What took place on the 17th December, when the officer attached these goods at the suit of Bellows, cannot enlarge the defendant\u2019s previous engagement to the plaintiff. To make himself secure, the officer should then have exacted a promise from defendant, that he would hold the goods to answer that suit as well as his own. The mere act of attaching the goods in the hands of Watkins imposed no obligation on Watkins to keep them safe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An officer cannot, at his own will merely, impose such an obligation. Here was no consent of the defendant to contract any new engagement. If he had been summoned by Bellows as trustee, then he could not have safely delivered up the goods to Darling. Watkins was guilty of no breach of trust or promise [in] not suffering French to take the goods on the 17th December, when French attached at the suit of Bellows, because his own debt was not then settled. He was guilty of no such breach when the demand was made, because his engagement, made Dec. 11, 1799, was fulfilled by delivery to Darling on settlement of the action. He engaged to see the goods forthcoming; that is, ready for the person entitled to demand them. If the suit had not been settled, and he had directed the officer to levy on them, they must be produced to the officer. If the suit was compromised, or the judgment otherwise satisfied, or no levy made in thirty days, then his engagement was to see them forthcoming, ready to be delivered to the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>The plaintiff became </em>nonsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\"><em> Buel </em>v. <em>Metcalfe, </em>in error, Kirby, 40.

H. 9, 13, 14, Parker, C. J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>said that, while the receiptor retains actual possession, the sheriff may make a second attachment, without again seizing the property, by making a return of an attachment, and giving the receiptor notice, with directions to hold the property to answer upon the second attachment also; if the receiptor is unwilling to incur farther responsibility, he may, upon such notice, decline to hold the property for the security of any demand, except that upon which it was first attached, and return it to the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">In <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>1850, 20 Conn. 364, it was <em>held, </em>that, where an officer has placed attached property in the creditor\u2019s possession, to keep for him, a second attachment in fact (not a mere constructive attachment) is valid, although the bailee is not notified of the second attachment. See also <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>Bushnell, </em>1835, 11 Conn. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\"><em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Treat, </em>1860, 49 Me. 309, is not in point; because the Court regarded the first attachment as dissolved upon the delivery of the goods to the receiptor upon the form of receipt there given.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">In <em>Chittenden </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>1866, 42 Ill. 100, it was said that, to make a valid attachment or levy on personal property, which has been already seized on process and placed in the hands of the official \u201c custodian <em>\u201d </em>in Chicago, the officer should go to the custodian, and there, in sight of the property, make a levy and indorse it on the writ, and notify the custodian of his act.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">As to the rules of construction applicable to receipts for attached prop erty, see Doe, J., in <em>Spear </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1872, 52 N.
