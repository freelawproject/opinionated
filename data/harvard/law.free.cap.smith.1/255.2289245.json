It had been built all together ; two rooms on the floor, chimney in the middle, entry on the front side, from which stairs to both chambers, and entrance into both rooms. D.\u2019s title to his part was under a set-off on execution. The division was by an imaginary line running through the middle of the front door, entry, stairs, chimney, &amp;c. The house was old, and needed repairs. M.\u2019s part was not worth repairing; but D.\u2019s part -was tenantable. The fire-wards, upon view of M.\u2019s part, were of opinion that it was dangerous for want of repairs, and ordered it to bo repaired, or otherwise rendered not dangerous on account of fire. M. took down his part to the line. He left half the materials of the entry for D.; sawed through the plate, girts, stairs, &amp;c., but did not take down the chimney. lie did these things carefully, doing as little damage as possible to D.\u2019s part of the house.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-10\"><em>Held, </em>that D. could maintain trespass against M.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">This was trespass, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> for breaking into plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house in Portsmouth ; tearing down doors, walls, stairs, &amp;c., carrying away part, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">Plea: general issue; with leave to give special matter in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-13\">At the trial, February Term, 1808, it appeared in evidence that the plaintiff and defendant owned a dwelling-house. It had been built all together, two rooms on the floor, chimney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>in the middle, entry front side the chimney, outside door, stairs up to the chambers. The part which plaintiff owned had been set off on execution some years before. Plaintiff claimed under the levy. They (sheriff and appraisers) divided by an imaginary line, running through the middle front door, entry, through the stairs, chimney, &amp;c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The whole house was now old and out of repair, and defendant\u2019s part not worth repairing; but the plaintiff\u2019s part was tenantable. The fire-wards viewed defendant\u2019s part., and were of opinion that it was dangerous for want of repairs \u2014 it was untenanted and untenantable. They ordered it to be repaired (or otherwise rendered not dangerous on account of fire). The defendant, at the time mentioned in the declaration, August^ 1807, took down his part to the line. He did it carefully and prudently, doing as little damage to the plaintiff as he could. He left half the materials of the entry for the plaintiff; sawed through the plate, girt, stairs, boards, &amp;e.; but did not take down the chimney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">On these facts, which were either proved or admitted, the question was, whether defendant was liable in any action; and, if in any, whether it should not have been case and not trespass. It was agreed that the j,ury should be instructed that the action lies, and that they should estimate the damages ; and that the verdict should be entered, subject to the opinion of the Court whether, on the evidence as stated in the Chief Justice\u2019s minutes, this action, in point of law, could be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The jury estimated the damages at $50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">At this Term, Mr. <em>Freeman </em>and Mr. <em>Mason </em>were heard for the defendant. They cited Syst. Pleading, 68 ; Buller, 26, 79; 1 Strange, 634; s. C. 8 Mod. 272; 2 Wils. 313 ; 2 Burr. 1114, to show that trespass did not lie. They denied that any action lay. The defendant owned to the line. He was the exclusive owner, and not tenant in common with the plaintiff. But, if he had no right to do what he had done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(open one side of plaintiff\u2019s house and let in the air and storm), the act was done on defendant\u2019s own land and to his own timber ; the damage was merely consequential.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-5\"><em>Webster </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b273-14\"><em> Matts v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlV\">I haye taken some pains to examine the books in relation to this case, since the trial, but have not met with much success. I am inclined to think that each of the parties were interested in the entry, stairs, chimney, &amp;c., and that neither could destroy these without the consent of the other; that each of these owners was under an obligation to the other to keep his part in repair, at least so far that the tenement of the other should suffer no injury from want of such repair, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It may be likened to the case of a party-wall, which neither owner can remove. 1 Domat, 806, 308 j 1 Selw. 355; 1 Dali. 341, 346; Co. Litt. \u00a7 323, pp. 54 <em>b, </em>200, <em>a, b; </em>Esp. 411. See statute 11 Geo. I. c. 28 (6 Anne, c. 31; 37 Anne, c. 17), proceedings in pulling down an old ruinous party-wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">From the nature of the thing, these parties must be considered as interested, as it were, in common, in the entry, chimney, stairs, &amp;c.; and neither could destroy that in which the other had a valuable interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Doe had an easement, or right of enjoyment, of that part of the entry which was beyond the middle line, which does not depend on the courtesy of defendant; it is a matter of right. It is for the interest of both parties that this should be the case. It may be said the owner may do what he will with his own ; but this is to be understood with this reasonable restriction, that he shall not thereby hurt another or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>injure the property of another, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But the truth is, it is not his own in an absolute, exclusive sense; because Doe has a right to the enjoyment of it. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I think, therefore, an action lies ; and, for the reasons hinted at, trespass is the proper action. The injury is direct and not merely consequential. 1 Selw. 355. The acts done by Morrell were the immediate cause of the injury to the plaintiff. It would seem case would not lie. Com. Dig.

It is quite clear that, so long as both tenements remained in good condition, Morrell had no right to deprive Doe\u2019s tenement of support, or to prevent the beneficial use of the entry and stairway. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>1853, 9 Exch. 218; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>1870 , 30 Iowa, 386; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>King, </em>1871, 62 Ill. 30. See, as to the analogous case of party-walls, <em>Eno v. Del Vecchio, </em>1854, 4 Duer, 53; s. c. 1856, 6 Duer, 17; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Sinsheimer, </em>1873, 50 N. Y. 646; <em>Brondage v. Warner, </em>1841, 2 Hill, 145; <em>Potter v. White, </em>1860, 6 Bosw. 644; <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Hennings, </em>1863, 20 Md. 179; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Bordman, </em>1862, 4 Allen, 147; Tindal, C. J., in <em>Bradbee </em>v. <em>Christ\u2019s Hospital, </em>1842, 4 M. &amp; G. 714, 761. (In the report of <em>Wigford v. Gill, </em>34 Eliz., Cro. Eliz. 269, there is nothing to show that the adjoining owner, who pulled down that part of the wall which stood on his land, ever consented to its erection, or was under any obligation to allow it to remain.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">To sustain the above position as to Morrell\u2019s rights and duties, it is not necessary to indorse the much controverted doctrine of <em>Pyer v. Carter, </em>1857, 1 H. &amp; N. 916; nor to accede to all the views expressed by Bell, J., in <em>Dunklee </em>v. <em>Wilton R. R., </em>1852, 24 N. H. 489, 495-507. See the very explicit admission of one of the leading opponents of <em>Pyer v. Carter, </em>viz., Lord Westbujry, in <em>Suffield </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1864, 4 De G. J. &amp; S. 185, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">The cases of <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>1856, 5 Duer, 553, and <em>Dillman v. Hoffman, </em>1875, 38 Wis. 559, were decided on grounds not existing in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Morrell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Hieatt </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>1860, 10 Ohio St. 523, countenances the doctrine, that one of the owners o\u00ed a party-wall, which was built by agreement, may take it down, in order to erect, on his lot, a building better suited to the increased value of the land. But this doctrine is inapplicable to <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Morrell, </em>and does not seem in accord with <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>King, Potter </em>v. <em>White, </em>and <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Hennings, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">It has been held that, when a party-wall is insecure, one of the owners, if in no fault for its condition, may take it down and rebuild it, without being liable to the other owner for damage thus occasioned. <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>1857, 15 N. Y. 601; <em>Crawshaw v. Sumner, </em>1874, 56 Mo. 517. See also <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>1870 , 2 Cincinnati Superior Court Reporter, 60; <em>Cubitt </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>1828, 8 B. &amp; C. 257; Jessel, M. R., in <em>Standard Bank of Africa </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>1878, 38 L. T. n. s. 672. But, in the present case, Morrell does not appear to have entertained the purpose of rebuilding.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">II. The question of Morrell\u2019s obligation to repair his part for the purpose of affording continued support to Doe\u2019s part is not necessarily involved in this action; which was brought to recover for positive acts of destruction, and not for mere neglect to repair. It might be held that Morrell, even if under no duty to repair, was bound (apart from the matter of public danger) to let his part stand so long as it furnished a support to the other part.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The question whether Morrell was under obligation to repair can hardly bo said to be decisively settled by the cases; but the weight of recent authority is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">It is said in Keil. 23 II. VII. 98 <em>b, </em>pi. 4, that, if one man have the upper part of a house, and the other the lower, they may each compel the other to repair his part in preservation of the other. See also the <em>dicta </em>of Lord Campbell, C. J., in <em>Humphries </em>v. <em>Brogden, </em>1850, 12 Ad. &amp; El. n. s. 739, 756, 757 (citing, with approval, Erskine\u2019s Institute of the Law of Scotland), and Dillon, C. J., in <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>1869, 28 Iowa, 233, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The case in Keilway, or the report of it, was doubted by Holt, C. J., in <em>Tenant </em>v. <em>Goldwin, </em>3 Anne, 6 Mod. 311; s. c. 2 Ld. Raym. 1089; 1 Salk. 21, 360; where it was said that the writ in E. if. B. 127, is grounded upon the custom of the place, and not upon the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">According to the head-note in <em>Anonymous, </em>1 Anne, 11 Mod. 7, the doctrine of the case in Keilway was there affirmed; but the casein 11 Mod. is so imperfectly reported as to be of little value.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">In <em>Cheeseborough </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1834, 10 Conn. 318, it was decided, that the owner of the lower part of a house cannot maintain an action on the case, against the owner of the upper part, for suffering the roof to become leaky and ruinous, whereby goods in the lower part are damaged; the Court saying that the plaintiff could have an adequate remedy only in chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">In the case of a ruinous party-wall, it was <em>held </em>by Chancellor Kent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>that one of the owners, who pulled it down and rebuilt it, could recover contribution in equity from the other owner. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Mesier, </em>1820, 4 Johns. Ch. 334. And see Read, J., in <em>Vollmer\u2019s Appeal, </em>1869, 61 Pa. St. 118, 128 (a case turning on a statute); Brown, P. J., in <em>List </em>v. Hornbrook, 1867, 2 W. Va. 340, 346; <em>Stevenson </em>v. Wallace, 1876, 27 Gratt. 77. In <em>Runnels v. Bullen, </em>1823, 2 N. H. 532, Woodbury, J., said, p. 535: \u201cAndwhere the decay is suffered in a portion of a party-wall between cellars or houses, no doubt an action for the consequent damage can he sustained by the other owners;\u201d and he subsequently cited <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Morrell, </em>with seeming approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In <em>Sherred </em>v. <em>Cisco, </em>1851, 4 Sandf. N. Y. Superior Court, 480, it was <em>held, </em>that there was no claim for contribution where one of the owners of a party-wall rebuilds it after the destruction of the wall and both adjoining buildings by \u00f1re. And in <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>1857, 15 N. Y. 601, 615, Denio, C. J., said: \u201c I do not perceive any solid distinction between a total destruction of the wall and buildings, and a state of things which should require the whole to be rebuilt from the foundation. In either case, there is great force in saying that the mutual easements have become inapplicable, and that each proprietor may build as he pleases upon his own land, without any obligation to accommodate the other.\u201d These <em>dicta </em>of Judge Denio are indorsed in Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition, \u00a7 256. And see <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1871, 35 Md. 208; Cochran, J., in <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Hennings, </em>1863, 20 Md. 179, 185; Scholfield, J., in <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Flentye, </em>1875, 80 Ill. 258, 260; Mellor, J., in <em>Colebeck </em>v. <em>Girdler\u2019s Co., </em>1876, L.

It was decided that the action could not be maintained; the Court holding that there was no implied obligation to repair. Some New Hampshire decisions, though not in point, may be noticed in this connection. The grantee of a right to grind at a corn-mill cannot maintain ease, against one claiming the mill under the grantor, for not keeping it in repair. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Peaslee, </em>1847, 20 N. H. 547. A license to erect a dam and flow the land of another terminates with the decay of the dam, and gives no right, when the dam has become decayed and ruinous, to re-erect or repair it, and flow the land again. <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Kidder, </em>1852, 24 N. H. 364; <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Redington, </em>1850, 21 N. H. 291, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The owner of the upper part of a house cannot maintain an action at law against the owner of the lower part, to recover contribution for repairs made on the roof. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>1808, 4 Mass. 575; <em>Wiggin </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>1862, 43 N. H. 561; <em>Ottumwa Lodge </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>1871, 34 Iowa, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"A4g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>III. As to the form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Morrell\u2019s counsel argued that, even \u201c if he had no right to do what he had done \u2014open one side of plaintiff\u2019s house and let in the air and storm \u2014 the act was done on defendant\u2019s own land and to his own timber. . . .\u201d But it would <em>seem </em>physically impossible for Morrell to have sawn asunder his half from Doe\u2019s without placing part of his (or his servant\u2019s) hand or foot upon or over Doe\u2019s part, during the act of sawing. Morrell\u2019s right to enter upon Doe\u2019s side of the stairs for purposes of passage did not include a right to enter for purposes of wrongful destruction. The wrongful placing of part of his hand or foot upon or over Doe\u2019s side would bo a trespass, according to the views expressed by Lord Coi.ekidge, C. J., in <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Loftus Iron Co., </em>1874, L. R. 10 C. P. 10, 12. \u201cIt is clear that, in determining the question of trespass or no trespass, the Court cannot measure the amount of the alleged trespass; if the defendant place a part of his foot on the plaintiff\u2019s land unlawfully, it is, in law, as much a trespass as if he had walked hall' a mile on it.\u201d In that case, it was <em>held </em>a trespass, if the mouth and feet of the defendant\u2019s horse protruded over the plaintiff\u2019s land, through an opening in a wire fence; Lord Coeeridgh saying, \u201c That may be a very small trespass, but it is a trespass in law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The cases as to the remedy of one owner of a party-wall against the other hardly seem in point. <em>Cubitt </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>1828, 8 B. &amp; C. 257 (see also <em>Wiltshire </em>v. <em>Sidford, </em>1827, 1 M. &amp; R. 401), is inapplicable, unless Doe and Morrell were tenants in common. But partition had already been fully made between them; and their interests would seem to be several, though each had a right to make beneficial use of the other\u2019s part for certain purposes. <em>Matts </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>1813, 5 Taunt. 20, may bo distinguished, on the ground that Morrell did not remove any portion of tho building that stood on Doe\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Cate, </em>1875, 56 N. H. 130, 136, Cushing, C. J., said: \u201c . . . If the ease reqnired.it, I should be inclined to hold that the difference between trespass and case has now become matter of form, and to permit the form of action to be changed by amendment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
