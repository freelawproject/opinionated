There was a second count for two hundred pounds of honey in the comb.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">The case was, the plaintiffs found a swarm of bees in a tree on the [defendant\u2019s] land in Claremont, marked the tree, and notified the defendant, who cut down the tree, September, 1803, and converted the honey to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">Plea: the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">\u25a0 At the trial there was some dispute whether the plaintiffs or one of the defendant\u2019s family first discovered the bees, and whether the plaintiffs gave notice of .the finding and marking the tree. The other parts of the case were proved.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b78-12\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">summed up, and observed that two questions had been' made on the trial: first, whether the plaintiffs first discovered the bees; and, secondly, supposing they did, whether the property of the honey was in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">The first is a question of evidence proper for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">The second is a question of law, and one about which the Court entertain no doubt. The plaintiffs do not pretend to have any property in the land or in the tree, nor had they any property in the bees. How then came they by a property in the honey ? It must have been by occupancy. But how did they occupy, or appropriate the honey to themselves ? They saw the bees enter the tree, they heard them make a noise near the tree, and they marked the tree. The two first gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>no light; they do not amount to occupancy. The marking of the tree was a trespass, and consequently can avail the plaintiffs nothing, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The doctrine contended for by plaintiffs is injurious to the rights of property. Till the bees occupied the tree in question, it is not pretended that plaintiffs had any right in it. What gave them a right ? Having seen a swarm of bees, in which they-had no property, occupying it? This circumstance, whether the effect of accident, or the result of labor and skill, cannot lessen the rights of the owner of the soil. Will it be pretended that plaintiffs thereby acquired a right to the tree? If they acquired a title to the honey, they must necessarily have a right to take it away, to cut down the tree, to pass over the defendant\u2019s land for the purpose, &amp;c. Admitting that plaintiffs could acquire property in a swarm .of bees, or in the honey, by finding, in some cases, they could not do so in the present case, because such right or property interferes with the rights and property clearly vested in defendant; it is inconsistent with it; it lessens its value at least. It is much more consonant to our ideas of property to say, that the bees and honey in the defendant\u2019s trees belong to him in the same manner and for the same reason as all mines and minerals belong to the owner of the soil. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Will it be pretended by the plaintiffs that they could have put, without defendant\u2019s permission, a swarm of bees into the defendant\u2019s tree, and there kept them till they had made honey; and then, in case he cut down the tree, maintained trespass for the cutting, or trover for the honey ? One would suppose that the present case was not stronger than that; here they had no right to the bees.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It has been said, that, by the usage in this part of the State, the person who finds bees acquires a property in them wherever found. We recognize no such usage. We have no local customs or usages which are binding in one part of the State and not in another. If this be the law here, it must be so in every other part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Verdict for defendant.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><em> Pierson </em>v. <em>Post, </em>3 Caines, 175.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b79-5\"> 2 Blackst. 390 \u2014 391. Bees are <em>ferae natura, </em>except when hived or reclaimed; when a swarm lights on my tree they are not mine. But it would seem that, if they hive themselves in my tree, they are then mine, <em>ratione soli. </em>And, if they are found on my ground, I have a qualified property in them; to the young, <em>rationeimpotentice; </em>and to the labor of the bees, or honey, because they are on my land and use my hive. I have, on these accounts, to say the least of it, a better title than any other person. See Shep. Touch. 223 (226) [5 Mod. 375, cited in Manuscript Digest].</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">It would seem, by c. 13 of <em>Gharta Foresta, </em>that honey belongs to the owner of the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">1 Beeves, Hist.
