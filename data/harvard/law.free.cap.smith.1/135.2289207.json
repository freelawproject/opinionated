His counsel, <em>Mr. </em>Bell, moved, in arrest of judgment, that there was no evidence that the indictment was found by the grand jury. The bill was signed by the solicitor, <em>D. </em>Everett, and by the foreman of the grand jury. But the words, \u201c this is a true bill,\u201d were omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-9\"><em>The counsel [for </em>defendant] contended that this omission was fatal, that the signature of the foreman, with the addition of \u201cforeman,\u201d was not sufficient. The intention of the jury may have been to find it not a true bill, in which case it would have the signature as it now has. This bill in its present shape shows that the grand jury have acted upon it, but it does not appear what they have done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-10\"><em>The solicitor </em>contended that, according to the usage in this State, it was evident that the grand jury had found this a true bill; because the jury never indorse \u201c ignoramus,\u201d or \u201c this is not a true bill,\u201d as they sometimes do in England. This difference in the usage removes all pretence of uncertainty. All bills signed by the foreman are found true bills. But, if this were not so, it is too late to take the exception after plea pleaded. By pleading to this indictment, defendant admits it is duly found.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Per Curiam.</p>\n<p id=\"ANW\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> S.
