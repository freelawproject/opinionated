Laws, ed. 1797, 248, 249; 1 Manuscript on Descent, &amp;c., 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">This is in the nature of bill of discovery in courts of equity. Complaint seeks no relief; judge can give none. It is in aid of some other jurisdiction, in civil suit; which other jurisdiction cannot compel discovery. (Discovery and relief may be in chancery, or discovery only in aid of other courts.) It is intended the better to enable such court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The answers may doubtless be used in a trial between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">There can be no doubt as to constitutionality of this. Article 15, Bill of Rights, relates to criminal proceedings only. See 2 Manuscript on Descent, &amp;c., 995, Idiots.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">If not usable in action, of no use. Judge of probate cannot act after discovery ; must dismiss then ; <em>functus officio. </em>He has power to compel the discovery. Why ? <em>Qui </em>bono, if not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Objection. 1st, bill of rights ; <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> 2d, common-law maxim \u2014 furnish evidence in civil suits. Answer.
