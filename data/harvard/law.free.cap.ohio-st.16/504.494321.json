Thereupon the defendant offered and gave evidence, tending to prove that a contract was made between the plaintiff and defendant, whereby said plaintiff, being a millwright, agreed to repair the mill for the defendant at and for the customary cash rates of charge by measurement of such work as the repairs consisted of; that the repairs were worth, at the customary cash rates of charge by measurement, about $504; that the said plaintiff, immediately after the making of the repairs, and in the absence of the defendant, proceeded to measure said work, and some days afterward procured from the defendant his notes thereon, amounting in all to $850, including the note sued on; that the notes constituting the $850, loss the note sued on, had passed into the hands of other persons, and that the liability of the defendant thereon had become fixed. The plaintiff thereupon offered and gave evidence tending to prove that, after the making of the ro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>pairs, the plaintiff and defendant met to settle, and the plaintiff stated to defendant that the said work by measurement, at customary cash prices, amounted to $1,150; that the defendant expressed the opinion that the bill was too high, and offered $750; the plaintiff again asserted it was not too high, and said he was willing to leave it to millwrights, and defendant said he thought they could settle it themselves, and they settled before they separated late at night. Defendant gave his notes to plaintiff for $850 for the said work of plaintiff, the note sued on in this case being one of said notes. And thereupon the plaintiff asked the court to charge the jury as to the law of this case, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">1. That the plaintiff is entitled to their verdict for the amount appearing due upon the writing obligatory offered *in evidenee, unless they find that the defendant, at the time of the making of said writing obligatory, was induced by fraudulent conduct on the part of the plaintiff to believe that he was making an instrument different from that which he actually did make, or unless they find that the consideration of said writing obligatory has failed in whole or in part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">2. That the jury can not find that the consideration of said writing obligatory has entirely failed, without they find that the repairs constituting such consideration were of no value; nor that the consideration of said writing obligatory has failed in part, unless they find that a part of such repairs were of no value, and also find the price fixed by the parties upon such repairs, as they find of no value at the time of the giving of said notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">3. That if they find that said writing obligatory was given upon a compromise between said parties, as to the price and value of said repairs, the plaintiff is entitled to their verdict for tho amount appearing due upon said writing obligatory, irrespective of what may have been the real value of such repairs at customary cash prices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">Upon which said first proposition the court charged the jury that if, when the parties met to ascertain what was due from the defendant to the plaintiff, the plaintiff deceived the defendant, and induced him to believe that the plaintiff was entitled to recover more than he was entitled to receive, the defendant is entitled to an abatement equal to the excess over the amount actually due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">Upon said second proposition, the court refused to charge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>law as stated in said proposition ; but the court did charge the jury that the law is otherwise than is stated in said proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">Upon said third proposition, the court charged the jury that the law was as stated in said proposition, provided the parties met on terms of equality, and the plaintiff did not deceive the defendant by fraudulent representations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">To which said several opinions of the court in refusing to *cbargo as aforesaid, as well as to the several instructions given by the court to the jury in their charge aforesaid, the plaintiff excepted, and prayed that his bill of exceptions in that behalf might be allowed, which is accordingly done. And upon his motion, the same is ordered to be made a part of the record in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">The errors assigned and relie d upon are, that the court of common pleas erred in refusing to instruct the jury as required by the plaintiff, and in the instruction given, and also the general error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-9\">J. C. Hance and S. W. Bostwick, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-10\">Stanton &amp; Peppard, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-11\">The case was submitted without argument.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b432-12\">Hitchcock, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7lT\">The request first made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel for the instruction of the court to the jury, is based upon the assumption, that in order to avoid a contract for fraud, the fraud must be committed in the execution of the instrument witnessing the contract, and not in false and fraudulent representations previously made, which induced the party to execute it. The court of common pleas did not recognize this as a sound princijilo of law, and refused to charge as requested. Upon this question this court is divided in opinion, or at least have not been able to come to a definite conclusion, and it is therefore left undetermined. Nor are we prepared to say whether or not there was error in the charge actually given by the court in response to this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Counsel for plaintiff next requested the court to charge the jury that they could not find the consideration for said writing obligatory had entirely failed, unless they found that the repairs constituting such consideration, were of no *valuo; nor that the consideration had failed in part, unless they should find that a part of such repairs were of no value, and also find the pi'ice fixed upon such repairs as were of no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The court refused so to charge the jury, but did charge that such was not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Was this erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The construction which has been put by this court upon the act of February 24, 1834, allowing a defendant to an action upon a written contract for tho payment of property or money, to plead or give notice of the entire or partial failure of consideration, is this : If' the defendant relies upon entire failure, ho must so make his proof. If he relies upon partial failure, he must, by his proofv show wherein this partial failure consists. It is not enough that he proves that the consideration is less valuable than it was supposed or estimated to be, when the contract was made. If tho law were to be so construed, it would bo of no use to fix any value upon the property or labor, or whatever might bo the consideration of the note, bond, or contract, for this value might be varied by the proofs, or by the verdict of a jury. Besides, if the vendee of an article might prove that the article was of less value than the contract price, the vendor ought to be permitted to prove that it was more valuable. Such was never the intention of the law. To avail himself of this law, a defendant must show that the consideration is entirely valueless, or if the defense is partial failure, then he must prove that part of the consideration which is claimed to have failed, was entirely valueless.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">For instance, a note is given, the consideration of which is one thousand barrels of flour, at a stipulated price per barrel. No part of the flour is delivered. Hero would be an entire failure of consideration. If but five hundred barrels is delivered, there is a partial failure of consideration to this extent. But the maker of the note can not rely upon the defense, that there was a partial failure of consideration, and ^sustain the same by proof, that tho flour was of less value than the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">If we are right in this construction, and it is the construction which this court has always given to the statute, it follows that the court of common pleas erred in not instructing upon this point as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">For this error the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
