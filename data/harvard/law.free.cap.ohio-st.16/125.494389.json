Haines, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">In considering this question, we must recollect that we are in a court of law, investigating a legal, not an equitable right; and that, in remote times, if the mortgagor once *suffered tho condition to be broken, his estate was gone, and there could be no redemption. No principle of law is more firmly established than that, as between mortgagor and mortgagee, and those holding under them, the legal estate and right of possession are in the mortgagee and his assigns. It will probably be admitted by the counsel for tho defendant in error, that if the assignee, Rattorman, had purchased and taken possession of the lot in controversy, he could be evicted. But, as this plain proposition may be denied, I will refer to a few loading cases upon this point</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\">In the language of Judge Wilde, 17 Mass. 421: \u201c Tho ancient doctrine of tho common law, in respect to mortgages, is plain and well understood. By a conveyance by way of mortgage in foe, all the mortgagor\u2019s title passes to the mortgagee, subject, however, to be defeated by the performance of the condition. But if tho condition be not strictly performed by the mortgagor, the estato of the mortgagee becomes absolute\u2014no right remaining to tho mortgagor afterward to redeem.\u201d 1 South. (N. J.) 268. So in 2 Black. Com. 158 : \u201c In case of failure to perform the condition, the mortgagee may enter and take possession, without possibility at law of being afterward evicted by the mortgagor.\u201d 1 Powell on Morg. 4, 5. And this was tho law until courts of equity interfered,. and tho debtor was declared to possess what was significantly termed an \u201cequity of redemption,\u201d or a right to redeem the estate within a reasonable period, upon the payment of tho debt and all equitable charges, such as taxes, assessments, repairs, etc. Holcombe\u2019s Eq. 186 ; 1 Powell, 4, n. <em>a; </em>17 Mass. 422 ; 10 Paige, 70; 2 Ed w. G34. A deed of mortgage, at its early introduction, created an estato upon condition, which became absolute when the condition was not performed. An equity of redemption was not known until tho chancellor interfered and modified the rigor of the common law, by entertaining the bill to redeem, and it is said, in 1 Paige, 67 : \u201c That the system of chancery foreclosure originated in a desire to protect a landed aristocracy, rather than as proceeding from any fixed principle of ^equity.\u201d It will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>be recollected that John B. Germain (the common source of title) conveyed the lot in question, subject to our mortgage, and could grant only his interest or ostate therein. We are informed in 2 Black. Com. 103, \u201c That an estate in lands, tenements, and hereditaments, signified such interest as the tenant hath therein.\u201d What interest had John B. Germain in said lot, as between him and the mortgagee after the execution and recording of the said mortgage, on November 26, 1841? Clearly an equity of redemption only. And in this principle all the English and American authorities coincide. In 2 Cow. 301, Judge Southerland correctly says : <em>\u201c </em>The estate of the mortgagee is a legal interest,\u201d and \u201cthe estate of the mortgagor an equitable interest.\u201d Judge McLean, 2 McL. 448: <em>\u201c </em>The mortgagee has the legal title.\u201d Justice Washington, 9 Wheat. 499 : A purchaser with notice can be in no better situation than the person from whom he derives his title, and is bound by the same equity which would affect his right. The mortgagor, after forfeiture, has no title at law, and none in equity but to redeem upon the terms of paying the debt and interest. His conveyance to a purchaser with notice, passes nothing but an equity of redemption, and the latter can, no moro than the mortgagor, assert that equity against the mortgagee, without paying the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">In 2 Halst. 178, the court say, \u201c that it is a clear principle of law, that a mortgagee in possession can never be ousted by the mortgagor or any claiming under him, until the mortgage be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">In 13 Ves. 3, Lord Eldon remarks, \u201cthat a court of chancery will not take the possession from the mortgageo for the purpose of placing it even in the hands of the court, while a shilling is due.\u201d In England, a mortgagor, after forfeiture, is considered only as a tenant at sufferance. Lord Tenterdon, 15 Eng. Com. Law, 336, says, \u201c the mortgagor is not in the situation of tenant at all, or, at all events, he is not more thari a tenant at sufferance, b;it in a peculiar character, and liable to be treated as tenant or trespasser, at the option of *the mortgagee,\u201d 7 Eng. Com. Law, 204; and such is the language of all the English authorities. 3 East, 451; 1 D. &amp; E. 383 ; Woodfall\u2019s Land, and Ten. 83. There can be no doubt, in the words of Ch. J. Spencer, 20 Johns. 62, \u201cthat the mortgagee, as between him and the mortgagor, nas the right of entry, and is entitled to the possession of the promises,\u201d and \u201c that the purchaser of an equity of redemption1 can aver no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>seizin or title against any other person than the mortgage debtor or his immediate tenant.\u201d 10 Mass. 421, 425; 1 South. 269.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">But the defendant in error assumes that the sheriff\u2019s deed is void, and conveys no title from an oversight in the draughtsman of the bill to foreclose; and that the plaintiff in ei\u2019ror can not avail himself of the original mortgage in this action. The principle is too plain to be controverted, that a decree of foreclosure is conclusive only upon the parties to the suit. The estate of Kramer in the said lot was the equity of redemption as derived from Germain, and hold by him subject to the payment of the mortgage debt. Kramer, in taking a conveyance with notice of the mortgage, subjects himself to all the claims that existed in favor of Mousch, or his assigns, against Germain, and is precluded from setting up any title that could not have been asserted by Germain. If Kramer could hold his purchase discharged of the mortgage, it would enable the partios to commit a fraud. The plaintiff in error derives her title from a purchaser who pays his money on the faith of an order of court, under a judicial proceeding sanctioned and confirmed by the court, and application of the proceeds of the sale made by them. It would be a merited reproach to our jurisprudence, if, under those circumstances, a party could acquire what he never purchased\u2014an estate beyond the power of Germain to dispose of,\u2014an estate to be discharged by accident from the charge to which it was subjected. The principles of law are not of this variant <em>\u201cprotean </em>\u201d character. The plaintiff in error \u201c stands in the shoes \u201d of Ratterman, and as his legal assignee, is entitled to all his right, and may set up the *mortgage and protect her title under it\u2014may use it as her shield and buckler. By her purchase from Loring (the purchaser under the decree), she comes into the place of all the parties to the bill, and holds by deed (through the sheriff) from them. The'purchaser has paid the amount adjudged to be duo Ratterman ; and he and those holding under him are to be considered as tho legal assigns of the mortgage, and may set it up as a muniment of title. No peculiar form of words is essential to the assignment of a mortgage. The assignment of the note is a good transfer of the mortgage. 4 Ohio, 318 ; 1 Blackf. 137. \u201c Whatever transfers the debt carries the estate with it.\u201d 4 Burr. 978. Here is a solemn conveyance of the interest of all the parties to the suit, by the executive officer of the court, and assuredly passes all the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of Ratterman in the mortgage. In 1 South. 273, \u201ca purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale comes into the place of the defendant, and holds as if by deed from him, the sheriff being merely the agent of the law to transfer the title.\u201d Den. v. Stockton, 7 Halst. 322, 324, was action brought to recover possession of mortgaged promises by the purchaser under the decree of foreclosure, who was also the mortgagor. The defense was, \u201cthat the proceedings in chancery and the sheriff\u2019s sale were irregular and void,\u201d etc. The court said, \u201c that by bidding at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and accepting a deed, Jane Hart (the mortgagee) acknowledged no title inconsistent with her own. That act was intended to come in aid of her mortgage, and to perfect her title ; such would be the effect if the proceedings are valid. There is nothing in the nature of these proceedings which divests or suspends the legal title and right of possession until a sale take place. By <em>that </em>the estate of both the mortgagor and mortgagee are transferred to the purchaser.\u201d Precisely as we claim in this case. That by the sale to David Loring, the estate of Germain and Ratterman was transferred to him, and thereby he is invested with their rights. It follows, therefore, that Doring having purchased the interest of Ratterman in the mortgaged premises, his grantee can protect *herself under the mortgage. In the language of the court, 10 Johns. 481, \u201calthough no regular foreclosure is shown, yet the assignee of the mortgagee, living in possession, may protect his possession under it.\u201d And in 7 Cow. 13, 20, it is stated, \u201cthat a conveyance by a mortgagee as upon a statute foreclosure under the form of sale, even if the proceedings to foreclose be irregular, yet carries all the interest of tho mortgagee to the purchaser, as well in the debt as in the land mortgaged.\u201d Such a deed operates as a good assignment of the mortgage, and the purchaser may claim as assignee. It is also there settled, \u201cthat the assignee of a mortgagee in possession will be protected against an action of ejectment by the mortgagor and all persons claiming under him, and this though his assignment was obtained upon a usurious consideration.\u201d The only distinction in' this case is, that here, \u201cthe sheriff\u201d (in the language of Washington, J., 3 Wash. 550,) \u201c is empowered by law to convey by deed to the purchaser, under an execution, all the right, title, interest, and estate of the defendant\u201d (here the parties to the suit) \u201c as fully as the defendant himself, or an attorney empowered for that purpose by him, could have done. The officer in fact acts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>such attorney, appointed for that purpose by law.' The purchase money is paid to the defendant in the execution, or is applied to his use in discharge of his debts, between whom and the purchaser the law raises a contract, in like manner as if the conveyance had been made by him. In tho case before the court, the interest of all parties to the suit passes through the agency of the sheriff to the purchaser, and enables him and his grantees to avail themselves of all securities.\u201d Tho purchaser takes the interest of the mortgagee, and is invested with his rights. He is no stranger to the proceedings, but has connected himself with tho mortgage by the payment of the money, and is entitled to be subrogated in all his rights. Any departure from the principle would lead to great injustice, and the encouragement of a spirit of speculation in the purchase of equities of redemption utterly, worthless, except for the ^chance of some oversight on tho part of tho draughtsman. The defendant in error, by resorting to another forum, in the language of the court, 17 Mass. 427, \u201c has an adequate and convenient remedy, and well adapted to tho great end of all judicial proceedings, the doing of impartial justice to all parties.' For while on the one hand it moderates the rigor of the common law for the benefit of the mortgagor, it compels him on the other hand, to perform whatever equity and justice may require for the benefit of the piortgagee. It compels the mortgagor, when he applies for equity, to do equity. If ejectment would lie for the mortgagor upon payment of the debt, tho mortgagee would have no remedy to recover any disbursements made by him for repairs, for his right to demand them depends either upon the statute or the rules of equity. They are unknown to the common law, which considers tho mortgagee as the absolute owner.\u201d The right of the defendant in error being then an equitable one merely, can only be enforced in chancery by a bill to redeem. This is the acknowledged law in England and the United States, and has been attempted to be shaken by a single case. 20 Wend. 260. As to that authority, the judge states that \u201cthe question of the invalidity of the sale was then presented for the first time. In that case the form of the master\u2019s deed was peculiar in the granting clause, subject to all adverse claim to the same, and all chances and all risks of title,\u201d and as his opinion may be considered one of first impression, it is not entitled to much weight. It is certainly,not sustained by reason or authority. It has been well remarked by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Lord Eldon, <em>\u201c </em>that it is better that law should be certain than that every judge should speculate upon improvements in it;\u201d and by Judge Southard, 1 South. 281, \u201cthat judge ought not to be led without authority that can not be resisted, into the establishment of principles unjust and unreasonable.\u201d The cases cited by Judge Cowen, in favor of this novel proposition, are those in 3 Johns. 459, and others which only decide what we admit, \u201cthat the purchaser will take only a title as against the parties to the trust,\u201d *and the reason assigned by Chancellor Kent for making all persons interested parties is, \u201cthat otherwise the mortgagor would take the surplus money.\u201d This is the language of all those cases, \u201c that the decree of foreclosure is conclusive only upon the parties to the snit, and that upon a bill to redeem by other incumbrances, the purchaser is consoled in having his principal, interest, costs, taxes, etc., repaid him.\u201d We have previously endeavored to show that the plaintiff in error is not to be treated as a stranger\u2014that having deduced her title from Loring, the purchaser under the decree, she comes \u201cinto the seat\u201d of the mortgagee by operation of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-5\">James Riley, Morehead &amp; G-Wynne, for defendant in error ;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">The mortgagor may sell and convey his title, both legal and equitable, to whom he pleases ; for he is the owner of the fee till foreclosure, subject to the right of the mortgagee to enter for breach of the condition, and pay himself out of the rents and profits, or to subject the land to sale for the payment of his demand. The purchaser from the mortgagor, therefore, takes the fee simple subject to the mortgagee\u2019s lien, and only liable to be divested by the legal proceedings to enforce it at law by judgment and execution ; or in chancery by decree or sale. The plaintiff below, therefore, had the legal title, and, <em>prima fade, </em>the right to recover. Is that right taken away by the judicial proceedings ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">1. If the mortgagee would divest the title of the mortgagor, or his grantee, by foreclosure proceedings, he must make the person holding that title a defendant; indeed, without that, the proceedings are a mere nullity, and do not in any manner affect the title, either of the mortgagor, or of the mortgagee himself. 20 Wend. 264; 9 Dana, 201; 10 Paige, 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">It is plain they do not affect the title of the mortgagor: for the court have obtained no jurisdiction over him. Indeed more; the complainant has not asked to have him *made a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the foreclosure. A mere statement of this fact is sufficient. But see 10 Paige, 56; 5 Ib. 30; 6 Wend. 449, 453; 1 Dana, 278; 9 Ib. 201; 2 Blackf. 111, n. 1 Conn. 509; 1 Ohio, 101; 6 Ib. 44, 117, 535 ; 20 Wend. 264.

If be were so named, he might show that he never was served, nor appeared; that he is not the person the judgment was rendered against which is sought to bo enforced. 6 Wend. 452; 1 Ohio, 100, 259; 2 Ib. 31, 334; 3 Ib. 44, 518; 7 Ib. 187, pt. 2; 12 Ib. 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-4\">The distinction on which this action rests is stated in Story's Eq. PI, sec. 193. The proper parties defendant to a bill to foreclose are, all persons interested, who are to bo affected by the decree; all persons interested in the equity of redemption\u2014all incumbrancers should be made parties, whether prior or subsequent; if such incumbrancers are not made parties, the decree does not bind them, and a decreo of sale would not. The prior incumbrancers are not bound, because their rights are paramount to the foreclosing party. Findlay <em>v. </em>Bank of the United States, 11 Wheat. 304; Delabare <em>v. </em>Norwood, 3 Swanst. 144; Shepherd <em>v. </em>Gruinnett, Ib. 151; Rose <em>v. </em>Page, 2 Simon, 471. There can not be a foreclosure where the mortgagee is not before the court. Powell Mort. 990, 991, n. <em>a; </em>Fell <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 Bro. 276; Polk <em>v. </em>Clinton, 12 Ves. 48, 59; Swift <em>v. </em>Edson, 5 Conn. 531. A mortgagor who has conveyed all his interest in the mortgaged premises can not sustain a bill to redeem; and if a mortgagee, who has assigned all his interest in the mortgage and mortgage debt, forecloses, the proceedings are a nullity. 2 Pick. 276; 5 Ib. 281; 24 Maine, 298; 9 Mass. 422; Powell Mort. 261, 262; 20 Wend. 260; 4 Dana, 232; 4 Hill, 175; 23 Maine, 25; 25 Ib. 392. Every foreclosure contains a redemption, and every redemption a foreclosure. If the mortgagor have nothing in the mortgaged premises, he can not redeem; and if the mortgagee, ^having nothing in the mortgage and mortgage debt, foreclose, it will be a nullity. There \u25a0can be no foreclosure unless the mortgagor be before the court; .and incumbrancers are bound only as they are reached. It follows that if a junior mortgagee should foreclose without making .a senior mortgagee party, the senior mortgagee could eject the .purchaser at this junior foreclosure sale; and if tho mortgagor was not made party, he could eject the purchaser, having the par-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>amount title, the fee; and the proceedings could not be used in evidence against him nor the sheriff\u2019s'deed. John B. Germain had not one particle of interest in this land for months before the bill was filed against him, nor no one made defendant had one particle of interest in this land, and no one of the defendants could either redeem the mortgage or have it foreclosed against him so as to affect one particle in this title, acquired months before. 5 Conn. 531; 24 Maine, 298; 2 Pick. 276; 5 Ib. 281; 9 Mass. 422; Powell Mort. 261, 262; 20 Wend. 260; 4 Dana, 233; 4 Hill, 175; 23 Maine, 25; 25 Ib. 302. And as John B. Germain could neither redeem the mortgage, nor could the mortgage be foreclosed by filing a bill against him, having no interest in the mortgaged premises when the proceedings were commenced, David Loring stepping into the shoes of a man who could neither redeem nor foreclose the mortgage; neither could he, David Loring.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-5\">2. As the foreclosure proceedings are no defense to this'action, the inquiry offers: can the tenant protect her possession by means of the mortgage ? That question must be answered in the negative. No person but the mortgagee or his assignee can set up the mortgage. 1 Ohio, 101; 2 Ib. 223-225; 20 Wend. 260; 4 Dana, 233; 4 Hill, 175 ; Doug. 631, 632; 2 Burr. 978, 979 ; 7 Johns. 282; 4 Ib. 43; 6 Ib. 290; 2 Ib. 380; 24 Maine, 198; 5 Halst. 158, 159; 1 South. 275; 2 Ib. 380; Adams Eject. 29, n. 3. \u201cIf the mortgage is to be set up, the mortgagee must join in the defense.\u201d 1 Halst. 478; Esp. 783; 3 Term, 783; 3 Burr. 1293, 1297; Barnes, 193, 194; 8 Term, 645; Sel. *Prac. 1064; Adams Eject. 260; Comber. 209; Bull.

Although many authorities have been cited by counsel to sustain this judgment, yet the one principally relied upon, and which was undoubtedly received by the superior court as conclusive of the case, is the case of Watson et al. <em>v. </em>Spence, 20 Wend. 260. That was a case substantially like the one now before the court, and decided as the case was in the court below\u2014that is, the result was *the same in both cases. There had been a foreclosure and sale to a stranger, the mortgagor having parted with his interest before the bill was filed, and his vendee not having been made a party. The court adopt a course of reasoning by which they are brought to the conclusion that tho proceedings in chancery were void as to the vendee of the mortgagor because he was not a party; and that inasmuch as he might have maintained ejectment before the foreclosure against a stranger, he could after the foreclosure\u2014although that stranger is a purchaser under the chancery proceedings; that a purchaser in such case acquires no interest in the land, except as against the original mortgagor; that he has no privity with the mortgagee, and can not be treated as an assignee. It is admitted at the same time that if the mortgagee, or an assignee of tho mortgagee, had purchased, or was in possession, the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Although we have the highest respect for the court making this decision, yet we are not entirely satisfied with the reasoning adopted or the decision made.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In this state we hold, as is held in New York, that in mortgages the debt is the principal, the mortgage the incident. That by assignment of the debt the mortgage is transferred. That by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>payment of the debt, it is satisfied. We hold,' too, that as to all the world except the mortgagee, the mortgagor has a legal estate in the land mortgaged\u2014an interest which may be sold on execution. But we hold that, as between the mortgagor and mortgagee, and those holding under either or both, after condition broken, tho legal estate becomes absolute in the mortgagee, still subject however, to be redeemed upon the payment ,of the debt secured. And this right of redemption continues until the land is sold under a proceeding in chancery. After condition broken, the mortgagee may maintain ejectment for the land, against the mortgagor or any one claiming under him. If the mortgagee or his assignee go into possession, neither the mortgagor, nor any person under him, can disturb this possession. *After condition broken, then the mortgagee has an interest in the land\u2014as between the parties to the mortgage, he has the legal interest. Having this legal interest, be may file his bill in chancery for a foreclosure, or for a decree ordering a sale of tho mortgaged prem-' ises. To this bill he must, or ought to make the mortgagor a party. And he ought further to make all persons parties who have acquired interests in the property, either anterior or posterior to tho date of his mortgage. But suppose he does not, and a decree passes, what is the consequence? Counsel for defendant in error contend that the proceedings are absolutely null and void. That a decree in chancery is absolutely void unless all persons who have an interest in the subject matter are made parties. For if it would be void in a case like the one under consideration for that cause, it must for the same cause be void in every case. But it is not so. If the court have jurisdiction, all parties before it will be bound by the decree. As to those not parties to the suit, not before the court, the decree does not affect them; their interests remain as they were. The mortgagee having filed his bill making the mortgagor a party, regardless of those to whom the mortgagor may have transferred the equity of redemption, obtains a decree, and the land is sold,\u2014what interest passes by the sale ?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Counsel suppose, and such seems to have been the opinion of the court in New York, that nothing passes but the interest of the mortgagor, who is defendant in the suit, and as that mortgagor had no interest, therefore that nothing passes. But such is not the case. When the bill is filed, the legal title, as between par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ties and privies, is in the mortgagee. The object of the bill is, that this may be sold\u2014the land itself, the legal title to which is in the complainant, and that it may be sold divested of any equity of redemption. And it seems clearly to tho court, that when it ia sold, the purchaser takes the interest, not only of the defendants in the case, but the interest of the mortgagee; and that he takes it divested of any right of redemption on the part of those who are parties to the proceeding. So far *as tho land is concerned, he is subrogated to all the rights of tho mortgagee. A junior vendee of the mortgagor, under such circumstances, can not recover in ejectment against the purchaser at the judicial sale, such purchaser being in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It is said, however, that such vendee was not a party to the judicial proceeding, and therefore as to him the proceedings are void. True, his interests are not affected by tho decree and sale. Still, the court have jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties before it. The decree is not a nullity. Now, what were the rights of the junior vendee? As to the mortgagee and those claiming under him, he has, and never had, any other interest than a mere equity of redemption. That right still remains. He may have a bill to redeem, but he can not sustain an ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">These principles being applied, how stands the case before the court? On November 22, 1841, John B. Germain and wife mortgaged the land in controversy to one Anthony Mousch, to secure the payment of $300. Mousch assigned this mortgage to Ratter-man. On January 14, 1842, the mortgagor convoyed the same premises, under tho incumbrance of the mortgage, to Michael Germain, under whom, by intermediate conveyances, the lessor of the defendant in error claims title. On October 25, 1842, and after forfeiture of the conditions of the mortgage, Ratterman filed his bill in chancery for a foreclosure, and for the sale of the mortgaged premises. To this bill John G. Germain, Anthony Mousch, and others were made defendants; but Kramer, tho lessor of the defendant in error, was not made a defendant. A decree was obtained, and the laud sold under an order of sale to one David Loring. This sale was confirmed and a deed made by the sheriff to Loring, who convoyed to John Frische, husband of the plaintiff in error. Frisehe died in possession. By this proceeding and sale, all the interests of those made parties to the bill became vested in Loring. But the interest of Kramer, he not being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>party, was not affected. That interest, ^however, as it respects the mortgagee and those claiming under him, or in his right, is a mere right to redeem. He has it still, but he can not sustain an ejectment. Possibly, as against a mere stranger, an intruder, he might; but not as against him in whom is vested the right of the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">There is another view of the case, which will equally show the error of the superior court. By our practice, the proceedings in chancery, which we sometimes denominate proceedings to foreclose an equity of redemption, are in fact, in the nature of proceedings <em>in rem. </em>The object is to procure, by a decree of the court, the sale of the mortgaged premises, and for no other purpose. In the case of Ratterman <em>v. </em>Germain and others, such was the object of the bill. And upon this bill the court decreed that the mortgaged premises should bo sold. They were sold pursuant to the decree, by the proper officer of the court. Under this sale, unless the proceedings were utterly and entirely void, the purchaser took these identical mortgaged premises, and could transmit them to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The superior court, in excluding from the jury the evidence offered by.the plaintiff in error, and in charging the jury, that as against the plaintiff the lessor of the defendant in error had the legal title, committed an error. The court erred too, in refusing the second, third, and fourth instructions requested by the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The judgment is reversed, with costs, and the case remanded for further proceedings-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
