Although the sentencing guidelines range for the revocation was only three to nine months, the district court concluded that Chacon-Bianco would benefit from the two year intensive drug rehabilitation program. Because this rational is reasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">In March 1998, Norberto Chacon-Bianco was sentenced to seventy months imprisonment and five years supervised release after being convicted for cocaine and cocaine base possession, intent to distribute, and conspiracy charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)-(C) and 846. Following his release from prison, Chacon-Bianco was directed to participate in a substance abuse program as a special condition of his supervision, but he tested positive for cocaine use in July 2002, September 2002, November 2004, and June 2005. R2 at 3. The district court held a supervised release revocation hearing in December 2005, correctly calculated the guidelines range of three to nine months, and sentenced Chacon-Blanco to two years imprisonment so that he could participate in the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 five hundred hour drug treatment program. Both before the district court and on appeal, Chacon-Bianco argues that he accepted responsibility for his conduct, and therefore the two year sentence was unreasonable in comparison to a guidelines range of three to nine months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). A violation of a condition of supervision is a Grade C violation of supervised release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(3)(B) (2005). For a Grade C violation, the Guidelines provide a range of three to nine months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">Additionally, for a Grade C violation of supervised release conditions, \u201cthe court may, after considering the factors set forth in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(D), and (4)-(7), revoke a term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment not to exceed two years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Among other factors, courts should consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>medical care ... or ... correctional treatment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We have held that, for sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, the guidelines range is \u201cmerely advisory, and it is enough that there is some indication the district court was aware of and considered them.\u201d <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Furthermore, a two year sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release is reasonable when it was within the statutory range and the district court considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at the sentence. <em>See Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107; <em>see also United States v. Wiggins, </em>220 F.3d 1248, 1249 (11th Cir.2000) (permitting a two year sentence in order to allow completion of the comprehensive drug rehabilitation program).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Chacon-Bianco is unable to show that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. The district court was not required to impose a sentence within the three to nine month guidelines range provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s statement that Chacon-Bianco needed a two year sentence that would allow him to participate in the five hundred hour Bureau of Prisons\u2019 drug treatment program showed adequate consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly subsection (a)(2)(D). Finally, the sentence was less than the statutory maximum. Given these considerations, we cannot say that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Chacon-Bianco has appealed the reasonableness of the two year sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release. Although this sentence is longer than the suggested guidelines range, the district court reasonably concluded that Chacon-Bianco would benefit from the two year intensive drug rehabilitation program. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
