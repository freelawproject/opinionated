Garcia pled guilty to unlawful re-entry into the United States by an illegal alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), 1326(b)(2) (2000). The district court sentenced Garcia to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garcia\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Garcia\u2019s plea. Specifically, Garcia asserts that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because his trial counsel told him he would be entitled to a sentence reduction that he did not receive. Garcia was given an opportunity to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">Garcia did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, therefore his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Garcia\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117, 120 (4th Cir.1991). During his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>plea colloquy, Garcia specifically stated that he understood the maximum penalty applicable to his crime, that he discussed the sentencing guidelines with his attorney, that he understood that the district court had the authority to depart from the Guidelines in determining Garcia\u2019s sentence, that he understood that he would still be bound by his guilty plea if his sentence was more severe than he expected it to be, and that no one promised him anything not set forth in his written plea agreement. Garcia is bound by the statements he made at the plea colloquy. <em>See Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-23\">. The probation officer calculated a sentencing guideline range for Garcia of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment founded on a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. To the extent Garcia is attempting to allege that his trial counsel was ineffective during the plea process, such a claim must be brought in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), because counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness does not conclusively appear on the face of the record. <em>DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d at 120-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
