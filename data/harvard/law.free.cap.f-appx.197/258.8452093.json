Only Du-Pree\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying his post-judgment motions is properly before this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that DuPree has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\"> The district court's judgment denying relief on DuPree\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was entered on March 29, 2006. DuPree\u2019s post-judgment motions are considered filed on April 27, 2006, the date he signed them. <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Because the motions were not filed within ten days of the entry of the district court\u2019s order, the time for filing a notice of appeal from that order was not tolled, and expired after thirty days, on April 28, 2006. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). The district court\u2019s order denying the post-judgment motions was entered on May 9, 2006. DuPree\u2019s notice of appeal is considered filed on May 25, 2006, and is timely only as to the order denying the post-judgment motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
