(\u201cFidelity\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on his claim for violation of the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, Bergquist argues the district court erred by finding that Fidelity properly asserted, as an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the FLSA\u2019s exemption of computer programmers from the overtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>pay provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We review the district court\u2019s analysis of Fidelity\u2019s affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c) for abuse of discretion. <em>See E.E.O.C. v. White &amp; Son Enters., </em>881 F.2d 1006, 1009 (11th Cir.1989) (reviewing for abuse of discretion district court\u2019s ruling on waiver of affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c)); <em>cf. Amoco Oil Co. v. Gomez, </em>379 F.3d 1266, 1276 (11th Cir.2004) (reviewing for abuse of discretion district court\u2019s denial of motion to amend answer to add counterclaim under Rule 8(c) (citing <em>389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold, </em>179 F.3d 656, 664 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that \u201cwe have held that a district court\u2019s [Rule 8(c) ] decisions with regard to the treatment of affirmative defenses is reviewed for an abuse of discretion\u201d))).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">As a general rule, the FLSA provides that employees are entitled to receive overtime pay at one and one-half times their regular rate for all hours worked in excess of forty per week. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207(a)(1). The FLSA exempts from its overtime pay requirements \u201cany employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\u201d who receives payment on a salary basis. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1); <em>see also Avery v. City of Talladega, </em>24 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.1994). Moreover, section 213(a)(17) of Title 29 further exempts certain specified employees from the overtime compensation requirements, including an employee, such as Bergquist, who is \u201ca computer systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer, or other similarly skilled worker\u201d with certain defined primary duties. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 213(a)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Prior to entering summary judgment in favor of Fidelity based on the forgoing exemptions, the district court addressed Bergquist\u2019s argument that Fidelity\u2019s failure to assert in its answer the \u201ccomputer programmer\u201d exemption as an affirmative defense resulted in a waiver of the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">The Court initially notes that rule 8(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that \u201c[i]n pleading a party shall set forth affirmatively ... waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d If the party fails to raise an affirmative defense in the pleadings, the party generally waives its right to raise the issue at trial. <em>Hassan v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>842 F.2d 260, 263 (11th Cir.1988). The purpose of requiring that an affirmative defense be pled in the answer, however, is to provide notice to the opposing party \u2018of the existence of certain issues.\u2019 <em>Schwind [v. EW &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>357 F.Supp.2d 691, 697 (S.D.N.Y.2005) ] (quoting <em>Doubleday &amp; Co. v. Curtis, </em>763 F.2d 495, 503 (2d Cir.1985)).... Furthermore, \u201cif a plaintiff receives notice of an affirmative defense by some means other than pleadings, \u2018the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 8(c) does not cause the plaintiff any prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Grant v. Preferred Research, Inc., </em>885 F.2d 795, 797 (11th Cir.1989) ] (quoting <em>[Hassan, </em>842 F.2d at 263])____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">The Court finds, in the case at bar, that Defendant has not sought leave to amend its answer. The Court also finds Defendant\u2019s contention that the exemption defenses were raised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>reading paragraph 7 of the Amended Complaint in conjunction with Defendant\u2019s Answer to be tenuous. Nevertheless, while tenuous, review of the record easily demonstrates this case revolves around whether Plaintiff is an exempt computer programmer. This is evident in the Motion for More Definite Statement, the Amended Complaint, the Answer, Defendant\u2019s August 15, 2005 Rule 11 letter and subsequent Rule 11 Motion, Plaintiffs Deposition as well as being a focal point of the parties\u2019 Discovery. Plaintiffs deposition explores his occupational duties, the performance of his duties and even touches upon Plaintiffs understanding of the status of an exempt employee. Moreover, Plaintiffs First Set of Interrogatories asked \u201c[d]oes Defendant contend that Plaintiff was not entitled to be paid for overtime compensation for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours during a work week[,]\u201d to which Defendant answered \u201cPlaintiff was not entitled to be paid overtime compensation for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week because his job title, duties and compensation exempt Plaintiff from the overtime requirements of the [FLSA] and regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d Also noteworthy is that Defendant provided Plaintiff with notice of the computer programmer exemption, and the opportunity to rebut it, in its Rule 11 letter dated August 15, 2005. Defendant, in complying with Rule 11(c)(1)(A), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, served the Rule 11 letter with an attached copy of its yet to be filed Motion for Rule 11 sanctions on Plaintiff. This occurred a month prior to the filing of Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. The Rule 11 letter clearly and explicitly sets forth Defendant\u2019s intention to utilize the exemption defenses in noting that Plaintiff \u201cmet the requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1) and/or (2)(17) and that he was not entitled to overtime compensation under the Act.\u201d The Rule 11 letter also provides that \u201c[bjased on the foregoing, you are and have been on notice that Mr. Bergquist was an exempt computer professional for the duration of his employment at Fidelity.\u201d The attached Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions provides an even more thorough examination of these exemptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">Based upon the foregoing, the Court finds the exemption defenses in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1) and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(17) to be properly asserted and before the Court. Alternatively, it is clear that Plaintiff has had notice of the exemption defenses, has had the opportunity to respond to them and has thus not been prejudiced. <em>Hassan, </em>842 F.2d at 263 (stating that \u201c[w]e must avoid the hypertechnicality in pleading requirements and focus, instead, on enforcing the actual purpose of rule [8(c) ].\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Dist. Ct. Order Granting Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment (Nov. 10, 2005) (internal record citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">From our review of the record, it is plain that the purpose of Rule 8(c) \u2014 \u201csimply to guarantee that the opposing party has notice of any additional issue that may be raised at trial so that he or she is prepared to properly litigate\u201d \u2014 was satisfied here. <em>Hassan, </em>842 F.2d at 263 (citing <em>Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. Univ. of III. Found., </em>402 U.S. 313, 350, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971)). \u201cWhen a plaintiff has notice that an affirmative defense will be raised at trial, the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 8(c) does not cause the plaintiff any prejudice. And, when the failure to raise an affirmative defense does not prejudice the plaintiff, it is not error for the trial court to hear evidence on the issue.\u201d <em>Hassan, </em>842 F.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Bergquist does not allege, and the record would not support, that he was sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>prised or in any way prejudiced by the district court\u2019s decision, given that it clearly was on notice that the \u201ccomputer programmer\u201d exemption was a central issue of dispute between the parties, based on all of the indicators outlined by the district court in its order. <em>Cf. Hassan, </em>842 F.2d at 263-64 (finding no abuse of discretion in district court\u2019s consideration of affirmative defense where plaintiff suffered no prejudice and plaintiff received interrogatories concerning, and was questioned extensively during her deposition about, the affirmative defense). On this record, we discern no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in its finding that the \u201ccomputer programmer\u201d exemption was properly before it as an affirmative defense. Based on the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order, in which the court applied controlling Circuit precedent and addressed every argument raised by Bergquist in this appeal, we affirm the order of summary judgment in favor of Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-15\">. Bergquist was employed by Fidelity\u2019s predecessor, Alltel Information Services, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">. Bergquist argues only that the affirmative defense was not properly raised, but does not challenge the merits of the district court's summary judgment analysis. <em>Cf. Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (llffi Cir.1989) (noting that issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived, and a passing reference in an appellate brief is insufficient to raise an issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
