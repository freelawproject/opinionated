He appeals the three-year term of imprisonment imposed following the revocation of his term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Nickerson argues that the district court erred by refusing to hold his revocation hearing within a reasonable time under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1. The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is not applicable to revocation hearings. <em>See United States v. Tippens, </em>39 F.3d 88, 89-90 (5th Cir.1994). The right to a revocation hearing accrues once the warrant has been executed and the defendant has been taken into federal custody. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, due process rights may be impeded by a delay in the execution of a warrant \u201cif the delay undermines [defendant\u2019s] ability to contest the issue of the violation or to proffer mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record does not reflect that Nickerson suffered any specific prejudice from the delay in executing the warrant. Moreover, the two-month delay between the execution of the warrant and the revocation hearing was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Nickerson argues that the sentence is unreasonable. Although the three-year term of imprisonment imposed on revocation of supervised release exceeded the sentencing range indicated by the policy statements in chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines, it did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, Nicker-son\u2019s revocation sentence was neither \u201cun-</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">reasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
