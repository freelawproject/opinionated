Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Yoes filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against several defendants, including Barbara Owens, an assistant manager of a convenience store, claiming that Owens was involved in a methamphetamine ring and had placed a contract on his life. Owens, the only defendant who was served with process within the time set by the district court, moved for summary judgment. That court dismissed Yoes\u2019s claims against Owens because Yoes had failed to show that Owens was a state actor or had conspired with others to interfere in Yoes\u2019s civil rights. The court also dismissed without prejudice Yoes\u2019s claims against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">Yoes argues that the district court erroneously denied him IFP status to proceed in the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). He does not, however, explain how the district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915(g) determination relates to that court\u2019s certification that the instant appeal is not taken in good faith. Yoes has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. His appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
