Quesada argues (1) his sentence contravened <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and, (2) for the first time on appeal, that his count three conviction should be overturned because the statute cited in the indictment, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), purportedly does not criminalize the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">Quesada\u2019s contention that the district court was precluded from enhancing his sentence based on facts that had not been either admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury is untenable. <em>Post-Booker </em>\u201c[t]he sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">Quesada\u2019s guilty plea renders his defective indictment claim waived because \u201c[a] voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdietional defects in the proceedings against the defendant,\u201d <em>United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 392 (5th Cir.2000), and an allegedly defective indictment does not deprive a district court of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
