Zangwill challenges her convictions for conspiracy to make a counterfeit security and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and knowingly making, uttering, or possessing forged securities, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Zangwill contends that the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a continuance improperly prevented her from obtaining her choice of counsel, and that this action infringed upon her rights under the Sixth Amendment. Because we disagree with Zangwill\u2019s contention, we AFFIRM her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">This case centers around a check fraud scheme involving Zangwill and other employees and officers of Sunny Sky Travel (\u201cSunny Sky\u201d), a travel agency located in Fern Park, Florida. In the summer of 2003, Zangwill participated with Luke Amoresano, the owner of Sunny Sky and her then-boyfriend, in issuing and depositing large numbers of unauthorized checks that had been drawn on the bank accounts of Sunny Sky\u2019s customers. As a result of this scheme, approximately 140 customers of Sunny Sky had funds improperly withdrawn from them accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">On 9 February 2005, a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Florida returned a thirty-eight count indictment against Zangwill. Separate indictments were issued against Zangwill\u2019s co-conspirators at Sunny Sky, including Amoresano, who pled guilty. The indictment against Zangwill contained one count of conspiracy to make a counterfeit security and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, eight counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and twenty-nine counts of making, uttering, or possessing forged securities in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Rl-1. Zangwill was arrested in New York after the indictment issued. Rl-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">At Zangwill\u2019s arraignment on 2 March 2005, the court appointed attorney Peter Warren Kenny of the Federal Public Defender\u2019s office to represent Zangwill. Rl12, 14. The court also scheduled the case for a jury trial before Gregory A. Presnell, District Judge for the Middle District of Florida, for the trial term commencing on 4 May 2005. Rl-15 at 7. Kenny first entered his appearance as Zangwill\u2019s attorney on 8 March 2005. Rl-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">On 13 April 2005, Zangwill, through counsel, filed an unopposed motion to continue the trial until the July 2005 term. Rl-26. Zangwill\u2019s motion cited both the government\u2019s voluminous documents and the need to locate and meet with additional witnesses as bars to having her counsel effectively try the case in May. <em>Id. </em>After discussing the motion at the parties\u2019 status conference on 14 April 2005 and directly seeking the input of Zangwill\u2019s counsel as to when he would prefer to try the case, R2 at 2, the court granted a continuance and the trial was moved from May 2005 to the trial term commencing 5 July 2005. Rl-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">On 16 June 2005, the parties met again for a status conference before Judge Presnell. It was at that conference that Zangwill\u2019s counsel, for the first time, advised the court that Zangwill had been negotiating with a second attorney, James Dauksch, to procure his representation. R3 at 2. Apparently Dauksch had not yet joined in the representation because he required full payment of a retainer fee prior to taking Zangwill\u2019s case. Rl-45 at 2. When Zangwill\u2019s counsel mentioned the prospect of delaying the trial so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>accommodate the addition of Dauksch as counsel, Judge Presnell advised that Zangwill was \u201cwelcome to get whatever counsel she [chose], but it [would] not be a basis for another continuance.\u201d R3 at 3. Due to a scheduling conflict in Judge Presnefl\u2019s calendar, after the status conference adjourned, Zangwill\u2019s case was assigned to a new judge, Patricia C. Fawsett. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4; Rl-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Another status conference occurred on 21 June 2005, this time before Judge Fawsett. At that conference, the parties informed the court that there was a lingering question as to whether Zangwill was going to obtain new counsel. In response, Judge Fawsett advised the parties that she had agreed to preside over Zangwill\u2019s case with the clear understanding that it would be tried in July. R4 at 2. Accordingly, the trial date was set for 14 July 2005. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 5. Judge Fawsett further instructed Zangwill\u2019s counsel to \u201cexplain to [Zangwill] there will not be another continuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">On 5 July 2005, Zangwill, through counsel, filed a second motion to continue the trial, this time seeking a continuance until September. The motion indicated that Dauksch\u2019s retainer fee had now been paid and that he was ready to undertake the representation. Rl-45 at 2-3. However, because the trial was scheduled to commence in \u201ceight working days,\u201d the motion argued that a continuance was needed so that Dauksch could adequately \u201cfamiliarize himself\u2019 with the case. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The motion also indicated that Dauksch had prior commitments that conflicted with a July trial date. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Zangwill\u2019s motion asserted that a September trial date would be a minimal delay, as it was \u201conly six months after arraignment and seven months after indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. The government opposed Zangwill\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The district court denied the motion for a continuance on the day it was filed. Rl46. The order denying the motion observed not only that \u201cdefendant [had] been forewarned that a desire to change counsel [would] not result in a second continuance of the trial,\u201d <em>id., </em>but also that the government had already filed jury instructions in preparation for trial. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the order noted that \u201cthe Court [had] rearranged its schedule to be available to conduct the trial commencing on the date certain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Zangwill\u2019s trial commenced on 14 July 2005, and lasted for five days. <em>See </em>R5; R6; R7; R8; R9. The government called fifteen witnesses, including Zangwill\u2019s alleged co-conspirator, Amoresano, who was transported to Florida from Ohio (where he was serving his sentence). Rl-39. Zangwill did not call any witnesses in her defense. <em>See </em>R7. After the jury convicted Zangwill of all thirty-eight counts, the district court sentenced her to 46 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Rl-84 at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">On appeal, Zangwill argues that the court\u2019s denial of her second motion for a continuance wrongfully deprived her of the counsel of her choosing, thereby violating her rights under the Sixth Amendment. We review a district court\u2019s disposition of requests for trial continuances for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1248 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>221 F.3d 1183, 1189 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">\u201cThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution guarantee that any person brought to trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to assistance of counsel before he or she can be validly convicted and punished by im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>prisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Verderame, </em>51 F.3d 249, 251 (11th Cir.1995). A \u201cnecessary corollary\u201d of the right to counsel is a defendant\u2019s right to have \u201cboth a fair opportunity to be represented by counsel of his own choice and sufficient time within which to prepare a defense.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1248 (quoting <em>Gandy v. Alabama, </em>569 F.2d 1318, 1321-22 (5th Cir.1978)). In some cases, a trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance request \u201cmay be so arbitrary and so fundamentally unfair\u201d as to amount to a wrongful deprivation of the due process right to counsel. <em>Gandy, </em>569 F.2d at 1323.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">\u201cHowever, the Supreme Court has made clear that not every denial of a request for a continuance is a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322; <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589-91, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964). Rather, \u201cthe proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion ... requires a delicate balance between the defendant\u2019s right to adequate representation by counsel of his choice and the general interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1248 (citations omitted). Indeed, in light of the myriad scheduling burdens that a court faces in \u201cassembling the witnesses, lawyers, and jurors at the same place at the same time,\u201d the Supreme Court has counseled that \u201cbroad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1616, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (citations omitted). <em>See also United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2565-66, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) (citations omitted) (recognizing \u201ca trial court\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness and against the demands of its calendar\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">We have enumerated a number of factors that should be considered in determining whether a denial of a continuance impinged upon the defendant\u2019s \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d opportunity to choose counsel, including: \u201c(1) the length of the delay; (2) whether the counsel who becomes unavailable for trial has associates prepared to try the case; (3) whether other continuances have been requested and granted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>(4) the inconvenience to all involved in the trial; (5) whether the requested continuance is for a legitimate reason; and (6) any unique factors.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1248 (citing <em>Bowe, </em>221 F.3d at 1190).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Applying this analysis to the facts of this case, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Zangwill\u2019s motion for a continuance. The proposed continuance would have delayed the trial for a period of approximately a month and a half, which Zangwill characterizes as negligible. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16. However, Zangwill had already succeeded in postponing the trial for a period of two months (from May to July 2005) at the time she made her second continuance request. In addition, as the trial court order\u2019s observed, the first continuance \u2014 in April 2005 \u2014 was purportedly intended to give Zangwill\u2019s then-counsel, Kenny, \u201cadequate time to prepare\u201d a defense in the case. Rl-46. In fact, at the April 14 status conference between the parties, the court directly sought Kenny\u2019s input as to which month he would feel sufficiently prepared to try the case. <em>See </em>R2 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Despite these accommodations, and despite the fact that Zangwill was on notice in April 2005 that her trial was scheduled to begin sometime in July, she appears to have waited a month after the April status conference before she first sought to obtain Dauksch as her replacement counsel. Rl-45 at 2. Moreover, although Zangwill apparently began seeking Dauksch\u2019s representation sometime in May 2005, the court was not advised of this development until mid-June 2005, weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin. Finally, we note that while there were ongoing (and vague) discussions between the parties about the prospect of a continuance based on the addition of Dauksch to the case, a motion to continue the trial on that basis was not ultimately filed until 5 July 2005, just days before her trial. In summary, we agree with the court\u2019s finding that Zangwill had \u201cmore than adequate time to engage counsel.\u201d Rl-46. Even assuming her motives were proper, it seems clear that Zangwill acted in a dilatory manner in attempting to secure Dauksch\u2019s legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Moreover, the denial of Zangwill\u2019s motion must be weighed in light of the inconveniences that would have resulted from an additional delay in Zangwill\u2019s trial. At the time the continuance was sought, the government had obtained a writ and had arranged for the transportation of one witness from a federal penitentiary in Ohio. <em>Id. </em>Jury instructions had already been filed in the case. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the government had prepared and scheduled the testimony of fifteen witnesses, both law enforcement officers and victims, all of whom later testified at Zangwill\u2019s trial. R5; R6; R7. Contrary to Zangwill\u2019s assertions, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 1-3, we conclude that a second continuance would have caused considerable inconvenience to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Furthermore, an additional delay would have caused inconvenience to the court and its docket. In light of the large number of documents and exhibits involved in the case, the court had expressed concern about the administrative challenge of trying Zangwill\u2019s case even before her continuance motion was filed. <em>See </em>R4-103 at 3-4. In scheduling the trial date for July 14, the court indicated to the parties that it had \u201crearranged [the court\u2019s] schedule\u201d to accommodate Zangwill\u2019s four to five day trial. Rl-46. Indeed, Judge Fawsett expressly advised the parties that all of the cases on the court\u2019s docket were being scheduled around Zangwill\u2019s trial. R4-103 at 5. As a final matter, the court directly warned Zangwill \u2014 weeks before her motion was filed \u2014 that it would not grant a second continuance based solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>addition of a new attorney to her case. Rl-46; R4 at 5. <em>See also </em>R3. In applying the six-factor test to the facts of this case, therefore, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying Zangwill\u2019s motion for a continuance, thereby erroneously depriving her of counsel of her choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Nor do our prior precedents governing the denial of continuances lend support to Zangwill\u2019s erroneous deprivation claim. Zangwill\u2019s claim falls short of the egregious due process deprivation that was found in <em>Gandy. </em>In <em>Gandy, </em>the defendant\u2019s continuance motion was denied after his attorney \u201csuddenly] and abruptly]\u201d abandoned him on the very day his trial was scheduled to begin, <em>United States v. Barrentine, </em>591 F.2d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1979), leaving him with replacement counsel who \u201chad no relation to the case.\u201d <em>Gandy, </em>569 F.2d at 1320. There we found that the court\u2019s harsh denial of the continuance motion constituted \u201can insensitive acquiescence in the [attorney\u2019s] desertion\u201d of his client, and concluded that the denial had thus violated the defendant\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 1326-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The facts of this appeal are much more analogous to the unsuccessful denial of continuance claim found in <em>Barrentine, </em>where the defendants were aware of the case against them for months; they discovered a conflict in their attorney\u2019s schedule shortly after they sought to retain him; and they had already been advised of the court\u2019s position that the trial would go forward with or without their new counsel. 591 F.2d at 1074-75. As in <em>Barrentine, </em>in this case Zangwill failed to make proper arrangements to obtain Dauksch in a prompt manner, and then took a gamble by \u201cwaiting until the eleventh (or at least the tenth) hour to seek a solution\u201d to the problem of her legal representation. <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1252. <em>See also id. </em>(finding that defendant was aware of his desired counsel\u2019s unavailability for a long time, but that he failed to take steps to procure replacement counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">In summary, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of Zangwill\u2019s motion for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion by the court and thereby erroneously deprived her of her constitutional rights. The court weighed the competing interests at stake, and concluded that an additional delay in the interests of accommodating Zangwill\u2019s new counsel, Dauksch, was outweighed by the inconvenience to the government and the burden on the court. We cannot say that this determination was so arbitrary and fundamentally unfair as to violate Zangwill\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. As the Supreme Court has stated in assessing these constitutional challenges: \u201cThese matters are, of course, arguable, and other judges in other courts might well grant a continuance in these circumstances. But the fact that something is arguable does not make it unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Ungar, </em>376 U.S. at 591, 84 S.Ct. at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Appellant Zangwill appealed to this court, arguing that the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion, and that the court\u2019s action thereby improperly prevented her from obtaining the counsel of her choice as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Upon a careful review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court erroneously deprived her of counsel of her choosing. Accordingly, Zangwill\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. The parties stayed a decision on this appeal pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. </em>Gonzalez-Lopez, -U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). That case established that \"[w]here the right to be assisted by counsel of one's choice is wrongly denied ... it is unnecessary to conduct an [ineffective assistance of counsel] inquiry or a prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2563. Put another way, the Court stated that a Sixth Amendment violation occurs the moment one\u2019s choice of counsel is erroneously deprived; no additional showing of \"prejudice\u201d to the defendant at trial is required. <em>Id. </em>Zangwill argues that this decision bolsters her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">However, both parties in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>had conceded on appeal that the trial court had erroneously deprived the defendant of his right to counsel of his choosing. <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2561. Thus the sole legal issue before the Supreme Court was what level of trial prejudice \u2014 if any \u2014 needed to be shown once it was determined that an erroneous deprivation of one\u2019s counsel had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2562-64. In order for the automatic rule of <em>Gonzalez-Lopez to </em>apply, in other words, it must first be shown that the trial court \"wrongly\u201d or \"erroneously\u201d denied the defendant his choice of counsel. <em>Accord United States v. Hickey, </em>No. 97-0218, slip op. at 14, 2006 WL 1867708 (N.D.Cal. July 6, 2006). Here, the issue before us is whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Zangwill\u2019s continuance motion was so unfair and arbitrary as to constitute an \"erroneous\u201d deprivation of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Because we hold that it was not, <em>Gonzalez-Lopez\u2019s </em>rule is inapplicable to Zangwill\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
