He argues that the district court erred by denying him an offense level reduction based on his acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-18\">This court has previously rejected the argument that because a defendant meets other criteria for acceptance of responsibility he is entitled to a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction despite his use of illicit drugs while on release. <em>See United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rickett, </em>89 F.3d 224, 227 (5th Cir.1996). In this case, the district court\u2019s ruling was based on Henry\u2019s continued drug use, as evidenced by urine test results. Additionally, the district court found that Henry\u2019s denials regarding his continued drug use were not credible. Given these facts, it cannot be said that the district court\u2019s ruling is without foundation. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
