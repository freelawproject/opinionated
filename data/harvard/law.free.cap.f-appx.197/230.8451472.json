Tucker filed this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) petition for habeas corpus relief against the United States, challenging the district court\u2019s decision to delay a hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243(c) (2000) until Tucker\u2019s release from state custody. As the judge below noted, the district court\u2019s decision to so delay the \u00a7 4243(c) hearing was affirmed by this court in <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>153 Fed. Appx. 173 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 05-4336). Nothing has changed in the interim to affect that decision. Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Tucker\u2019s petition, and we affirm that decision. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-27\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
