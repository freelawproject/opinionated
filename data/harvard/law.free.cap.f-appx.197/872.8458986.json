Williams, a federal prisoner, appeals <em>pro se </em>the dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, on grounds that the district court erred by finding that he failed to raise a constitutionally cognizable claim. Williams filed his instant petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996); therefore, the provisions of that act govern his appeal. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Williams, a federal prisoner who was convicted and sentenced to 86 months\u2019 imprisonment in the Eastern District of Virginia for 12 counts of wire fraud, 2 counts of identity theft, and one count of false use of a social security number, filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2241 petition. In his petition, Williams claimed that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was illegally collecting money from him and had illegally established a payment schedule in violation of <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir. 2002). In support, Williams filed a memorandum in which he argued that, as part of his sentence, the district court had ordered him to pay a special assessment of $1500 and restitution under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) in the amount of $186,942.58. He stated that the court\u2019s order required him to pay no less than $200 per month beginning 60 days after he was placed on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">Williams argued that the BOP was illegally collecting his money because (1) he had not been released from prison, and (2) the BOP had set its own schedule, both of which were in violation of the district court\u2019s payment schedule. Subsequently, Williams filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the BOP from collecting his money during the pendency of his \u00a7 2241 proceedings. Williams argued that he had been \u201ccoerced\u201d into participation in the BOP\u2019s \u201cInmate Financial Responsibility Program\u201d (IFRP) and requested that the BOP be enjoined from using it.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">In support, Williams filed an affidavit in which he stated that the BOP falsely claimed that participation in the IFRP was voluntary. He further argued that the BOP was taking 50% of his wages every month and he lived under the threat of \u201cFRP Refusal Status\u201d if he stopped participating. Williams claimed that the BOP had never been designated as a \u201ccollection agency\u201d and was arbitrarily waiving certain inmates\u2019 orders of restitution. Williams further claimed that, if he chose not to participate in the IFRP, he would suffer consequences, including a heightened custody level and lesser pay status. He argued that such consequences for choosing not to participate in the IFRP violated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution because they constituted additional punishment not imposed by the district court. Lastly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Williams provided examples of how the rigid application of IFRP Program Statement 5380.07 caused arbitrary results to different inmates that had the ultimate effect of changing an inmate\u2019s status to \u201cFRP Refusal Status\u201d and subjecting him to a higher security level and other consequences. Ultimately, Williams\u2019s core objection was that the application of 5380.07 was arbitrary and it was \u201cnearly impossible for an inmate to consistently comply with the program ... because the payment schedule is set without any regard to any unforeseen illness or catastrophic event which regularly occur in the prison environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The BOP responded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the IFRP was a voluntary program that provided certain incentives and benefits for participation and that inmates who chose not to participate or failed to comply with the financial plan agreed upon as part of the IFRP were not extended the same benefits. Thus, the BOP argued that Williams had correctly stated that his failure to participate would result in the loss of some of the benefits he currently enjoyed, but his claim simply did not rise to the level of a Fifth Amendment constitutional claim and should be denied. The district court denied the prehminary injunction after finding that Williams had neither complied with the local rules nor shown a substantial likelihood of success.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In response to Williams\u2019s original complaint, the BOP submitted exhibits, including a copy of a contract Williams signed, in which he agreed to participate in the IFRP and have 50% of his payments from work deducted to satisfy his financial obligations. Williams responded, in part, that the BOP\u2019s reliance on regulations was irrelevant because he was sentenced under the MVRA, which overrode all regulations preceding its enactment. He further argued that there was no evidence that the court wanted him to participate in the IFRP and reiterated his assertion that he only was required to pay $200 per month starting 60 days after his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The BOP later submitted pages six and seven of the district court\u2019s judgment against Williams, showing the monetary penalties and schedule of payments. The district court ordered that payments would be applied first to the assessment and then to the restitution. The court then ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">The special assessment is due in full immediately. If not made immediately, the court authorizes the deduction of appropriate sums from the defendant\u2019s account while in confinement in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Bureau of Prisons.... Any balance that remains unpaid on the special assessment and restitution at the inception of supervision shall be paid by the defendant in installments of not less than $200.00 per month, until paid in full. Said payments shall commence sixty (60) days after release on supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUu\">The following page stated that \u201c[rjestitution is due and payable immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">In response, Williams argued for the first time that the BOP\u2019s regulations and the MVRA were unconstitutional on their face because they imposed an enhancement of punishment in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Prior to the court\u2019s decision, the BOP filed a notice of supplemental authority directing the court to an unpublished opinion by this Court holding that a district court does have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to consider challenges to BOP regulations, but affirming the court\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s claim because the IFRP program was voluntary and the benefits were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>constitutionally guaranteed. See <em>United States v. Warmus, </em>151 Fed.Appx. 783 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The district court subsequently denied Williams\u2019s petition, citing to <em>Warmus </em>and finding that the IFRP was a voluntary program, and, therefore, the BOP\u2019s implementation of it was not a cognizable claim under \u00a7 2241, and Williams appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">On appeal, Williams states that his \u00a7 2241 claim was that the BOP arbitrarily and capriciously coerces inmates to participate in the IFRP under threat of Special Housing Unit placement and a transfer to a higher security facility. He proceeds, however, to state that he is attacking the execution of his sentence and wishes to enforce his actual sentence, which he argues requires a payment schedule of $200 per month 60 days after his release. Williams then argues that the district court did not properly review his petition and that his claim should have been decided under <em>Prouty </em>because the issue raised is identical. He further argues that the Fourth Circuit, where he was sentenced, has similarly held that a district court cannot delegate the final authority to establish the scheduling of restitution payments. Williams argues that <em>Warmus </em>is inapposite because it concerned only a special assessment, not restitution ordered under the MVRA, and <em>Prouty </em>is the case most closely on point. Williams also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court\u2019s order should be vacated under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) because it was fraudulently issued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1294 (2004). While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides the primary post-conviction relief for federal prisoners, it is possible for a federal prisoner to attack his conviction and sentence through \u00a7 2241 as opposed to \u00a7 2255. Moreover, the Supreme Court has permitted federal prisoners to use \u00a7 2241 to challenge BOP regulations categorically excluding a class of prisoners from early release. See <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 236, 121 S.Ct. 714, 720, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001). In an non-binding, unpublished case, we, citing <em>Lopez, </em>approved of \u00a7 2241 as a vehicle for challenging BOP regulations. <em>Warmus, </em>151 Fed.Appx. at 786. Thus, to the extent Williams\u2019s claim is a challenge to the regulations themselves and the manner in which his sentence is being executed, \u00a7 2241 was the proper statute for bringing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">First, to the extent Williams is arguing that the IFRP violates his due process rights, we conclude the argument is meritless. The IFRP was created to encourage \u201ceach sentenced inmate to meet his or her legitimate financial obligations.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.10. The regulations pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>vide that, when an inmate has a financial obligation, including the special assessment and restitution impbsed at sentencing, BOP staff \u201cshall help that inmate develop a financial plan and shall monitor the inmate\u2019s progress in meeting that obligation.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11. The IFRP, however, is a voluntary program with consequences if an inmate chooses not to participate in it, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11(d), and while this Circuit has not yet done so, every circuit to have addressed the IFRP has approved of it and found no due process violations. <em>See Montano-Figueroa v. Crabtree, </em>162 F.3d 548, 549 (9th Cir.1998) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit, in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 case, has further held that a prisoner\u2019s \u201ccompelled participation [in the IFRP] is not punitive because ... it [is] \u2018reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective\u2019 of rehabilitation,\u201d and, therefore, not a violation of due process. <em>Johnpoll v. Thornburgh, </em>898 F.2d 849, 851 (2d Cir.1990). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Second, if Williams is arguing that the district court improperly delegated authority to the BOP, that is a challenge to the judgment and sentence as a whole, and the proper vehicle for challenging it is a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241. <em>Cf. Matheny v. Morrison, </em>307 F.3d 709, 711 (8th Cir.2002) (persuasively holding that a prisoner\u2019s claim that the district court unconstitutionally delegated its powers when imposing sentence was an attack on the validity of the sentence and should be brought under \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Next, Williams also argues that the BOP is not executing his sentence in conformity with the district court\u2019s order, resulting in wages being taken from him. The Supreme Court has stated that, unless a habeas \u201cclaim alleges a lack of jurisdiction or constitutional error, the scope of collateral attack [is] ... limited,\u201d and \u201can error of law does not provide a basis for collateral attack unless the claimed error constituted \u2018a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 185, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2240, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979). The same is true for errors of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 99 S.Ct. at 2241. While <em>Addonizio </em>concerned a \u00a7 2255 challenge to a conviction, the Court has further stated that discretion is implicit in the statutory command that courts \u201cdispose of the matter as law and justice require.\u201d <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 478 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3044 n. 11, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067. As Williams\u2019s challenge to the execution of his sentence under \u00a7 2241 is a non-constitutional challenge, we conclude that he is required to make a strong showing that the manner in which his sentence is being executed is resulting in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Here, we doubt that the BOP is executing Williams\u2019s sentence inappropriately. The court\u2019s sentence directed Williams to immediately pay the special assessment and authorized the BOP to deduct appropriate sums from Williams\u2019s account while in confinement in accordance with the applicable BOP rules and regulations. It further ordered that, if there was any remaining unpaid balance on both the special assessment and restitution at the time of Williams\u2019s release, then Williams would have to pay a minimum of $200 per month beginning 60 days after the inception of his supervised release. The following page indicates that \u201c[restitution is due and payable immediately.\u201d To that end, Williams signed a contract with the BOP to have 50% of his wages earned in prison applied to his two financial obligations \u2014 the assessment and restitution. Given the foregoing, and the fact that restitution was ordered due immediately, we do not think that the BOP is improperly executing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Williams\u2019s sentence in any way. Williams agreed to the program, and contrary to his opinion, the district court\u2019s schedule was not simply $200 per month only after he was placed on supervised release. Instead, the district court ordered immediate payment, with any remaining unpaid balance after Williams\u2019s release to be paid off at $200 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The case that Williams believes supports his claim that the BOP is improperly using the IFRP to execute his sentence, specifically the restitution order, is <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir.2002). In <em>Prouty, </em>we interpreted the MVRA, which provides, in part, that \u201ca restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and in-kind payments.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(3)(A). The MVRA also states that \u201cthe court shall, pursuant to section 3572, specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2). Section 3572 in turn provides that \u201c[i]f the [restitution] order[] permits other than immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(2). Based on that language, we held that \u201cthe MVRA precludes the district court from delegating duties expressly delineated in the statute,\u201d such as the duty to create a schedule for paying restitution. <em>Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1255. The district court in <em>Prouty </em>ordered immediate repayment with an \u201cinformal understanding\u201d that the probation office would set the schedule, and we held that the court\u2019s order did not comply with the MVRA\u2019s requirements that the court set the schedule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">However, as <em>Prouty </em>points out, the MVRA provides that \u201c[i]f the [restitution] order[ ] permits other than immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(2). Therefore, if the restitution order does not permit other than immediate payment, the district court is not required to set the schedule. In <em>Prouty, </em>the intent of the district court was somewhat unclear, and it immediately delegated the repayment schedule to the probation office. <em>Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1254. Here, the court clearly ordered the restitution to be due in full immediately, and, therefore, under the MVRA, was not required to schedule the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Even assuming the court had not contemplated deducting funds for the purposes of paying of restitution, <em>Prouty </em>would not be applicable to the instant case. <em>Prouty </em>was a direct appeal in which the defendant clearly was challenging the district court\u2019s order of restitution as being in violation of the MVRA. From the record in this case, Williams has never directly appealed the court\u2019s actual restitution order. If he believed that the district court violated the MVRA by failing to set a schedule, his first remedy should have been to file a direct appeal, and his failure to raise the issue on direct appeal renders the claim procedurally defaulted. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280-81 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a prisoner procedurally defaulted on his \u00a7 2241 challenge to the district court\u2019s initial calculation of restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Williams\u2019s real claim, however, is that the BOP is improperly executing the district court\u2019s order. Since there is no constitutional violation in the BOP\u2019s actions, and clearly Williams cannot challenge the district court\u2019s entire judgment in this \u00a7 2241 motion, the issue is whether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the BOP\u2019s actions constitute a miscarriage of justice. Williams is required to pay-restitution as part of his judgment, and the BOP\u2019s actions in deducting sums of money to put toward Williams\u2019s financial obligation simply do not result in any miscarriage of justice. If Williams truly believes that prison officials are violating his constitutional rights through their actions, he may file a lawsuit against them seeking damages under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). <em>See Behrens v. Regier, </em>422 F.3d 1255, 1263 n. 15 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We, therefore, conclude that the district court\u2019s order dismissing Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2241 is due to be affirmed because Williams has not stated a cognizable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. This argument was raised for the first time on appeal, and, therefore, we decline to address it. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). Additionally, Williams has not offered any argument regarding his Eighth Amendment claim, either to the district court or in his initial brief, and we will not consider it here. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. Moreover, Williams raised for the first time in his reply brief an argument that his sentence was unconstitutionally vague and an argument that the district court violated its Article III duties. Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief will also not be considered. <em>Bauknight v. Monroe County, Fla., </em>446 F.3d 1327, 1330 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006). Lastly, we note that Williams has made a passing argument that the court's restitution order violated his Sixth Amendment rights in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This argument is merit-less, as we have held that nothing in <em>Booker </em>applies to the MVRA or restitution orders. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.3d 1302, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
