Bookman renews his argument that the district court\u2019s application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), was error because the Government did not prove that his prior burglary-of-a-habitation convictions occurred on different occasions with appropriate documentation, citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The Government concedes the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">We agree that, because the record does not disclose that the sequence of Book-man\u2019s prior convictions was established by Shepard-appropriate material, the ACCA enhancement was error. <em>See United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 279-80 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing. Because we remand for resentencing on the <em>Shepard </em>violation, we do not address the remainder of Bookman\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">JUDGMENT VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
