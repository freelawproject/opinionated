On appeal, Mejia Hernandez argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated when, based on his prior federal conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, the district court enhanced his sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and applied a 16-level Guideline enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(I).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>Mejia Hernandez\u2019s preserved constitutional challenge to his sentence based on the failure of the indictment to allege his prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1604, 164 L.Ed.2d 325 (2006). Mejia Hernandez\u2019s challenge to the 16-level Guideline enhancement is raised for the first time on appeal. He also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court should not have made the finding that his conviction was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because such a finding was analogous to judicial fact-finding about the character of a prior conviction prohibited by <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). These two arguments are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Under this standard of review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If these three conditions are met, we may notice the error only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). In order for an error to be plain, it must be obvious or clear under current law. <em>United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">We find neither error nor plain error. Section 1326(a) establishes a two-year maximum sentence for aliens who illegally re-enter the United States after being deported. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2), however, if an alien\u2019s initial removal was subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, the statutory maximum increases to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the United States Supreme Court held that the aggravated felony conviction required under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was not an element of the offense and, thus, the prior conviction need not be alleged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). Under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>Mejia Hernandez\u2019s prior conviction did not need to be charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order for that conviction to be used to increase his statutory maximum sentence or Guideline range. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2946, 165 L.Ed.2d 976 (2006); <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). As we have repeatedly recognized, <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains the law until it is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1273; <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1316 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Mejia Hernandez\u2019s argument that the district court improperly determined that his prior federal conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) also fails because it was a question of law for the district court to decide. An aggravated felony for the purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) includes \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Whether a prior conviction is an aggravat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ed felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43) is a question of law. <em>Ramsey v. I.N.S., </em>55 F.3d 580, 582 (11th Cir.1995). <em>Shepard </em>is inapposite as the court need only find that Mejia Hernandez had a felony conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Drug trafficking crimes under \u00a7 924(c)(2) include felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). Section 841 criminalizes possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Where the offense involves cocaine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant faces a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of at least 20 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)-(C). Thus, the district court did not err in determining that Mejia Hernandez\u2019s federal conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">In light of the foregoing, we find no error in Mejia Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-20\">.
