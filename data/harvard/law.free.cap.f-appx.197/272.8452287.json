The district court sentenced Bennett to thirty-three months of imprisonment. Bennett\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal but suggesting that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it was greater than necessary to serve the ends of justice. Bennett was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">In sentencing Bennett, the district court considered the properly calculated advisory sentencing guidelines range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). The sentence imposed is within the guideline range and well below the ten-year statutory maximum set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000). Under these circumstances, we find that Bennett\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345-46 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (stating that \u201ca sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
