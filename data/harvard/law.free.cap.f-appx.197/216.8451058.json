The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Smyre that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Smyre failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that the district court dismiss Smyre\u2019s petition as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-26\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir. 1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Smyre has waived appellate review of the district court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s timeliness determination because, despite receiving proper notice, Smyre failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that his petition was time-barred. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
