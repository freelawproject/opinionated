We briefly summarize the events underlying Jennings\u2019 claims, as they bear on our discussion. Erie police stopped Jennings on the evening of July 7, 2000, because his car\u2019s taillights were not working. Jennings provided a false name when asked for identification, and when the name was run through a police computer check, a flag for a suspended driver\u2019s license was discovered. After getting out of the car upon the officers\u2019 request, Jennings immediately fled and was pursued by one of the officers. In the course of the chase, Jennings managed to steal the officer\u2019s revolver, shoot him in the leg, and continue running. Additional officers were called upon to assist in the search for Jennings, including Defendant Terry Dawley who had been off-duty. After over two hours of searching, Dawley and another officer found Jennings. A gun battle ensued, resulting in both Dawley and Jennings receiving five gunshot wounds and a second officer\u2019s finger being shot off. After Jennings had fallen to the ground, Officer Les Fetterman jumped on his back and strug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>gled to handcuff him. Fetterman eventually succeeded in this endeavor, after hitting and kicking Jennings in the head, ribs, and groin. Jennings was arrested and charged with numerous offenses. An Erie County jury convicted Jennings of nearly all of the charges, including the attempted homicide of Dawley, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft of the revolver, and resisting arrest. Jennings\u2019 convictions and sentence were affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In 2002, Jennings filed three lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that his constitutional rights had been violated by Defendants\u2019 actions in the course of his arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Jennings\u2019 complaints under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) were variously granted in part, denied in part, or denied in their entirety by the District Court. Defendants Fetterman and Dawley then filed motions for summary judgment, to which Jennings responded. The District Court granted Fetterman\u2019s motion for summary judgment in part and denied Dawley\u2019s summary judgment motion in its entirety. The District Court then consolidated the cases for trial, ordered the parties to file pretrial statements, and scheduled a pretrial conference. In their pretrial statements, Defendants repeated arguments raised in earlier motions. The court construed these arguments as a motion for reconsideration of its previous orders and proceeded to review and dismiss each of Jennings\u2019 claims. Jennings timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of Jennings\u2019 claims <em>de novo, </em>viewing the underlying facts and all reasonable inferenees therefrom in the light most favorable to Jennings. <em>See Pennsylvania Coal Ass\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>63 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Jennings alleged that Dawley used excessive force by shooting at him while under the influence of alcohol and that Fetterman violated his civil rights by calling Dawley to return to duty even though he knew that Dawley was intoxicated. The District Court determined that these claims were barred as a matter of law by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Under <em>Heck, </em>if a favorable judgment on a \u00a7 1983 damages claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of the plaintiffs conviction or sentence, the claim must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. To succeed on his excessive force claim, Jennings must show that Dawley\u2019s shooting at him was unreasonable in light of the circumstances. <em>See Kopec v. Tate, </em>361 F.3d 772, 776-77 (3d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). The District Court reasoned that Jennings\u2019 attempted homicide conviction necessarily meant that the jury had rejected Jennings\u2019 theory that he had shot at Dawley in self defense. The court further explained that a judgment in favor of Jennings on his excessive force claim would contradict this jury finding and, by logical extension, invalidate the attempted homicide conviction. As Jennings did not demonstrate that this conviction had already been invalidated, we agree with the District Court that Jennings\u2019 claims were barred under <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Jennings next asserts that the Erie Police Department and former police chief Paul DeDionisio deliberately delayed obtaining medical treatment for him for two hours after the gun battle ended. As an arrestee in the custody of government officials, Jennings was required to be given medical care for his wounds. <em>See Monmouth County Corr. Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro, </em>834 F.2d 326, 346 n. 31 (3d Cir.1987). Denial or delay of such care can constitute \u201cdeliberate indifference to a serious medical need,\u201d as proscribed by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>See id. </em>at 346-47. The District Court held that the record evidence showed that Jennings was medically treated at the scene for his injuries, initially by a firefighter whom Fetterman had asked to tend to Jennings, and later by a second ambulance which had been called. As Jennings provided no contradictory evidence, we agree with the District Court that there were no facts demonstrating a \u201cgenuine issue for trial\u201d on the issue of deliberate indifference and that both defendants were entitled to summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Jennings contends that District Attorney Brad Foulk directed the police department not to conduct an internal review of the events leading up to his arrest so that Jennings would be deprived of information beneficial to his defense. We agree with the District Court\u2019s dismissal of this claim, given the state courts\u2019 uncontradicted findings that the purpose of any internal police review would have been to determine whether the police had received enough help in capturing Jennings, not whether there had been any police misconduct. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. Op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Jennings\u2019 final claim is that Defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights by ordering the surgical removal of a bullet from his body without his consent. As the District Court observed, the record shows that Jennings himself sought a court order to have bullets removed from his body due to the pain they were causing. Therefore, there is no factual basis for finding the surgery \u201cunreasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Winston v. Lee, </em>470 U.S. 753, 760, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 84 L.Ed.2d 662 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. Jennings originally filed five lawsuits naming 23 defendants. Two of these suits were previously dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\">. This appeal was originally listed for possible dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Given the extent of the proceedings in the District Court, we find that summary affirmance under LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 is a more appropriate method of disposing of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
