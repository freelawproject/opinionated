He argues that his guilty plea was not voluntary because the district court failed to advise him that his federal sentence would run consecutively to the state sentence he was already serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-23\">Hansen acknowledges that his claim may be foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>234 F.3d 252, 256-57 (5th Cir.2000). Athough <em>Hernandez </em>is not controlling as it involved a different statute under which the district court had discretion whether to impose a consecutive sentence, it is nevertheless instructive. It, along with this court\u2019s prior decisions in <em>United States v. Saldana </em>and <em>Tindall v. United States, </em>establish that a court is not required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 to inform a defendant <em>of </em>the interaction between federal and state sentences, as long as it has advised the defendant of the maximum possible federal sentence. <em>See Saldana, </em>505 F.2d 628, 628 (5th Cir.1974)(per curiam); <em>Tindall, </em>469 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir.1972). Hansen\u2019s argument to the contrary is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
