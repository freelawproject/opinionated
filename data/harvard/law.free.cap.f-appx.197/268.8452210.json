The district court sentenced Con-nor to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004), the district court also held that if the Sentencing Guidelines were determined to be unconstitutional, it would impose the identical sentence under an advisory guideline sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). Connor\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Connor\u2019s trial attorney was ineffective. Connor was given an opportunity to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, and asserts error in the increase of the amount of crack cocaine attributable to him from 50 grams to 150-500 grams. We find Connor\u2019s assertions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">First, Connor\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), in the district court, and not on direct appeal, unless it \u201cconclusively appears\u201d from the record that the defense counsel did not provide effective representation. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). Because it does not conclusively appear from the record that defense counsel here was ineffective, we decline review of this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Connor\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claim of error in the increase of the quantity of drug amount on which he was sentenced was based on his own admissions in his objections to his presentence report and at sentencing. Hence, the claim has no merit on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">While not raised by Connor or his attorney, we find that, although the imposition of Connor\u2019s sentence under the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines was error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-17 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>(2005), in light of the district court\u2019s announcement of an identical alternate sentence, the error was harmless, as it did not affect the selection of Connor\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 266-67 (4th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Aug. 11, 2006 (No. 06-227); <em>United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448, 451-52 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Moreover, we find that the district court properly sentenced Connor in compliance with the mandates of <em>Booker, </em>and Connor\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (sentence imposed within the advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"ArG\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Connor\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. The probation officer calculated a sentencing guideline range applicable to Connor of 262 to 327 months' imprisonment founded on a total offense level of 37 (base offense level of 38 based on responsibility for more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, to which two levels were added for possession of a dangerous weapon and three were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility), and a criminal history category of III. Connor filed objections to the presentence report, contending that the amount of cocaine base reasonably foreseeable to him was at least 150 grams but less than 500 and that his base offense level should be 34, rather than 38, based on the admitted drug quantity. After careful consideration of the facts and evidence, the district court ruled in accordance with the agreement of the parties, adjusted Connor\u2019s offense level to 34 and his criminal history category to III, with an attendant adjusted guideline range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\">.
