Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, the Adels\u2019 former employer, filed a complaint against the Adels with jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Because we are unable to determine whether the parties to this case are in fact of diverse citizenship, we remand the appeal to the district court to determine if jurisdiction exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Although no party to this appeal has raised the question of jurisdiction, \u201cwe are required, even <em>sua sponte, </em>to initiate an inquiry into our subject-matter jurisdiction whenever we become concerned that it may not exist.\u201d <em>Gilchrist v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>390 F.3d 1327, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). In a suit based on diversity of citizenship, the plaintiff is required to allege each party\u2019s citizenship, and the allegations must show that the parties are diverse. <em>Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. Am. Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>600 F.2d 15, 16 (5th Cir.1979). In its complaint, VALIC alleged that it is a corporation \u201corganized pursuant to the laws of Texas and qualified to do business in the State of Florida\u201d and that the Adels are residents of Florida. VALIC did not allege a principal place of business. Because for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, \u201ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1), we cannot determine whether the parties are diverse. We remand this case to the district court, therefore, to determine if jurisdiction exists. On remand, the district court \u201ccan do this by giving the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their defective pleadings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653. Of course, if the amendments show that there is no diversity of citizenship, the district court must dismiss the action.\u201d <em>Am. Motorists Ins., </em>600 F.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
