Because substantial evidence supports the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">On October 31, 2001, East applied for SSI benefits. East alleged that, as of September 30, 2001,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she was disabled due to her physical impairments of back injuries, asthma and seizures, and her mental impairments of bipolar disorder, depression, suicide attempts and a learning disability. The Commissioner denied East\u2019s application initially and upon reconsideration. East then requested and received a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">During the hearing, the ALJ heard testimony from East and from a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). The ALJ also considered East\u2019s extensive medical records and various evaluations completed by both East\u2019s treating sources and consulting doctors and psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">After reviewing the evidence, the ALJ concluded that East was not disabled. The ALJ found that, although East\u2019s asthma, degenerative disc disease and bipolar disorder were severe impairments that precluded East from performing her past relevant work, East retained the residual functional capacity to perform light simple work. Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ found that such light work existed at the national and regional level. The ALJ discounted the credibility of East\u2019s treating physician and treating psychiatrist as well as East\u2019s hearing testimony regarding her subjective complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">The Appeal Counsel denied East\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. East appealed to the district court. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommending that the district court affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Over East\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. East appealed to this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">A. East\u2019s Borderline Personality Disorder Diagnosis</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">East argues that the ALJ erred by failing to consider her borderline personality disorder diagnosis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>East did not list borderline personality disorder as one of her impairments on her application or in any other paperwork she completed during the administrative process. Furthermore, the record contains no evidence of the effect that East\u2019s borderline personality disorder had on her ability to perform basic work activities. She did not describe the effect borderline personality disorder had on her abilities in either her daily living questionnaire or her hearing testimony. None of her doctors completed any paperwork evaluating how East\u2019s borderline personality disorder limited her abilities. Indeed, a description of the symptoms of this mental disorder cannot even be found in the record. Instead, East\u2019s medical records contain brief references to either historical or \u201cby report\u201d borderline personality disorder diagnoses, most of which occurred prior to East\u2019s alleged onset date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, it does not appear from the record that any of East\u2019s treating physicians, after her alleged onset date, independently diagnosed East with borderline personality disorder. Instead, since East\u2019s alleged onset date, her primary diagnoses of mental impairments have been depression and bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">East has the burden to present evidence of her impairments and their severity. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). Although the ALJ must consider all the impairments the claimant alleges in determining whether the claimant is disabled, <em>see Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir.1991), the ALJ need not scour the medical record searching for other impairments that might be disabling, either individually or in combination, that have not been identified by the claimant. Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court committed reversible error in failing to consider East\u2019s borderline personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">B. Treating Physicians\u2019 Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">East also argues that the ALJ erred in rejecting the medical opinions of Dr. Robert Hartmann, M.D., East\u2019s treating psychiatrist, and Dr. Alice House, M.D., East\u2019s treating physician. These treating physicians\u2019 opinions must be given sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>stantial and considerable weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">\u201cThis Court has concluded \u2018good cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). When the ALJ does not give the treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight, the ALJ applies other factors for determining whether a claimant is \u201cdisabled,\u201d such as the length of treatment, the frequency of examination, the nature and extent of the relationship, as well as the supportability of the opinion, its consistency with other evidence and the specialization of the physician. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(2)-(6). If the ALJ does not give a treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight, \u201c[t]he ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, and the failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (requiring the agency to \u201cgive good reasons\u201d for not giving weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The ALJ provided specific \u201cgood cause\u201d reasons for rejecting these opinions. As to Dr. Hartmann, the ALJ explained that she \u201crejected] Dr. Hartman[n]\u2019s conclusions, as they [were] inconsistent with his own treatment notes,\u201d he had only briefly treated East and \u201chis records show improvement in symptoms with medication.\u201d Thus, the ALJ gave specific reasons for her decision to give less weight to Dr. Hartmann\u2019s opinion and considered the factors in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Dr. Hartmann\u2019s opinion are supported by substantial evidence because his opinion was inconsistent with his own treatment notes regarding East. When East\u2019s psychological treatment with Dr. Hartmann began in May 2003, Dr. Hartmann initially noted \u201cmild depression,\u201d and in August 2003 found East to be \u201c[n]ot clearly manic or depressed\u201d despite the fact that she had not been taking her medications for a month and a half. Additionally, East self-reported that her medications had been working in September 2003, yet when Dr. Hartmann assessed East\u2019s ability to work in November 2003, he concluded that she had either seriously limited ability to function or no useful ability to function in all but one (maintain personal appearance) work-related activity. In addition, the progress notes of the staff at the Oconee Center, including Dr. Hartmann, indicate that East\u2019s symptoms improved when she faithfully took her medications. Moreover, based on East\u2019s hearing testimony, Dr. Hartmann had seen East only six times over six months and for only 15 minutes each visit before he completed his medical assessment containing his opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">As to Dr. House, the ALJ expressly noted that she \u201cafforded little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>evidentiary weight to Dr. House\u2019s limitations\u201d because they were \u201cout of proportion to the objective medical findings,\u201d based on Dr. House\u2019s own findings. The ALJ also acknowledged Dr. House\u2019s diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but found it to be non-severe based on the fact that there was \u201clittle evidence in the file to confirm the diagnosis.\u201d These reasons are supported by substantial evidence. While Dr. House concluded in her October 21, 2003 Pain Evaluation that East\u2019s complaints of pain were credible and could prevent her from working, she concluded in her January 15, 2004 Physical Capabilities Evaluation that East\u2019s pain allegations were \u201cgreater than [the] findings\u201d and referred to East\u2019s x-ray report. Notably, January 2002 medical imaging of East\u2019s lumbar spine revealed no subluxation or fracture and only \u201c[e]arly minimal spondylosis\u201d between two vertebra. July 2002 x-rays of East\u2019s lumbar spine and right hip revealed only some disc space narrowing and described East\u2019s complaints as \u201cunexplained clinical symptoms.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Dr. House also noted on her Physical Capabilities Evaluation that East\u2019s fibromyalgia \u201chas no known clinical findings.\u201d Dr. House\u2019s treatment notes indicate that on November 24, 2003, she made an appointment for East with a rheumatologist to follow up on East\u2019s fibromyalgia, but no other medical records documenting the results of that follow up can be found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Thus, the ALJ gave adequate reasons for discrediting both doctors\u2019 opinions, and her reasons were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">C. East\u2019s Subjective Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Finally, East contends that the ALJ erred in finding that East lacked credibility with regard to her physical complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">A three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). The pain standard requires \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In evaluating a claim based on disabling subjective symptoms, the ALJ considers medical findings, a claimant\u2019s statements, statements by the treating physician and evidence of how the pain affects the claimant\u2019s daily activities and ability to work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(a). Furthermore, \u201c[i]f the ALJ decides not to credit a claimant\u2019s testimony as to her pain, he must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so. Failure to articulate the reasons for discrediting subjective pain testimony requires ... that the testimony be accepted as true.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1561-62 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Here, the ALJ concluded that East\u2019s subjective complaints were not credible for the following reasons: (1) tests performed by a number of specialists had been negative; (2) physical examiners had noted that East\u2019s presentation was func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>tional and referred her to psychiatrists for further evaluation; (3) C.L. Coster, D.O., the consulting examiner, strongly suggested that East was faking during an examination to determine her range of motion; (4) East\u2019s degenerative disk disease was mild, and no objective medical evidence supported the degree of pain and limitation East claimed; and (5) although East alleged that she could not afford her prescription medications, she used her children\u2019s child support to buy up to 45 packs of cigarettes per month. These reasons for discrediting East are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Indeed, East does not argue that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Instead, East contends that the ALJ improperly applied the pain standard by failing to address whether East had impairments that could reasonably be expected to produce the type of pain East alleged. We disagree. The ALJ specifically stated that she was required to \u201cconsider all symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which these symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence based on the requirements of 20 CFR \u00a7 416.929 and Social Security Ruling 96-7p.\u201d It is clear from the ALJ\u2019s opinion as a whole that, although East had impairments that could reasonably be expected to produce the <em>type </em>of pain and other symptoms East alleged, the ALJ did not believe East\u2019s testimony as to the <em>seventy of </em>her pain and other symptoms, i.e., their intensity, persistence and functionally limiting effects. <em>See Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1561 (explaining that once an impairment meeting the pain standard is established, the ALJ must consider evidence \u201cabout the intensity, persistence, and functional!y limiting effects of pain or other symptoms\u201d in addition to \u201cthe medical signs and laboratory findings in deciding the issue of disability\u201d); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(c) (\u2018When the medical signs or laboratory findings show that you have a medically determinable impairment(s) that could reasonably be expected to produce your symptoms, such as pain, we must then evaluate the intensity and persistence of your symptoms so that we can determine how your symptoms limit your capacity for work....\u201d). We cannot say that the ALJ misapplied the pain standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s determination that East was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-9\">. East originally alleged an onset date of November 1999, but later amended her onset date to September 30, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-10\">. We review a Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits to determine whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standard was applied. <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance. It is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hale v. Bowen, </em>831 F.2d 1007, 1011 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cIf the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence we must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b925-17\">. East also argues that the ALJ erred in failing to consider the consulting psychologist's report by Dr. Priscilla Wilson. Ph.D. However, any error in failing to address this report explicitly in the ALJ\u2019s determination was harmless given that Dr. Wilson\u2019s observations in the report were consistent with the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (finding harmless ALJ\u2019s mischaracterization of claimant\u2019s past work because the error did not contradict the ALJ\u2019s ultimate findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">East also complains that the ALJ failed explicitly to accept or reject the daily activities questionnaire completed by her mother, Linda Boggs. Because Boggs\u2019s statements in the questionnaire duplicated and corroborated East\u2019s testimony, which the ALJ explicitly found not credible, it is \"obvious\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>ALJ implicitly rejected Boggs's statements. See <em>Tieniber v. Heckler, </em>720 F.2d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.1983) (\"[Tjhis circuit does not require an explicit finding as to credibility,\u201d but rather findings may be by implication if they are \"obvious to the reviewing court\u201d). Because Boggs\u2019s credibility was not critical to the outcome of the case, the lack of an explicit credibility finding as to her questionnaire does not provide a basis for remand. <em>See Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. For example, on October 23, 2001, Dr. Kathleen Klotz, M.D., noted \"1997 Bipolar disorder and personality disorder\u201d in the \"Past Medical History\u201d portion of her treatment notes. After reporting to the emergency room, East was seen by Dr. Klotz for frequent headaches. Dr. Klotz prescribed Imitrex and ordered various tests, including an MRI of East\u2019s brain. In sum, Dr. Klotz was not treating East for any alleged mental impairments, and it does not appear she diagnosed East with borderline personality disorder. Instead, it appears Dr. Klotz was merely noting East's historical diagnosis of borderline personality disorder as reported by East.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Another example appears on an August 10, 2003 referral form, which indicates that East had been referred to the Oconee Center for individual counseling. The form states that the Oconee Center was unable to reach East at the number listed on the referral. They then sent East a letter informing her how to contact them to set up an initial meeting. The \"Diagnoses\u201d section of the referral form lists bipolar disorder under \"Axis I\u201d and borderline personality disorder under \"Axis II.\u201d Given that East had not yet appeared for an initial meeting, this form does not appear to constitute a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder by the staff at the Oconee Center, but merely a report of East\u2019s historical diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. On appeal East also argues that the ALJ erred by failing to recontact Dr. Hartmann or Dr. House pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e) prior to rejecting their opinions. We do not consider this argument, which was not timely raised before either the Appeals Council or the district court. <em>See Stewart v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., 26 </em>F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that issues raised for the first time on appeal are not addressed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">. East argues that the ALJ \"misunderstood\" her back impairment and emphasizes her 1996 MRI, which she contends the ALJ ignored. This MRI, which was performed almost five years before East\u2019s alleged onset date, found a \"disc protrusion with mild resultant spinal stenosis,\u201d but \"no evidence of direct impingement or displacement of adjacent nerve roots.\" Under the circumstances, the ALJ properly concluded that East\u2019s back condition was severe, just not so severe as to preclude her from all types of jobs in a national economy. This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b929-6\">. East also raises a number of other arguments, but they lack merit and do not warrant further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
