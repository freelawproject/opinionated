Raza argues that the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance based on his pending application for labor certification was inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) because it was based on the Government\u2019s objection alone. He further contends that the BIA\u2019s determination that there was no good cause for a continuance because of the uncertainty of his receiving the labor certification or an employment-based immigrant visa was not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-22\">The IJ adopted the Government\u2019s argument that a continuance would have been speculative. Raza\u2019s timely application for labor certification did not constitute good cause for a continuance because the grant of the certification would have been only the first step in a long, discretionary process. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the denial of Raza\u2019s motion for a continuance was supported by the record and was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Patel v. INS, </em>803 F.2d 804, 806 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Raza also argues for the first time in his petition for review that the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance violated his due process rights because he was prevented from pursuing an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). Because Raza has not exhausted his administrative remedies concerning this issue by first raising it before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Raza\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
