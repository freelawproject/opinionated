Aziz appeals the district court\u2019s order adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Aziz v. Central Virginia </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Reg'l Jail, </em>No. CA-04-732-7 (W.D.Va. filed Aug. 12, 2005; entered Aug. 15, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-27\"><em> </em>While Aziz attempted to amend his complaint to name two individual defendants in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the purported amendment was proffered beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the time permitted by the magistrate judge for Aziz to amend his complaint. Because the purported amendment was not considered by the district court, this court\u2019s affirmance is only as to the dismissal of Aziz\u2019s complaint against the Central Virginia Regional Jail. We accordingly have not considered the legal merit, if any, of Aziz's claims against any individuals who may have participated in the incidents that underlie Aziz's complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
