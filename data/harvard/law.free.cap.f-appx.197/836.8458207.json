We affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions but remanded the case with the instruction that the district court make findings of fact as to whether appellant had obstructed justice so to warrant the court\u2019s enhancement of his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>9 F.3d 1559 (11th Cir.1993) (Table). Pursuant to the mandate, the district court entered an order stating the factual basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">On June 27, 2005, appellant moved the district court to \u201cCorrect [his] Final Judgment\u201d pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) contending that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is retroactive and should be applied to his case. The district court denied his motion on the ground that the Supreme Court had not declared <em>Booker </em>to be retroactive and applicable to cases on collateral review; thus, <em>Booker </em>provides appellant with no basis for relief. <em>See </em>Record, Vol. 2 at Tabs 125 and 140. Appellant now appeals. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, as the district court properly held, <em>Booker </em>provides appellant no basis for relief. Second, appellant\u2019s motion constitutes a collateral attack on his sentences and therefore should have been brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-18\">. We intimate no view as to whether appellant would have to petition this court for leave to file a \u00a7 2255 motion because the motion would amount to a second or successive motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
