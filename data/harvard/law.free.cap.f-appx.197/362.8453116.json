He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his prior Oklahoma conviction for indecent, lewd acts with a minor. Rivas-Gonzalez also argues that the sentence may not be upheld as a reasonable sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because we conclude that the alternative 41-month sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we need not determine whether Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s prior Oklahoma conviction for indecent, lewd acts with a minor meets the common-sense definition of sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ments to \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The district court, in the alternative, determined that even without the 16-level enhancement, it would have imposed the same sentence based on the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), including Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s history and characteristics; Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s conduct underlying his prior Oklahoma conviction; the fact that Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s criminal history was underrepresented; Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s seven prior unscored illegal reentries into the United States; and Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s violations of the terms of his prior Oklahoma sentence of probation. The district court considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), as well as Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s personal history as a victim of physical abuse. Because the district court provided detailed, fact-specific reasons for its decision to impose the 41-month sentence based on the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and because the district court did not consider any improper factors, Rivas-Gonzalez has not shown that the alternative sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709-10 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 715-21 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014 (U.S. May 18, 2006)(No. 05-11144).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Rivas-Gonzalez also argues that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence for the charged 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rivas-Gonzalez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in hght of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rivas-Gonzalez concedes that his argument is foreclosed in fight of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
