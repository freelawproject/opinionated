On motion from the respondent, the district court transferred the case to this court pursuant to the Real ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13,119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005). The matter is now construed as a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) (Supp.2005); <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 735-36 (5th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1055,163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">Carreon was ordered removed because of a Texas state conviction for an aggravated felony, namely unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (UUMV). Carreon then sought a discretionary waiver of removability under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 212(e). The BIA determined that Carreon was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because he failed to establish a comparable ground for inadmissibility as required to obtain a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">Carreon asserts that the only issue on appeal is whether his UUMV conviction is a crime of violence for immigration purposes. We must raise the issue of our appellate jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d), this court may review a petition only if, inter alia, the alien has exhausted all of his administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). An alien\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the BIA, either on direct review or in a motion to reopen, serves as a jurisdictional bar to this court\u2019s consideration of the issue. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">Carreon argued before the BIA only that he was eligible for discretionary relief from removal under \u00a7 212(c) because his UUMV offense was a theft offense and a ciime involving moral turpitude, thereby establishing a corresponding ground for inadmissibility. The BIA held that UUMV is not a crime involving moral turpitude and expressly noted that Carreon did not contest his removability. Carreon did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>argue the theory that his UUMV offense was not a crime of violence subjecting him to removal for conviction of an aggravated felony. Because Carreon did not raise his theory before the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it on appeal. <em>See Wang, </em>260 F.3d at 452-53; \u00a7 1252(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
