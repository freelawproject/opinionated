Gareia-Salazar argues that the district court erred by basing his sentence, which was above the pertinent guidelines range, on facts that were not admitted or established beyond a reasonable doubt. Gareia-Salazar farther contends that the district court failed to give proper consideration to the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Garcia-Salazar\u2019s argument concerning factual findings is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 797-98 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006). Garcia-Salazar\u2019s claim concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is refuted by the record, which reflects that the district court gave proper consideration to these factors when sentencing Gareia-Salazar. Garcia-Salazar has not shown that the district court abused its discretion at sentencing, nor has he shown that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006). Garcia-Salazar\u2019s argument concerning his rights under the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses is, as he concedes, unavailing. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-76 (5th Cir.2005). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
