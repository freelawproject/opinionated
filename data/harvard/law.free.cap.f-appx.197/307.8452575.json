Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">The district court dismissed Lauer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint after determining that (1) Lauer had a history of abuse of the court, (2) the Western District of Texas had barred Lauer from filing any new lawsuits without obtaining leave of court, (3) General Order 94-6 of the Eastern District of Texas specified that the court would honor sanctions imposed by another Texas federal court, and (4) Lauer had not informed the court of the sanction order prior to filing his suit. The district court did not err in certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith or in dismissing Lauer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>See Balawajder v. Scott, </em>160 F.3d 1066, 1068 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">As Lauer has not shown that his appeal will present legal points arguable on their merits, we deny his motion for leave to proceed IFP, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Lauer previously accumulated two \u00a7 1915(g) strikes. <em>See Lauer v. Treon, </em>82 Fed.Appx. 948 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Lauer is now barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from bringing a civil action or an appeal from a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under \u00a7 1915 unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
