To obtain habeas relief, Babb must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ... or ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). This standard requires the application of federal law \u201cto be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 124 S.Ct. 1, 4, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). An unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs when the \u201cstate court identifies the correct governing legal rule from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the [petitioner\u2019s] case,\u201d or \u201ceither unreasonably extends a legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1520, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">In this case, the Florida courts correctly identified <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), as the Supreme Court decision providing controlling legal authority for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. To prevail on such a claim, \u201cpetitioner must prove both incompetence and prejudice by showing that (1) \u2018counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u2019 and (2) \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zakrzewski v. McDonough, </em>455 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">When reviewing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court\u2019s role \u201cis not to grade counsel\u2019s performance\u201d; instead, our role is to conduct an objective inquiry and determine whether \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>[was] \u2018reasonable[ ] under prevailing professional norms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1313 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065). Therefore, \u201c[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065). \u201cCourts must indulge the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and that counsel made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cThus, counsel cannot be adjudged incompetent for performing in a particular way in a case, as long as the approach taken \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2474, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)). To overcome the strong presumption in favor of competence, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing \u201cthat no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Babb argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, because Farrar did not strike Edwards from Babb\u2019s jury after Edwards indicated during <em>voir dire </em>that, eight years earlier, she or someone close to her had experienced sexual and physical abuse and that she might not be able to be fair and impartial. Babb asserts that Farrar\u2019s decision to leave Edwards on the jury was not objectively reasonable; and he was prejudiced by that decision because Edwards\u2019s presence on the jury could have influenced other jurors. In addition, Babb contends that, even if Farrar made a tactical decision to keep Edwards on the jury, allowing a biased juror to serve on a jury is <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">At an evidentiary hearing held on Babb\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, Farrar testified that it was his usual practice to engage his clients in jury selection and that he believed he did so with Babb. Farrar also reviewed his <em>voir dire </em>worksheet and the transcript of the <em>voir dire </em>proceedings and testified that he wanted a jury with many independent thinkers in Babb\u2019s case. In addition, Farrar testified that he considered Edwards\u2019s previous service on a hung jury to be significant. Farrar also stated that, although he noted on his <em>voir dire </em>seating chart that Edwards was a victim \u2014 given the general jury pool in Babb\u2019s case Edwards \u2014 may have fallen within the acceptable range.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Given the strong presumption that Farrar\u2019s conduct was reasonable, Babb has failed to establish that Farrar\u2019s failure to strike Edwards from the jury was an act that no competent counsel would have taken. <em>See Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1314-15. Therefore, we conclude that the state court\u2019s decision \u2014 that Babb\u2019s counsel was not deficient \u2014 did not involve an objectively unreasonable application of federal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even though the state court noted that the logic of Farrar\u2019s decision was debatable, the evidence in the record does not support a finding that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>And the Supreme Court has not concluded that a lawyer who leaves an arguably biased juror on a jury is <em>per se </em>ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">To the extent that Babb contends that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>facts in light of the evidence presented,\u201d Babb has not met his burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the state court\u2019s factual finding \u2014 that Farrar made a strategic decision in keeping Edwards on the jury \u2014 was incorrect. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (e)(1). A state court\u2019s determinations of fact are \u201cpresumed to be correct\u201d; and Babb does not present evidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, that the state court\u2019s decision in this case was based on an unreasonable factual determination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Therefore, we affirm the denial of Babb\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-10\">. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (the \"AEDPA\") governs this case because Babb filed his section 2254 petition after the AEDPA's effective date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-11\">. On appeal Babb offers argument on issues beyond the scope of his COA. Because we previously denied Babb\u2019s motion to expand his COA, we decline to consider these arguments. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (explaining that under the AEDPA, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in petitioner's COA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b911-6\">. Because Babb did not establish that Farrar was deficient, it is not necessary for us to address whether Babb was prejudiced by Farrar\u2019s representation. <em>See Bottoson v. Moore, </em>234 F.3d 526, 532 (11th Cir.2000) (\"It is well established that a habeas petitioner must demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice, and that a failure with respect to either prong constitutes a failure to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
