Stats., art. 2875.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The fraud consisted in taking a decree of foreclosure on that part of\" one of the tracts which constituted defendant\u2019s homestead, when the mortgage had been corrected by a release placed on record as soon as the-, mistake was discovered; but the application for injunction was not delayed in consequence of any act, decree, or promise made at the time of\" or after rendition of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The defendant had been cited to appear before the decree was entered,, and the citation advised him that foreclosure of mortgage on these tracts-of land was prayed for; but he had no reason to believe that plaintiff was asking foreclosure on the entire tract of which his homestead was a part after the mortgage covering that by mistake had been corrected by release.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Such a decree, however, was entered, and no act was done at that time- or subsequently to induce him to believe that the decree would not be-enforced. The statute which excuses the failure to apply for injunction, within one year has in contemplation some act, other than the mere taking of a judgment that ought not to be taken, by which a party is-caused to delay making application; and no such acts appearing, we are of opinion that Lumpkin\u2019s right to Writ of injunction was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">While right to that specific relief was barred, it does not follow that, any other lawful relief not barred might not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Lumpkin sought a reformation of the judgment, so as to exclude his homestead from its operation; that he was clearly entitled to under the-facts shown, and right to such relief was not barred. The injunction ought to have been dissolved; but if it had been, no benefit would thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>have resulted to the holder of the judgment of which reformation was sought, unless some person could be found who would buy the property in controversy subject to the right of Lumpkin as it might be declared in the pending litigation.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b669-6\">Delivered April 30, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The result reached by the Court of Civil Appeals is correct, and application for writ of error will be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
