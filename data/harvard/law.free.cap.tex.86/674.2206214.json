Where there is only one attachment, there can be but one demand, and it is sufficient for the court to ascertain and render judgment for the amount of that demand, without specifying it, eo nomine, as plaintiff\u2019s demand; and when this amount exceeds the bond, then judgment should be rendered for the amount of said bond.
