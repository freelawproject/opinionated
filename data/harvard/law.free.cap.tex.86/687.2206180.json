Levy was made by him with the primary intent of placing such property in such position that it could not be levied on by his creditors, such intent would render the transfer fraudulent and void as to plaintiffs.\u201d This was not exactty the charge requested and refused, but it did embrace the same propositions.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b715-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Delivered May 24, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">If the word \u201cintent\u201d be restricted to the maker of the mortgage, then the charge should not have been given; but if it be applied to him and to the accepting creditor, then it was correct, and should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The moving or primary purpose of a debtor in paying to a creditor a debt by conveying to him property, or in mortgaging property to secure a debt due to him, may be to prevent some other creditor from subjecting it to the payment of a sum due to him; but this, within the meaning of the law, will not render the conveyance or mortgage fraudulent as to such creditor, if his purpose is solely to have payment or security for the sum actually due.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">As said in Ellis v. Valentine, 65 Texas, 547, \u201c What it is lawful to do can not become unlawful by reason of the fact that it is done through a motive or with an intent not friendly to all creditors; a hindrance or delay which does not operate as a fraud upon other creditors is not that prohibited by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">To have made the mortgage in question fraudulent, the secured creditor must have had some purpose other than the security and payment of the sum due. He may have known that the debtor would not have given him the security but for a desire even to defeat some other creditor in the collection of sum due him, but this would not render it unlawful for him to take security for payment of sum due.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">If the real purpose of the creditor was not such a lawful purpose, but was to tie up the property by a mortgage, in form, to the injury of other creditors, or some like purpose on his part, then the mortgage would be fraudulent as to other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">It is to be regretted that the unguarded language used in the former opinion may have led to a misapprehension of the rules of law applicable to such a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The opinion now in question presents correctly the law applicable to the question on which writ of error is asked, although we might not be able to concur in some of the reasoning through which the conclusion was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The motion for rehearing on application for writ of error will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Justice Gaines not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
