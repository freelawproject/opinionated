Zloch, Magistrate Judge Charlene H. Sorrentino, and Assistant United States Attorney Terrence J. Thompson (collectively referred to as \u201cDefendants\u201d), and denial of his motion to reopen or reconsider, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). On appeal, Simmons concedes that he qualifies for the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g), which prohibits the grant of <em>in forma pauperis </em>status to him. However, he asserts that \u00a7 1915(b)(4) carves out an \u201cindigent prisoner\u201d exception to the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision and allows him to pay the filing fee over time after filing his complaint through withdrawals from his prisoner account.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-24\">\u2018We review the interpretation of the filing fee provision of the PLRA [Prison Litigation Reform Act] <em>de novo.\u201d Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir. 2004). We \u201creview the denial of [a] motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Cliff v. Payco General American Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2004). A motion for reconsideration filed within 10 days of the judgment it seeks to reopen is properly designated as filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <em>See Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1178 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). When a district court rules upon a timely filed Rule 59(e) motion, both its ruling on the motion and the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>derlying judgment are appealable to this Court. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 402-403, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1547-48, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision of the PLRA provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). \u201cAfter the third meritless suit, the prisoner must pay the full filing fee <em>at the time he initiates suit.\u2019\u2019 Dupree v. Palmer, </em>284 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">[T]he proper procedure is for the district court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice when it denies the prisoner leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>pursuant to the three strikes provision of \u00a7 1915(g). The prisoner cannot simply pay the filing fee after being denied <em>informa pauperis </em>status. He must pay the filing fee at the time he <em>initiates </em>the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Section 1915(b)(4) provides \u201c[i]n no event shall a prisoner be prohibited from bringing a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment for the reason that the prisoner has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(4). The Fifth Circuit has held that \u201c[sjection 1915(b)(4) pertains to the initial partial filing fee requirement of \u00a7 1915(b)(1). Moreover, it is subject to the \u2018three strikes\u2019 rule of \u00a7 1915(g), which applies to \u00a7 1915 as a whole.\u201d <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Center, </em>136 F.3d 458, 464-65 (5th Cir. 1998). We have held that \u201c[t]he <em>only </em>exception to section 1915(g) is if the frequent filer prisoner is \u2018under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rivera v. Allin, </em>144 F.3d 719, 723 (11th Cir.1998) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">The district court did not err by denying Simmons\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissing his complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), nor did it abuse its discretion by denying his motion to reopen or reconsider. Simmons concedes that he qualifies for the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g). There is no evidence in the record that Simmons paid the filing fee at the time he initiated the suit or that he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. Therefore, the district court properly denied him <em>in forma pauperis </em>status and dismissed his complaint. <em>Dupree, </em>284 F.3d at 1236. Simmons\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1915(b)(4) allows him to avoid \u00a7 1915(g) or pay the filing fee in installments after filing a complaint is without merit. <em>See Patton, </em>136 F.3d at 464-65. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to reopen or reconsider the case, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
