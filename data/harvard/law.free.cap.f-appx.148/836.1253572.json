We VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">A federal grand jury indicted Vargas-Vasquez on one count of unlawfully attempting to enter the United States after previously having been deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty to the charge. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s base offense level as eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Because Vargas-Vasquez previously had been deported for a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence exceeded thirteen months, he received a 16-level increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). He also received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s total offense level was 21, and his criminal history category was III. Accordingly, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 46 to 57 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel filed two written objections to the PSI that are relevant here. First, his counsel objected to the use of Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s prior drug trafficking convictions to establish his maximum sentence and guideline range. Specifically, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel argued that Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s indictment did not allege that his previous deportation was subsequent to a conviction for a drug trafficking offense resulting in a sentence of 13 months or more, and that Vargas-Vasquez was charged with violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), which imposes a maximum penalty of two years, not with the \u201cdistinct, aggravated crime set forth separately in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).\u201d R1-18 at 8. His counsel contended that the indictment referenced \u00a7 1326(b)(2) but failed to contain the elements of that offense. Accordingly, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel argued that the district court could not impose permissibly a sentence in excess of two years because Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s offense of conviction carried that maximum. Although conceding that the Supreme Court, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), had previously rejected his argument, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel contended that the Supreme Court recently has called into question its holding in that case. Second, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel argued that, based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court could not consider Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s two prior drug convictions in calculating either his offense level or his criminal history category because they were not alleged in the indictment, admitted in his guilty plea, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">At the sentencing hearing, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel raised one objection relevant here. He objected to the use of Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s prior convictions both to establish his offense level and to establish the criminal history category because they were neither charged in the indictment nor admitted by Vargas-Vasquez. Citing <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>(11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004), the district court overruled Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Noting that, prior to \u201c9/11,\u201d \u201cthe government used to exercise discretion in deciding who[m] to prosecute for illegal reentry,\u201d the district court stated that it \u201cwish[ed] the executive branch would go back to exercising some discretion.\u201d R3 at 20. The district court then stated that it intended to impose a sentence \u201cat the bottom of the Guideline range,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, and sentenced Vargas-Vasquez to 41 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On appeal, Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel contends on his behalf that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, the government concedes that the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error and that this case should be remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Because Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s counsel objected to the district court\u2019s use of Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s convictions to enhance his sentence, when they were neither charged in the indictment nor admitted by Vargas-Vasquez, Vargas-Vasquez preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim. Thus, we review his <em>Booker </em>claim to determine whether any error was harmless. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">In this case, the government cannot show that the district court\u2019s statutory sentencing error, under <em>Booker, </em>did not affect Vargas-Vasquez\u2019s sentence. Thus, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Because the government cannot meet its burden of proving that the district court\u2019s statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\">. Additionally, Vargas-Vasquez avers that <em>Booker </em>overruled our holding in <em>Marseille </em>that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is still binding Supreme Court precedent. <em>Marseille, </em>377 F.3d at 1257. This argument has no merit. In <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>a case decided after <em>Booker, </em>we noted that we must continue to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. 410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
