Because Bailey\u2019s motion did not assert a defect in the collateral review process itself, but rather reargued the merits of his \u00a7 2255 motion based on new case law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>motion was properly characterized a successive \u00a7 2255 motion under our decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.2003). To appeal an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas action, Bailey must establish entitlement to a certificate of appealability. <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368 (4th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Bailey has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">To the extent that Bailey\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. We further deny Bailey\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, motions to appoint CJA counsel, and motion for release. We deny as moot his motion to expedite the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
