See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b212-20\">Ronnie Clark pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute approximately twenty-eight grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000), and possession of thirty firearms by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). The district court sentenced Clark as an armed career criminal to a total sentence of 200 months of imprisonment. Clark appeals his sentence, asserting that the district court erred by sentencing him as an armed career criminal. The Government asserts that Clark validly waived the right to appeal his sentence in the plea agreement. We agree with the Government and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir.2000). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53-54 (4th Cir. 1990). A waiver of appeal does not prohibit the appeal of a sentence imposed in excess of the statutory maximum, a sentence based on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race, <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992), or proceedings conducted in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel following the entry of the guilty plea. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 732-33 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">Clark does not challenge the voluntariness of the waiver of his right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 169-73 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>agreement waiver of right to appeal that district court accepted prior to Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not invalidated by change in law effected by that decision). Moreover, contrary to Clark\u2019s assertion, the issue raised on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 169 n. 7 (concluding that \u201cthe [Supreme] Court\u2019s use of the term \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 in <em>Blakely [v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) ] and <em>Booker </em>does not alter the meaning of the language in the appeal waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
