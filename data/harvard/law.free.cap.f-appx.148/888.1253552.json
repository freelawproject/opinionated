The government gave notice that Snyder was subject to an enhanced ten-year mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on his prior conviction for possession of cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1), 851. Snyder challenged the enhanced mandatory minimum, alleging that \u00a7 851 violated the Sixth Amendment in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">At sentencing, the court determined that <em>Blakely </em>did not require the government to plead prior convictions in the indictment or prove them to a jury, and sentenced Snyder to 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">On appeal, Snyder challenges the use of his prior conviction to enhance his sentence, and he questions the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>He concedes, however, that this court has rejected his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal sentencing guidelines and that in a mandatory guidelines regime, the Sixth Amendment required that any fact that increased a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the maximum sentence authorized by the facts established by a plea or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">Because Snyder preserved his <em>Booker </em>challenge in the district court, we review the sentences de novo. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law that we also review de novo. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>111 F.3d 101, 101 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">We conclude that there is no merit to Snyder\u2019s argument. An enhancement based on a prior conviction, even if not admitted by the defendant or proved to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>jury, does not represent a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), does not alter this conclusion. <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d at 1290 n. 3. Moreover, <em>Booker </em>had no effect on the validity of mandatory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-15\">.
