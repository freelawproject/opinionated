No. 11670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89, <em>reprinted in </em>51 Fed. Reg. 10494 (Mar. 26, 1986), and its implementing legislation, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 11601-11611 (West 1995 &amp; Supp.2005). Because the record before this court fails to adequately demonstrate whether Katona established a wrongful removal or whether his former wife, Magdolna Kovacs, has an adequate defense to the petition, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-20\">A petitioner who claims a child has been wrongfully removed may bring a petition for an order of return in any federal dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>trict court or state court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11603(a), (b) (2000). In reviewing such a petition under the Convention, the court\u2019s inquiry is limited only to the merits of the abduction claim; the merits of the underlying custody dispute are not considered. <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>240 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir.2001). This court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions, whether domestic, foreign, or international, de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">To prevail on a petition for return of a child in a child abduction case under the Convention, a petitioner must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the child was \u201chabitually resident\u201d in the country from which he or she was taken at the time of the removal; (2) the removal was in violation of the petitioner\u2019s custody rights under the law of the country where the child was \u201chabitually resident;\u201d and (3) the petitioner had been exercising those rights at the time of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 398 (citing Hague Convention, art. 3). Once a petitioner establishes these criteria, the child must be returned unless the respondent can show by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) returning the child would expose him to grave risk of physical or psychological harm or place him in an intolerable situation; (2) return of the child would be barred by fundamental American principles concerning the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; (3) the action was not commenced within a year of the abduction and the child is now well-settled in the new location; or (4) the petitioner was not exercising custody rights at the time of the removal or had agreed to the removal. Id. at 398-99 (citing Hague Convention, arts. 12, 13a, 13b, 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It is undisputed that the parties\u2019 minor children were habitual residents of Hungary. Documentation presented to the district court by Kovacs demonstrated that Katona was entitled to visitation with the children on a regular basis. Kovacs also conceded that Katona was exercising his right of visitation at the time of the removal. However, the Convention distinguishes custody from rights of access or visitation. Article 5 of the Convention defines rights of custody to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d In contrast, \u201c \u2018rights of access\u2019 ... include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s habitual residence.\u201d While the remedy for violating rights of custody requires the child\u2019s return to the country of habitual residence, the remedies for violating rights of access are less drastic, such as \u201cordering that the custodial parent who removed the child from the child\u2019s habitual residence reimburse the other parent for expenses incurred in exercising his or her rights of access.\u201d <em>Whallon v. Lynn, </em>230 F.3d 450, 455 n. 3 (1st Cir.2000) (citing Hague Convention, art. 26). The record before us is unclear with regard to whether Katona has a right of custody or a right of access. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings to determine the nature of Katona\u2019s custodial rights in the context of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Should the district court determine Katona to have rights of custody, the record should be further developed with regard to whether Kovacs can prevail on a defense that returning the children would expose them to grave risk of physical or psychological harm or place them in an intolerable situation. The court should not rely on testimony that is clearly part of the underlying custody dispute and not properly considered in the context of Katona\u2019s petition. <em>See Miller, </em>240 F.3d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Should the court determine from the evidence that Katona has only a right of access, it should craft a remedy within the context of the Convention to ensure Katona can exercise that right. <em>See Whallow, </em>230 F.3d at 455 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Finally, we have found nothing to support the district court\u2019s application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel to the Convention. <em>See, e.g., Holder v. Holder, </em>305 F.3d 854, 871-72 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting equitable estoppel defense). While a number of courts have extended the one-year limitation period in situations where the abducting parent succeeded in concealing the location of the child beyond the one-year limit, <em>see, e.g., Bocquet v. Ouzid, </em>225 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1348-49 (S.D.Fla. 2002) (extending limitations period), we have found no cases that reduce the time frame in which a parent must act under the Convention. Indeed, to do so appears to directly conflict with the intent of the Convention\u2019s drafters who adopted a one-year limitation. Accordingly, the district court shall not apply equitable estoppel on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
