Kamensky appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against Hillsborough County, Florida, and Rogelio Dean, her former employer and supervisor, respectively, whom she alleged retaliated against her for exercising her First Amendment right to freedom of speech. After de novo review, we conclude the district court did not err and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-17\">Kamensky alleged she was terminated because she expressed concerns about the propriety of a trip to Boston to view a proposed vendor\u2019s facilities. Kamensky asserts the district court erred in: (1) overlooking evidence showing any review of Dean\u2019s decision to reclassify her position and ultimately terminate her was merely a \u201crubber stamp,\u201d thus permitting a reasonable factfinder to impose liability on Hills-borough County and on Dean, in his individual capacity; and (2) determining there was insufficient evidence to create a jury question as to whether her speech played a substantial part in her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-18\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ALQq\">A. <em>Rubber stamp argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-19\">1. <em>Dean</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-20\">A \u201cdecisionmaker\u201d is someone \u201cwho has the power to make official decisions and, thus, be held <em>individually </em>liable.\u201d <em>Quinn v. Monroe County, </em>330 F.3d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir.2003) (emphasis in original). A \u201cdecisionmaker\u201d may often be identified by a rule or by examining the statutory authority of the official alleged to have made the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1328. In the termination context, a \u201cdecisionmaker\u201d has the power to terminate an employee, not merely the power to recommend termination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-21\">Kamensky concedes Dean\u2019s reorganization proposal had to be reviewed by the County\u2019s Human Resources Director, the Assistant County Administrator, the County Civil Service Board (County Board), and Dan Kleman, the County Administrator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>She further concedes county policy and procedure deemed Kleman the decision-maker regarding the elimination of Kamensky\u2019s position. Thus, the evidence indisputably shows Dean had no power to terminate Kamensky, but rather only had the power to recommend her termination. Dean was not the \u201cofficial decisionmaker,\u201d and thus cannot be held individually hable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Nonetheless, Kamensky asks us to create a \u201crubber stamp\u201d exception to <em>Quinn\u2019s </em>\u201cdecisionmaker\u201d inquiry. In doing so, she cites cases dealing with governmental, not individual, liability. <em>See Holloman ex. rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1290-94 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Matthews v. Columbia County, </em>294 F.3d 1294, 1296-98 (11th Cir.2002). We have not extended this line of cases to individual liability, and refrain from doing so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">2. <em>Hillsborough County</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">In <em>Quinn, </em>we noted the distinction between a \u201cdecisionmaker,\u201d as discussed above, and a \u201cpolicymaker,\u201d \u201cwho takes actions that may cause the [governmental entity] to be held liable for a custom or policy.\u201d <em>Quinn, </em>330 F.3d at 1326. Such an inquiry exists because governmental entities cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on a theory of <em>respondeat superior, </em>but rather may be held liable only for the execution of a governmental policy or custom. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. This liability \u201cmay arise with regards to an employment decision, such as a termination, provided that the decisionmaker \u2018possesses <em>final authority </em>to establish ... <em>policy </em>with respect to the action ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation omitted). \u201cOnly those ... officers who have final policymaking authority may by their actions subject the government to \u00a7 1983 liability.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>294 F.3d at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">A governmental employee is considered a \u201cfinal policymaker\u201d for governmental liability purposes \u201conly if his decisions have legal effect without further action by the governing body, and if the governing body lacks the power to reverse the ... employee\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1292 (internal citation omitted). \u201cTo determine if someone is a final policy maker, we look not only to \u2018state and local positive law,\u2019 but also to \u2018custom and usage having the force of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The evidence demonstrated Dean, by definition, was not the \u201cfinal policymaker\u201d over Kamensky\u2019s termination. Dean\u2019s reorganization plan had no legal effect without further action by Kleman, and Kleman had the power to reject Dean\u2019s plan. <em>See id. </em>Kamensky, however, asserts Kleman merely \u201crubber stamped\u201d Dean\u2019s recommendation, and that, absent meaningful review, the County may be held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">In <em>Quinn, </em>we cited a Fifth Circuit case for the proposition a final policymaker may serve as the conduit of a subordinate\u2019s improper motive if he merely \u201crubber stamps\u201d the subordinate\u2019s recommendation. <em>Quinn, </em>330 F.3d at 1327 (citation omitted). In <em>Quinn, </em>however, we noted the plaintiff neither pointed to a cognizable defect in the proceedings, nor provided evidence the reviewing board approved any improper motive. <em>Id. </em>at 1326. More recently, we looked \u201cto whether there is an actual <em>\u2018opportunity\u2019 </em>for \u2018meaningful\u2019 review\u201d in determining whether a governmental decisionmaker is a final policymaker. <em>Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1292 (emphasis added). In <em>Holloman, </em>we found no <em>opportunity </em>for a meaningful review by a school board in hght of the practical difficulties of administering a multi-step appellate process. <em>Id. </em>at 1293 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Here, as in <em>Quinn, </em>Kamensky does not point to any cognizable defect in the proceedings, nor does she provide evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Kleman, or anyone else, approved an improper motive. And, unlike in <em>Holloman, </em>in this case, there was an opportunity for meaningful review. Indeed, Kleman testified that, when he approved Dean\u2019s reorganization plan, he was aware of the reorganization plan and its proposed adverse affects on Kamensky\u2019s position. Thus, Kamensky failed to introduce sufficient evidence to show Dean was the \u201cfinal policymaker\u201d regarding her termination. <em>See Quinn, </em>330 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">B. <em>Insufficient evidence for jury question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">For a public employee to sustain a retaliation claim for protected speech under the First Amendment, the employee must show, by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) her speech is on a matter of public concern; (2) her free speech interest outweighed her employer\u2019s interest in promoting efficient public services; and (3) her speech played a \u201csubstantial part\u201d in the employer\u2019s decision to discharge her. <em>Anderson v. Burke County, Ga., </em>239 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2001). The County concedes the first two factors, but disputes the third factor. As to that factor, this Court has stated \u201c\u2018it is neither possible nor desirable to fashion a single standard for determining when an employee has met her initial burden of demonstrating that a retaliatory intent was a \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018motivating factor\u2019 behind a government employment decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley v. City of Dalton, Ga., </em>219 F.3d 1280, 1291 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Rather, a court must examine the record as a whole to ascertain whether the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude her protected speech was a substantial motivating factor in the decision to terminate her. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe plaintiffs burden in this regard is not a heavy one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In <em>Stanley, </em>this Court identified several relevant factors to consider, including: (1) the temporal proximity between the termination and the protected activity; (2) whether any reasons for the termination were pretextual; (3) whether any comments made, or actions taken, by the employer indicate the discharge was related to the protected speech; (4) whether the asserted reason for the discharge varied; and (5) any circumstantial evidence of causation, including such facts as who initiated any internal investigations or termination proceedings, whether there is evidence of management hostility to the speech in question, or whether the employer had a motive to retaliate. <em>Id. </em>at 1291 n. 20. \u201cThere is no one factor that is outcome determinative, but all factors must be taken into account.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">As to temporal proximity, we have inferred causation \u201c[wjhere termination closely follows protected activity.\u201d <em>Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., </em>93 F.3d 739, 745 (11th Cir.1996). However, we have rejected any per se rule as to the length of time necessary to create such an inference. <em>See Beckwith v. City of Daytona Beach Shores, Fla., </em>58 F.3d 1554, 1566-67 (11th Cir.1995). In <em>Stanley, </em>219 F.3d at 1291-92, we refused to grant such an inference where there was almost a four-year gap between the protected speech and the employee\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">There was a one-year gap between Kamensky\u2019s protected speech and Dean\u2019s initial staff analysis, an eighteen-month gap between her protected speech and his initial reorganization proposal, and over a two-year gap between her protected speech and her ultimate termination. As in <em>Stanley, </em>Kamensky cannot show an inference of causation from temporal proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">As to pretext, Dean offered one primary reason for Kamensky\u2019s termination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>reorganization of the ITS department, but also referred to a second reason, her poor performance. Kamensky offered no evidence to demonstrate these reasons were pretextual. Rather, uncontroverted evidence indicated Dean presented his reorganization plan based on a staff analysis he performed after receiving an operational analysis from an outside firm. Moreover, Dean testified as to Kamensky\u2019s unsatisfactory performance, and Kamensky admitted she had performance problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">As to the other <em>Stanley </em>factors, Kamensky offered no evidence any comments were made, by anyone, indicating her termination was related to her protected speech, and Dean expressly denied he made any such comments. As to specific actions, Kamensky testified Dean reduced her responsibilities and gave her a substandard evaluation after she expressed concerns about the Boston trip. However, Kamensky also admitted that, prior to and during this time, her work performance suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Moreover, Kamensky did not offer any evidence Dean confronted her about her protected speech, failed to notify her of his reorganization plan, failed to follow departmental policy, reprimanded her, or singled her out in his plan. Rather, Dean testified he followed departmental policy, notified her of his plan, advised her to apply for a new position, would have hired her had she applied, and recommended reclassification of another employee\u2019s, Deborah Scarborough\u2019s, position in his plan. Kamensky also failed to introduce any evidence Dean\u2019s asserted reasons for her termination ever varied.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Lastly, Kamensky failed to introduce sufficient circumstantial evidence of causation. Although it is undisputed Dean initiated the reorganization plan ultimately leading to Kamensky\u2019s termination, Kamensky offered no evidence these actions had anything to do with her speech. More importantly, Kamensky offered no evidence of management hostility towards her speech, nor did she provide any evidence Dean had a motive to retaliate against her. For instance, she offered no evidence Dean came under scrutiny or otherwise suffered because of her protected speech. We conclude Kamensky has failed to show her speech was a motivating factor in her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">We find no merit to Kamensky\u2019s \u201crubber stamp\u201d argument. Additionally, the district court did not err in determining there was insufficient evidence to create a jury question as to whether Kamensky\u2019s speech played a substantial part in her termination. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Hillsborough County and Dean.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-13\">. We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion for summary judgment, viewing all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving parly. <em>Turnes v.
