Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in her view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Counsel and Cason have filed supplemental briefs raising additional issues. We affirm Cason\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">Counsel raises as a potential issue that Cason\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. To succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal, a defendant must show conclusively from the face of the record that counsel provided ineffective representation. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Because the record does not conclusively establish counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, we conclude that Cason\u2019s claims must be brought, if at all, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Cason maintains that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a sentence enhanced by a designation of career offender status on facts not alleged in the indictment, not admitted by him, and not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, Cason claims that the district court\u2019s finding that his prior convictions qualified as crimes of violence for determining his career offender status, under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.2 (2003), constituted impermissible judicial fact-finding under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, we conclude from the record that Cason has \u201cno legitimate defense to the career offender designation.\u201d <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 247 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">Cason also claims that even if the district court did not err in designating him a career offender, it erred in failing to treat the guidelines as advisory. Because this objection was not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Although the district court committed error that was plain in treating the guidelines as mandatory, <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48 (4th Cir. 2005), Cason cannot demonstrate that the error in imposing his sentence under a mandatory guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights. Therefore, the sentence is not plainly erroneous in light of <em>Booker. </em>Neither is there any indication that Cason\u2019s sentence was unreasonable; thus, we conclude from the record that Cason\u2019s sentencing challenge lacks merit. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 224 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case and found no error. Accordingly, we affirm Cason\u2019s convictions and sentence and deny his motion to relieve and substitute counsel. This court requires that counsel inform Cason, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Cason requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the Cason. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
