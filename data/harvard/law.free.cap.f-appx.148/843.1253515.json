Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). A finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.... \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">First, Chen argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence since Chen\u2019s asylum application and oral testimony were consistent with each other. Like other factual findings, credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Chen has not shown the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination must be overturned. This is so because substantial evidence supports the determination, including: (1) the unexplained discrepancy between the September <em>2000 </em>date on the document allegedly issued by Chen\u2019s village in China certifying that Chen\u2019s mother was sterilized and Chen\u2019s testimony that she requested the document in September <em>2001 </em>(which the IJ cited to support her finding that Chen was not credible in asserting that her mother was forcibly, and not voluntarily, sterilized); (2) Chen\u2019s contradictory testimony at her credible-fear interview and at her asylum hearing regarding her use of a \u201csnakehead\u201d to leave China (which the IJ noted in finding that Chen was not credible in asserting that she had no knowledge of the arrangements made by her family to secure her arrival here); and (3) the U.S. State Department\u2019s China Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2001 states that Buddhism is an officially recognized religion in China, and that most government officials who practice a religion are Buddhist (which provided support to the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen was not credible in claiming that her father was persecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>for being Buddhist). Simply put, Chen has pointed to no evidence in the record that compels us to reverse the adverse credibility decision, which is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We are likewise unpersuaded by Chen\u2019s argument that the IJ\u2019s denial of her asylum application was not supported by substantial evidence because she stated a meritorious claim for asylum due to being harassed by her ex-boyfriend based on her gender. An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution may be established based on (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d and by overcoming any rebuttal by the INS; (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country; or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2). Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201crefugee,\u201d <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). To establish the necessary causal connection, the alien must present \u201cspecific, deta\u00f1ed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she w\u00fcl be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutorily listed factor. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, we have approved a \u201ccountrywide requirement\u201d in which a refugee must first pursue an \u201cinternal resettlement alternative\u201d in her own country, or establish that this is not possible, before seeking asylum here. <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1326-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">In addition to the adverse credibility finding that we have affirmed above, the record shows that Chen has never been beaten, arrested, imprisoned, tortured, or forcibly sterilized in China. As the IJ put it, \u201c[i]t is clear from the record before this Court that this respondent has never been harmed physically whatsoever in her country.\u201d Although her ex-boyfriend\u2019s father once broke a window and door in her house, the incident is more akin to an isolated instance of intimidation and harassment, rather than persecution. Moreover, even if the alleged group of \u201cpoor young women who rebel against status quo of arrenged [sic] marriage in rural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>[C]hina\u201d is a cognizable social group, Chen presented <em>no </em>evidence showing that her ex-boyfriend or his father were aware of her membership in that group or that she was harmed based on her membership in this group. In short, substantial evidence, including the adverse credibility finding, supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Chen failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution in China. Accordingly, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-19\">. When the BIA issues a summary affirmance, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final order subject to review. <em>See Mendoza v. Att'y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>cause Chen's removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\"IIRIRA''), this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the INA, as amended by IIRIRA. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-12\">. Because we find that Chen has not established a case for asylum under the INA, we do not address her arguments that she also satisfied the higher standards for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
