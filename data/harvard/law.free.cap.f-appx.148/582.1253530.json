We deferred submission of his appeal pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and our en banc decision in <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Ca\u00f1edo argues that the district court should have applied a clear and convincing evidence burden of proof to the facts enhancing his sentence for intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. Because of that enhancement, Canedo\u2019s eighteen-month sentence was six months longer than the maximum otherwise applicable, and he was sentenced to three years supervised release although no supervised release could have been imposed under the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Ca\u00f1edo did not raise the issue whether this violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial. We therefore remand for further proceedings in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Ameline. See Ameline, </em>409 F.3d at 1078-79, 1086 (remanding to district court to answer whether sentence would have been different if district court had known that Sentencing Guidelines were advisory). REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
