The district court sentenced Cruz-Carrillo to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment. The court also gave an alternative sentence according to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) of seventy-one months, treating the guidelines as advisory, under <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Cruz-Carrillo\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), conceding Cruz-Carrillo admitted to all the facts used to enhance his sentence, but raising the issue of whether the court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by applying the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. Cruz-Carrillo was notified of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2000) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-57. After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. This remedial scheme applies to any sentence imposed under the mandatory sentencing guidelines, regardless of whether or not the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). However, the Court was careful to note that its decision did not render every sentence unconstitutional. Courts were advised that ordinary doctrines such as plain error and harmless error would still apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Here, because the district court imposed an alternative discretionary sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a) that was identical to the guidelines sentence, the error inherent in the application of the guidelines as mandatory did not affect the court\u2019s ultimate determination of the sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Hazelwood, </em>398 F.3d 792, 801 (6th Cir.2005) (finding error not harmless and remanding when court\u2019s comments indicated it might have imposed a lesser sentence under advisory guidelines scheme). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that any possible <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record, we affirm Cruz-Carrillo\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
