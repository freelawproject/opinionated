Reversible error exists under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); we vacate Andino\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">We initially address Andino\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement for being deported after a felony conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), based on his prior Florida state conviction for robbery. Andino contends that a conflict exists between the definitions of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) and under the immigration statutes: he claims that the statutory definition controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of criminal statutes and sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Krawczak, </em>331 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">We conclude that the district court properly applied the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). This guideline requires a 16-level enhancement if the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Under Florida law, robbery is a second degree felony punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 812.13(2)(c), 775.082(3)(e). Thus, under the guidelines and the accompanying commentary, Andino\u2019s conviction for robbery qualifies as a felony \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that triggers the 16-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comments. (n.1B)(iii) and 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-19\">And we reject Andino\u2019s claim about the conflict between the guidelines and the immigration statutes. The immigration statutes provide a base maximum two-year prison sentence for illegal reentry of a deported alien. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). But \u00a7 1326(b)(1) allows a maximum ten-year sentence if the deportation was subsequent to a conviction for three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or a felony (other than an aggravated felony). And \u00a7 1326(b)(2) allows a maximum twenty-year sentence if the deportation was subsequent to a conviction for an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d An \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for which the term of imprisonment actually imposed is at least one year. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F); <em>United States v. Guzman-Bera, </em>216 F.3d 1019, 1020 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">No one disputes that a robbery is a crime of violence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. But Andino was sentenced only to 364 days\u2019 imprisonment for the Florida robbery. Because his actual sentence was less than one year, he contends that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>robbery conviction does not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) that would expose him to the maximum 20-year sentence. To the extent that the district court adopted the statement in the presentence investigation report (PSI) that Andino was subject to a 20-year maximum sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), an error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">But it is an error that does not mean much. Andino argues that the guideline definition for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d, which includes any robbery, regardless of the sentence actually imposed, conflicts with the statutory definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d. Andino\u2019s robbery conviction \u2014 while not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the immigration statutes \u2014 does qualify as a felony that exposes Andino to a ten-year maximum sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This ten-year maximum sentence is more than Andino\u2019s guideline sentencing range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment after applying the 16-level enhancement. Under these facts, we discern no conflict between the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Andino also argues that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence based on the fact of his prior conviction, which was not charged in the indictment, not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and not admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Andino properly raised his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim in the district court. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). We review this issue <em>de novo; </em>we will reverse unless the government shows that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Andino\u2019s 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) was based solely on the fact that he had a previous conviction. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme court stated that the government need not allege in the indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had a prior conviction for a district court to use that conviction to enhance a sentence. \u201cThis conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the district court did not violate Andino\u2019s constitutional rights by applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement based on his prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">But the district court did commit a statutory error under <em>Booker. See United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005) (under <em>Booker, </em>two types of sentencing errors exist: \u201cone is constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>and the other is statutory\u201d). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. <em>Booker </em>statutory errors are subject to a less demanding harmless error test that is applicable to non-constitutional errors. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). That standard requires us to determine whether the error either did not affect the sentence or only had a slight effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Here, the government has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s statutory error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not have an affect on the sentence Andino received. In rejecting Andino\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim, the district court stated \u201cwe don\u2019t need to deal with [the <em>Blakely </em>objection] anymore since it\u2019s simply overruled by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court made no statement that it would have imposed an identical sentence if it had been proceeding under an advisory guidelines system. The court merely sentenced Andino at the low end of the guideline range without commenting on whether the guidelines sentence was appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In sum, although the district court properly applied the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), Andino must be resentenced under the advisory guidelines system in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\">. We also note that the PSI indicates that Andino has at least three prior misdemeanor drug convictions. These convictions also expose Andino to \u00a7 1326(b)(1)\u2019s maximum ten-year sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">. We need not hypothesize about whether a situation could arise with the conflict Andino asserts. We are aware that the definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) differ: the latter requires that the sentence actually imposed be at least one year, and the former requires only that the conviction be punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of one year. But the definition of a \"crime of violence\u201d that is an \"aggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) applies to the determination of a maximum possible sentence for a violation of \u00a7 1326(a): this definition does not apply to \u00a7 2L1.2, which unambiguously defines a \"crime of violence\u201d in its commentary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. Just before Andino was sentenced and before the Supreme Court decided <em>Booker, </em>we declined to apply the principles set out in <em>Blakely </em>to the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1089, 160 L.Ed.2d 1058 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
