After reviewing all the submissions of the parties, including a transcript of the proceedings before the administrative law judge and the exhibits in that proceeding, the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>trate judge entered an order affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">David Marek, the claimant, appeals the final judgment entered as a result of the magistrate judge\u2019s order. Marek raises the same claims on appeal that he raised before the magistrate judge. He contends that the ALJ improperly rejected the opinion of his treating physician and did not properly consider the combined effect of all of his impairments and his subjective symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The district court adequately and correctly addressed all of Marek\u2019s arguments. After careful review of the briefs, the record, and the magistrate judge\u2019s order, we affirm the denial of disability benefits for the reasons articulated in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
