She was sentenced to 63 months imprisonment and two years of supervised release. Wilson appeals the district court\u2019s admission of alleged hearsay testimony on the grounds that it did not meet the requirements of the co-conspirator exception and that it violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause. Wilson also challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to admit hearsay evidence under the doctrine of \u201ccurative admissibility,\u201d and to offer a proposed jury instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">Wilson challenges the district court\u2019s decision to admit testimony given by Brent La Mott regarding statements made by Donald Ware to Shane Meier as a nonhearsay coconspirator statement. We review the district court\u2019s decision to admit coconspirator statements for abuse of discretion and the underlying factual determination that a conspiracy existed and the statements were made in furtherance thereof for clear error. <em>United States v. Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 981 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 965, 124 S.Ct. 1729, 158 L.Ed.2d 411 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Wilson first argues that La Mott\u2019s testimony did not relay an admissible coeonspirator statement because the government did not prove that La Mott was part of the conspiracy. An otherwise hearsay statement is admissible if it was made by a coconspirator of the defendant during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); <em>United States v. Kearns, </em>61 F.3d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir.1995). While the <em>declarant </em>must be a member of the conspiracy, the witness testifying at trial need not be a member of the conspiracy in order for a coconspirator\u2019s statement to be admissible. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>989 F.2d 1061, 1067-69 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that statements by coconspirators to non-members of the conspiracy, introduced through the testimony of non-members, were admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)); <em>see also United States v. Garcia, </em>16 F.3d 341 (9th Cir.1994) (analyzing whether the <em>declarant, </em>not the undercover agent who testified as to the statement at issue, was a member of the conspiracy). Thus, despite the fact that La Mott was not a member of the conspiracy, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting La Mott\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Wilson next argues that the statement was not made \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the conspiracy. To be \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a conspiracy, \u201cthe statements must further the common objectives of the conspiracy or set in motion transactions that are an integral part of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Kearns, </em>61 F.3d at 1426 (quotations omitted), \u201cmere conversation between coconspirators\u201d does not qualify as nonhearsay. <em>United States v. Bibbero, </em>749 F.2d 581, 583-84 (9th Cir. 1984) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Here, Ware\u2019s statement concerned the source of the pseudophendrine pills and it is plausible that the statement was made to convince Meier, a member of the conspiracy, that the source was loyal, consistent and reliable. <em>See Williams, </em>989 F.2d at 1069 (holding that statements made to keep a coconspirator \u201cinformed as to the group\u2019s drug supply\u201d were made in furtherance of the conspiracy); <em>Kearns, </em>61 F.3d at 1425-26 (holding that statements made to convince a potential co-conspirator of the economic foundation of the conspiracy were made in furtherance thereof). Meier received methamphetamine from Ware, manufactured methamphetamine, and acted as an intermediary, introducing members of the conspiracy. Ware\u2019s statement to Meier about the source of the pills could have been made to \u201cinduce enlistment\u201d and/or to \u201creassure\u201d Meier about the continued existence of the methamphetamine production scheme. <em>See United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1535 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 866, 109 S.Ct. 171, 102 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). On these facts, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting La Mott\u2019s testimony as to Ware\u2019s statement to Meier as a coconspirator statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Wilson argues that the admission of the hearsay statement provided by La Mott violated her Confrontation Clause rights as articulated in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). We review alleged violations of the Confrontation Clause de novo. <em>See Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 137, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999); <em>United States v. Nielsen, </em>371 F.3d 574, 581 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Although <em>Crawford </em>did not define \u201ctestimonial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, the Court explicitly noted \u201cstatements in fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>therance of a conspiracy\u201d as an example of \u201cstatements that by their nature were <em>not </em>testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (emphasis added). For statements that are <em>not </em>testimonial in nature, Confrontation Clause scrutiny need not apply, and the rule of <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), permits admission of an unavailable witness\u2019s statement against a criminal defendant so long as it \u201cbears adequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 42, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Parle v. Runnels, </em>387 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir.2004). This test is met where the declarant is unavailable and the evidence falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d or bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. The admissibility of co-conspirator statements as nonhearsay qualifies as a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception under the <em>Roberts </em>test. <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987); <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 815, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990); <em>United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, </em>987 F.2d 599, 607 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We conclude that because the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Ware\u2019s statement to Meier as a non-hearsay co-conspirator statement, it is not testimonial in nature. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The statement was more like a \u201ccasual remark to an acquaintance\u201d than the type of \u201cformal statement to government officers\u201d to which the Confrontation Clause applies. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Wade\u2019s statement was not made \u201cunder circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that [it] would be available for use at a later trial\u201d <em>see Parle, </em>387 F.3d at 1037, because it was made off-hand between coconspirators, in a noncustodial situation, and was overheard by La Mott. In sum, we therefore conclude that the admission of the challenged statement did not violate Wilson\u2019s Confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Wilson argues that under the doctrine of \u201ccurative admissibility,\u201d she should have been permitted to introduce two letters Ware sent her when he was in custody that were exculpatory as to Wilson. The district court excluded this evidence as hearsay. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence under the hearsay rule, <em>Shryock, </em>342 F.3d at 981, and whether to admit evidence under the doctrine of curative admissibility, <em>see Nguyen v. Southwest Leasing and Rental Inc., </em>282 F.3d 1061, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The doctrine of curative admissibility provides that \u201cthe introduction of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an opponent, in the court\u2019s discretion, to introduce evidence on the same issue to rebut any false impression that might have resulted from the earlier admission.\u201d <em>Nguyen, </em>282 F.3d at 1067 (citing <em>United States v. Whitworth, </em>856 F.2d 1268, 1285 (9th Cir.1988)). As discussed above, the testimony given by La Mott was not inadmissible. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the letters from Ware.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Wilson argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give her proposed \u201cmissing witness\u201d jury instruction. Such an instruction is unwarranted \u201cif the defense does not adequately show that the government possesses the sole power to produce the witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Anders, </em>602 F.2d 823, 825 (8th Cir.1979); <em>see United States v. Noah, </em>475 F.2d 688, 691 (9th Cir.1973). Here, Wilson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>could have called Ware as a witness and has not shown that Ware was \u201cpeculiarly\u201d within the government\u2019s power to produce. <em>Cf. Noah, 475 </em>F.2d at 691. Moreover, the court permitted Wilson\u2019s attorney, in his closing arguments, to point out to the jury that the government didn\u2019t call Ware as a witness. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give Wilson\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-14\">.
