Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We conclude that his sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Munoz-Hernandez was convicted by a jury for possessing with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). The PSR indicated that Munoz-Hernandez was responsible for 33.25 kilograms of cocaine, fixing his base offense level at thirty-four and producing a Guidelines imprisonment range of 151-188 months. Consistent with the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that Munoz-Hernandez be sentenced at the \u201clow end\u201d of the range, the district court imposed a sentence of 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following its decision in <em>Booker, </em>the Court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of Booker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">Munoz-Hernandez concedes that he failed to preserve error with respect to his <em>Booker </em>issue. Thus, our review is for plain error only.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWe find plain error when: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If all three of these conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">Munoz-Hernandez satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error test because the district court committed Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error and because that error is now plain after Booker.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to prejudice, Munoz-Hernandez argues that three facts indicate that the district court would likely have assessed a different sentence under an advisory regime: (1) his sentence was placed at the very bottom of the Guidelines range; (2) he was a first-time offender; and (3) his conviction resulted in deportation proceedings being initiated against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>These facts are insufficient to establish, \u201cwith a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, that if the judge had sentenced him under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one,\u201d Munoz-Hernandez would have received a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Having reconsidered in light of <em>Booker, </em>we REINSTATE our decision affirming Munoz-Hernandez\u2019s conviction, and AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
