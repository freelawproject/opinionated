Camacho plead guilty to the charge, admitting that, during the conspiracy, he assisted in distributing between 400 and 700 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">On appeal, Camacho asserts that, as explained in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in order to comport with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, a factual determination that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the applicable guideline range must be reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. Camacho argues that, in his case, the district court erred by imposing his sentence under a mandatory guideline system and under the belief that it did not have the authority to depart downward from the applicable guideline range. Camacho also argues that, because the court was required to make factual findings in order to determine the mandatory guideline range, there was constitutional error in his sentence as well. He contends that, had the court believed that the guidelines were advisory, he would have been sentenced below the guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Where a defendant fails to raise a Sixth Amendment objection in the district court, the standard of review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Under plain-error review, the defendant has the burden to show that \u201cthere is (1) error (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The Court later revisited that rule in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, clarifying that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the </em>defendant.... In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original). Subsequently, the Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. The Court concluded that the appropriate remedy was to excise two specific sections of the sentencing reform act: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal). Thus, the remedy left the Sentencing Guidelines intact, while rendering them advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We have explained that there are two types of error under <em>Booker: </em>(1) Sixth Amendment error based upon sentencing enhancements neither admitted by the defendant nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) error based upon sentencing under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-1334 (11th Cir.2005). There is no Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker </em>where the defendant has admitted to facts later used by the district court to enhance a sentence. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">With regard to statutory error, where the district court imposed a sentence under a mandatory guidelines system, the first two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. The third prong of the plain error test requires the defendant to demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300. In <em>Rodriguez </em>we explained that: \u201cWhere errors could have cut either way and uncertainty exists, the burden is the decisive factor in the third prong of the plain error test, and the burden is on the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where we \u201cjust don\u2019t know\u201d whether the defendant would have received a lesser sentence under an advisory guideline system, the defendant has failed his burden of showing prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. The fact that \u201cthe district court sentenced a defendant to the bottom of the applicable guidelines range[,]\u201d standing alone, \u201cdoes not establish a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1361 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. There is simply nothing in the record to suggest that the sentencing judge would have imposed a lower sentence knowing that the guidelines were no longer mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Because Camacho admitted to the facts supporting the sentence imposed, there is no plain constitutional error in his sentence. In addition, because there is not a reasonable probability that Camacho would have been sentenced differently under an advisory guideline scheme, the statutory error in the district court\u2019s sentence did not affect Camacho\u2019s substantial rights, and we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
