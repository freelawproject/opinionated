On appeal, Hubbard argues that: (1) \u00a7 922(g) attempts to regulate non-eeonomic intrastate criminal activity, and is, therefore, unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause; and (2) he was sentenced in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court enhanced his sentence based upon facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by him, pursuant to a mandatory sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">We review constitutional challenges to statutes <em>de novo. See United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir.2001). Hubbard preserved his <em>Booker </em>error by objecting, based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that appellant properly preserved <em>Booker </em>claim by citing <em>Blakely </em>in his written objections to the PSI and reminding the court at sentencing of his <em>Blakely </em>objection). Accordingly, he is entitled to preserved error review, meaning that we review his claim <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018To find harmless error, we must determine that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 670 (11th Cir.1998)). \u201cThe burden is on the government to show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 741, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1781, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Upon thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Hubbard\u2019s conviction, but find <em>Booker </em>constitutional error that the government cannot establish was harmless. We therefore vacate and remand his sentence for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">The relevant facts are these. On May 27, 2004, Hubbard was indicted for one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Without the benefit of a plea agreement, Hubbard entered a plea of guilty to the crime charged. Hubbard also filed a \u201cfactual resume,\u201d in which he admitted the facts necessary to support his guilty plea, including the following: (1) on May 16, 1995, he was convicted, in Alabama state court, of attempted second-degree burglary, which is a felony crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, and (2) on July 17, 2003, he knowingly possessed a Ruger, 9mm caliber, semiautomatic handgun. He also stipulated \u201cthat [the Ruger] was manufactured outside the State of Alabama and therefore affected commerce by its importation into the State of Alabama.\u201d Hubbard then proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Hubbard\u2019s base offense level was 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. 2K2.1(a)(2)(A). The PSI recommended the following adjustments: (1) a 2-level upward adjustment for engaging in reck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>less endangerment during flight from law enforcement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2; (2) a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a); and (3) a 1-level reduction for Hubbard\u2019s timely entry of a guilty plea, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b). With an adjusted offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of VI (based on 14 criminal history points), his Sentencing Guidelines range was 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Hubbard objected to the 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2, arguing that the adjustment was not warranted based on the police report, which indicated that Hubbard stopped his vehicle after only a \u201cbrief vehicle pursuit.\u201d Hubbard also argued that enhancement was improper based on <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">At the sentencing hearing, in support of the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement, the government presented the testimony of Officer Raymond Cook, of the Mobile Police Department, who was responsible for stopping Hubbard\u2019s vehicle prior to his arrest. Officer Cook described that after he turned on the blue lights of his marked car, Hubbard increased the speed of his vehicle. Officer Cook pursued Hubbard through a residential area for about a minute and a half, during which Hubbard drove approximately 15 miles per hour faster than the posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour, ran stop signs without slowing down, and drove in opposing traffic lanes, despite the presence of other traffic on the road. After Hubbard pulled his vehicle over, Hubbard got out and ran away. Officer Cook chased him and eventually arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">After Officer Cook\u2019s testimony, Hubbard noted that, during the chase, he did not travel at \u201can excessive rate of speed,\u201d and highlighted Officer Cook\u2019s testimony that no near collisions occurred. Hubbard argued that the facts did not establish that he \u201crecklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d The district court disagreed, noting that the \u201cevidence [was] more than adequate to supply the elements of reckless endangerment during flight,\u201d and ruled the two-level enhancement, under \u00a7 3C1.2, was warranted. Hubbard also reiterated his <em>Blakely </em>argument, but the district court overruled the objection, finding that <em>Blakely </em>was not applicable, pursuant to this Court\u2019s controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s sentencing calculations and sentenced Hubbard to 92 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">As for Hubbard\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he recognizes that we squarely rejected his argument in <em>Dupree, </em>in which we held that a defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm that traveled in interstate commerce (facts that Hubbard admitted in this case) is sufficient to satisfy the commerce element of the statute and comply with the Commerce Clause. <em>See </em>258 F.3d 1260; <em>see also United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (rejecting argument that Congress exceeded its authority, under the Commerce Clause, by enacting \u00a7 922(g)(1); noting that the felon-in-possession statute has an express jurisdictional element, which would ensure that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce); <em>cf. United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218 (11th Cir.) <em>(en </em>banc) (rejecting facial and as-applied chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>lenges, based on the Commerce Clause, to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 247, pursuant to the \"approach this Circuit has repeatedly taken to the nearly identical language found in \u00a7 922(g)\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 368, -L.Ed.2d - (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Where a panel of this Court has addressed an issue of law, \u201ceach succeeding panel is bound by the holding of the first panel to address the issue of law, unless and until that holding is overruled en banc, or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (1993). Under our uniform line of controlling precedent, \u00a7 922(g) is a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. Hubbard\u2019s admission, in the factual resume he filed, that he possessed a gun that had traveled in interstate commerce was sufficient to demonstrate the required nexus to interstate commerce. Accordingly, we affirm Hubbard\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">As for Hubbard\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim, the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where, under a mandatory Guidelines system, a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that' were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. at 749-56, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The <em>Booker </em>constitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a Guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2005). The <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional, or statutory, error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant under a mandatory sentencing scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation. <em>Id. </em>This case concerns both types of error. The district court committed <em>Booker </em>constitutional error by sentencing Hubbard on the basis of facts (reckless endangerment during flight) not alleged in the indictment or admitted by him as part of his plea and statutory error by applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">A constitutional error is harmless if the government can show that \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (quotation and alteration omitted). Based on our careful review of the record, with particular attention to the sentencing transcript, we can find no indication of whether or not the district court would have sentenced Hubbard similarly under an advisory scheme. Moreover, Hubbard was sentenced to the low end of the Guidelines range. On this record, the government cannot show that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we vacate Hubbard\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">.
